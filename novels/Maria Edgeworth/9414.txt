tales and novels vol v manoeuvring almeria and vivian tales of fashionable life by maria edgeworth in ten volumes with engravings on steel manoeuvring chapter i and gave her words where oily flattry lays the pleasing colours of the art of praise parnell note from mrs beaumont to miss walsingham i am more grieved than i can express my dearest miss walsingham by a cruel contre temps which must prevent my indulging myself in the long promised and long expected pleasure of being at your fte de famille on tuesday to celebrate your dear fathers birthday i trust however to your conciliating goodness my kind young friend to represent my distress properly to mr walsingham make him sensible i conjure you that my heart is with you all and assure him that this is no common apology indeed i never employ such artifices with my friends to them and to you in particular my dear i always speak with perfect frankness and candour amelia with whom entre nous you are more a favourite than ever is so much vexed and mortified by this disappointment that i see i shall not be restored to favour till i can fix a day for going to you yet when that may be circumstances which i should not feel myself quite justified in mentioning will not permit me to decide kindest regards and affectionate remembrances to all your dear circle any news of the young captain any hopes of his return from sea ever with perfect truth my dearest miss walsinghams sincere friend eugenia beaumont ps private read to yourself to be candid with you my dear young friend my secret reason for denying myself the pleasure of tuesdays fte is that i have just heard that there is a shocking chicken pox in the village near you and i confess it is one of my weaknesses to dread even the bare rumour of such a thing on account of my amelia but i should not wish to have this mentioned in your house because you must be sensible your father would think it an idle womanish fear and you know how anxious i am for his esteem burn this i beseech you upon second thoughts i believe it will be best to tell the truth and the whole truth to your father if you should see that nothing else will do in short i write in haste and must trust now as ever entirely to your discretion well my dear said mr walsingham to his daughter as the young lady sat at the breakfast table looking over this note how long do you mean to sit the picture of the delicate embarrassment to relieve you as far as in me lies let me assure you that i shall not ask to see this note of mrs beaumonts which as usual seems to contain some mighty mystery no great mystery only only some minikin mystery said mr walsingham yes elle est politique pour des choux et des raves this charming widow beaumont is manoeuvrer we cant well make an english word of it the species thank heaven is not so numerous yet in england as to require a generic name the description however has been touched by one of our poets julias a manager shes born for rule and knows her wiser husband is a fool for her own breakfast shell project a scheme nor take her tea without a stratagem even from the time when mrs beaumont was a girl of sixteen i remember her manoeuvring to gain a husband and then manoeuvring to manage him which she did with triumphant address what sort of a man was colonel beaumont an excellent man an open hearted soldier of the strictest honour and integrity then is it not much in mrs beaumonts favour that she enjoyed the confidence of such a man and that he left her guardian to his son and daughter if he had lived with her long enough to become acquainted with her real character what you say my dear would be unanswerable but colonel beaumont died a few years after his marriage and during those few years he was chiefly with his regiment you will however allow said miss walsingham that since his death mrs beaumont has justified his confidence has she not been a good guardian and an affectionate mother why as a guardian i think she has allowed her son too much liberty and too much money i have heard that young beaumont has lost a considerable sum at newmarket i grant you that mrs beaumont is an affectionate mother and i am convinced that she is extremely anxious to advance the worldly interests of her children still i cannot my dear agree with you that she is a good mother in the whole course of the education of her son and daughter she has pursued a system of artifice whatever she wanted them to learn or to do or to leave undone some stratagem sentimental or scenic was employed somebody was to hint to some other body to act upon amelia to make her do so and so nothing that is nothing like truth ever came directly from the mother there were always whisperings and mysteries and dont say that before amelia and i would not have this told to edward because it might make him like something that she did not wish that he should like and that she had her reasons for not letting him know that she did not wish him to like there was always some truth to be concealed for some mighty good purpose and things and persons were to be represented in false lights to produce on some particular occasion some partial effect all this succeeded admirably in detail and for the management of helpless ignorant credulous childhood but mark the consequences of this system children grow up and cannot always see hear and understand just as their mothers please they will go into the world they will mix with others their eyes will be opened they will see through the whole system of artifice by which their childhood was so cleverly managed and then confidence in the parent must be destroyed for ever miss walsingham acknowledged the truth of what her father said but she observed that this was a common error in education which had the sanction of high authority in its favour even the eloquent rousseau and the elegant and ingenious madame de genlis and it is certain continued miss walsingham that mrs beaumont has not made her children artful both amelia and mr beaumont are remarkably open sincere honourable characters mr beaumont indeed carries his sincerity almost to a fault he is too blunt perhaps in his manner and amelia though she is of such a timid gentle temper and so much afraid of giving pain has always courage enough to speak the truth even in circumstances where it is most difficult so at least you must allow my dear father that mrs beaumont has made her children sincere i am sorry my dear to seem uncharitable but i must observe that sometimes the very faults of parents produce a tendency to opposite virtues in their children for the children suffer by the consequences of these faults and detecting despise and resolve to avoid them as to amelia and mr beaumont their acquaintance with our family has been no unfavourable circumstance in their education they saw amongst us the advantages of sincerity they became attached to you and to my excellent ward captain walsingham he obtained strong power over young beaumonts mind and used it to the best purposes your friendship for amelia was i think equally advantageous to her as you are nearly of the same age you had opportunities of winning her confidence and your stronger mind fortified hers and inspired her timid character with the courage necessary to be sincere well persisted miss walsingham though mrs beaumont may have used a little finesse towards her children in trifles yet in matters of consequence i do think that she has no interest but theirs and her affection for them will make her lay aside all art when their happiness is at stake mr walsingham shook his head and do you then really believe my dear marianne that mrs beaumont would consider any thing for instance in the marriage of her son and daughter but fortune and what the world calls connexion and establishments certainly i cannot think that these are mrs beaumonts first objects because we are people but of small fortune and yet she prefers us to many of large estates and higher station you should say she professes to prefer us replied mr walsingham and do you really believe her to be sincere now there is my ward captain walsingham for whom she pretends to have such a regard do you think that mrs beaumont wishes her daughter should marry him i do indeed but mrs beaumont must speak cautiously on that subject this is prudence not dissimulation for you know that my cousin walsingham never declared his attachment to miss beaumont on the contrary he always took the most scrupulous pains to conceal it from her because he had not fortune enough to marry and he was too honourable to attempt or even to wish to engage the affections of one to whom he had no prospect of being united he is a noble fellow exclaimed mr walsingham there is no sacrifice of pleasure or interest he would hesitate to make to his duty for his friends there is no exertion no endurance no forbearance of which he has not shown himself capable for his country all i ask from heaven for him is opportunity to serve his country whether circumstances whether success will ever prove his merits to the world i cannot foretell but i shall always glory in him as my ward my relation my friend mrs beaumont speaks of him just as you do said miss walsingham speaks but not thinks said mr walsingham no no captain walsingham is not the man she desires for a son in law she wants to marry amelia to sir john hunter to sir john hunter yes to sir john hunter a being without literature without morals without even youth to plead in his favour he is nearly forty years old old enough to be amelias father yet this is the man whom mrs beaumont prefers for the husband of her beloved daughter because he is heir presumptive to a great estate and has the chance of a reversionary earldom and this is your modern good mother oh no no cried miss walsingham you do mrs beaumont injustice i assure you she despises sir john hunter as much as we do yet observe the court she has paid to the whole family of the hunters yes but that has been merely from regard to the late lady hunter who was her particular friend particular friend a vamped up sentimental conversation reason but i assure you persisted miss walsingham that i know mrs beaumonts mind better than you do father at least on this subject you a girl of eighteen pretend to know a manoeuvrer of her age only let me tell you my reasons it was but last week that mrs beaumont told me that she did not wish to encourage sir john hunter and that she should be perfectly happy if she could see amelia united to such a man as captain walsingham such a man as captain walsingham nicely guarded expression but you have not heard all yet mrs beaumont anxiously inquired from me whether he had made any prize money whether there was any chance of his returning soon and she added with particular emphasis you dont know how much i wish it you dont know what a favourite he is of mine that last i will lay any wager cried mr walsingham she said in a whisper and in a corner yes but she could not do otherwise for amelia was present mrs beaumont took me aside aside ay ay but take care i advise you of her asides and her whisperings and her cornerings and her inuendoes and semiconfidences lest your own happiness my dear unsuspecting enthusiastic daughter should be the sacrifice miss walsingham now stood perfectly silent in embarrassed and breathless anxiety i see continued her father that mrs beaumont for whose mighty genius one intrigue at a time is not sufficient wants also to persuade you my dear that she wishes to have you for a daughter in law and yet all the time she is doing every thing she can to make her son marry that fool miss hunter merely because she has two hundred thousand pounds fortune there i can assure you that you are mistaken said miss walsingham mrs beaumont dreads that her son should marry miss hunter mrs beaumont thinks her as silly as you do and complained to me of her having no taste for literature or for any thing but dress and trifling conversation i wonder then that mrs beaumont selects her continually for her companion she thinks miss hunter the most insipid companion in the world but i dare not tell you lest you should laugh at me again that it was for the sake of the late lady hunter that mrs beaumont was so kind to the daughter and now miss hunter is so fond of her and so grateful that as mrs beaumont says it would be cruelty to shake her off mighty plausible but the truth of all this begging mrs beaumonts pardon i doubt i will not call it a falsehood but i may be permitted to call it a beaumont time will show and in the mean time my dear daughter be on your guard against mrs beaumonts art and against your own credulity the momentary pain i give my friends by speaking the plain truth i have always found overbalanced by the pleasure and advantage of mutual confidence our domestic happiness has arisen chiefly from our habits of openness and sincerity our whole souls are laid open there is no management no intrigue de cabinet no esprit de la ligue mr walsingham now left the room and miss walsingham absorbed in reflections more interesting to her than even the defence of mrs beaumont went out to walk her fathers house was situated in a beautiful part of devonshire near the sea shore in the neighbourhood of plymouth and as miss walsingham was walking on the beach she saw an old fisherman mooring his boat to the projecting stump of a tree his figure was so picturesque that she stopped to sketch it and as she was drawing a woman came from the cottage near the shore to ask the fisherman what luck he had had a fine turbot says he and a john doree then away with them this minute to beaumont park said the woman for heres madam beaumonts man martin called in a flustrum while you was away to say madam must have the nicest of our fish whatsomever it might be and a john doree if it could be had for love or money for tuesday here the woman perceiving miss walsingham dropped a curtsy your humble servant miss walsingham said the woman on tuesday said miss walsingham are you sure that mrs beaumont bespoke the fish for tuesday oh sartin sure miss for martin mentioned moreover what he had heard talk in the servants hall that there is to be a very pettiklar old gentleman as rich as rich as rich can be from foreign parts and a great friend of the colonel thats dead and he that is the old pettiklar gentleman is to be down all the way from lonon to dine at the park on tuesday for sartin so husband away with the john doree and the turbot while they be fresh but why thought miss walsingham did not mrs beaumont tell us the plain truth if this is the truth chapter ii young hermes next a close contriving god her brows encircled with his serpent rod then plots and fair excuses fill her brain and views of breaking amrous vows for gain the information which mrs beaumonts man martin had learned from the servants hall and had communicated to the fishermans wife was more correct and had been less amplified embellished misunderstood or misrepresented than is usually found to be the case with pieces of news which are so heard and so repeated it was true that mrs beaumont expected to see on tuesday an old gentleman a mr palmer who had been a friend of her husbands he had lately returned from jamaica where he had made a large fortune it is true also that this old gentleman was a little particular but not precisely in the sense in which the fishermans wife understood the phrase he was not particularly fond of john dorees and turbots but he was particularly fond of making his fellow creatures happy particularly generous particularly open and honest in his nature abhorring all artifice himself and unsuspicious of it in others he was unacquainted with mrs beaumonts character as he had been for many years in the west indies and he knew her only from her letters in which she appeared every thing that was candid and amiable his great friendship for her deceased husband also inclined him to like her colonel beaumont had appointed him one of the guardians of his children but mr palmer being absent from england had declined to act he was also trustee to mrs beaumonts marriage settlement and she had represented that it was necessary he should be present at the settlement of her family affairs upon her sons coming of age an event which was to take place in a few days the urgent representations of mrs beaumont and the anxious desire she expressed to see mr palmer had at last prevailed with the good old gentleman to journey down to beaumont park though he was a valetudinarian and though he was obliged he said to return to jamaica with the west india fleet which was expected to sail in ten days so that he announced positively that he could stay but a week at beaumont park with his good friends and relations he was related but distantly to the beaumonts and he stood in precisely the same degree of relationship to the walsinghams he had no other relations and his fortune was completely at his own disposal on this fortune our cunning widow had speculated long and deeply though in fact there was no occasion for art it was mr palmers intention to leave his large fortune to the beaumonts or to divide it between the beaumont and walsingham families and had she been sincere in her professed desire of a complete union by a double marriage between the representatives of the families her favourite object would have been in either case equally secure here was a plain easy road to her object but it was too direct for mrs beaumont with all her abilities she could never comprehend the axiom that a right line is the shortest possible line between any two points an axiom equally true in morals and in mathematics no the serpentine line was in her opinion not only the most beautiful but the most expeditious safe and convenient she had formed a triple scheme of such intricacy that it is necessary distinctly to state the argument of her plot lest the action should be too complicated to be easily developed she had in the first place a design of engrossing the whole of mr palmers fortune for her own family and for this purpose she determined to prevent mr palmer from becoming acquainted with his other relations the walsinghams to whom she had always had a secret dislike because they were of remarkably open sincere characters as mr palmer proposed to stay but a week in the country this scheme of preventing their meeting seemed feasible in the second place mrs beaumont wished to marry her daughter to sir john hunter because sir john was heir expectant to a large estate called the wigram estate and because there was in his family a certain reversionary title the earldom of puckeridge which would devolve to sir john after the death of a near relation in the third place mrs beaumont wished to marry her own son to miss hunter who was sir johns sister by a second marriage and above twenty years younger than he was this lady was preferred to miss walsingham for a daughter in law for the reasons which mr walsingham had given because she possessed an independent fortune of two hundred thousand pounds and because she was so childish and silly that mrs beaumont thought she could always manage her easily and by this means retain power over her son miss hunter was very pretty and mrs beaumont had observed that her son had sometimes been struck with her beauty sufficiently to give hopes that by proper management he might be diverted from his serious sober preference of miss walsingham mrs beaumont foresaw many difficulties in the execution of these plans she knew that amelia liked captain walsingham and that captain walsingham was attached to her though he had never declared his love and she dreaded that captain walsingham who was at this time at sea should return just whilst mr palmer was with her because she was well aware that the captain was a kind of man mr palmer would infinitely prefer to sir john hunter indeed she had been secretly informed that mr palmer hated every one who had a title therefore she could not whilst he was with her openly encourage sir john hunter in his addresses to amelia to conciliate these seemingly incompatible schemes she determined but let our heroine speak for herself my dearest miss hunter said she now we are by ourselves let me open my mind to you i have been watching for an opportunity these two days but so hurried as i have been wheres amelia out walking maam she told me you begged her to walk to get rid of her head ache and that she might look well to day as mr palmer is to come i would not go with her because you whispered to me at breakfast that you had something very particular to say to me but you did not give that as a reason i hope surely you didnt tell amelia that i had something particular to say to you oh no maam i told her that i had something to do about my dress and so i had my new hat to try on true my love quite right for you know i wouldnt have her suspect that we had any thing to say to each other that we didnt wish her to hear especially as it is about herself herself oh is it said miss hunter in a tone of disappointment and about you too my darling be assured i have no daughter i love better or ever shall with such a son as i have and such a daughter in law as i hope and trust i shall have ere long i shall think myself the most fortunate of mothers silly miss hunters face brightened up again but now my love continued mrs beaumont taking her hand leading her to a window and speaking very low though no one else was in the room before we talk any more of what is nearest my heart i must get you to write a note for me to your brother directly for there is a circumstance i forgot thoughtless creature that i am but indeed i never can think when i feel much some people are always so collected and prudent but i have none of that heigho well my dear you must supply my deficiencies you will write and tell sir john that in my agitation when he made his proposal for my amelia of which i so frankly approved i omitted to warn him that no hint must be given that i do any thing more than permit him to address my daughter upon an equal footing with any other gentleman who might address her stay my dear you dont understand me i see in short to be candid with you old mr palmer is coming to day you know now my dear you must be aware that it is of the greatest consequence to the interests of my family of which i hope you always consider yourself for i have always considered you as forming a part and a very distinguished part i say my darling that we must consider that it is our interest in all things to please and humour this good old gentleman he will be with us but for a week you know well the point is this i have been informed from undoubted authority people who were about him at the time and knew that the reason he quarrelled with that nephew of his who died two years ago was the young mans having accepted a baronetage and at that time old palmer swore that no sprig of quality those were the very words should ever inherit a shilling of his money such a ridiculous whim but these london merchants who make great fortunes from nothing are apt to have their little eccentricities and then they have so much pride in their own way and so much self will and mercantile downrightness in their manners that theres no managing them but by humouring their fancies im convinced if mr palmer suspected that i even wished amelia to marry sir john he would never leave any of us a farthing and it would all go to the walsinghams so my dear do you explain to your brother that though i have not the least objection to his coming here whilst mr palmer is with us he must not take umbrage at any seeming coldness in my manner he knows my heart i trust at least you do my albina and even if i should be obliged to receive or to go to see the walsinghams which by the bye i have taken means to prevent but if it should happen that they were to hear of palmers being with us and come and sir john should meet them he must not be surprised or jealous at my speaking in the highest terms of captain walsingham this i shall be obliged to do as a blind before mr palmer i must make him believe that i prefer a commoner for my son in law or we are all undone with him you know it is my sons interest and yours as well as your brothers and amelias that i consider so explain all this to him my dear you will explain it so much better and make it so much more palpable to your brother than i could dear mrs beaumont how can you think so you who write so well and such long letters about every thing and so quick but goodness i shall never get it all into a letter im afraid and before mr palmer comes and then it will soon be dressing time la i could say it all to john in five minutes what a pity he is not here to day well my love then suppose you were to go to him as you so prudently remark things of this sort are always so much easier and better said than written and now i look at my watch i see you cannot have time to write a long letter and to dress so i believe though i shall grieve to lose you i must consent to your going for this one day to your brothers my carriage and williamson shall attend you said mrs beaumont ringing the bell to order the carriage but remember you promise me now to come back positively to morrow or next day at farthest if i should not be able to send the carriage again to morrow i would not upon any account have you away if it can possibly be helped whilst mr palmer is here considering you as i do the carriage to the door directly and williamson to attend miss hunter considering you as i do my dearest albina quite as my own daughter oh my dearest mrs beaumont you are so kind said the poor girl whom mrs beaumont could always thus easily pay with words the carriage came to the door with such prompt obedience to mrs beaumonts summons that one of a more reflecting or calculating nature than miss hunter might have suspected that it had been ordered to be in readiness to carry her away this morning fare ye well my own albina be sure you dont stay long from us said mrs beaumont accompanying her to the hall door a thousand kind things to everybody and your brother in particular but my dear miss hunter one word more said she following to the carriage door and whispering theres another thing that i must trust to your management and cleverness i mentioned that mr palmer was to know nothing of the approbation of sir johns suit oh yes yes maam i understand perfectly but stay my love you must understand too that it is to be quite a secret between ourselves not to be mentioned to my son even for you know he is sudden in his temper and warm and quite in the walsingham interest and theres no knowing what might be the consequence if it were to be let out imprudently and sir john and edward both so high spirited one cant be too cautious my dear to prevent mischief between gentlemen so caution your brother to leave it to me to break it and bring things about with edward and amelia stopping miss hunter again as she made a second effort to get into the carriage you comprehend my dear that amelia is not in the secret yet so not a word from your brother to her about my approbation that would ruin all i trust to his honour and besides drawing the young lady back for the third whisper miss hunter stood suspended with one foot in air and the other on the step the coachman impatient to be off manoeuvred to make his horses restless whilst at the same time he cried aloud so so prancer stand still peacock stand still sir miss hunter jumped down on terra firma those horses frighten me so for you my dear said mrs beaumont martin stand at their heads my dear child i wont detain you for youll be late i had only to say that oh that i trust implicitly to your brothers honour but besides this it will not be amiss for you to hint as you know you can delicately delicately you understand that it is for his interest to leave me to manage every thing yet none of this is to be said as if from me pray dont let it come from me say it all from yourself dont let my name be mentioned at all dont commit me you understand perfectly perfectly maam one kiss dear mrs beaumont and adieu is my dressing box in tell him to drive fast for i hate going slow dearest mrs beaumont good bye i feel as if i were going for an age though it is only for one day dear affectionate girl i love heart good bye drive fast as miss hunter desires you our fair politician well satisfied with the understanding of her confidante which never comprehended more than met the ear and secure in a charg daffaires whose powers it was never necessary to limit stood on the steps before the house door deep in reverie for some minutes after the carriage had driven away till she was roused by seeing her son returning from his mornings ride chapter iii will you hear a spanish lady how she wood an english man garments gay as rich as may be deckd with jewels she had on the spanish ladys love percys reliques of ancient poetry mr beaumont had just been at a neighbouring farm house where there lived one of mr walsinghams tenants a man of the name of birch a respectable farmer who was originally from ireland and whose son was at sea with captain walsingham the captain had taken young birch under his particular care at mr walsinghams request birchs parents had this day received a letter from their son which in the joy and pride of their hearts they showed to mr beaumont who was in the habit of calling at their house to inquire if they had heard any news of their son or of captain walsingham mr beaumont liked to read birchs letters because they were written with characteristic simplicity and affection and somewhat in the irish idiom which this young sailors english education had not made him entirely forget letter from birch to his parents hms lambuscade honoured parents i write this from sea lat n long w wind nne to let you know you will not see me so soon as i said in my last of the th yesterday pm two oclock some despatches were brought to my good captain by the pickle sloop which will to morrow wind and weather permitting alter our destination what the nature of them is i cannot impart to you for it has not transpired beyond the lieutenants but whatever i do under the orders of my good captain i am satisfied and confident all is for the best for my own share i long for an opportunity of fighting the french and of showing the captain what is in me and that the pains he has took to make a gentleman and an honour to his majestys service of me is not thrown away had he been my own father or brother he could not be better or done more god willing i will never disgrace his principles for it would be my ambition to be like him in every respect and he says if i behave myself as i ought i shall soon be a lieutenant and a lieutenant in his majestys navy is as good a gentleman as any in england and has a right tell my sister kitty to hand the first woman in lonon out of her carriage if he pleases and if she pleases now we talk of ladies and as please god we shall soon be in action and may not have another opportunity of writing to you this great while for there is talk of our sailing southward with the fleet to bring the french and spaniards to action i think it best to send you all the news i have in this letter but pray bid kate with my love mind this that not a word of the following is to take wind for her life on account of my not knowing if it might be agreeable or how it might affect my good captain and others that shall be nameless you must know then that when we were at where we were stationed six weeks and two days waiting for the winds and one cause or other we used to employ ourselves i and my captain taking soundings which i cant more particularly explain the nature of to you especially in a letter for he always took me out to attend him in preference to any other and after he had completed his soundings and had no farther use for me in that job i asked him leave to go near the same place in the evening to fish which my good captain consented to as he always does to what duty done can gratify me provided i was in my ship by ten now you must know that there are convents in this country which you have often heard of kitty no doubt being damnable places where young catholic women are shut up unmarried often it is to be reasonably supposed against their wills and there is a convent in one of the suburbs which has a high back wall to the garden of it that comes down near the strand and it was under this wall we two used to sound and that afterwards i used to be fishing and one evening when i was not thinking of any such thing there comes over the wall a huge nosegay of flowers with a stone in it that made me jump and this for three evenings running the same way about the same hour till at last one evening as i was looking up at the wall as i had now learned to do about the time the nosegays were thrown over i saw coming down a stone tied to a string and to the stone a letter the words of which i cant particularly take upon me to recollect because i gave up the paper to my captain who desired it of me and took no copy but the sense was that in that convent there was shut up a lady the daughter of an english gentleman by a spanish wife both her parents being dead and her spanish relations and father confessor or catholic priest of a man not wishing she should get to england where she might be what she had a right to be by birth at least by her fathers side a protestant shut her up since she was a child and that there was a relative of hers in england who with a wicked lawyer or attorney had got possession of her estate and made every body believe she was dead and so it being seven years and more since she was heard of she is what is called dead in law which sort of death however wont signify if she appears again wherefore the letter goes on to say she would be particularly glad to make her escape and get over to old england but she confesses that she is neither young nor handsome and may be never may be rich therefore that whoever helps her must do it for the sake of doing good and nothing else for though she would pay all expenses handsomely she could not promise more and that she knew the danger of the undertaking to be great greater for them that would carry her off even than for herself that she knows however that british sailors are brave as they are generous this part of the letter was very well indited and went straight to my heart the minute ever i read it and she wished it could be in the power of captain walsingham to take her under his immediate protection and that she had taken measures so as she could escape over the wall of the garden if he would have a boat in readiness to carry her to his ship and at the same hour next evening the stone should be let down as usual and he might fasten his answer to it which would be drawn up in due course concluding all this with that she would not go at all unless captain walsingham came for her himself certifying himself to be himself i suppose for she knew him to be a gentleman by reputation and she should be safe under his protection and so would her secret she was confident at all events this was the entire and sum total of the letter so when i had read to the end and looked for the postscript and all i found for my pains that the lady mistook me for my captain or would not have written or thrown the nosegays so i took the letter to my captain and what he answered and how it was settled by signals i suppose between them after it was not for me to inquire not a word more was said by him to me or i to him on the topic till the very night we were to sail for england it was then that our captain took me aside and he says birch will you assist me i ask this not as your captain so you are at liberty to do as you please will you help me to rescue this lady who seems to be unjustly detained and to carry her back safe to her country and her friends i told him i would do that or any thing else he bid me confident he would never ask me to do a wrong thing and as to the lady i should be proud to help to carry her off to old england and her lawful friends only i thought if i might be so bold it was a pity she was not young and handsome for his sake at that he smiled and only said perhaps it was best for him as it was then he settled about the boat and who were to go and when it was twelve oclock striking by the great town clock when we were under the walls of the convent as appointed and all was hush and silent as the grave for our very lives for it was a matter of life or death i promise you and we all knew as much and the sailors had a dread of the inquisition upon them that was beyond all terrible so we watched and waited and waited and watched so long that we thought something must have gone wrong or that all was found out and the captain could not delay the ships sailing and he struck his repeater and it was within a quarter of one and he said it is too late we must put back just then i that was watching with the lantern in my hand gave notice and first there comes down a white bundle fastened to the stone and cord then the captain and i fixed the ladder of ropes and down came the lady as well as ever she went up and not a word but away with her the captain had her in a trice in our boat safe and snug and off we put rowing for the bare life all silent as ever i think i hear the striking of our oars and the plashing of the water this minute which we would have gladly silenced but could not any way in nature but none heard it or at least took any notice against us i can give you no idea of the terror which the lady manifested when the boat stood out to sea at the slightest squall of wind or the least agitation of the waves for besides being naturally cowardly as all or most women are for the first time at sea here was a poor soul who had been watching and may be fasting and worn out mind and body with the terror of perfecting her escape from the convent where she had been immured all her life and as helpless as a child so it was wonderful she went through it as well as she did and without screaming which should be an example to kate and others glad enough even we men were when we reached the ship there was at that time a silence on board you could have heard a pin drop all being in perfect readiness for getting under way the sails ready for dropping and officers and sailors waiting in the greatest expectation of our boats return our boat passed swiftly alongside and great beyond belief was the astonishment of all at seeing a woman veiled hoisted out and in and ushered below half fainting i never felt more comfortable in my life than when we found her and ourselves safe aboard lambuscade the anchor was instantly weighed all sail made and the ship stood out to sea to the lady the captain gave up his cabin double sentries were placed and as the captain ordered every precaution that could shield her character in such suspicious circumstances were enforced with the utmost punctilio i cannot describe nor can you even conceive kate the degree of curiosity shown about her all striving to get a sight of her when she first went down and most zealous they were to bring lights but that would not do for they could not see her for her veil yet through all we could make out that she was a fine figure of a woman at any rate and something more than ordinary from the air she had with her the next day when she was sitting on deck the wind by times would blow aside her veil so as to give us glimpses of her face when to our surprise and i am sure to the captains satisfaction we found she was beyond all contradiction young and handsome and moreover i have reason to believe she has fine jewels with her besides a ring from her own finger which with a very pretty action she put on his that next day on deck as i noticed when nobody was minding so that no doubt she is as much richer as she is handsomer than she made believe contrary to the ways of other women which is in her favour and my good captains for from what i can judge after all he has done for her she has no dislike nor objection to him i have not time to add any thing more but my love to kitty and nancy and tom and mary and little bess and honoured parents wishing you good health as i am in thank god at this present i am your dutiful and loving son john birch ps i open my letter to tell you we are going southward immediately all in high spirits as there is hopes of meeting the french and spaniards we have just hoisted the nun lady on board an english packet god send her and this letter safe to england mr beaumont might perhaps have been amused by this romantic story and by the style in which it was told if he had not been alarmed by the hint at the conclusion of the letter that the lady was not indifferent to her deliverer now mr beaumont earnestly wished that his friend captain walsingham might become his brother in law and he began to have fears about this spanish lady with her gratitude her rings and the advantages of the great interest her misfortunes and helpless condition would excite together with the vast temptations to fall in love that might occur during the course of a voyage had he taken notice of the postscript his mind would have been somewhat relieved on this subject mr beaumont pondered all the way that he rode home and on this subject he was still meditating when he saw his mother standing on the steps where we left her when miss hunters carriage drove away chapter iv i shall in all my best obey you madam hamlet did you meet miss hunter my dear son said she yes maam i just passed the carriage in the avenue she is going home is not she said he rather in a tone of satisfaction ah poor thing yes said mrs beaumont in a most pathetic tone ah poor thing why maam what has happened to her whats the matter matter oh nothing did i say that any thing was the matter dont speak so loud whispered she your groom heard every word we said stay till he is out of hearing and then we can talk i dont care if all the world hears what i say cried mr beaumont hastily but as if suppressing his rising indignation he with a milder look and tone added i cannot conceive my dear mother why you are always so afraid of being overheard servants my dear make such mischief you know by misunderstanding and misrepresenting every thing they hear and they repeat things so oddly and raise such strange reports true very true indeed maam said mr beaumont you are quite right and i beg pardon for being so hasty i wish you could teach me a little of your patience and prudence prudence ah my dear edward tis only time and sad experience of the world can teach that to people of our open tempers i was at your age ten times more imprudent and unsuspicious than you are were you maam but i dont think i am unsuspicious i was when i was a boy i wish we could continue children always in some things i hate suspicion in any body but more than in any one else i hate it in myself and yet mr beaumont hesitated and his mother instantly went on with a fluent panegyric upon the hereditary unsuspiciousness of his temper but madam were you not saying something to me about miss hunter was i oh i was merely going to say that i was sorry you did not know she was going this morning that you might have taken leave of her poor thing take leave of her maam i bowed to her and wished her a good morning when i met her just now and she told me she was only going to the hall for a day surely no greater leave taking was requisite when i am to see the lady again to morrow i presume that is not quite so certain as she thinks poor soul i told her i would send for her again to morrow just to keep up her spirits at leaving me walk this way edward under the shade of the trees for i am dead with the heat and you too look so hot i say i am not so sure that it would be prudent to have her here so much especially whilst mr palmer is with us you know mrs beaumont paused as if waiting for an assent or a dissent or a leading hint how to proceed but her son persisting in perverse silence she was forced to repeat you know edward my dear you know i dont know indeed maam you dont know faith not i maam i dont know for the soul of me what mr palmers coming has to do with miss hunters going theres room enough in the house i suppose for each of them and all of us to play our parts as to the rest the young ladys coming or going is quite a matter of indifference to me except of course as far as politeness and hospitality go but all that i leave to you who do the honours for me so well mrs beaumonts ideas were utterly thrown out of their order by this speech no part of which was exactly what she wished or expected not that any of the sentiments it contained or suggested were new to her but she was not prepared to meet them thus clothed in distinct words and in such a compact form she had drawn up her forces for battle in an order which this unexpectedly decisive movement of the enemy discomfited and a less able tactician might have been in these circumstances not only embarrassed but utterly defeated yet however unprepared for this sudden shock with admirable generalship our female hannibal falling back in the centre admitted him to advance impetuous and triumphant till she had him completely surrounded my being of age in a few days continued mr beaumont will not make any difference surely i depend upon it that you will always invite whomever you like to this house of which i hope my dear mother you will always do me the favour to be the mistress till i marry at least for my wifes feelings added he smiling i cant engage before i have her and before we know who she is to be said mrs beaumont carelessly time enough as you say to think of that besides there are few women in the world i know scarcely one with whom in the relation of mother and daughter in law i should wish to live but wherever i live my dear son as long as i have a house i hope you will always do me the justice and the pleasure to consider yourself as its master heaven knows i shall never give any other man a right to dispute with you the sovereignty of my castle or my cottage whichever it may be as to the rest pursued mrs beaumont you cannot marry against my wishes my dear edward for your wishes on this as on all other subjects will ever govern mine her son kissed her hand with warm gratitude you will not i hope think that i seek to prolong my regency or to assume undue power or influence in affairs continued mrs beaumont if i hint to you in general terms what i think may contribute to your happiness you must afterwards decide for yourself and are now as you have ever been master to do as you please too much too much i have had too much liberty and have too little acquired the habit of commanding my will and my passions by my reason of this i am sensible my excellent friend captain walsingham told me some years ago that this was the fault of my character and he charged me to watch over myself and so i have but not so strictly i fear as if he had watched along with me well maam you were going to give me some advice i am all attention my dear son captain walsingham showed his judgment more perhaps in pointing out causes than effects the weakness of a fond mother i am sensible did indulge you in childhood and perhaps more imprudently in youth with an unlimited liberty to judge and act for yourself your mothers system of education came alas more from her heart than her head captain walsingham himself cannot be more sensible of my errors than i am captain walsingham believe me mother never mentioned this in reproach to you he is not a man to teach a son to see his mothers errors if she had any he always spoke of you with the greatest respect and since i must at my own expense do him justice it was i well remember upon some occasion where i spoke too hastily and insisted upon my will in opposition to yours madam that captain walsingham took me aside and represented to me the fault into which my want of command over myself had betrayed me this he did so forcibly that i have never from that hour to this i flatter myself on any material occasion forgotten the impression he made on my mind but madam i interrupt you you were going to give me your advice about no no no advice no advice you are in my opinion fully adequate to the direction of your own conduct i was merely going to suggest that since you have not been accustomed to control from a mother and since you have thank heaven a high spirit that would sooner break than bend it must be essential to your happiness to have a wife of a compliant gentle temper not fond of disputing the right or attached to her own opinions not one who would be tenacious of rule and unseasonably inflexible unseasonably inflexible undoubtedly maam yet i should despise a mean spirited wife i am sure you would but compliance that proceeds from affection you know can never deserve to be called mean spirited nor would it so appear to you i am persuaded that there is a degree of fondness of affection enthusiastic affection which disposes the temper always to a certain softness and yieldingness which i conceive would be peculiarly attractive to you and essential to your happiness in short i know your temper could not bear contradiction oh indeed maam you are quite mistaken quite mistaken and at the very moment he reddens with anger because i contradict even in the softest gentlest manner in my power his opinion of himself you dont understand me indeed you dont understand me said mr beaumont beating with his whip the leaves of a bush which was near him either you dont understand me or i dont understand you i am much more able to bear contradiction than you think i am provided it be direct but i do not love what i am doing at this instant added he smiling i dont love beating about the bush look there now strange creatures you men are so like he looks to his poor father who used to tell me that he loved to be contradicted and yet who would not i am sure have lived three days with any woman who had ventured to contradict him directly whatever influence i obtained in his heart and whatever happiness we enjoyed in our union i attribute to my trusting to my observations on his character rather than to his own account of himself therefore i may be permitted to claim some judgment of what would suit your hereditary temper certainly maam certainly but to come to the point at once may i ask this plain question do you by these reflections mean to allude to any particular persons is there any woman in the world you at this instant would wish me to marry yes miss walsingham mr beaumont started with joyful surprise when his mother thus immediately pronounced the very name he wished to hear you surprise and delight me my dear mother surprise how can that be surely you must know my high opinion of miss walsingham but but you added but there is no woman who may not be taxed with a but yet it is not for her friend to lower her merit my only objection to her is i shall infallibly affront you if i name it name it name it you will not affront me my only objection to her then is her superiority she is so superior that forgive me i dont know any man yourself not excepted who is at all her equal i think precisely as you do and rejoice rejoice why there i cannot sympathize with you i own as a mother i should feel a little a little mortified to see my son not the superior and when the comparison is to be daily and hourly made and to last for life and all the world to see it as well as myself i own i have a mothers vanity i should wish to see my son always what he has hitherto been the superior and master in his own house mr beaumont made no reply to these insinuations but walked on in silence and his mother unable to determine precisely whether the vexation apparent in his countenance proceeded from disapprobation of her observations or from their working the effect she desired upon his pride warily waited till he should betray some decisive symptom of his feelings but she waited in vain he was resolved not to speak there is not a woman upon earth i should wish so much to have as a daughter in law a companion and a friend as miss walsingham you must be convinced resumed mrs beaumont so far as i am concerned it is the most desirable thing in the world but i should think it my duty to put my own feelings and wishes out of the question and to make myself prefer whomsoever all things considered my judgment tells me would make you the happiest and whom would your judgment prefer madam why i am not at liberty to tell unless i could explain all my reasons indeed i know not what to say dear madam explain all your reasons or we shall never understand one another and never come to an end of these half explanations here they were interrupted by seeing mr twigg a courtly clergyman coming towards them beaumont was obliged to endure his tiresome flattery upon the beauties of beaumont park and upon the judicious improvements that were making had been made and would no doubt be very soon made mrs beaumont at last relieved his or her own impatience by commissioning mr twigg to walk round the improvements by himself by himself she insisted it should be that she might have his unbiassed judgment upon the two lines which had been marked for the new belt or screen and he was also to decide whether they should call it a belt or a screen honoured with this commission he struck off into the walk to which mrs beaumont pointed and began his solitary progress mr beaumont then urged his mother to go on with her explanation mrs beaumont thought that she could not hazard much by flattering the vanity of a man on that subject on which perhaps it is most easily flattered therefore after sufficient delicacy of circumlocution she informed her son that there was a young lady who was actually dying for love of him whose extreme fondness would make her live but in him and who besides having a natural ductility of character and softness of temper was perfectly free from any formidable superiority of intellect and had the most exalted opinion of his capacity as well as of his character and accomplishments in short such an enthusiastic adoration as would induce that belief in the infallibility of a husband which must secure to him the fullest enjoyment of domestic peace power and pre eminence mr beaumont seemed less moved than his mother had calculated that the vanity of man must be by such a declaration discovery it could not be called if i am to take all this seriously madam replied he laughing and if au pied de la lettre my vanity is to believe that this damsel is dying for love yet still i have so little chivalry in my nature that i cannot understand how it would add to my happiness to sacrifice myself to save her life that i am well suited to her i am as willing as vanity can make me to believe but how is it to be proved that the lady is suited to me my dear these things do not admit of logical proof well moral sentimental or any kind of proof you please have you no pity and is not pity akin to love akin oh yes maam it is akin but for that very reason it may not be a friend relations you know in these days are as often enemies as friends vile pun far fetched quibble provoking boy but i see you are not in a humour to be serious so i will take another time to talk to you of this affair now or never maam for mercys sake mercys sake you who show none ah this is the way with you men all this is play to you but death to us death dear maam ladies you know as well as i do dont die of love in these days you would not make a fool of your son i could not nor could any other woman that is clear but amongst us i am afraid we have undesignedly indeed but irremediably made a fool of this poor confiding girl but maam in whom did she confide not in me ill swear i have nothing to reproach myself with thank god my conscience is clear i have been as ungallant as possible i have been as cruel as my nature would permit i am sure no one can charge me with giving false promises i scarcely speak nor false hopes for i scarcely look at the young lady so then you know who the young lady in question is perhaps i ought not to pretend to know that would be useless affectation alas for i fear many know and have seen and heard much more than you have or i either here mrs beaumont observed that her sons colour changed and that he suddenly grew serious aware that she had now touched upon the right chord she struck it again with a masters hand and prophets fire she declared that all the world took it for granted that miss hunter was to be married to mr beaumont that it was talked of every where that she was asked continually by her correspondents when the marriage was to take place in confirmation of which assertion she produced bundles of letters from her pockets from mrs and miss and from lady this and lady that nay continued she if it were confined even to the circle of ones private friends and acquaintance i should not so much mind it for one might contradict and have it contradicted and one might send the poor thing away to some watering place and the report might die away as reports do sometimes but all that sort of thing it is too late to think of now for the thing is public quite public got into the newspapers heres a paragraph i cut out this very morning from my paper lest the poor girl should see it the other day i believe you saw it yourself there was something of the same sort we hear that as soon as he comes of age mr beaumont of beaumont park is to lead to the altar of hymen miss hunter sister to sir john hunter of devonshire well after you left the room albina took up the paper you had been reading and when she saw this paragraph i thought she would have dropped i did not know what to do whatever i could say you know would only make it worse i tried to turn it off and talked of twenty things but it would not do no no it is too serious for that well though i believe she would rather have put her hand in the fire she had the courage to speak to me about it herself and what did she say maam inquired mr beaumont eagerly poor simple creature she had but one idea that you had seen it that she would not for the world you had read it what would you think of her she should never be able to meet you again what could she do it must be contradicted somebody must contradict it then she worried me to have it contradicted in the papers i told her i did not well know how that could be done and urged that it would be much more prudent not to fix attention upon the parties by more paragraphs but she was not in a state to think of prudence no what would you think was the only idea in her mind if i would not write she would write that minute herself and sign her name this and a thousand wild things she said till i was forced to be quite angry and to tell her she must be governed by those who had more discretion than herself then she was so subdued so ashamed really my heart bled for her even whilst i scolded her but it is quite necessary to be harsh with her for she has no more foresight nor art nor command of herself sometimes than a child of five years old i assure you i was rejoiced to get her away before mr palmer came for a new eye coming into a family sees so much one wouldnt wish to be seen you know it would be terrible to have the poor young creature commit and expose herself to a stranger so early in life indeed as it is i am persuaded no one will ever think of marrying her if you do not in worldly prudence but of that she has not an atom in worldly prudence she might do better or as well certainly for her fortune will be very considerable sir john means to add to it when he gets the wigram estate and the old uncle wigram cant live for ever but poor albina i dare swear does not know what fortune she is to have nor what you have love love all for love and all in vain she is certainly very much to be pitied longer might mrs beaumont have continued in monologue without danger of interruption from her son who stood resolved to hear the utmost sum of all that she should say on the subject never interrupting her he only filled certain pauses that seemed expectant of reply with the phrases i am very sorry indeed maam and really maam it is out of my power to help it but mrs beaumont observed that the latter phrase had been omitted as she proceeded and i am very sorry indeed maam he repeated less as words of course and more and more as if they came from the heart having so far successfully as she thought worked upon her sons good nature and seeing her daughter through the trees coming towards them she abruptly exclaimed promise me at all events dearest edward i conjure you promise me that you will not make proposals any where else without letting me know of it beforehand and give me time joining her hands in a supplicating attitude give me but a few weeks to prepare my poor little albina for this sad sad stroke i promise you madam that i will not directly or indirectly make an offer of my hand or heart to any woman without previously letting you know my determination and as for a few weeks more or less my mother surely need not supplicate but simply let me know her wishes even without her reasons they would have been sufficient with me do i satisfy you now madam more than satisfy as you ever do ever will my dear son but you will require no more on this subject i must be left master of myself indubitably certainly master of yourself most certainly of course mr beaumont was going to add something beginning with it is better at once to tell you that i can never but mrs beaumont stopped him with hush my dear hush not a word more for here is amelia and i cannot talk on this subject before her you know my beloved amelia how languid you look i fear that to please me you have taken too long a walk and mr palmer wont see you in your best looks after all what note is that you have in your hand a note from miss walsingham mamma oh the chickenpox take care letters notes every thing may convey the infection cried mrs beaumont snatching the paper how could dearest miss walsingham be so giddy as to answer my note after what i said in my postscript how did this note come by the little postboy mamma i met him at the porters lodge but what is all this strange thing said mrs beaumont after having read the note twice over it contained a certificate from the parish minister and churchwardens apothecary and surgeon bearing witness one and all that there was no individual man woman or child in the parish or within three miles of walsingham house who was even under any suspicion of having the chickenpox my father desires me to send mrs beaumont the enclosed clean bill of health by which she will find that we need be no longer subject to quarantine and unless some other reasons prevent our having the pleasure of seeing her we may hope soon that she will favour us with her long promised visit yours sincerely marianne walsingham i am delighted said mrs beaumont to find it was a false report and that we shall not be kept the lord knows how long away from the dear walsinghams then we can go to them to morrow cant we mamma and i will write and say so shall i said amelia no need to write my dear if we promise for any particular day and are not able to go that seems unkind and is taken ill you see and as mr palmer is coming we cant leave him but he will go with us surely said mr beaumont the walsinghams are as much his relations as we are and if he comes two hundred miles to see us he will surely go seven to see them true said mrs beaumont but it is civil and kind to leave him to fix his own day poor old gentleman after so long a journey we must allow him some rest consider he cant go galloping about as you do dear edward but said amelia as the walsinghams know he is to be in the country they will of course come to see him immediately how do they know he is to be in the country i thought i took it for granted you told them so mamma when you wrote about not going to walsingham house on mr walsinghams birthday no my dear i was so full of the chickenpox and terror about you i could think of nothing else thank you dear mother but now that is out of the question i had best write a line by the return of the postboy to say that mr palmer is to be here to day and that he stays only one week certainly love but let me write about it for i have particular reasons and my dear now we are by ourselves let me caution you not to mention that mr palmer can stay but one week in the first place it is uncivil to him for we are not sure of it and it is like driving him away and in the next place there are reasons i cant explain to you that know so little of the world my dear amelia but in general it is always foolish to mention things always foolish to mention things cried mr beaumont smiling of this sort i mean said mrs beaumont a little disconcerted of what sort persisted her son hush my dear heres the postboy and the ass any letters my good little boy any letters for me i has madam a many for the house i does not know for who the bag will tell said the boy unstrapping the bag from his shoulders give it to me then said mrs beaumont i am anxious for letters always she was peculiarly anxious now to open the post bag to put a stop to a conversation which did not please her whilst seated on a rustic seat under a spreading beech our heroine with her accustomed looks of mystery examined the seals of her numerous and important letters to ascertain whether they had been opened at the post office or whether their folds might have been pervious to any prying eye her son tore the covers off the newspapers and as he unfolded one amelia leaned upon his shoulder and whispered softly any news of the fleet brother mrs beaumont than whom fine ear himself had not quicker auditory nerves especially for indiscreet whispers looked up from her letters and examined unperceived the countenance of amelia who was searching with eagerness the columns of the paper as mr beaumont turned over the leaf amelia looked up and seeing her mothers eyes fixed upon her coloured and from want of presence of mind to invent any thing better to say asked if her mother wished to have the papers no said mrs beaumont coldly not i amelia i am not such a politician as you are grown amelia withdrew her attention or at least her eyes from the paper and had recourse to the beech tree the beautiful foliage of which she studied with profound attention god bless me heres news news of the fleet cried beaumont turning suddenly to his sister and then recollecting himself to his mother maam they say there has been a great engagement between the french and spaniards and the english particulars not known yet but they say ten sail of the french line are taken and four spaniards blown up and six spanish men of war disabled and a treasure ship taken walsingham must have been in the engagement my horse ill gallop over this minute and know from the walsinghams if they have seen the papers and if theres any thing more about it in their papers gallop my dearest edward said his mother standing in his path but you dont consider mr palmer damn mr palmer i beg your pardon mother i mean no harm to the old gentleman friend of my fathers great respect for him ill be back by dinner time back ready to receive him he cant be here till six only five by me now maam i shall have more than time to dress too cool as a cucumber ready to receive the good old fellow in one short hour my dear seven miles to walsingham house and seven back again and all the time you will waste there and to dress too only consider i do consider maam and have considered every thing in the world my horse will carry me there and back in fifty minutes easily and five to spare ill be bound i shant light so wheres the paper im off well order your horse and leave me the paper at least while he is getting ready ride by this way and you will find us here where is this famous paragraph beaumont drew the paper crumpled from the pocket into which he had thrust it ran off for his horse and quickly returned mounted give me the paper good friends im off away then my dear since you will heat yourself for nothing but only let me point out to you said she holding the paper fast whilst she held it up to him that this whole report rests on no authority whatever not a word of it in the gazette not a line from the admiralty no official account no bulletin no credit given to the rumour at lloyds stocks the same and how did the news come not even the news writer pretends it came through any the least respectable channel a frigate in latitude the lord knows what saw a fleet in a fog might be spanish might be french might be english spoke another frigate some days afterwards who heard firing well firing says nothing but the frigate turns this firing into an engagement and a victory and presently communicates the news to a collier and the collier tells another collier and so it goes up the thames to some wonder maker standing agape for a paragraph to secure a dinner to the press the news goes just as our paper is coming out and to be sure we shall have a contradiction and an apology in our next well maam but i will ask mr walsingham what he thinks and show him the paper do if you like it my dear i never control you but dont overheat yourself for nothing what can mr walsingham or all the walsinghams in the world tell more than we can and as to showing him the paper you know he takes the same paper but dont let me detain you amelia who is that coming through the gate mr palmers servant i protest well it cant be i see said beaumont dismounting take away your masters horse quick quick amelia my love to dress i must have you ready to receive your godfathers blessing consider mr palmer was your fathers earliest friend and besides he is a relation though distant and it is always a good and prudent thing to keep up relationships many a fine estate has come from very distant relations most unexpectedly and even independently of all relationships when friendships are properly cultivated theres no knowing to what they may lead not that i look to any thing of that sort here but before you see mr palmer just as we are walking home and quite to ourselves let me give you some leading hints about this old gentlemans character which i have gathered no matter how for your advantage my dear children he is a humourist and must not be opposed in any of his oddities he is used to be waited upon and attended to as all these men are who have lived in the west indies a bon vivant of course edward produce your best wines the pilau and currie and all that leave to me i had special notice of his love for a john doree and a john doree i have for him but now i am going to give you the master key to his heart like all men who have made great fortunes he loves to feel continually the importance his wealth confers he loves to feel that wealth does every thing is superior to every thing to birth and titles especially it is his pride to think himself though a commoner far above any man who condescends to take a title he hates persons of quality therefore whilst he is here not a word in favour of any titled person forget the whole house of peers send them all to coventry all to coventry remember and now you have the key to his heart go and dress to be ready for him having thus given her private instructions and advanced her secret plans mrs beaumont repaired to her toilet well satisfied with her mornings work chapter v chi mi fa piu carezze che non sole o mha ingannato o ingannar me vuole by st george theres nothing like old england for comfort cried mr palmer settling himself in his arm chair in the evening nothing after all in any part of the known world like old england for comfort why madam theres not another people in the universe that have in any of their languages a name even for comfort the french have been forced to borrow it but now they have got it they dont know how to use it nor even how to pronounce it poor devils well theres nothing like old england for comfort ah nothing like old england for comfort echoed mrs beaumont in a sentimental tone though at that instant her thoughts were far distant from her words for this declaration of his love for old england alarmed her with the notion that he might change his mind about returning immediately to jamaica and that he might take root again and flourish for years to come in his native soil perhaps in her neighbourhood to the bane of all her favourite projects what would become of her scheme of marrying amelia to the baronet and her son to the docile albina what would become of the scheme of preventing him from being acquainted with the walsinghams for a week it might be practicable to keep them asunder by policising but this could never be effected if he were to settle or even to make any long stay in the country the walsinghams would be affronted and then what would become of their interest in the county her son could not be returned without that and worse than all the rest mr palmer might take a fancy to see these walsinghams who were as nearly related to him as the beaumonts and seeing he might prefer and preferring he might possibly leave half nay perhaps the whole of his large fortune to them and thus all her hopes and projects might at once be frustrated little aware of the long and perplexing trains of ideas which his honest ejaculation in favour of his native country had raised mr palmer went on with his own comfortable thoughts and of all the comforts our native land affords i know of none so grateful to the heart continued he as good friends which are to be found nowhere else in such perfection a man at my time of life misses many an old friend on his return to his native country but then he sees them still in their representatives and loves them again in their children mr beaumont looked at me at that instant so like his father he is the image of what my friend was when i first knew him i am rejoiced you see the likeness said mrs beaumont amelia my dear pour out the coffee and miss beaumont too has just his expression of countenance which surprises me more in her delicate features upon my word i have reason to be proud of my god daughter as far as appearances go and with english women appearances fair as they may be seldom are even so good as the truth theres her fathers smile again for me young lady if that smile deceives theres no truth in woman do not you find our coffee here very bad compared with what you have been used to abroad said mrs beaumont i do rejoice to find myself here quiet in the country continued mr palmer without hearing the ladys question nothing after all like a good old english family where every thing speaks plenty and hospitality without waste or ostentation and where you are received with a hearty welcome without compliments and let do just as you please without form and without being persecuted by politeness this was the image of an english country family impressed early upon the good old gentlemans imagination which had remained there fresh and unchanged since the days of his youth and he now took it for granted that he should see it realized in the family of his late friend i was afraid resumed mrs beaumont that after being so long accustomed to a west indian life you would find many things unpleasant to your feelings here but you are so kind so accommodating is it really possible that you have not since your return to england experienced any uncomfortable sensations suffered any serious injury to your health my dear sir from the damps and chills of our climate why now i think of it i have i have a cough said mr palmer coughing mrs beaumont officiously shut the window i do acknowledge that england is not quite so superior to all other countries in her climate as in every thing else yet i dont damn the climate like a lord at my time of life a man must expect to be a valetudinarian and it would be unjust to blame ones native climate for that but a man of seventy five must live where he can not where he will and dr y tells me that i can live nowhere but in the west indies oh sir never mind dr y exclaimed young beaumont live with us in england many englishmen live to a great age surely let people say what they will of the climate but perhaps brother interposed amelia those who like mr palmer have lived much in a warm climate might find a return to a cold country dangerous and we should consider what is best for him not merely what is most agreeable to ourselves true my dearest amelia said mrs beaumont and to be sure dr y is one of our most skilful physicians i could not be so rash or so selfish as to set my private wishes or my private opinion in opposition to dr y s advice but surely my dear sir you wont let one physician however eminent send you away from us all and banish you again from england we have a very clever physician here dr wheeler in whom i have the greatest confidence in my own case i confess i should prefer his judgment to any of the london fashionable physicians who are so fine and so hurried that they cant take time to study ones particular constitution and hear all one has to say to them now that is wheelers great excellence and i should so like to hear his opinion i am sure if he gives it against me i will not say a word more if he decide for jamaica i may be vexed but i should make it a point of conscience to submit and not to urge my good friend to stay in england at his own peril happy they who can live where they please and whose fortune puts it in their power to purchase any climate and to combine the comforts and luxuries of all countries nothing more was said upon the subject mrs beaumont turned the conversation to the different luxuries of the west and east indies mr palmer fatigued by his journey retired early to rest little dreaming that his kind hostess waked whilst he slept for the purpose of preparing a physician to give a proper opinion upon his case mrs beaumont left a note to her favourite dr wheeler to be sent very early in the morning as if by accident the doctor dropped in at breakfast time and mrs beaumont declared that it was the luckiest chance imaginable that he should happen to call just when she was wishing to see him when the question in debate was stated to him he with becoming gravity of countenance and suavity of manner entered into a discussion upon the effect of hot and cold climates upon the solids and fluids and nervous system in general then upon english constitutions in particular and lastly upon idiosyncrasies this last word cost mr palmer half his breakfast on hearing it he turned down his cup with a profound sigh and pushed his plate from him indications which did not escape the physicians demure eye gaining confidence from the weakness of the patient dr wheeler now boldly pronounced that in his opinion any gentleman who after having habituated himself long to a hot climate as jamaica for instance should come late in life to reside in a colder climate as england for example must run very great hazard indeed nay he could almost venture to predict would fall a victim to the sudden tension of the lax fibres though a man of sound good sense in most things mr palmers weakness was on medical subjects as great as his ignorance his superstitious faith in physicians was as implicit as either dr wheeler or mrs beaumont could desire then said mr palmer with a sigh still deeper than the first for the first was for himself and the second for his country then england old england farewell for ever all my judges pronounce sentence of transportation upon me mr beaumont and amelia in eager and persuasive tones of remonstrance and expostulation at once addressed the doctor to obtain a mitigation or suspension of his sentence dr wheeler albeit unused to the imperative mood reiterated his dictum though little accustomed to hold his opinion against the arguments or the wishes of the rich and fair he upon this occasion stood his ground against miss and mr beaumont wonderfully well for nearly five minutes till to his utter perplexity and dismay he saw mrs beaumont appear amongst his assailants well i said i would submit and not say a word if dr wheeler was against me she began but i cannot sit by silent i must protest against this cruel cruel decree so contrary too to what i hoped and expected would be dr wheelers opinion poor dr wheeler twinkled and seemed as if he would have rubbed his eyes not sure whether he was awake or in a dream in his perplexity he apprehended that he had misunderstood mrs beaumonts note and he now prepared to make his way round again through the solids and the fluids and the whole nervous system till by favour of idiosyncrasy he hoped to get out of his difficulty and to allow mr palmer to remain on british ground mrs beaumonts face in spite of her powers of simulation lengthened and lengthened and darkened and darkened as he proceeded in his recantation but when the exception to the general axiom was fairly made out and a clear permit to remain in england granted by such high medical authority she forced a smile and joined loudly in the general congratulations whilst her son was triumphing and shaking hands with mr palmer she slipped down stairs after dr wheeler ah doctor what have you done ruined me ruined me didnt you read my note didnt you understand it i thought a word to the wise was enough why then it was as i understood it at first so i thought but then i fancied i must be mistaken afterwards for when i expected support my dear madam you opposed my opinion in favour of jamaica more warmly than any one and what was i to think to think oh my dear doctor you might have guessed that was only a sham opposition but my dear maam cried dr wheeler who though the mildest of men was now worked up to something like indignation my dear maam sham upon sham is too much for any man the doctor went down stairs murmuring thus by excess of hypocrisy our heroine disgusted even her own adherents in which she has the honour to resemble some of the most wily politicians famous in english history but she was too wise ever to let any one who could serve or injure her go discontented out of her presence my dear good dr wheeler i never saw you angry before come come cried mrs beaumont sliding a douceur into his hand friends must not be vexed for trifles it was only a mistake de part et dautre and youll return here to morrow in your way home and breakfast with us and now we understand one another and added she in a whisper we can talk over things and have your cool judgment best when only you and i and mr palmer are present you comprehend those who practise many manoeuvres and carry on many intrigues at the same time have this advantage that if one fails the success of another compensates for the disappointment however she might have been vexed by this slight contre temps with dr wheeler mrs beaumont had ample compensation of different sorts this day some due to her own exertions some owing to accident her own exertions prevented her dear albina hunter from returning for mrs beaumont never sent the promised carriage only a note of apology a nail had run into one of the coach horses feet to accident she owed that the walsinghams were not at home when her son galloped over to see them the next morning and to inquire what news from captain walsingham that days paper also brought a contradiction of the report of the engagement and victory so that mrs beaumonts apprehensions on this subject were allayed and she had no doubt that by proper management with a sufficient number of notes and messages misunderstandings lame horses and crossings upon the road she might actually get through the week without letting the walsinghams see mr palmer or at least without more than a vis or a morning visit from which no great danger could be apprehended few indeed have so much character thought she or so much dexterity in showing it as to make a dangerous impression in the course of a formal morning visit chapter vi ah cest mentir tant soit peu jen conviens cest un grand mal mais il produit un bien voltaire the third day went off still more successfully dr wheeler called at breakfast frightened mr palmer out of his senses about his health and convinced him that his life depended upon his immediate return to the climate of jamaica so this point was decided mrs beaumont calculating justly that the walsinghams would return mr beaumonts visit and come to pay their respects to mr palmer this morning settled as soon as breakfast was over a plan of operations which should keep mr palmer out till dinner time he must see the charming drive which her son had made round his improvements and she must have the pleasure of showing it to him herself and she assured him that he might trust to her driving so into mrs beaumonts garden chair he got and when she had him fairly prisoner she carried him far away from all danger of intruding visitors it may readily be supposed that our heroine made good use of the five or six hours leisure for manoeuvring which she thus secured so frank and cordial was this simple hearted old man any one but mrs beaumont would have thought that with him no manoeuvring was necessary that she need only to have trusted to his friendship and generosity and have directly told him her wishes he was so prepossessed in her favour as being the widow of his friend that he was almost incapable of suspecting her of any unhandsome conduct besides having had little converse with modern ladies his imagination was so prepossessed with the old fashioned picture of a respectable widow lady and guardian mother that he took it for granted mrs beaumont was just like one of the good matrons of former times like lady bountiful or lady lizard and as such he spoke to her of her family concerns in all the openness of a heart which knew no guile now my good mistress beaumont you must look upon me just as my friend the colonel would have done as a man who has your family interests at heart just as much as if i were one of yourselves and let me in to all your little affairs and trust me with all your little plans and let us talk over things together and settle how every thing can be done for the best for the young people you know i have no relations in the world but your family and the walsinghams of whom by the bye i know nothing no one living has any claim upon me i can leave or give my own just as i please and you and yours are of course my first objects and for the how and the what and the when i must consult you and only beg you to keep it in mind that i would as soon give as bequeath and rather for as to what a man leaves to his friends he can only have the satisfaction of thinking that they will be the better for him after he is dead and gone which is but cold comfort but what he gives he has the warm comfort of seeing them enjoy whilst he is alive with them such a generous sentiment exclaimed mrs beaumont and so unlike persons in general who have large fortunes at their disposal i feel so much obliged so excessively not at all not at all not at all no more of that no more of that my good lady the colonel and i were friends so there can be no obligation between us nor thanks nor speeches but just as if you were talking to yourself tell me your mind and if there are any little embarrassments that the son may want to clear off on coming of age or if theres any thing wanting to your jointure my dear madam or if there should be any marriages in the wind where a few thousands more or less might be the making or the breaking of a heart let me hear about it all and do me the justice to let me have the pleasure of making the young folks and the old folks too happy their own way for i have no notion of insisting on all people being happy my way no no ive too much english liberty in me for that and im sure you my good lady are as great a foe as i am to all family managements and mysteries where the old dont know what the young do nor the young what the old think no no thats all nonsense and french convent work nothing like a good old english family so my dear mistress beaumont out with it all and make me one of yourselves free of the family from this minute heres my hand and heart upon it an old friend may presume so far this frankness would have opened any heart except mrs beaumonts but it is the misfortune of artful people that they cannot believe others to be artless either they think simplicity of character folly or else they suspect that openness is only affected as a bait to draw them into snares our heroine balanced for a moment between these two notions she could not believe mr palmer to be an absolute fool no his having made such a large fortune forbad that thought then he must have thrown himself thus open merely to try her and to come at the knowledge of debts and embarrassments which if brought to light would lower his opinion of the prudence of the family my excellent friend to be candid with you she began there is no need of your generosity at present to relieve my son from any embarrassments for i know that he has no debts whatever and i am confident he will make my jointure every thing and more than every thing i could desire and as to marriages my amelia is so young theres time enough to consider true true and she does well to take time to consider but though i dont understand these matters much she looks mightily like the notion i have of a girl thats a little bit in love in love oh my dear sir you dont say so in love why i suppose i should not say in love theres some other way of expressing it come into fashion since my time no doubt and even then i know that was not to be said of a young lady till signing and sealing day but it popped out and i cant get it back again so you must even let it pass and what harm for you know madam without love what would become of the world though i was jilted once and away i acknowledge but forgive and forget i dont like the girl a whit the worse for being a little bit tender hearted for im morally certain even from the little i have heard her say and from the way she has been brought up and from her being her fathers daughter and her mothers madam she could not fix her affections on any one that would not do honour to her choice or which is only saying the same thing in other words that you and i should not approve ah theres the thing said mrs beaumont sighing why now i took it into my head from a blush i saw this morning though how i came to notice it i dont know for to my recollection i have not noticed a girls blushing before these twenty years but to be sure here i have as near an interest almost as if she were my own daughter i say from the blush i saw this morning when young beaumont was talking of the gallop he had taken to inquire about captain walsingham i took it into my head that he was the happy man oh my dear sir he never made any proposals for amelia that was strictly true nor i am sure ever thought of it as far as ever i heard the saving clause of as far as ever i heard prevented this last assertion from coming under that description of falsehoods denominated downright lies indeed how could he pursued mrs beaumont for you know he is no match for amelia he has nothing in the world but his commission no there never was any proposal from that quarter and of course it is impossible my daughter could think of a man who has no thoughts of her you know best my good madam i merely spoke at random im the worst guesser in the world especially on these matters what people tell me i know and neither more not less mrs beaumont rejoiced in the simplicity of her companion then my good friend it is but fair to tell you said she that amelia has an admirer a lover hey who ah theres the misfortune it is a thing i never can consent to ha then now it is out theres the reason the girl blushes and is so absent at times a plan now occurred to mrs beaumonts scheming imagination which she thought the master piece of policy she determined to account for whatever symptoms of embarrassment mr palmer might observe in her daughter by attributing them to a thwarted attachment for sir john hunter and mrs beaumont resolved to make a merit to mr palmer of opposing this match because the lover was a baronet and she thought that mr palmer would be pleased by her showing an aversion to the thoughts of her daughters marrying a sprig of quality this ingenious method of paying her court to her open hearted friend at the expense equally of truth and of her daughter she executed with her usual address well im heartily glad my dear good madam to find that you have the same prejudices against sprigs of quality that i have one good commoner is worth a million of them to my mind so i told a puppy of a nephew of mine who would go and buy a baronetage forsooth disinherited him but he is dead poor puppy poor young man but this is all new to me said mrs beaumont with well feigned surprise but did not you know my dear madam that i had a nephew and that he is dead oh yes but not the particulars no the particulars i never talk of not to the poor dogs credit its well hes dead for if he had lived i am afraid i should have forgiven him no no i never would but there is no use in thinking any more of that what were we saying oh about your amelia our amelia let me call her if she is so much attached poor thing to this man though he is a baronet which i own is against him to my fancy yet it is to be presumed he has good qualities to balance that since she values him and young people must be young and have their little foolish prepossessions for title and so forth to be sure i should have thought my friends daughter above that of such a good family as she is and with such good sense as she inherits too but we have all our foibles i suppose and since it is so with amelia why do let me see this baronet swain of hers and let me try what good i can find out in him and let me bring myself if i can over my prejudices and then you my dear madam so good and kind a mother as you are will make an effort too on your part for we must see the girl happy if it is not out of all sense and reason and if the man be worthy of her it is not his fault that he is a sprig of quality and we must forgive and forget and give our consent my dear mrs beaumont and would you ever give your consent to her marrying sir john hunter cried mrs beaumont breathless with amazement and for a moment thrown off her guard so as to speak quite naturally the sudden difference in her tone and manner struck even her unsuspicious companion and he attributed it to displeasure at this last hint why my very dear good friends wife forgive me said he for this interference and for as it seems opposing your opinion about your daughters marriage which no man has a right to do but if you ask me plump whether i could forgive her for marrying sir john hunter i answer for i can speak nothing but the truth i would if he is a worthy man i thought said mrs beaumont astonished you disinherited your own nephew because he took a baronets title against your will bless you no my dear madam that did displease me to be sure but that was the least cause of displeasure i had i let the world fancy and say what they would rather than bring faults to light but no more about that but did not you take an oath that you would never leave a shilling of your fortune to any sprig of quality never my dearest madam never cried mr palmer laughing never was such a gander see what oaths people put into ones mouth and what lies the world tells said mrs beaumont and believes said mr palmer with a sly smile the surprise that mrs beaumont felt was mixed with a strange and rapid confusion of other sentiments regret for having wasted such a quantity of contrivance and manoeuvring against an imaginary difficulty all this arose from her too easy belief of secret underhand information through the maze of artifice in which she had involved affairs she now with some difficulty perceived that plain truth would have served her purpose better but regret for the past was not in the least mixed with any thing like remorse or penitence on the contrary she instantly began to consider how she could best profit by her own wrong she thought she saw two of her favourite objects almost within her reach mr palmers fortune and the future title for her daughter no obstacle seemed likely to oppose the accomplishment of her wishes except amelias own inclinations these she thought she could readily prevail upon her to give up for she knew that her daughter was both of a timid and of an affectionate temper that she had never in any instance withstood or even disputed her maternal authority and that dread of her displeasure had often proved sufficient to make amelia suppress or sacrifice her own feelings combining all these reflections with her wonted rapidity mrs beaumont determined what her play should now be she saw or thought she saw that she ought either by gentle or strong means to lure or intimidate amelia to her purpose and that while she carried on this part of the plot with her daughter in private she should appear to mr palmer to yield to his persuasions by degrees to make the young people happy their own way and to be persuaded reluctantly out of her aversion to sprigs of quality to be sure it would be necessary to give fresh explanations and instructions to sir john hunter through his sister with the new parts that he and she were to act in this domestic drama as soon as mrs beaumont returned from her airing therefore she retired to her own apartment and wrote a note of explanation with a proper proportion of sentiment and verbiage to her dear albina begging to see her and sir john hunter the very next day the horse which had been lamed by the nail now of course had recovered and it was found by mrs beaumont that she had been misinformed and that he had been lamed only by sudden cramp any excuse she knew would be sufficient in the present state of affairs to the young lady who was more ready to be deceived than even our heroine was disposed to deceive indeed as machiavel says as there are people willing to cheat there will always be those who are ready to be cheated chapter vii vous menchantez mais vous mpouvantez ces pieges l sont ils bien ajusts craignez vous point de vous laisser surprendre dans les filets que vos mains savent tendre voltaire to prepare amelia to receive sir john hunter properly was mrs beaumonts next attempt for as she had represented to mr palmer that her daughter was attached to sir john it was necessary that her manner should in some degree accord with this representation that at least it should not exhibit any symptoms of disapprobation or dislike whatever coldness or reserve might appear it would be easy to attribute to bashfulness and dread of mr palmers observation when amelia was undressing at night her mother went into her room and having dismissed the maid threw herself into an arm chair and exclaimed half yawning how tired i am no wonder such a long airing as we took to day but my dear amelia i could not sleep to night without telling you how glad i am to find that you are such a favourite with mr palmer i am glad he likes me said amelia i am sure i like him what a benevolent excellent man he seems to be excellent excellent the best creature in the world and so interested about you and so anxious that you should be well and soon established almost as anxious about it as i am myself he is very good and you are very good mamma but there is no occasion that i should be soon established as it is called is there that is the regular answer you know in these cases from every young lady that ever was born in or out of a book within the memory of man but we will suppose all that to be said prettily on your part and answered properly on mine so give me leave to go on to something more to the purpose and dont look so alarmed my love you know i am not a hurrying person you shall take your own time and every thing shall be done as you like and the whole shall be kept amongst ourselves entirely for nothing is so disadvantageous and distressing to a young woman as to have these things talked of in the world long before they take place but maam surely there is no marriage determined upon for me without my even knowing it determined upon oh dear no my darling you shall decide every thing for yourself thank you mother now you are kind indeed indubitably my dearest amelia i would not decide on any thing without consulting you for i have the greatest dependence on your prudence and judgment with a silly romantic girl who had no discretion i should certainly think it my duty to do otherwise and if i saw my daughter following headlong some idle fancy of fifteen i should interpose my authority at once and say it must not be but i know my amelia so well that i am confident she will judge as prudently for herself as i could for her and indeed i am persuaded that our opinions will be now as they almost always are my sweet girl the same i hope so mamma but well well ill allow a maidenly but and you will allow that sir john hunter shall be the man at last oh mamma that can never be said amelia with much earnestness never a young ladys never amelia i will allow too dont interrupt me my dear but give me leave to tell you again that you shall have your own time mr palmer has given his consent and approbation consent and approbation cried amelia and is it come to this without even consulting me and is this the way i am left to judge for myself oh mother mother what will become of me amelia who had long had experience that it was vain for her to attempt to counteract or oppose any scheme that her mother had planned sat down at this instant in despair but even from despair she took courage and rising suddenly exclaimed i never can or will marry sir john hunter for i love another person mother you know i do and i will speak truth and abide by it let the consequences be what they may well my dear dont speak so loud at all events for though it may be very proper to speak the truth it is not necessary that the whole universe should hear it you speak of another attachment is it possible that you allude to captain walsingham but captain walsingham has never proposed for you nor even given you any reason to think he would or if he has he must have deceived me in the grossest manner he is incapable of deceiving any body said amelia he never gave me any reason to think he would propose for me nor ever made the slightest attempt to engage my affections you saw his conduct it was always uniform he is incapable of any double or underhand practices in the warmth of your eulogium on captain walsingham you seem amelia to forget that you reflect in the most severe manner upon yourself for what woman what young woman especially who has either delicacy pride or prudence can avow that she loves a man who has never given even by her own statement of the matter the slightest reason to believe that he thinks of her amelia stood abashed and for some instants incapable of reply but at last approaching her mother and hiding her face as she hung over her shoulder she said in a low and timid voice it was only to my mother i thought that could not be wrong and when it was to prevent a greater wrong the engaging myself to another person engaging yourself my foolish child but did i not tell you that you should have your own time but no time mother will do try my dear love that is all i ask of you and this you cannot in duty in kindness in prudence or with decency refuse me cannot i indeed you cannot so say not a word more that can lessen the high opinion i have of you but show me that you have a becoming sense of your own and of female dignity and that you are not the poor mean spirited creature to pine for a man who disdains you disdain i never saw any disdain on the contrary though he never gave me reason to think so i cannot help fancying that he likes you and yet he never proposed for you do not believe it a man may coquet as well as a woman and often more but till he makes his proposal never if you have any value for your own happiness or dignity fancy for a moment that he loves you but he cannot marry because he is so poor true and if so what stronger argument can be brought against your thinking of him i do not think of him i endeavour not to think of him that is my own girl depend upon it he thinks not of you he is all in his profession prefers it to every woman upon earth i have heard him say he would not give it up for any consideration all for glory you see nothing for love amelia sighed her mother rose and kissing her said as if she took every thing she wished for granted so my amelia i am glad to see you reasonable and ready to show a spirit that becomes you sir john hunter breakfasts here to morrow but said amelia detaining her mother who would have left the room i cannot encourage sir john hunter for i do not esteem him therefore i am sure i can never love him you cannot encourage sir john hunter amelia replied mrs beaumont it is extraordinary that this should appear to you an impossibility the very moment the gentleman proposes for you it was not always so allow me to remind you of a ball last year where you and i met both sir john hunter and captain walsingham as i remember you gave all your attention that evening to sir john oh mother i am ashamed of that evening i regret it more than any evening of my life i did wrong very wrong and bitterly have i suffered for it as people always do sooner or later by deceit i was afraid that you should see my real feelings and to conceal them i for the first and last time of my life acted like a coquette but if you recollect dear mother the very next day i confessed the truth to you my friend miss walsingham urged me to have the courage to be sincere miss walsingham on every occasion i find the secret influence of these walsinghams operating in my family cried mrs beaumont from a sudden impulse of anger which threw her off her guard surely their influence has always been beneficial to us all to me miss walsinghams friendship has been of the greatest service yes by secretly encouraging you against your mothers approbation in a ridiculous passion for a man who neither can nor will marry you far from encouraging me madam in any thing contrary to your wishes and far from wishing to do any thing secretly miss walsingham never spoke to me on this subject but once and that was to advise me strongly not to conceal the truth from you and not to make use of any artifices or manoeuvres possibly very possibly but i presume you could conduct yourself properly without miss walsinghams interference or advice i thought mamma you liked miss walsingham particularly and that you wished i should cultivate her friendship certainly i admire miss walsingham extremely and wish to be on the best terms with the family but i will never permit any one to interfere between me and my children we should have gone on better without advisers i am sure her advice and friendship have preserved me from many faults but never led me into any i might from timidity and from fear of your superior address and abilities have become insincere and artful but she has given me strength of mind enough to bear the present evil and to dare at all hazards to speak the truth but my dearest amelia said mrs beaumont softening her tone why so warm what object can your mother have but your good can any miss walsingham or any other friend upon earth have your interest so much at heart as i have why am i so anxious if it is not from love to you amelia was touched by her mothers looks and words of affection and acknowledged that she had spoken with too much warmth mrs beaumont thought she could make advantage of this moment then my beloved child if you are convinced of my affection for you show at least some confidence in me in return show some disposition to oblige me here is a match i approve here is an establishment every way suitable but why mamma must i be married interrupted amelia i will not think at least i will try not to think of any one of whom you do not approve but i cannot marry any other man while i feel such a partiality for so dear mother pray do not let sir john hunter come here any more on my account it is not necessary that i should marry it is necessary however said mrs beaumont withdrawing her hand haughtily and darting a look of contempt and anger upon her daughter it is necessary however that i should be mistress in my own house and that i should invite here whomever i please and it is necessary that you should receive them without airs and with politeness on this observe i insist and will be obeyed mrs beaumont would receive no reply but left the room seemingly in great displeasure but even half her anger was affected to intimidate this gentle girl sir john hunter and his sister arrived to breakfast mrs beaumont played her part admirably so that she seemed to mr palmer only to be enduring sir john from consideration for her daughter and from compliance with mr palmers own request that she would try what could be done to make the young people happy yet she with infinite address drew sir john out and dexterously turned every thing he said into what she thought would please mr palmer though all the time she seemed to be misunderstanding or confuting him mr palmers attention which was generally fixed exclusively on one object at a time had ample occupation in studying sir john whom he examined for amelias sake with all the honest penetration which he possessed towards amelia herself he scarcely ever looked for without any refinement of delicacy he had sufficient feeling and sense to avoid what he thought would embarrass a young lady amelias silence and reserve appeared to him therefore as her politic mother had foreseen just what was natural and proper he had been told that she was attached to sir john hunter and the idea of doubting the truth of what mrs beaumont had asserted could not enter his confiding mind in the mean time our heroine to whom the conduct of a double intrigue was by no means embarrassing did not neglect the affairs of her dear albina she had found time before breakfast as she met miss hunter getting out of her carriage to make herself sure that her notes of explanation had been understood and she now by a multitude of scarcely perceptible inuendoes and seemingly suppressed looks of pity contrived to carry on the representation she had made to her son of this damsels helpless and lovelorn state indeed the young lady appeared as much in love as could have been desired for stage effect and rather more than was necessary for propriety all mrs beaumonts art therefore was exerted to throw a veil of becoming delicacy over what might have been too glaring by hiding half to improve the whole where there was any want of management on the part of her young coadjutrix she with exquisite skill made advantage even of these errors by look and sighs that implied almost as emphatically as words could have said to her son you see what i told you is too true the simple creature has not art enough to conceal her passion she is undone in the eyes of the world if you do not confirm what report has said this she left to work its natural effect upon the vanity of man and in the midst of these multiplied manoeuvres mrs beaumont sat with ease and unconcern sometimes talking to one sometimes to another so that a stranger would have thought her a party uninterested in all that was going forward and might have wondered at her blindness or indifference but alas notwithstanding her utmost art she failed this day in turning and twisting sir john hunters conversation and character so as to make them agreeable to mr palmer this she knew by his retiring at an early hour at night as he sometimes did when company was not agreeable to him his age gave him this privilege mrs beaumont followed to inquire if he would not wish to take something before he went to rest by st george madam beaumont you are right said mr palmer you are right in not liking this baronet im tired of him sick of him cant like him sorry for it since amelia likes him but what can a daughter of colonel beaumont find in this man to be pleased with he is a baronet to be sure but that is all tell me my good madam what it is the girl likes in him mrs beaumont could only answer by an equivocal smile and a shrug that seemed to say theres no accounting for these things but my dear madam pursued mr palmer the man is neither handsome nor young he is old enough for her father though he gives himself the airs of a youngster and his manners are i can allow for fashionable manners but madam it is his character i dont like selfish cold designing not a generous thought not a good feeling about him you are right madam quite right in all his conversation such meanness and even in what he means for wit such a contempt of what is fair and honourable now that fellow does not believe that such a thing as virtue or patriotism honour or friendship exists the jackanapes and as for love why madam im convinced he is no more in love with the girl than i am nor so much maam nor half so much does not feel her merit does not value her accomplishments does not madam madam he is thinking of nothing but himself and her fortune fortune fortune fortune thats all the mans a miser madam they that know no better fancy that there are none but old misers but i can tell them there are young misers and middle aged misers and misers of all ages they say such a man cant be a miser because he is a spendthrift but madam you know a man can be both yes and thats what many of your young men of fashion are and what ill engage this fellow is and can amelia like him my poor child and does she think he loves her my poor poor child how can she be so blind but love is always blind they say ive a great mind to take her to task and ask her between ourselves what it is she likes in her baronet oh my dear sir she would sink to the centre of the earth if you were to speak for heavens sake dont take her to task foolish as she is besides she would be so angry with me for telling you angry the gipsy am not i her godfather and her guardian though i could not act because i was abroad yet her guardian i was left by her father and love her too as well as i should a daughter of her fathers and she to have secrets and mysteries that would be worse than all the rest for mysteries are what i abhor madam wherever there are secrets and mysteries in a family take my word for it there is somethings wrong true my dear sir but amelia has no idea of mysteries or art i only meant that young girls you know will be ashamed on these occasions and we must make allowances so do not speak to her i conjure you well madam you are her mother and must know best i have only her interest at heart but i wont speak to her since it will so distress her but what shall be done about this lover you are quite right about him and i have not a word more to say but i declare i think you judge him too harshly though i am not inclined to be his friend yet i must do him the justice to say he has more good qualities than you allow or rather than you have seen yet he is passionately fond of amelia oh there youre wrong quite wrong he is passionately in love whatever he may pretend to the contrary pretend and why should the puppy pretend not to be in love pride pride and fashion young men are so governed by fashion and so afraid of ridicule theres a set of fashionables now with whom love is a bore you know i know no indeed i know no such thing said mr palmer but this i know that i hate pretences of all sorts and if the man is in love i should for my part like him the better for showing it so he will when you know him a little better you are quite a stranger and he is bashful bashful never saw so confident a man in any country but he is shy under all that under but i dont like characters where every thing is under something different from what appears at top well take a day or two more to study him though i am his enemy i must deal fairly by him for poor amelias sake you are a good mother madam an indulgent mother and i honour and love you for it ill follow your example and bear with this spendthrift miser coxcomb sprig of quality for a day or two more and try to like him for amelias sake but if hes not worthy of her he shant have her by st george he shall not shall he madam oh no no good night my good sir what the manoeuvres of the next day might have effected and how far sir john hunter profited by the new instructions which were given to him in consequence of this conversation can never be accurately ascertained because the whole united plan of operations was disturbed by a new and unforeseen event chapter viii un volto senza senno un petto senza core un cor senz alma un alma senza fede guarini heres glorious news of captain walsingham cried young beaumont i always knew he would distinguish himself if he had an opportunity and thank god he has had as fine an opportunity as heart could wish here mother here mr palmer is an account of it in this days paper and here is a letter from himself which mr walsingham has just sent me oh give me the letter cried mrs beaumont with affected eagerness let me have the paper then cried mr palmer where are my spectacles are there any letters for me said sir john hunter did my newspapers come albina i desired that they should be forwarded here mrs beaumont can you tell me any thing of my papers dear amelia how interesting your brother looks when he is pleased albina whispered quite loud enough to be heard a most gallant action by st george exclaimed mr palmer these are the things that keep up the honour of the british navy and the glory of britain this spanish ship that captain walsingham captured the day after the engagement is likely to turn out a valuable prize too said mrs beaumont i am vastly glad to find this by his letter for the money will be useful to him he wanted it so much he does not say how much his share will come to does he edward no maam you see he writes in a great hurry and he has only time as he says to mention the needful and is not the money the needful said sir john hunter with a splenetic smile with walsingham it is only a secondary consideration replied beaumont honour is captain walsinghams first object i dare say he has never yet calculated what his prize money will be right right reiterated mr palmer then he is the right sort long may it be before our naval officers think more of prize money than of glory long may it be before our honest tars turn into calculating pirates they never will or can whilst they have such officers as captain walsingham said beaumont by st george he seems to be a fine fellow and you a warm friend said mr palmer ay ay the colonels own son but why have i never seen any of these walsinghams since i came to the country are they ashamed of being related to me because i am a merchant more likely they are too proud to pay court to you because you are so rich said mr beaumont but they did come to see you sir the morning you were out so late mother you know oh ay true how unfortunate but have not we horses have not we carriages have not we legs said mr palmer ill go and see these walsinghams to morrow please god i live so long for i am proud of my relationship to this young hero and i wont be cast off by good people let them be as proud as they will thats their fault but i will not stand on idle ceremony so my good mistress beaumont we will all go in a body and storm their castle to morrow morning an admirable plan i like it of all things said mrs beaumont how few even in youth are so active and enthusiastic as our good friend but my dear mr palmer but i wish i could see the captain himself is there any chance of his coming home home yes said beaumont did you not read his letter sir here it is he will be at home directly he says perhaps a few hours after this letter reaches you youll see me see him odds my life im glad of it and you my little amelia said mr palmer tapping her shoulders as she stood with her back to him reading the newspaper and you my little silent one not one word have i heard from you all this time does not some spark of your fathers spirit kindle within you on hearing of this heroic relation of ours luckily for the ladies sir said sir john hunter coming up as he thought to the ladys assistance luckily for young ladies sir they are not called upon to be heroes and it would be luckier still for us men if they never set themselves up for heroines ha ha ha miss beaumont continued he the shower is over ill order the horses out that we may have our ride sir john left the room evidently pleased with his own wit amelia my love said mrs beaumont who drew up also to give assistance at this critical juncture go this moment and write a note to your friend miss walsingham to say that we shall all be with them early to morrow i will send a servant directly that we may be sure to meet with them at home this time youll find pen ink and paper in my dressing room love mrs beaumont drew amelias arm within hers and dictating kindest messages for the walsinghams led her out of the room having thus successfully covered her daughters retreat our skilful manoeuvrer returned all self complacent to the company and next to please the warm hearted mr palmer she seemed to sympathize in his patriotic enthusiasm for the british navy she pronounced a panegyric on the young hero captain walsingham which made the good old man rub his hands with exultation and which irradiated with joy the countenance of her son but alas mrs beaumonts endeavours to please or rather to dupe all parties could not even with her consummate address always succeed though she had an excellent memory and great presence of mind with peculiar quickness both of eye and ear yet she could not always register arrange and recollect all that was necessary for the various parts she undertook to act scarcely had she finished her eulogium on captain walsingham when to her dismay she saw close behind her sir john hunter who had entered the room without her perceiving it he said not one word but his clouded brow showed his suspicions and his extreme displeasure mrs beaumont said he after some minutes silence i find i must have the honour of wishing you a good morning for i have an indispensable engagement at home to dinner to day i thought sir john you and amelia were going to ride maam miss beaumont does not choose to ride she told me so this instant as i passed her on the stairs oh dont disturb her i beg she is writing to miss walsingham i have the honour to wish you a good morning maam well if you are determined to go let me say three words to you in the music room sir john though added she in a whisper intended to be heard by mr palmer i know you do not look upon me as your friend yet depend upon it i shall treat you and all the world with perfect candour sir john though sulky could not avoid following the lady and as soon as she had shut all the doors and double doors of the music room she exclaimed it is always best to speak openly to ones friends now my dear sir john hunter how can you be so childish as to take ill of me what i really was forced to say for your interest about captain walsingham to mr palmer you know old palmer is the oddest most self willed man imaginable humour and please him i must the few days he is with me you know he goes on tuesday thats decided dr wheeler has seen him has talked to him about his health and it is absolutely necessary that he should return to the west indies then he is perfectly determined to leave all he has to amelia yes maam but how am i sure of being the better for that interrupted sir john whose decided selfishness was a match for mrs beaumonts address because it went without scruple or ceremony straight to his object for maam you cant think im such a fool as not to see that mr palmer wishes me at the devil miss beaumont gives me no encouragement and you maam i know are too good a politician to offend mr palmer so if he declares in favour of this young hero captain walsingham i may quit the field but you dont consider that mr palmers young hero has never made any proposal for amelia pshaw maam but i know as well as you do that he likes her and propose he will for her now that he has money granting that you forget that all this takes time and that palmer will be gone to the west indies before they can bring out their proposal and as soon as he is gone and has left his will as he means to do with me you and i have the game in our own hands it is very extraordinary to me that you do not seem to understand my play though i explained the whole to albina and i thought she had made you comprehend the necessity for my seeming for this one week to be less your friend than i could wish because of your title and that odd whim of palmer you know but i am sure we understand one another now excuse me said the invincible sir john i confess mrs beaumont you have so much more abilities and finesse and all that sort of thing than i have that i cannot help being afraid of of not understanding the business rightly in business there is nothing like understanding one another and going on sure grounds there has been so much going backwards and forwards and explanations and manoeuvres that i am not clear how it is nor do i feel secure even that i have the honour of your approbation what not when i have assured you of it sir john in the most unequivocal manner it was singular that the only person to whom in this affair mrs beaumont spoke the real truth should not believe her sir john hunter continued obstinately suspicious and incredulous he had just heard that his uncle wigram his rich uncle wigram was taken ill and not likely to recover this intelligence had also reached mrs beaumont and she was anxious to secure the baronet and the wigram fortune for her daughter but nothing she could say seemed to satisfy him that she was not double dealing at last to prove to him her sincerity she gave him what he required and what alone he said could make his mind easy could bring him to make up his mind a written assurance of her approbation of his addresses to amelia with this he was content for said he what is written remains and there can be no misunderstandings in future or changing of minds it was agreed between these confidential friends that sir john should depart as it were displeased and she begged that he would not return till mr palmer should have left the country now there was a numerous tribe of hangers on who were in the habit of frequenting beaumont park whom mrs beaumont loved to see at her house because besides making her feel her own importance they were frequently useful to carry on the subordinate parts of her perpetual manoeuvres among these secondary personages who attended mrs beaumont abroad to increase her consequence in the eyes of common spectators and who at home filled the stage and added to the bustle and effect her chief favourites were mr twigg the same gentleman who was deputed to decide upon the belt or the screen and captain lightbody mr twigg was the most elegant flatterer of the two but captain lightbody was the most assured and upon the whole made his way the best he was a handsome man had a good address could tell a good story sing a good song and make things go off well when there was company so that he was a prodigious assistance to the mistress of the house then he danced with the young ladies when they had no other partners he mounted guard regularly beside the piano forte or the harp when the ladies were playing and at dinner it was always the etiquette for him to sit beside miss beaumont or miss hunter when the gentlemen guests were not such as mrs beaumont thought entitled to that honour or such as she deemed safe companions these arrangements imply that captain lightbody thought himself in mrs beaumonts confidence and so he was to a certain degree just enough to flatter him into doing her high or low behests whenever she had a report to circulate or to contradict captain lightbody was put in play and no man could be better calculated for this purpose both from his love of talking and of locomotion he galloped about from place to place and from one great house to another knew all the lords and ladies and generals and colonels and brigade majors and aides de camp in the land could any mortal be better qualified to fetch and carry news for mrs beaumont besides news it was his office to carry compliments and to speed the intercourse not perhaps from soul to soul but from house to house which is necessary in a visiting country to keep up the character of an agreeable neighbour did mrs beaumont forget to send a card of invitation or neglect to return a visit lightbody was to set it to rights for her lightbody the ready bearer of pretty notes the maker always the fabricator sometimes of the civilest speeches imaginable this expert speechifier this ever idle ever busy scamperer our heroine dispatched to engage a neighbouring family to pay her a morning visit the next day just about the time which was fixed for her going to see the walsinghams the usual caution was given pray lightbody do not let my name be used do not let me be mentioned but take it upon yourself and say as if from yourself that you have reason to believe i take it ill that they have not been here lately and then you can mention the hour that would be most convenient but let me have nothing to do with it i must not appear in it on any account in consequence of captain lightbodys faithful execution of his secret instructions a barouche full of morning visitors drove to the door just at the time when mrs beaumont had proposed to set out for walsingham house mrs beaumont with a well dissembled look of vexation exclaimed as she looked out of the window at the carriage how provoking who can these people be i hope martin will say i am not at home ring ring amelia oh its too late they have seen me and martin stupid creature has let them in mr palmer was much discomfited and grew more and more impatient when these troublesome visitors protracted their stay and proposed a walk to see some improvements in the grounds but my good mistress beaumont said he you know we are engaged to our cousin walsingham this morning and if you will give me leave i will go on before you with mr beaumont and we can say what detains you disconcerted by this simple determination of this straight forward plain spoken old gentleman mrs beaumont saw that farther delay on her part would be not only inefficacious but dangerous she now was eager to be relieved from the difficulties which she had herself contrived she would not for any consideration have trusted mr palmer to pay this visit without her therefore by an able counter movement she extricated herself not only without loss but with advantage from this perilous situation she made a handsome apology to her visitors for being obliged to run away from them she would leave amelia to have the pleasure of showing them the grounds mrs beaumont was irresistible in her arrangements amelia disappointed and afraid to show how deeply she felt the disappointment was obliged to stay to do the honours of beaumont park whilst her mother drove off rejoicing in half the success at least of her stratagem but even as a politician she used upon every occasion too much artifice it was said of cardinal mazarin he is a great politician but in all his politics there is one capital defect cest quil veut toujours tromper how tiresome those people were i thought we never should have got away from them said mrs beaumont what possessed them to come this morning and to pay such a horrid long visit besides those duttons at all times are the most stupid creatures upon the face of the earth i cannot endure them so awkward and ill bred too and yet of a good family who could think it they are people one must see but they are absolutely insufferable insufferable said mr palmer why my good madam then you have the patience of a martyr for you suffered them so patiently that i never should have guessed you suffered at all i protest i thought they were friends and favourites of yours and that you were very glad to see them well well tis the way of the world continued mr palmer this sort of what do you call it double dealing about visitors goes on every where madam beaumont but how do i know that when i go away you may not be as glad to get rid of me as you were to get away from these duttons added he in a tone of forced jocularity how do i know but that the minute my back is turned you may not begin to take me to pieces in my turn and say that old palmer he was the most tiresome humoursome strange old fashioned fellow i thought we should never have got rid of him my dear dear sir how can you speak in such a manner cried mrs beaumont who had made several vain attempts to interrupt this speech you who are our best friend is it possible you could suspect is there no difference to be made between friends and common acquaintance i am sure i hope there is said mr palmer smiling there was something so near the truth in mr palmers raillery that mrs beaumont could not take it with as much easy unconcern as the occasion required especially in the presence of her son who maintained a provoking silence unhappy indeed are those who cannot in such moments of distress in their own families and in their nearest connexions find any relief from their embarrassments and who look round in vain for one to be responsible for their sincerity mrs beaumont sat uneasy and almost disconcerted mr palmer felt for his snuff box his usual consolation but it was not in his pocket he had left it on his table now mrs beaumont was relieved for she had something to do and something to say with her wonted politeness in spite of all remonstrance from mr palmer her man martin was sent back for the snuff box and conjectures about his finding it and his being able to overtake them before they arrived at walsingham house supplied conversation for a mile or two heres martin coming back full gallop i vow said miss hunter who could also talk on this topic come come my good lady said mr palmer taking the moment when the young lady had turned her back as she stretched out of the carriage for the pleasure of seeing martin gallop come come my good mrs beaumont shake hands and be friends and hang the duttons i did not mean to vex you by what i said i am not so polite as i should be i know and you perhaps are a little too polite but that is no great harm especially in a woman martin and the snuff box came up at this instant and all was apparently as well as ever yet mrs beaumont who valued a reputation for sincerity as much as chartres valued a reputation for honesty and nearly upon the same principle was seriously vexed that even this transient light had been let in upon her real character to such accidents duplicity is continually subject chapter ix led by simplicity divine she pleased and never tried to shine she gave to chance each unschoold feature and left her cause to sense and nature more arrived at walsingham park they met miss walsingham walking at some distance from the house is captain walsingham come was the first question asked no but expected every hour that he had not actually arrived was a comfortable reprieve to mrs beaumont breathing more freely and in refreshed spirits she prepared to alight from her carriage to walk to the house with miss walsingham as mr palmer proposed miss hunter who was dressed with uncommon elegance remonstrated in favour of her delicate slippers not that she named the real object of her solicitude no she had not spent so much time with mrs beaumont that great mistress of the art of apologizing without learning at least the inferior practices of the trade of course she had all the little common arts of excuse ever ready and instead of saying that she did not like to walk because she was afraid to spoil her shoes she protested she was afraid of the heat and could not walk so far but mr beaumont had jumped out of the carriage and mrs beaumont did not wish that he should walk home tte tte with miss walsingham therefore miss hunters remonstrances were of no avail my love you will not be heated for our walk is through this charming shady grove and if you are tired heres my son will give you his arm satisfied with this arrangement the young lady thus supported found it possible to walk mr palmer walked his own pace looking round at the beauties of the place and desiring that nobody might mind him this was his way and mrs beaumont never teased him with talking to him when he did not seem to be in the humour for it she who made something of every thing began to manage the conversation with her other companions during the walk so as to favour her views upon the several parties pursuing her principle that love is in mens minds generally independent of esteem and believing that her son might be rendered afraid of the superiority of miss walsinghams understanding mrs beaumont took treacherous pains to draw her out starting from chance seemingly as she well knew how a subject of debate she went from talking of the late marriage of some neighbouring couple to discuss a question on which she believed that miss walsinghams opinion would differ from that of her son the point was whether a wife should or should not have pin money miss walsingham thought that a wifes accepting it would tend to establish a separate interest between married people mr beaumont on the contrary was of opinion that a wifes having a separate allowance would prevent disputes so miss hunter thought of course for she had been prepared to be precisely of mr beaumonts opinion but reasons she had none in its support indeed she said with a pretty simper she thought that women had nothing to do with reason or reasoning that she thought a woman who really loved any body was always of that persons opinion and especially in a wife she did not see of what use reasoning and all that could be except to make a woman contradict and be odd and fond of ruling that for her part she had no pretensions to any understanding and if she had ever so much she should be glad she declared upon her honour to get rid of it if she could for what use could it possibly be of to her when it must be the husbands understanding that must always judge and rule and a wife ought only to obey and be always of the opinion of the man of her choice having thus made her profession of folly in broken sentences with pretty confusion and all becoming graces she leaned upon mr beaumonts arm with a bewitching air of languid delicacy that solicited support mrs beaumont suppressing a sigh which however she took care that her son should hear turned to miss walsingham and in a whisper owned that she could not help loving abilities and spirit too even in her own sex then she observed aloud that much might be urged on her side of the question with regard to pin money for not only as miss walsingham justly said it might tend to make a separate interest between husband and wife but the wife would probably be kept in total ignorance of her husbands affairs and that in some cases might be very disadvantageous as some women are more capable from their superior understanding of managing every thing than most men indeed than any man she could name even under favour of this pretty compliment which was plainly directed by a glance of mrs beaumonts eye miss walsingham would not accept of this painful pre eminence she explained and made it clear that she had not any ambition to rule or manage that i can readily believe said mr beaumont for i have observed that it is not always the women who are the most able to decide who are the most ambitious to govern this observation either was not heard or was not understood by miss hunter whose whole soul was occupied in settling some fold of her drapery but mr beaumonts speech had its full effect on mrs beaumont who bit her lip and looked reproachfully at her son as if she thought this an infringement of his promised truce a moment afterwards she felt the imprudence of her own reproachful look and was sensible that she would have done better not to have fixed the opinion or feeling in her sons mind by noticing it thus with displeasure recovering herself for she never was disconcerted for more than half a minute she passed on with easy grace to discuss the merits of the heroine of some new novel an historic novel which gave her opportunity of appealing to miss walsingham on some disputed points of history she dexterously attempted to draw her well informed young friend into a display of literature which might alarm mr beaumont his education had in some respects been shamefully neglected for his mother had calculated that ignorance would ensure dependence he had endeavoured to supply at a late period of his education the defects of its commencement but he was sensible that he had not supplied all his deficiencies and he was apt to feel with painful impatient sensibility his inferiority whenever literary subjects were introduced miss walsingham however was so perfectly free from all the affectation and vanity of a bel esprit that she did not alarm even those who were inferior to her in knowledge their self complacency instead of being depressed by the comparison of their attainments with hers was insensibly raised by the perception that notwithstanding these she could take pleasure in their conversation could appreciate their good sense or originality of thought without recurring to the authority of books or of great names in fact her mind had never been overwhelmed by a wasteful torrent of learning that the stream of literature had passed over it was apparent only from its fertility mrs beaumont repented of having drawn her into conversation indeed our heroine had trusted too much to some expressions which had at times dropped from her son about learned ladies and certain conversaziones she had concluded that he would never endure literature in a wife but she now perceived her mistake she discerned it too late and at this moment she was doubly vexed for she saw miss hunter produce herself in most disadvantageous contrast to her rival in conformity to instructions which mrs beaumont had secretly given her not to show too much sense or learning because gentlemen in general and in particular mr beaumont disliked it this young lady now professed absolute ignorance and incapacity upon all subjects and meaning to have an air of pretty childish innocence or timidity really made herself appear quite like a simpleton at the same time a tinge of ineffectual malice and envy appeared through her ill feigned humility she could give no opinion of any book oh she would not give any judgment for the whole world she did not think herself qualified to speak even if she had read the book which indeed she had not for really she never read she was not a reading lady as miss hunter had no portion of mrs beaumonts quick penetration she did not see the unfavourable impression these words made certain that she was following exactly her secret instructions she was confident of being in the right line so on she went whilst mrs beaumont sighed in vain and miss walsingham who now saw and understood her whole play almost smiled at the comic of the scene o dear mrs beaumont continued miss hunter how can you ever appeal to me about books and those sorts of things when you know i know nothing about the matter for mercys sake never do so any more for you know ive no taste for those sorts of things and besides i own even if i could i should so hate to be thought a blue stocking i would not have the least bit of blue in my stockings for the whole world id rather have any other colour black white red green yellow any other colour so i own im not sorry im not what they call a genius for though genius to be sures a very fascinating sort of thing in gentlemen yet in women it is not so becoming i think especially in ladies it does very well on the stage and for artists and so on but really now in company i think its an awkward thing and would make one look so odd now mr beaumont i must tell you an anecdote stop my dear miss hunter your ear ring is coming out stay let me clasp it love exclaimed mrs beaumont determined to stop her in the career of nonsense by giving her sensations since she could not give her ideas a new turn oh maam maam oh my ear you are killing me dearest mrs beaumont pinching me to death maam did i pinch my dear it was the hinge of the ear ring i suppose i dont know what it was but heres blood i declare my love i beg you a thousand pardons how could i be so awkward but why could not you for one moment hold your little head still miss walsingham applied a patch to the wound such a pretty ear as it is continued mrs beaumont i am sure it was a pity to hurt it you really did hurt it said mr beaumont in a tone of compassion oh horridly cried miss hunter and i that always faint at the sight of blood afraid that the young lady would again spoil her part in the acting and lose all the advantages which might result from the combined effect of the pretty ear and of compassion mrs beaumont endeavoured to take off her attention from the wound by attacking her ear rings my love said she dont wear these ear rings any more for i assure you there is no possibility of shutting or opening them without hurting you this expedient however nearly proved fatal in its consequences miss hunter entered most warmly into the defence of her ear rings and appealed to mr beaumont to confirm her decision that they were the prettiest and best ear rings in the world unluckily they did not particularly suit his fancy and the young lady who had but half an hour before professed that she could never be of a different opinion in any thing from that of the man she loved now pettishly declared that she could not and would not give up her taste incensed still more by a bow of submission but not of conviction from mr beaumont she went on regardless of her dearest mrs beaumonts frowns and vehemently maintained her judgment quoting with triumphant volubility innumerable precedents of ladies who had just bought the very same ear rings and whose taste she believed nobody would dispute mr beaumont had seen enough now and upon many other occasions to be convinced that it is not on matters of consequence that ladies are apt to grow most angry and he stood confirmed in his belief that those who in theory professed to have such a humble opinion of their own abilities that they cannot do or understand any thing useful are often in practice the most prone to insist upon the infallibility of their taste and judgment mrs beaumont who saw with one glance of her quick eye what passed at this moment in her sons mind sighed and said to herself how impossible to manage a fool who ravels as fast as one weaves the web of her fortune yet though mrs beaumont perceived and acknowledged the impracticability of managing a fool for a single hour it was one of the favourite objects of her manoeuvres to obtain this very fool for a daughter in law with the hope of governing her for life so inconsistent are cunning people even of the best abilities so ill do they calculate the value of their ultimate objects however ingeniously they devise their means or adapt them to their ends during this walk mr palmer had taken no part in the conversation he had seemed engrossed with his own thoughts or occupied with observing the beauties of the place tired with her walk for mrs beaumont always complained of being fatigued when she was vexed thus at once concealing her vexation and throwing the faults of her mind upon her body she stretched herself upon a sofa as soon as she reached the house nor did she recover from her exhausted state till she cast her eyes upon a tamborine which she knew would afford means of showing miss hunters figure and graces to advantage slight as this resource may seem mrs beaumont well knew that slighter still have often produced great effects soon afterward she observed her son smile repeatedly as he read a passage in some book that lay upon the table and she had the curiosity to take up the book when he turned away she found that it was cumberlands memoirs and saw the following little poem marked with reiterated lines of approbation why affectation why this mock grimace go silly thing and hide that simpring face thy lisping prattle and thy mincing gait all thy false mimic fooleries i hate for thou art follys counterfeit and she who is right foolish hath the better plea natures true idiot i prefer to thee why that soft languish why that drawling tone art sick art sleepy get thee hence begone i laugh at all thy pretty baby tears those fluttrings faintings and unreal fears can they deceive us can such mummries move touch us with pity or inspire with love no affectation vain is all thy art those eyes may wander over evry part theyll never find their passage to the heart why affectation why this mock grimace go silly thing and hide that simpring face thy lisping prattle and thy mincing gait all thy false mimic fooleries i hate for thou art follys counterfeit and she who is right foolish hath the better plea natures true idiot i prefer to thee why that soft languish why that drawling tone art sick art sleepy get thee hence begone i laugh at all thy pretty baby tears those fluttrings faintings and unreal fears can they deceive us can such mummries move touch us with pity or inspire with love no affectation vain is all thy art those eyes may wander over evry part theyll never find their passage to the heart mrs beaumont the moment she had read these lines perceived why her son had smiled the portrait seemed really to have been drawn from miss hunter and the lines were so propos to the scene which had just passed during the walk that it was impossible to avoid the application mrs beaumont shut the book hastily as her dear albina approached for she was afraid that the young lady would have known her own picture so few people however even of those much wiser than miss hunter know themselves that she need not have been alarmed but she had no longer leisure to devote her thoughts to this subject for mr walsingham who had been out riding had by this time returned and the moment he entered the room mrs beaumonts attention was directed to him and to mr palmer she introduced them to each other with many expressions of regret that they should not sooner have met characters that are free from artifice immediately coalesce as metals that are perfectly pure can be readily cemented together mr palmer and mr walsingham were intimate in half an hour there was an air of openness and sincerity about mr walsingham a freedom and directness in his conversation which delighted mr palmer i am heartily glad we have met at last my good cousin walsingham said he very sorry should i have been to have left the country without becoming acquainted with you and now i wish your gallant captain was arrived i am to set off the day after to morrow and i am sadly afraid i shall miss seeing him mr walsingham said that as they expected him every hour he hoped mr palmer would persuade mrs beaumont to spend the day at walsingham house mrs beaumont dared not object on the contrary it was now her policy to pretend the fondest friendship for all the walsingham family yet all the time pursuing her plan of preventing mr palmer from discerning their real characters and superior merit she managed with great dexterity to keep the conversation as much as possible upon general topics and tried to prevent mr palmer from being much alone with mr walsingham for she dreaded their growing intimacy after dinner however when the ladies retired the gentlemen drew their chairs close together and had a great deal of conversation on interesting subjects the most interesting was captain walsingham mr palmer earnestly desired to hear the particulars of his history and from whom said young beaumont turning to mr walsingham can he hear them better than from captain walsinghams guardian and friend chapter x yet never seaman more serenely brave led britains conquering squadrons oer the wave friends are not always the best biographers said mr walsingham but i will try to be impartial my wards first desire to be a sailor was excited as he has often since told me by reading robinson crusoe when he was scarcely thirteen he went out in the resolute a frigate under the command of captain campbell campbell was an excellent officer and very strict in all that related to order and discipline it was his principle and his practice never to forgive a first offence by which the number of second faults was considerably diminished my ward was not much pleased at first with his captain but he was afterwards convinced that this strictness was what made a man of him he was buffeted about and shown the rough of life made to work hard and submit to authority to reason he was always ready to yield and by degrees he learned that his first duty as a sailor was implicit obedience in due time he was made lieutenant in this situation his mixed duties of command and obedience were difficult because his first lieutenant the captains son was jealous of him walsingham found it a more difficult task to win the confidence of the son than it had been to earn the friendship of the father his punctuality in obeying orders and his respectful manner to the lieutenant availed but little for young campbell still viewed him with scornful yet with jealous eyes imagining that he only wanted to show himself the better officer of the falsehood of these suspicions walsingham had at last an opportunity of giving unquestionable proof it happened one day that lieutenant campbell impatient at seeing a sailor doing some work awkwardly on the outside of the vessel snatched the rope from his hand and swore he would do it himself in his hurry campbell missed his footing and fell overboard he could not swim walsingham had the presence of mind to order the ship to be put about and plunged instantly into the water to save his rival with much exertion he reached campbell supported him till the boat was lowered down and got him safe aboard again just like himself cried young beaumont all he ever wanted was opportunity to show his soul the first lieutenants jealousy was now changed into gratitude continued mr walsingham and from this time forward instead of suffering from that petty rivalship by which he used to be obstructed walsingham enjoyed the entire confidence of young campbell this good understanding between him and his brother officer not only made their every day lives pleasant but in times of difficulty secured success for three years that they lived together after this period and during which time they were ordered to every quarter of the globe they never had the slightest dispute either in the busiest or the idlest times at length in some engagement with a dutch ship the particulars of which i forget lieutenant campbell was mortally wounded his last words were walsingham comfort my father that was no easy task stern as captain campbell seemed the loss of his son was irreparable he never shed a tear when he was told it was all over but said gods will be done and turning into his cabin desired to be left alone half an hour afterwards he sent for walsingham who found him quite calm we must see and do our duty together to the last said he he exerted himself strenuously and to all outward appearance was as the sailors said the same man as ever but walsingham who knew him better saw that his heart was broken and that he wished for nothing but an honourable death one morning as he was on deck looking through his glass he called to walsingham your eyes are better than mine said he look here and tell me do you see yonder sail shes french le magnanime frigate if im not mistaken yes said walsingham i know her by the patch in her main sail well give her something to do said campbell though shes so much our superior please god before the suns over our heads you shall have her in tow walsingham we shall i trust said walsingham perhaps not we for i own i wish to fall said campbell you are first lieutenant now i cant leave my men under better command and i hope the admiralty will give you the ship if you give it to his majesty then turning to the sailors captain campbell addressed them with a countenance unusually cheerful and after a few words of encouragement gave orders to clear decks for action walsingham youll see to every thing whilst i step down to write he wrote as it was afterwards found two letters both concerning walsinghams interests the frigate with which they had to engage was indeed far superior to them in force but campbell trusted to the good order and steadiness as well as to the courage of his men the action was long and obstinate twice the english attempted to board the enemy and twice were repulsed the third time just as captain campbell had seized hold of the french colours which hung in rags over the side of the enemys ship he received a wound in his breast fell back into walsinghams arms and almost instantly expired the event of this day was different from what campbell had expected for le succs of fifty guns appeared in sight and after a desperate engagement with her in which walsingham was severely wounded and every other officer on board killed or wounded walsingham saw that nothing was left but to make a wanton sacrifice of the remainder of his crew or to strike after a contest of six hours he struck to le succs perfect silence on his deck a loud and insulting shout from the enemy no sooner had walsingham struck than la force the captain of le succs hailed him and ordered him to come in his own boat and to deliver his sword walsingham replied that his sword so demanded should never be delivered but with his life the frenchman did not think proper to persist but soon after sent his lieutenant on board the resolute where the men were found at their quarters with lighted matches in their hands ready to be as good as their word la force the captain of le succs was a sailor of fortune who had risen by chance not merit ay ay interrupted mr palmer so i thought and there was no great merit or glory either in a french fifty gun taking an english frigate after standing a six hours contest with another ship well my dear sir what became of poor walsingham how did this rascally frenchman treat his prisoners scandalously cried beaumont and yet walsingham is so generous that he will never let me damn the nation for what he says was only the fault of an individual who disgraced it well let me hear and judge for myself said mr palmer la force carried the resolute in triumph into a french port continued mr walsingham vain of displaying his prisoners he marched them up the country under pretence that they would not be safe in a sea port cambray was the town in which they were confined walsingham found the officers of the garrison very civil to him at first but when they saw that he was not fond of high play and that he declined being of their parties at billiards and vingt un they grew tired of him for without these resources they declared they should perish with ennui in a country town even under the penalty of losing all society walsingham resisted every temptation to game and submitted to live with the strictest economy rather than to run in debt but did you never send him any money or did not he get your remittances said mr palmer my dear sir by some delays of letters we did not hear for two months where he was imprisoned and he was reduced to the greatest distress pursued beaumont for he had shared all he had to the utmost farthing with his poor fellow prisoners like a true british sailor said mr palmer well sir i hope he contrived to make his escape no for he would not break his parole said beaumont his parole i did not know he was on his parole said mr palmer then certainly he could not break it he had two tempting opportunities i can assure you said beaumont one offered by the commandants lady who was not insensible to his merit the other by the gratitude of some poor servant whom he had obliged mr walsingham can tell you all the particulars no i need not detail the circumstances it is enough to tell you sir that he withstood the temptations would not break his parole and remained four months a prisoner in cambray like the officers of the garrison he should have drunk or gamed or else he must have died of vexation he says if he had not fortunately had a taste for reading and luckily procured books from a good old priests library at the end of four months the garrison of cambray was changed and instead of a set of dissipated officers there came a well conducted regiment under the command of m de villars an elderly officer of sense and discretion an excellent man cried beaumont i love him with all my soul though i never saw him but i beg your pardon for interrupting you mr walsingham a prattling hairdresser at cambray first prepossessed m de villars in walsinghams favour by relating a number of anecdotes intended to throw abuse and ridicule upon the english captain to convict him of misanthropy and economy of having had his hair dressed but twice since he came to cambray of never having frequented the society of madame la marquise de marsillac the late commandants lady for more than a fortnight after his arrival and of having actually been detected in working with his own hand with smiths and carpenters tools upon the strength of the hairdressers information m de villars paid the english captain a visit was pleased by his conversation and by all that he observed of his conduct and character as m de villars was going down stairs after having spent an evening with walsingham a boy of twelve years old the son of the master of the lodging house equipped in a military uniform stood across the landing place as if determined to stop him mon petit militaire said the commandant do you mean to dispute my passage non mon gnral said the boy i know my duty too well but i post myself here to demand an audience for i have a secret of importance to communicate m de villars smiling at the boys air of consequence yet pleased with the steady earnestness of his manner took him by the hand into an antechamber and said that he was ready to listen to whatever he had to impart the boy then told him that he had accidentally overheard a proposal which had been made to facilitate the english captains escape and that the captain refused to comply with it because it was not honourable to break his parole the boy who had been struck by the circumstance and who besides was grateful to walsingham for some little instances of kindness spoke with much enthusiasm in his favour and as m de villars afterwards repeated finished his speech by exclaiming i would give every thing i have in the world except my sword and my honour to procure this english captain his liberty m de villars was pleased with the boys manner and with the fact which he related so much so that he promised that if walsinghams liberty could be obtained he would procure it and you my good little friend shall if i succeed added he have the pleasure of being the first to tell him the good news some days afterwards the boy burst into walsinghams room exclaiming liberty liberty you are at liberty he danced and capered with such wild joy that it was some time before walsingham could obtain any explanation or could prevail on him to let him look at a letter which he held in his hand flourishing it about in triumph at last he showed that it was an order from m de villars for the release of captain walsingham and of all the english prisoners belonging to the resolute for whom exchanges had been effected no favour could be granted in a manner more honourable to all the parties concerned walsingham arrived in england without any farther difficulties thank god said mr palmer well now he has touched english ground again i have some hopes for him what next the first thing he did of course was to announce his return to the admiralty a court martial was held at portsmouth and fortunately for him was composed of officers of the highest distinction so that the first men in his profession became thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances of his conduct the enthusiasm with which his men bore testimony in his favour was gratifying to his feelings and the minutes of the evidence were most honourable to him the court pronounced that lieutenant walsingham had done all that could be effected by the most gallant and judicious officer in the defence of his majestys ship resolute the ministry who had employed captain campbell were no longer in place and one of the lords of the admiralty at this time happened to have had some personal quarrel with him a few days after the trial walsingham was at a public dinner at which campbells character became the subject of conversation walsingham was warned in a whisper that the first lord of the admiraltys private secretary was present and was advised to be prudent but walsinghams prudence was not of that sort which can coolly hear a worthy mans memory damned with faint praise his prudence was not of that sort which can tamely sit by and see a friends reputation in danger with all the warmth and eloquence of friendship he spoke in captain campbells defence and paid a just and energetic tribute of praise to his memory he spoke and not a word more was said against campbell the politicians looked down upon their plates and there was a pause of that sort which sometimes in a company of interested men of the world results from surprise at the imprudent honesty of a good natured novice walsingham as the company soon afterwards broke up heard one gentleman say of him to another as they went away theres a fellow now who has ruined himself without knowing it and all for a dead man it was not without knowing it walsingham was well aware what he hazarded but he was then and ever ready to sacrifice his own interests in the defence of truth and of a friend for two long years afterwards walsingham was in the technical and elegant phrase left on the shelf and the door of promotion was shut against him yes and there he might have remained till now said beaumont if it had not been for that good mr gaspar a clerk in one of their offices a man who though used to live among courtiers and people hackneyed in the political ways of the world was a plain warm hearted friend a man of an upright character who prized integrity and generosity the more because he met with them so seldom but i beg your pardon mr walsingham will you go on and tell mr palmer how and why gaspar served our friend one day walsingham had occasion to go to mr gaspars office to search for some papers relative to certain charts which he had drawn and intended to present to the admiralty in talking of the soundings of some bay he had taken whilst out with captain campbell he mentioned him as he always did with terms of affection and respect mr gaspar immediately asked are you sir that lieutenant walsingham of the resolute who at a public dinner about two years ago made such a disinterested defence of your captain if it is in my power to serve you depend upon it i will leave your charts with me i think i may have an opportunity of turning them to your advantage and that of the service gaspar who was thoroughly in earnest took a happy moment to present walsinghams charts before the admiralty just at a time when they were wanted the admiralty were glad to employ an officer who had some local information and they sent him out in the dreadnought a thirty six gun frigate with captain jemmison to the west indies and what sort of a man was his new captain said mr palmer as unlike his old one as possible said beaumont yes continued mr walsingham in every point except courage captain jemmison was as complete a contrast as could be imagined to captain campbell whatever else he might be jemmison was certainly a man of undaunted courage thats of course if he was a captain in the british navy said mr palmer from his appearance however you would never have taken him for a gallant sailor said mr walsingham abhorring the rough brutal swearing grog drinking tobacco chewing race of sea officers the bens and the mirvans of former times captain jemmison resolving i suppose to avoid their faults went into the contrary extreme of refinement and effeminacy a superlative coxcomb and an epicure more from fashion than taste he gloried in descanting with technical precision on the merits of dishes and of cooks his table even on shipboard was to be equalled in elegance only by his toilet the puppy exclaimed mr palmer and how could captain walsingham go on with such a coxcomb very ill you may be sure said beaumont for walsingham ill answer for it never could conceal or control his feelings of contempt or indignation yet as captain jemmisons lieutenant he always behaved with perfect propriety said mr walsingham and bore with his foppery and impertinence with the patience becoming a subordinate officer to his superior jemmison could not endure a lieutenant whose character and manners were a continual contrast and reproach to his own and he disliked him the more because he could never provoke him to any disrespect jemmison often replied even to walsinghams silent contempt as a french pamphleteer once published a book entitled rponse au silence de m de la motte on some points where duty and principle were concerned walsingham however could not be silent there was a lad of the name of birch on board the dreadnought whom walsingham had taken under his immediate care and whom he was endeavouring to train up in every good habit jemmison to torment walsingham made it his pleasure to counteract him in these endeavours and continually did all he could to spoil birch by foolish indulgence walsinghams indignation was upon these occasions vehement and his captain and he came to frequent quarrels young birch who had sense enough to know which was his true friend one day threw himself on his knees to beseech his lieutenant not to hazard so much on his account and solemnly swore that he would never be guilty of the slightest excess or negligence during the remainder of the voyage the young man was steady to his promise and by his resolution and temper prevented walsingham and his captain from coming to a serious rupture when they arrived at their place of destination jamaica captain jemmison went on shore to divert himself and spent his time in great dissipation at spanish town eating dressing dancing gallanting and glorying in its being observed by all the ladies that he had nothing of a sea captain about him the other officers encouraged by his precept and example left the ship but walsingham stayed on board and had severe duty to perform for he could not allow the crew to go on shore because they got into riots with the townspeople soon after their arrival and even during the course of their voyage he had observed among the sailors something like a disposition to mutiny encouraged probably by the negligence and apparent effeminacy of their captain though they knew him to be a man of intrepidity yet they ridiculed and despised his coxcombry and his relaxation of discipline gave them hopes of succeeding in their mutinous schemes walsingham strongly and repeatedly represented to captain jemmison the danger and remonstrated with him and the other officers upon the imprudence of leaving the ship at this juncture but jemmison in a prettily rounded period protested he saw no penumbra of danger and that till he was called upon by mars he owned he preferred the charms of venus this was vastly elegant but nevertheless it happened one night when the captain after having eaten an admirable supper was paying his court to a creole lady of spanish town news was brought him that the crew of the dreadnought had mutinied and that lieutenant walsingham was killed one half of the report was true and the other nearly so at midnight after having been exhausted during the preceding week by his vigilance walsingham had just thrown himself into his cot when he was roused by birch at his cabin door crying a mutiny a mutiny on deck walsingham seized his drawn cutlass and ran up the ladder determined to cut down the ringleader but just as he reached the top the sailors shut down the hatchway which struck his head with such violence that he fell stunned and to all appearance dead birch contrived in the midst of the bustle before he was himself seized by the mutineers to convey by signals to shore news of what had happened but captain jemmison could now be of no use before he could take any measures to prevent them the mutineers weighed anchor and the dreadnought under a brisk breeze was out of the bay all the other vessels in the harbour taking it for granted that her captain was on board and that she was sailing under orders in the mean time whilst walsingham was senseless the sailors stowed him into his cabin and set a guard over him the ringleader jefferies a revengeful villain who bore malice against him for some just punishment wanted to murder him but the rest would not consent some would not dip their hands in blood others pleaded for him and said that he was never cruel one man urged that the lieutenant had been kind to him when he was sick another suggested that it would be well to keep him alive to manage the ship for them in case of difficulties conscious of their ignorance they acceded to this advice jefferies proposal to murder him was overruled and it was agreed to keep walsingham close prisoner till they should need his assistance he had his timekeeper and log book locked up with him which were totally forgotten by these miscreants never seaman prayed more fervently for fair weather than walsingham now did for a storm at last one night he heard and he says it was one of the pleasantest sounds he ever heard in his life the wind rising soon it blew a storm he heard one of the sailors say a stiff gale jack and another an ugly night presently great noise on deck and the pumps at work every moment he now expected a deputation from the mutineers the first person he saw was the carpenter who came in to knock in the dead lights in the cabin windows the man was surly and would give no answer to any questions but walsingham knew by the hurry of his work that the fellow thought there was no time to be lost twice before he could finish what he was about messages came from captain jefferies to order him to something else then a violent crash above from the fall of a mast and then he heard one cry ill be cursed if i should care if we did but know where abouts we are then all was in such uproar that no voices could be distinguished at last his cabin door unlocked and many voices called upon him at once to come upon deck that instant and save the ship walsingham absolutely refused to do any thing for them till they returned to their duty delivered up to him their arms and their ringleader jefferies at this answer they stood aghast some tried entreaties some threats all in vain walsingham coolly said he would go to the bottom along with the ship rather than say a word to save them till they submitted the storm blew stronger the danger every moment increasing one of the mutineers came with a drawn cutlass another levelled a blunderbuss at walsingham swearing to despatch him that instant if he would not tell them where they were murder me and you will be hanged persist in your mutiny youll be drowned said walsingham youll never make me swerve from my duty and you know it you have my answer the enraged sailors seized him in their arms and carried him by force upon deck where the sight of the danger and the cries of throw him overboard over with him only seemed to fortify his resolution not a word not a sign could they get from him the rudder was now unshipped at this the sailors fury turned suddenly upon jefferies who between terror and ignorance was utterly incapacitated they seized bound gave him up to walsingham returned to their duty and then and not till then walsingham resumed his command walsinghams voice once more heard inspired confidence and with the hopes revived the exertions of the sailors i am not seaman enough to tell you how the ship was saved but that it was saved and saved by walsingham is certain i remember only that he made the ship manageable by some contrivance which he substituted in the place of the rudder that had been unshipped the storm abating he made for the first port to repair the ships damages intending to return to jamaica to deliver her up to her captain but from a vessel they spoke at sea he learned that jemmison was gone to england in a merchantman to england then walsingham prepared to follow and with this rebel crew cried beaumont think mr palmer what a situation he was in knowing as he did that every rascal of them would sooner go to the devil than go home where they knew they must be tried for their mutiny well sir well said mr palmer did they run away with the ship a second time or how did he manage he called them all one morning together on deck and pointing to the place where the gunpowder was kept he said i have means of blowing up the ship if ever you attempt to mutiny again the first finger you lay upon me i blow her up instantly they had found him to be a man of resolution they kept to their duty not a symptom of disobedience during the rest of the voyage in their passage they fell in with an enemys ship far superior to them in force there my lads said walsingham if you have a mind to earn your pardons theres your best chance take her home with you to your captain and your king a loud cheer was their answer they fought like devils to redeem themselves walsingham but without stopping to make his panegyric i need only tell you that walsinghams conduct and intrepidity were this time crowned with success he took the enemys ship and carried it in triumph into portsmouth jemmison was on the platform when they came in and what a mortifying sight it was to him and what a proud hour to walsingham you may imagine having delivered the dreadnought and her prize over to his captain the next thing to be thought of was the trial of the mutineers all except jefferies obtained a pardon in consideration of their return to duty and their subsequent services jefferies was hanged at the yard arm the trial of the mutineers brought on as jemmison foresaw it must many animadversions on his own conduct powerful connexions and his friends in place silenced as much as possible the public voice jemmison gave excellent dinners and endeavoured to drown the whole affair in his choice champagne and london particular madeira so his health and success to the british navy was drunk in bumper toasts ay ay they think to do every thing now in england by dinners and bumper toasts and three times three said mr palmer but it did not do in this instance said beaumont in a tone of exultation it did not do no continued mr walsingham though jemmisons dinners went down vastly well with a party they did not satisfy the public the opposition papers grew clamorous and the business was taken up so strongly and it raised such a cry against the ministry that they were obliged to bring jemmison to a court martial the puppy im glad of it with all my soul and how did he look then said mr palmer vastly like a gentleman that was all that even his friends could say for him the person he was most afraid of on the trial was walsingham in this apprehension he was confirmed by certain of his friends who had attempted to sound walsingham as to the nature of the evidence he intended to give they all reported that they could draw nothing out of him and that he was an impracticable fellow for his constant answer was that his evidence should be given in court and nowhere else even to his most intimate friends interrupted mr beaumont even to me who was in the house with him all the time the trial was going on he did not tell what his evidence would be when the day of trial came pursued mr walsingham dont forget admiral dashleigh said mr beaumont no who can forget him that knows him said walsingham a warm generous friend open hearted as he is brave he came to captain walsingham the day before the court martial was to sit i know walsingham you dont like my cousin jemmison said he nor do i much for he is a puppy and i never could like a puppy related to me or not be that as it may youll do him justice im sure for though he is a puppy he is a brave fellow and here for party purposes they have raised a cry of his being a coward and want to shoot him pour encourager les autres what you say will damn or save him and i have too good an opinion of you to think that any old grudge though you might have cause for it would stand in his way walsingham answered as usual that his opinion and his evidence would be known on the day of trial dashleigh went away very ill satisfied and persuaded that walsingham harboured revenge against his relation at last when he was called upon in court walsinghams conduct was both just and generous for though his answers spoke the exact truth yet he brought forward nothing to the disadvantage of jemmison but what truth compelled him to state and in his captains favour on the contrary he spoke so strongly of his intrepidity and of the gallant actions which in former instances he had performed in the service as quite to efface the recollection of his foppery and epicurism and as much as possible to excuse his negligence walsinghams evidence absolutely confuted the unjust charge or suspicion of cowardice that had been raised against jemmison and made such an impression in his favour that instead of being dismissed the service or even having his ship taken from him as was expected jemmison got off with a reprimand which i am sure he well deserved said mr palmer but certainly walsingham was right not to let him be run down by a popular cry especially as he had used him ill said mr beaumont well well i dont care about the puppy cried mr palmer only go on no sooner was the trial over and the sentence of the court made known than admiral dashleigh full of joy admiration and gratitude pushed his way towards walsingham and stretching out his hand exclaimed shake hands walsingham and forgive me or i cant forgive myself i suspected you yesterday morning of bearing malice against that coxcomb who deserved to be laughed at but not to be shot by jove walsingham youre an honest fellow i find and have you but just found that out admiral said walsingham with a proud smile harkee my lad said dashleigh calling after him remember im your friend at all events take it as you will ill make you mine yet before ive done with you walsingham knew that at this time admiral dashleighs friends were in power and that dashleigh himself had great influence with the admiralty and he probably treated the admiral thus haughtily to show that he had no interested views or hopes dashleigh understood this for he now comprehended walsinghams character perfectly immediately after the trial walsingham was made commander in consequence of his having saved the dreadnought and his having taken lambuscade with this appointment dashleigh had nothing to do but he never ceased exerting himself employing all the interest of his high connexions and all the personal influence of his great abilities to have walsingham made post and to get him a ship he succeeded at last but he never gave the least hint that it was done by his interest for he said he knew that walsingham had such nice notions and was such a proud principled fellow that he would not enjoy his promotion if he thought he owed it to any thing upon earth but his own merit so a handsome letter was written by the secretary of the admiralty to captain walsingham by their lordships desire informing him that in consideration of his services and merit his majesty had been pleased to make him post captain and to appoint him to the command of lambuscade the prize he took which would be sent out on the first occasion the secretary begged leave to add expressions of his private satisfaction on an appointment so likely to be advantageous to the public c in short it was all done so properly and so plausibly that even walsingham never suspected any secret influence nor did he find out the part dashleigh had taken in the business till several months afterwards when a discreet friend mentioned it by accident i was that discreet friend said mr beaumont well all this is very good but theres no love in this story said mr palmer i hope your hero is not too proud to fall in love too proud we are told you know that the greatest hero in the intervals of war resigned to tender passions all his mighty mind tender passions captain walsingham is in love then hey said mr palmer and may i ask bless me i shall be very sorry if it is with any body but may i ask to whom he is attached that is a question that i am not quite at liberty perhaps to answer said mr walsingham during the interval between his return in the dreadnought and his being appointed to lambuscade an interval of about eighteen months which he spent in the country here with me he had time to become thoroughly acquainted with a very amiable young lady a very amiable young lady and in this neighbourhood interrupted mr palmer it must be the very person i mean the very person i wish do not ask me any more said mr walsingham for my friend never declared his attachment and i have no right to declare it for him he was not at the time i speak of in circumstances to marry therefore he honourably concealed or rather suppressed his passion resolving not to attempt to engage the young ladys affections till he should have made a fortune sufficient to support her in her own rank in life well now thats all done thank heaven cried palmer he has fortune enough now or we can help him out you know this is excellent excellent come is it not time for us to go to the ladies im impatient to tell this to mrs beaumont stay my good mr palmer said mr walsingham what are you going to do let me alone let me alone ill only tell what i guess depend upon it i guess right and it may do a great deal of good to tell it to mrs beaumont and it will give her a great deal of pleasure trust me trust me i do trust you but perhaps you may be mistaken not at all not at all depend upon it so let me go to her this minute but stop my dear sir cried mr beaumont stop for another reason let me beg you to sit down again i am not clear that captain walsingham is not at this instant in love with perhaps as it is reported married to a spanish lady whom he has carried off out of a convent at and whom i understand he is bringing home with him heyday a spanish lady said mr palmer returning slowly to his seat with a fallen countenance hows this by st george this is unlucky but hows this i say you did not let us finish our story said mr beaumont or we should have told you let me hear the end of it now said mr palmer sitting down again and preparing himself with several pinches of snuff but just at this instant a servant came to say that coffee was ready i will never stir from this spot for coffee or any thing else said mr palmer till i know the history of the spanish lady then the shortest and best way i have of telling it to you is to beg you to read this letter which contains all i know of the matter said mr beaumont this letter is from young birch to his parents we have never heard a syllable directly from walsingham himself on this subject since he reached lisbon we have had no letters from him except that short epistle which brought us an account of his taking the treasure ship but we shall see him soon and know the truth of this story and hear whether he prefers his spanish or his english mistress fore george i wish this spanish woman had stayed in her convent said mr palmer i dont like runaway ladies but let us see what this letter says for her the letter is the same that mr beaumont read some time ago therefore it need not here be inserted before mr palmer had finished perusing it a second message came to say that the ladies waited tea and that mrs beaumont wished not to be late going home as there was no moon mr palmer nevertheless finished the letter before he stirred and then with a heavy sigh he rose and said i now wish more than ever that our captain would come home this night before i go and clear up this business i dont like this spanish plot this double intrigue ah dear me i shall be obliged to sail i shall be in jamaica before the fifth act how expectation loads the wings of time exclaimed mrs beaumont as the gentlemen entered the drawing room here we have been all day expecting our dear captain walsingham and the time has seemed so long the only time i ever found long in this house i should like to know said mr walsingham after a bow of due acknowledgment to mrs beaumont for her compliment i should like to know whether time appears to pass more slowly to those that hope or those that fear mrs beaumont handed coffee to mr palmer without attempting to answer this question to those that hope i should think said mr palmer for hope long deferred maketh the heart sick and time i can answer for it passes most slowly to those who are sick slow as the years dull circle seems to run when the brisk minor pants for twenty one said mr walsingham smiling as he looked at young beaumont but i think it is the mixture of fear with hope that makes time appear to pass slowly and is hope ever free from that mixture said miss walsingham does not hope without fear become certainty and fear without hope despair can hope ever be perfectly free from some mixture of fear oh dear me yes to be sure said miss hunter for hopes the most opposite thing that ever was to fear as different as black and white for surely every body knows that hope is just the contrary to fear and when one says i hope one does not ever mean i fear surely you know mrs beaumont i am the worst metaphysician in the world said mrs beaumont i have not head enough to analyze my heart nor i neither said miss hunter heigho very audibly hark cried mr beaumont i think i hear a horse galloping it is he it is walsingham out ran beaumont full speed to meet his friend whilst with more sober joy mr walsingham waited on the steps where all the company assembled mr palmer foremost with a face full of benevolent pleasure mrs beaumont congratulating every body but nobody listening to her luckily for her all were too heartily occupied with their own feelings to see how ill her countenance suited her words the sound of the galloping of the horse ceased for a minute then recommenced but before it could be settled whether it was coming nearer or going farther away mr beaumont returned with a note in his hand not walsingham only birch confound him said mr beaumont out of breath confound him what a race i took and how disappointed i was when i saw birchs face and yet it is no fault of his poor lad but why did not he come up to the house why did not you let us see him said mr walsingham i could not keep him he was in such a hurry to go home to his father and mother he would only stop to give this note from walsingham read quick plymouth oclock am just landed dear friends i cannot have the pleasure of seeing you as i had hoped to do this day i am obliged to go to london instantly on business that must not be delayed cannot tell when i can be with you hope in a few days well and happy and ever yours h walsingham all stood silent with looks of disappointment except mrs beaumont who reiterated what a pity what a sad pity what a disappointment what a terrible disappointment business said mr beaumont curse his business he should think of his friends first most likely his business is for his friends said miss walsingham thats right my dear little defender of the absent said mr walsingham business repeated mr palmer hum i like business better than pleasure i will be patient if it is really business that keeps him away from us depend upon it said miss walsingham nothing but business can keep him away from us his pleasure is always at home i am thinking said mr palmer drawing mr walsingham aside i am thinking whether he has really brought this spanish lady home with him and what will become of her of him i mean i wish i was not going to jamaica then my dear sir where is the necessity of your going my health my health the physicians say i cannot live in england mr walsingham who had but little faith in physicians laughed and exclaimed but my dear sir when you see so many men alive in england at this instant why should you believe in the impossibility of your living even in this pestiferous country mr palmer half smiled felt for his snuff box and then replied i am sure i should like to live in england if my health would let me but continued he his face growing longer and taking the hypochondriac cast as he pronounced the word but mr walsingham you dont consider that my health is really really really very good i see interrupted mr walsingham and i am heartily glad to see it sir sir you do not see it i assure you i have a great opinion of your judgment but as you are not a physician and because i have not taken out my diploma you think i can neither see nor understand interrupted mr walsingham but nevertheless give me leave to feel your pulse do you really understand a pulse said mr palmer baring his wrist and sighing as good a pulse as ever man had pronounced mr walsingham you dont say so why the physicians tell me never mind what they tell you if they told you the truth theyd tell you they want fees mrs beaumont quite startled by the tremendously loud voice in which mr walsingham pronounced the word truth rose and rang the bell for her carriage mr palmer said she i am afraid we must run away for i dread the night air for invalids my good madam i am at your orders answered mr palmer buttoning himself up to the chin mrs beaumont surely you dont think this gentleman an invalid said mr walsingham i only wish he would not think himself such replied mrs beaumont ah my dear friends said mr palmer i really am i certainly am a sad sad hypochondriac said mr walsingham pardon me you are indeed and every body is afraid to tell you so but myself mrs beaumont anxiously looked out of the window to see if her carriage was come to the door hypochondriac not in the least my dear sir said mr palmer if you were to hear what dr and dr say of my case and your own dr wheeler here who has a great reputation too shall i tell you what he says in a low voice mr palmer holding mr walsingham by the button proceeded to recapitulate some of dr wheelers prognostics and at every pause mr walsingham turned impatiently so as almost to twist off the detaining button repeating in the words of the king of prussia to his physician cest un ne cest un ne cest un ne pshaw i dont understand french cried mr palmer angrily his warmth obliged him to think of unbuttoning his coat which operation after stretching his neckcloth to remove an uneasy feeling in his throat he was commencing when mrs beaumont graciously stopped his hand the carriage is at the door my dear sir instead of unbuttoning your coat had not you better put this cambric handkerchief round your throat before we go into the cold air mr palmer put it on as if in defiance of mr walsingham and followed mrs beaumont who led him off in triumph before he reached the carriage door however his anger had spent its harmless force and stopping to shake hands with him mr palmer said my good mr walsingham i am obliged to you i am sure you wish me well and i thank you for speaking so freely i love honest friends but as to my being a hypochondriac believe me you are mistaken and as to dr wheeler said mrs beaumont as she drew up the glass of the carriage and as they drove from the door dr wheeler certainly does not deserve to be called un ne for he is a man of whose medical judgment i have the highest opinion though i am sure i am very candid to acknowledge it in the present case when his opinion is so much against my wishes and all our wishes and must i fear deprive us so soon of the company of our dear mr palmer why yes i must go i must go to jamaica said mr palmer in a more determined tone than he had yet spoken on the subject mrs beaumont silently rejoiced and as her son imprudently went on arguing in favour of his own wishes she leaned back in the carriage and gave herself up to a pleasing reverie in which she anticipated the successful completion of all her schemes relieved from the apprehension that captain walsinghams arrival might disconcert her projects she was now still further re assured by mr palmers resolution to sail immediately one day more and she was safe let mr palmer but sail without seeing captain walsingham and this was all mrs beaumont asked of fortune the rest her own genius would obtain she was so absorbed in thought that she did not know she was come home till the carriage stopped at her door sometimes indeed her reverie had been interrupted by mr palmers praises of the walsinghams and by a conversation which she heard going on about captain walsinghams life and adventures but captain walsingham was safe in london and whilst he was at that distance she could bear to hear his eulogium having lamented that she had been deprived of her dear amelia all this day and having arranged her plan of operations for the morrow mrs beaumont retired to rest and even in dreams her genius invented fresh expedients wrote notes of apology or made speeches of circumvention chapter xi and now as oft in some distempered state on one nice trick depends the general fate pope that old politician the cardinal of lorraine used to say that a lie believed but for one hour doth many times in a nation produce effects of seven years continuance at this rate what wonderful effects might our heroine have produced had she practised in public life instead of confining her genius to family politics the game seemed now in her own hands the day the important day on which all her accounts with her son were to be settled the day when mr palmers will was to be signed the last day he was to stay in england arrived mr beaumonts birthday his coming of age was of course hailed with every possible demonstration of joy the village bells rang the tenants were invited to a dinner and a dance and an ox was to be roasted whole and the preparations for rejoicing were heard all over the house mr palmers benevolent heart was ever ready to take a share in the pleasures of his fellow creatures especially in the festivities of the lower classes he appeared this morning in high good humour mrs beaumont with a smile on her lips yet with a brow of care was considering how she could make pleasure subservient to interest and how she could get business done in the midst of the amusements of the day most auspiciously did her day of business begin by mr palmers declaring to her that his will was actually made that with the exception of certain legacies he had left his whole fortune to her during her life with remainder to her son and daughter by this arrangement continued he i trust i shall ultimately serve my good friends the walsinghams as i wish for though i have not seen as much of that family as i should have been glad to have done yet the little i have seen convinces me that they are worthy people the most worthy people upon earth you know i have the greatest regard for them said mrs beaumont i am really sorry pursued mr palmer that i have not been able to make acquaintance with captain walsingham mr walsingham told me his whole history yesterday and it has prepossessed me much in his favour he is indeed a charming noble hearted young hero said mrs beaumont and i regret as much as you do that you cannot see him before you leave england however continued mr palmer as i was saying the walsinghams will i trust be the better sooner or later by me for i think i foresee that captain walsingham if a certain spanish lady were out of the question would propose for amelia and would persuade her to give up this foolish fancy of hers for that baronet mrs beaumont shook her head as if she believed this could not possibly be done well well if it cant be it cant the girls inclination must not be controlled i dont wonder however that you are vexed at missing such a husband for her as young walsingham but my good madam we must make the best of it let the girl marry her baronet i have left a legacy of some thousands to captain walsingham as a token of my esteem for his character and i am sure my dear mrs beaumont his interests are in good hands when i leave them in yours in the mean time i wish you as the representative of my late good friend colonel beaumont to enjoy all i have during your life mrs beaumont poured forth such a profusion of kind and grateful expressions that mr palmer was quite disconcerted no more of this my dear madam no more of this but there was something i was going to say that has gone out of my head oh it was that the walsinghams will i think stand a good chance of being the better for me in another way how why you have seen so much more of them than i have dont you my dear madam see that miss walsingham has made a conquest of your son i thought i was remarkably slow at seeing these things and yet i saw it miss walsingham is a prodigious favourite of mine but you know edward is so young and men dont like now a days to marry young said mrs beaumont well let them manage their affairs their own way said mr palmer all i wish upon earth is to see them happy or rather to hear of their happiness for i shall not see it you know in jamaica alas said mrs beaumont in a most affectionate tone and with a sigh that seemed to come from her heart alas that is such a melancholy thought mr palmer ended the conversation by inquiring whom he had best ask to witness his will mrs beaumont proposed captain lightbody and dr wheeler the doctor was luckily in the house for he had been sent for this morning to see her poor amelia who had caught cold yesterday and had a slight feverish complaint this was perfectly true the anxiety that amelia had suffered of late the fear of being forced or ensnared to marry a man she disliked apprehensions about the spanish incognita and at last the certainty that captain walsingham would not arrive before mr palmer should have left england and that consequently the hopes she had formed from this benevolent friends interference were vain all these things had overpowered amelia she had passed a feverish night and was really ill mrs beaumont at any other time would have been much alarmed for duplicity out of the question she was a fond mother but she now was well contented that her daughter should have a days confinement to her room for the sake of keeping her safe out of the way so leaving poor amelia to her feverish thoughts we proceed with the business of the day dr wheeler captain lightbody and mr twigg witnessed the will it was executed and a copy of it deposited with mrs beaumont this was one great point gained the next object was her jointure she had employed her convenient tame man captain lightbody humbly to suggest to her son that some increase of jointure would be proper and she was now in anxiety to know how these hints and others which had been made by more remote means would operate as she was waiting to see mr lightbody in her dressing room to hear the result of his suggestions the door opened well lightbody come in what success she stopped short for it was not captain lightbody it was her son without taking any notice of what she said he advanced towards her and presented a deed you will do me the favour mother to accept of this addition to your jointure said he it was always my intention to do this the moment it should be in my power and i had flattered myself that you would not have thought it necessary to suggest to me what i knew i ought to do or to hint to me your wishes by any intermediate person colouring deeply for it hurt her conscience to be found out mrs beaumont was upon the point of disavowing her emissary but she recollected that the words which she had used when her son was coming into the room might have betrayed her on the other hand it was not certain that he had heard them she hesitated from the shame of a disavowal which would have answered no purpose but to sink her lower in her sons opinion she was however saved by his abrupt sincerity dont say any thing more about it dear mother cried he but pardon me the pain i have given you at a time when indeed i wished only to give pleasure promise me that in future you will let me know your wishes directly and from your own lips undoubtedly depend upon it my dearest son i am quite overpowered the fact was that i could not however really and urgently necessary it was to me bring myself to mention with my own lips what as a direct request from me i knew you could not and would not refuse however inconvenient it might be to you to comply on this account and on this account only i wished you not to know my wants from myself but from an intermediate friend friend mr beaumont could not help repeating with an emphasis of disdain friend i only said by courtesy but i wished you to know my wants from an intermediate person that you might not feel yourself in any way bound or called upon and that the refusal might be implied and tacit as it were so that it could lead to no unpleasant feelings between us ah my dear mother said mr beaumont i have not your knowledge of the world or of human nature but from all i have heard seen and felt i am convinced that more unpleasant feelings are created in families by these false delicacies and managements and hints and go between friends by courtesy than ever would have been caused by the parties speaking directly to one another and telling the plain truth about their thoughts and wishes forgive me if i speak too plainly at this moment as we are to live together i hope many years it may spare us many an unhappy hour mrs beaumont wiped her eyes her son found it difficult to go on and yet upon his own principles it was right to proceed amelia maam i find she is ill this morning yes poor child i hope mother since interrupted mrs beaumont my dear son wishes always to hear from me the plain and direct truth i must tell him that as the guardian of his sister i think myself accountable to no one for my conduct with respect to her and that i should look upon any interference as an unkind and unjustifiable doubt of my affection for my daughter rest satisfied with this assurance that her happiness is in all i do my first object and as i have told her a thousand times no force shall be put on her inclinations i have no more to say no more to ask said mr beaumont this is a distinct positive declaration in which i will confide and in future not suffer appearances to alarm me a mother would not keep the word of promise to the ear and break it to the hope mrs beaumont feeling herself change countenance made an attempt to blow her nose and succeeded in hiding her face with her handkerchief with respect to myself continued mr beaumont i should also say lest you should be in any doubt concerning my sentiments that though i have complied with your request to delay for a few weeks that you need not repeat my dear interrupted mrs beaumont i understand all that perfectly then at the end of this month i shall and i hope with your entire approbation propose for miss walsingham time enough said mrs beaumont smiling and tapping her son playfully on the shoulder time enough to talk of that when the end of the month comes how often have i seen young men like you change their minds and fall in and out of love in the course of one short month at any rate continued mrs beaumont let us pass to the order of the day for we have time enough to settle other matters but the order of the day a tiresome one i confess is to settle accounts i am ready so am i then let us go with the accounts to mr palmer who is also ready i am sure but before we go said mrs beaumont whispering let us settle what is to be said about the debts your debts you know i fancy youll agree with me that the less is said about this the better and that in short the best will be to say nothing why so madam surely you dont think i mean to conceal my debts from our friend mr palmer at the very moment when i profess to tell him all my affairs and to settle accounts with him and you as my guardians with him but he has never acted you know as one of the guardians therefore you are not called upon to settle accounts with him then why maam did you urge him to come down from london to be present at the settlement of these accounts as a compliment and because i wish him to be present as your fathers friend but it is by no means essential that he should know every detail i will do whichever you please maam i will either settle accounts with or without him oh with him that is in his presence to be sure then he must know the whole why so your having contracted such debts will alter his opinion of your prudence and of mine and may perhaps essentially alter alter his will be it so that is the worst that can happen as far as i am concerned i would rather a thousand times it were so than deceive him into a better opinion of me than i deserve nobly said so like yourself and like every thing i could wish but forgive me if i did for you what indeed i would not wish you to do for yourself i have already told mr palmer that you had no embarrassments therefore you cannot and i am sure would not unsay what i have said mr beaumont stood fixed in astonishment but why mother did not you tell him the whole my dear love delicacy prevented me he offered to relieve you from any embarrassments if you had any but i having too much delicacy and pride to let my son put himself under pecuniary obligations hastily answered that you had no debts for there was no other reply to be made without offending poor palmer and hurting his generous feelings which i would not do for the universe and i considered too that as all palmers fortune will come to us in the end well maam interrupted mr beaumont impatient of all these glosses and excuses the plain state of the case is that i cannot contradict what my mother has said therefore i will not settle accounts at all with mr palmer and what excuse can i make to him after sending for him express from london that i must leave to you mother and what reason can i give for thus withdrawing our family confidence from such an old friend and at the very moment when he is doing so much for us all that i must leave to you mother i withdraw no confidence i have pretended none i will break none good heavens was not all i did and said for your interest nothing can be for my interest that is not for my honour and for yours mother but let us never go over the business again now to the order of the day my dear dear son said mrs beaumont dont speak so roughly so cruelly to me suddenly softened by seeing the tears standing in his mothers eyes he besought her pardon for the bluntness of his manner and expressed his entire belief in her affection and zeal for his interests but on the main point that he would not deceive mr palmer or directly or indirectly assert a falsehood mr beaumont was immoveable in the midst of her entreaties a message came from mr palmer to say that he was waiting for the accounts which mrs beaumont wished to settle well said she much perplexed well come down to him come for it is impossible for me to find any excuse after sending for him from london he would think there was something worse than there really is stay ill go down first and sound him and if it wont do without the accounts do you come when i ring the bell then all i have for it is to run my chance perhaps he may never recollect what passed about your debts for the dear good old soul has not the best memory in the world and if he should obstinately remember why after all its only a bit of false delicacy and a white lie for a friend and a son and we can colour it down went mrs beaumont to sound mr palmer but though much might be expected from her address yet she found it unequal to the task of convincing this gentlemans plain good sense that it would fatigue him to see those accounts which he came so many miles on purpose to settle perceiving him begin to waken to the suspicion that she had some interest in suppressing the accounts and hearing him in an altered tone ask madam is there any mystery in these accounts that i must not see them she instantly rang the bell and answered oh none none in the world only we thought that is i feared it might fatigue you too much my dear friend just the day before your journey and i was unwilling to lose so many hours of your good company but since you are so very kind heres my son and the papers chapter xii a face untaught to feign a judging eye that darts severe upon a rising lie and strikes a blush through frontless flattery to the settlement of accounts they sat down in due form and it so happened that though this dear good old soul had not the best memory in the world yet he had an obstinate recollection of every word mrs beaumont had said about her sons having no debts or embarrassments and great and unmanageable was his astonishment when the truth came to light it is not said he turning to mr beaumont that i am astonished at your having debts i am sorry for that to be sure but young men are often a little extravagant or so and i dare say particularly as you are so candid and make no excuses about it i dare say you will be more prudent in future and give up the race horses as you promise but why did not madam beaumont tell me the truth why make a mystery when i wanted nothing but to serve my friends it was not using me well it was not using yourself well madam madam i am vexed to the heart and would not for a thousand pounds ay fool as i am not for ten thousand pounds this had happened to me from my good friend the colonels widow a man that would as soon have cut his hand off oh madam madam beaumont you have struck me a hard blow at my time of life any thing but this i could have borne but to have ones confidence and old friendships shaken at my time of life mrs beaumont was in her turn in unfeigned astonishment for mr palmer took the matter more seriously and seemed more hurt by this discovery of a trifling deviation from truth than she had foreseen or than she could have conceived to be possible in a case where neither his interest nor any one of his passions was concerned it was in vain that she palliated and explained and talked of delicacy and generosity and pride and maternal feelings and the feelings of a friend and all manner of fine and double refined sentiments still mr palmers sturdy plain sense could not be made to comprehend that a falsehood is not a falsehood or that deceiving a friend is using him well her son suffered for her as his countenance and his painful and abashed silence plainly showed and does not even my son say any thing for me is this friendly said she unable to enter into his feelings and thinking that the part of a friend was to make apologies right or wrong mr palmer shook hands with mr beaumont and without uttering a syllable they understood one another perfectly mr beaumont left the room and mrs beaumont burst into tears mr palmer with great good nature tried to assuage that shame and compunction which he imagined that she felt he observed that to be sure she must feel mortified and vexed with herself but that he was persuaded nothing but some mistaken notion of delicacy could have led her to do what her principles must condemn immediately she said all that she saw would please mr palmer and following the lead of his mind she at last confirmed him in the opinion that this was an accidental not an habitual deviation from truth his confidence in her was broken but not utterly destroyed as to the debt resumed mr palmer do not let that give you a moments concern i will put that out of the question in a few minutes my share in the cargo of the anne which i see is just safely arrived in the downs will more than pay this debt your son shall enter upon his estate unencumbered no no dont thank me i wont cheat you of your thanks it is your son must thank me for this i do it on his account i like the young man there is an ingenuousness an honourable frankness about him that i love instead of his bond for the money i shall ask his promise never to have any thing more to do with race horses or newmarket and his promise i shall think as good as if it were his bond now i am not throwing money away im not doing an idle ostentatious thing but one that may and i hope will be essentially useful for look you here my good look here mrs beaumont a youth who finds himself encumbered with debt on coming to his estate is apt to think of freeing himself by marrying a fortune instead of a woman now instead of freeing a man this fetters him for life and what sort of a friend must that be who if he could prevent it would let this be done for a few thousand pounds so ill go before i take another pinch of snuff and draw him an order upon the cargo of the anne lest i should forget it in the hurry of packing and taking leave and all those uncomfortable things he left madam beaumont to her feelings or her reflections and in a few minutes with an order for the money in his hand went over the house in search of his young friend mr beaumont came out of his sisters room on hearing himself called here said mr palmer is a little business for you to do read this order over see that it is right and endorse it mind and never let me hear one word more about it only by way of acknowledgment ask your mother what you are to give me but dont read it till you are out of my sight is amelia up can i see her yes up and in her dressing room do dear sir go in and see her for my mother says she is too feverish to leave her room to day but i am sure that it will make her ten times worse to be prevented from seeing you the last day you are with us does the little gipsy then care so much for me thats fair for i am her friend and will prove it to her by giving up my own fancies to hers so trust me with her tte tte young gentleman go off if you please and do your own business mr palmer knocked at amelias door and fancying he heard an answer of admittance went in oh mr palmer my good mr palmer is it you yes but you seem not above half to know whether you are glad or sorry to see your good mr palmer for while you hold out your hand you turn away your face from me dear dear what a burning hand and how the pulse goes and flutters what does dr wheeler say to this i am a bit of a physician myself let me look at you whats this eyes as red as ferrets begging your eyes pardon young lady whats this about come said he drawing a chair and sitting down close beside her no mysteries no mysteries i hate mysteries besides we have not time for them consider i go to morrow and have all my shirts to pack up ay smile lady as your father used to do and open your whole heart to me as he always did consider me as an old friend i do consider you as a sincere excellent friend said amelia but amelia knew that she could not explain herself without disobeying and perhaps betraying her mother no buts said mr palmer taking hold of her hand come my little amelia before you have put that ring on and off your pretty finger fifty times more tell me whom you would wish to put a ring on this finger for life ah that is the thing i cannot tell you said amelia were i alone concerned i would tell you every thing but ask me no more i cannot tell you the whole truth then theres something wrong somewhere or other whenever people tell me they cannot speak the truth i always say then theres something wrong give me leave amelia to ask dont question me said amelia talk to my mother i dont know how i ought to answer you not know how fore george this is strange a strange house where one cant get at the simplest truth without a world of difficulty mother and daughter all alike not one of em but the son can for the soul of em give a plain answer to a plain question not know how as if it was a science to tell the truth not know how as if a person could not talk to me honest old richard palmer without knowing how as if it was how to baffle a lawyer on a cross examination not know how to answer ones own friend ah this is not the way your father and i used to go on miss beaumont nay nay dont cry now or that will finish oversetting the little temper i have left for i cant bear to see a woman cry especially a young woman like you it breaks my heart old as it is and fool that i am that ought to know your sex better by this time than to let a few tears drown my common sense well young lady be that as it may since you wont tell me your mind i must tell you your mind for i happen to know it yes i do your mother bid me spare your delicacy and i would but that i have not time besides i dont understand nor see what good is got but a great deal of mischief by these cursed new fashioned delicacies wherefore in plain english i tell you i dont like sir john hunter and i do like captain walsingham and i did wish you married to captain walsingham you need not start so for i say did i dont wish it now for since your heart is set upon sir john hunter god forbid i should want to give captain walsingham a wife without a heart so i have only to add that notwithstanding my own fancy or judgment i have done my best to persuade your mother to let you have the man or the baronet of your choice i will go farther ill make it a point with her and bring you both together for theres no other way i see of understanding you and get a promise of her consent and then i hope i shall leave you all satisfied and without any mysteries and in the mean time added mr palmer taking out of his coat pocket a morocco leather case and throwing it down on the table before amelia every body should be made happy their own way there are some diamonds for lady hunter and god bless you oh sir stay cried amelia rising eagerly dear good mr palmer keep your diamonds and leave me your esteem and love that i cant unless you speak openly to me it is out of nature dont kneel dont god bless you young lady you have my pity for indeed turning and looking at her you seem very miserable and look very sincere if my mother was here i must see my mother exclaimed amelia wheres the difficulty ill go for her this instant said mr palmer who was not a man to let a romance trail on to six volumes for want of going six yards or for want of somebodys coming into a room at the right minute for explanation or from some of those trivial causes by which adepts contrive to delude us at the very moment of expectation whilst mr palmer was going for mrs beaumont amelia waited in terrible anxiety the door was open and as she looked into the gallery which led to her room she saw mr palmer and her mother as they came along talking together knowing every symptom of suppressed passion in her mothers countenance she was quite terrified by indications which passed unnoticed by mr palmer as her mother approached amelia hid her face in her hands for a moment but gaining courage from the consciousness of integrity and from a determination to act openly she looked up and rising with dignity said in a gentle but firm voice mother i hope you will not think that there is any impropriety in my speaking to our friend mr palmer with the same openness with which i have always spoken to you my dear child interrupted mrs beaumont embracing amelia with a sudden change of manner and countenance my sweet child i have tried you to the utmost forgive me all your trials now are over and you must allow me the pleasure of telling our excellent friend mr palmer what i know will delight him almost as much as it delights me that the choice of amelias heart mr palmer is worthy of her just what we all wished captain walsingham exclaimed mr palmer with joyful astonishment sit down my love said mrs beaumont seating amelia who from the surprise at this sudden change in her mother and from the confusion of feelings which overwhelmed her at this moment was near fainting we are too much for her i have been too abrupt continued mrs beaumont open the window will you my good sir and whispering let us not say any more to her at present you see it wont do i am well quite well again now said amelia exerting herself dont leave dont forsake me mr palmer pray dont go holding out her hand to mr palmer my dear amelia said mrs beaumont dont talk dont exert yourself pray lie still on the sofa her colour is come back she looks like herself again said mr palmer seating himself beside her regardless of mrs beaumonts prohibitory looks since my little amelia wished me to stay ill not go so my child but i wont hurry you only want one sign of the head to confirm the truth of what your mother has just told me for nobody can tell what passes in a young ladys heart but herself so then it is not that sprig of quality that selfish spendthrift that sir john hunter who has your heart hey no no no answered amelia i never did i never could like such a man why i thought not i thought it was impossible but mrs beaumont alarmed beyond conception suddenly put her hand before mr palmers mouth to prevent him from finishing his sentence and exposing the whole of her shameful duplicity to her daughter absolutely i must and do hereby interpose my maternal authority and forbid all agitating explanations whilst amelia is in her present state dr wheeler says she is terribly feverish come mr palmer i must carry you off by force and from me you shall have all the explanations and all the satisfaction you can require well said mr palmer good bye for the present my little amelia my darling little amelia i am so delighted to find that captain walsinghams the man and so glad you have no mysteries be well be well soon i am so pleased so happy that i am as unruly as a child and as easily managed you see how i let myself be turned out of the room not turned out only carried out said mrs beaumont who never even in the most imminent perils lost her polite presence of mind having thus carried off mr palmer she was in hopes that in the joyful confusion of his mind he would he easily satisfied with any plausible explanation therefore she dexterously fixed his attention on the future and adverted as slightly as possible to the past now my good sir congratulate me said she on the prospect i have of happiness in such a son in law as captain walsingham if it be indeed true that captain walsingham is really attached to amelia but on the other hand what shall we do if there is any truth in the story of the spanish lady oh theres the difficulty between hope and fear i am in such a distracted state at this moment i hardly know what i say what shall we do about the spanish lady do my dear madam we can do nothing at all in that case but i will hope the best and youll see that he will prove a constant man at last in the mean time how was all that about sir john hunter and what are you to do with him leave that to me i will settle all that cried mrs beaumont but i hope the poor man though i dont like him has not been jilted no by no means amelias incapable of that you know she told you just now that she never liked him ay but i think madam you told me that she did said mr palmer sticking to his point with a decided plainness which quite disconcerted mrs beaumont it was all a mistake said she quite a mistake and i am sure you rejoice with me that it was so and as to the rest past blunders like past misfortunes are good for nothing but to be forgotten observing that mr palmer looked dissatisfied mrs beaumont continued apologizing i confess you have to all appearance some cause to be angry with me said she but now only hear me taking the blame upon myself let me candidly tell you the whole truth and all my reasons foolish perhaps as they were captain walsingham behaved so honourably and had such command over his feelings that i who am really the most credulous creature in the world was so completely deceived that i fancied he never had a thought of amelia and that he never would think of her and i own this roused both my pride and my prudence for my daughter and i certainly thought it my duty as her mother to do every thing in my power to discourage in her young and innocent heart a hopeless passion it was but within these few hours that i have been undeceived by you as to his sentiments that of course made an immediate change as you have seen in my measures for such is my high opinion of the young man and indeed my desire to be connected with the walsinghams is so great that even whilst i am in total ignorance of what the amount or value may be of this prize that he has taken and even whilst i am in doubt concerning this spanish incognita i have not hesitated to declare perhaps imprudently to amelia as you have just heard my full approbation of the choice of her heart hum well hey hows this said mr palmer to himself as he tried to believe and to be satisfied with this apology madam said he aloud to mrs beaumont i comprehend that it might not be prudent to encourage amelias partiality for captain walsingham till you were sure of the young mans sentiments but excuse me i am a very slow unpractised man in these matters i dont yet understand why you told me that she was in love with sir john hunter mrs beaumont being somewhat in the habit of self contradiction was seldom unprovided with a concordance of excuses but at this unlucky moment she was found unprepared hesitating she stood all subtle as she was deprived of ready wit and actually abashed in the presence of a plain good man i candidly confess my dear sir said she apologizing to mr palmer as he walked up and down that my delicacy or pride call it what you will my false pride for my daughter led me into an error i could not bring myself to acknowledge to any man even to you for you know that its contrary quite to the principles and pride of our sex that she felt any partiality for a man who had shown none for her you must be sensible it was to say no more an awkward mortifying thing and i was so afraid even of your finding it out that forgive me i did i candidly acknowledge fabricate the foolish story of sir john hunter but believe me i never seriously thought of her marrying him fore george i dont understand one word of it from beginning to end said mr palmer speaking aloud to himself regardless of the profusion of words which mrs beaumont continued pouring forth he seated himself in an arm chair and deep in reverie for some minutes went on slowly striking his hands together as he leaned with his arms on his knees at length he rose rang the bell and said to the servant sir be so obliging as to let my man crichton know that he need not hurry himself to pack up my clothes for i shall not go to morrow struck with consternation at these words mrs beaumont nevertheless commanded the proper expression of joy on the occasion delightful i must go this instant cried she and be the first to tell this charming news to amelia and edward tell them then madam if you please that i have gained such a conquest over what mr walsingham calls my hypochondriacism that i am determined at whatever risk to stay another year in old england and that i hope to be present at both their weddings mrs beaumonts quick exit was at this moment necessary to conceal her dismay instead of going to amelia she hurried to her own room locked the door and sat down to compose her feelings and to collect her thoughts but scarcely had she been two minutes in her apartment when a messenger came to summon her to the festive scene in the park the tenants and villagers were all at dinner and mr beaumont sent to let her know that they were waiting to drink her health she was obliged to go and to appear all radiant with pleasure the contrast between their honest mirth and her secret sufferings was great she escaped as soon as she could from their senseless joy and again shut herself up in her own room this sudden and totally unexpected resolution of mr palmers so astonished her that she could scarcely believe she had heard or understood his words rightly artful persons may perhaps calculate with expertness and accuracy what will in any given case be the determinations of the selfish and the interested but they are liable to frequent mistakes in judging of the open hearted and the generous there is no sympathy to guide them and all their habits tend to mislead them in forming opinions of the direct and sincere it had never entered into mrs beaumonts imagination that mr palmer would notwithstanding his belief that he hazarded his life by so doing defer a whole year returning to jamaica merely to secure the happiness of her son and daughter she plainly saw that he now suspected her dislike to the walsinghams and her aversion to the double union with that family she saw that the slightest circumstance in her conduct which confirmed his suspicions would not only utterly ruin her in his opinion but might induce him to alter that part of his will which left her sole possessor of his fortune during her life bad as her affairs were at this moment she knew that they might still be worse she recollected the letter of perfect approbation which sir john hunter had in his power she foresaw that he would produce this letter on the first rumour of her favouring another lover for amelia she had just declared to mr palmer that she never seriously thought of sir john hunter for her daughter and should this letter be brought to light she must be irremediably convicted of the basest duplicity and there would be no escape from the shame of falsehood or rather the disgrace of detection in this grand difficulty mrs beaumont was too good a politician to waste time upon any inferior considerations instead of allowing herself leisure to reflect that all her present difficulties arose from her habits of insincerity she with the true spirit of intrigue attributed her disappointments to some deficiency of artifice oh said she to herself why did i write i should only have spoken to sir john how could i be so imprudent as to commit myself by writing but what can be done to repair this error one web destroyed she with indefatigable subtlety began to weave another with that promptitude of invention which practice alone can give she devised a scheme by which she hoped not only to prevent sir john hunter from producing the written proof of her duplicity but by which she could also secure the reversionary title and the great wigram estate the nature of the scheme shall be unfolded in the next chapter and it will doubtless procure for mrs beaumont from all proper judges a just tribute of admiration they will allow our heroine to be possessed not only of that address which is the peculiar glory of female politicians but also of that masculine quality which the greatest wisest of mankind has pronounced to be the first second and third requisite for business boldness boldness boldness chapter xiii the creatures at her dirty work again pope amongst the infinite petty points of cunning of which that great practical philosopher bacon has in vain essayed to make out a list he notes that because it worketh better when any thing seemeth to be gotten from you by question than if you offer it of yourself you may lay a bait for a question by showing another visage and countenance than you are wont to the end to give occasion to the party to ask what the matter is of the change what is the matter my dearest mrs beaumont i never saw you look so sad before in all my life said miss hunter meeting mrs beaumont who had walked out into the park on purpose to be so met and in hopes of having the melancholy of her countenance thus observed it was the more striking and the more unseasonable from its contrast with the gay scene in the park the sound of music was heard and the dancing had begun and all was rural festivity what is the matter my dearest mrs beaumont repeated miss hunter at such a time as this to see you look so melancholy ah my love such a sad change in affairs but whispered mrs beaumont i cannot explain myself before your companion mr lightbody was walking with miss hunter but he was so complaisant that he was easily despatched on some convenient errand and then mrs beaumont with all her wonted delicacy of circumlocution began to communicate her distress to her young friend you know my beloved albina said she it has been my most ardent wish that your brother should be connected with my family by the nearest and dearest ties yes that is married to amelia said miss hunter and has any thing happened to prevent it oh my dear it is all over it cannot be must not be thought of must not be spoken of any more mr palmer has been outrageous about it such a scene as i have had and all to no purpose amelia has won him over to her party only conceive what i felt she declared beyond redemption her preference of captain walsingham before the captain proposed for her how odd dear suppose he should never propose for her what a way she will be in after affronting my brother and all and only think she gives up the title and the great wigram estate and every thing why my brother says uncle wigram cant live three months and lord puckeridges title too will come to my brother you know and amelia might have been lady puckeridge only think did you ever know any thing so foolish never said mrs beaumont but you know my dear so few girls have the sense you show in taking advice they all will judge for themselves but im most hurt by amelias want of gratitude and delicacy towards me continued mrs beaumont only conceive the difficulty and distress in which she has left me about your poor brother such a shock as the disappointment will be to him and he may though heaven knows how little i deserve it he may suspect for men when they are vexed and angry will you know suspect even their best friends he might i say suspect me of not being warm in his cause dear no i have always told him how kind you were and how much you wished the thing and of all people in the world he cant blame you dearest mrs beaumont at this instant mrs beaumont saw a glimpse of somebody in a bye path of the shrubbery near them hush take care who is that lurking there some listener who can it be miss hunter applied her glass to her eye but could not make out who it was it is lightbody i declare said mrs beaumont softly let us not pretend to see him and watch what he will do it is of the greatest consequence to me to know whether he is a listener or not so much as he is about the house an irresistible fit of giggling which seized miss hunter at the odd way in which lightbody walked prevented mrs beaumonts trial of his curiosity at the noise which the young lady made mr lightbody turned his head and immediately advancing with his accustomed mixture of effrontery and servility said that he had executed mrs beaumonts commands and that he had returned in hopes of getting a moment to say a word to her when she was at leisure about something he had just learned from mr palmers man crichton which it was of consequence she should know without delay oh thank you you best of creatures but i know all that already you know that mr palmer does not go to morrow yes and am so rejoiced at it do my dear lightbody go to amelia and my son from me and tell them that charming news and after that pray have the compassion to inquire if the post is not come in yet and run over the papers to see if you can find any thing about walsinghams prize mr lightbody obeyed but not with his usual alacrity mrs beaumont mused for a moment and then said i do believe he was listening what could he be doing there doing oh nothing said miss hunter hes never doing any thing you know and as to listening he was so far off he could not hear a word we said besides he is such a simple creature and loves you so i dont know said mrs beaumont he either did not play me fair or else he did a job i employed him in this morning so awkwardly that i never wish to employ him again he is but a low kind of person after all ill get rid of him that sort of people always grow tiresome and troublesome after a time and one must shake them off but i have not leisure to think of him now well my dear to go on with what i was saying to you mrs beaumont went on talking of her friendship for sir john hunter and of the difficulty of appeasing him but observing that miss hunter listened only with forced attention she paused to consider what this could mean habitually suspicious like all insincere people mrs beaumont now began to imagine that there was some plot carrying on against her by sir john hunter and lightbody and that miss hunter was made use of against her having a most contemptible opinion of her albinas understanding and knowing that her young friend had too little capacity to be able to deceive her or to invent a plausible excuse impromptu mrs beaumont turned quick and exclaimed my dear what could lightbody be saying to you when i came up for i remember he stopped short and you both looked so guilty guilty did i did he dearest mrs beaumont dont look at me so with your piercing eyes oh i vow and protest i cant tell you i wont tell you the young lady tittered and twisted herself into various affected attitudes then kissing mrs beaumont and then turning her back with childish playfulness she cried no i wont tell you never never never come come my dear dont trifle i have really business to do and am in a hurry well dont look at me never look at me again promise me that and ill tell you poor lightbody oh youre looking at me poor lightbody was talking to me of somebody and he laid me a wager but i cant tell you that ah dont be angry with me and i will tell if youll turn your head quite away that i should be married to somebody before the end of this year oh now dont look at me dearest dearest mrs beaumont you dear little simpleton and was that all said mrs beaumont vexed to have wasted her time upon such folly come be serious now my dear if you knew the anxiety i am in at this moment but wisely judging that it would be in vain to hope for any portion of the love sick damsels attention until she had confirmed her hopes of being married to somebody before the end of the year mrs beaumont scrupled not to throw out assurances in which she had herself no further faith after what she had heard from her son this morning she must have been convinced that there was no chance of marrying him to miss hunter she knew indeed positively that he would soon declare his real attachment but she could she thought during the interval retain her power over miss hunter and secure her services by concealing the truth before i say one word more of my own affairs let me my dearest child assure you that in the midst of all these disappointments and mortifications about amelia i am supported by the hope by something more than the hope that i shall see the daughter of my heart happily settled soon lightbody does not want penetration i see but i am not at liberty to say more so now my dear help me with all your cleverness to consider what i shall do in the difficulties i am in at this moment your brother has a letter of mine approving and so forth his addresses to my daughter now if he in the first rashness of his anger should produce this to palmer im undone or to my son worse and worse there would be a duel between them infallibly for beaumont is so warm on any point of honour oh i dread to think of it my dear so do i im sure but lord im the worst person to think in a hurry but cant you write a letter for you always know what to say so well and after all do you know i dont think hell be half so angry or so disappointed as you fancy for i never thought he was so much in love with amelia indeed i know if it was not a secret i could tell you what no secrets between us my darling child then i can tell you that just before he proposed for amelia he was consulting with me about proposing for mrs dutton mrs dutton the widow mrs dutton how you astonish me said mrs beaumont though she knew this before why she is older than i am older yes a great deal but then you know my brother is no chicken himself to be sure compared with you my dear he is not young theres a prodigious difference between you above twenty years for you know hes by another marriage true but i cant believe he proposed for mrs dutton not actually proposed because i would not let him for i should have hated to have had such an unfashionable looking woman for my sister in law i never could have borne to go into public with her you know so i plagued my brother out of it and luckily he found out that her jointure is not half so great as it was said to be i could have told him that mrs duttons jointure is nothing nearly so large as mine was even before the addition to it which my son so handsomely and indeed unexpectedly made to it this morning and did i tell you my dear mr palmer this day has been so kind as to leave me all his immense fortune for my own life but dont mention it lest it should get round and make ill will the walsinghams know nothing of it but to return to your poor brother if i could any way serve him with mrs dutton la hed never think of her more and im sure i would not have him you dear little saucy creature indeed i cannot wonder that you dont like the thoughts of mrs dutton for a chaperon in town oh horrid horrid and yet would you condemn your poor brother to be an old bachelor after this disappointment with amelia la maam cant he marry any body but mrs dutton i wish i could think of any person would suit him can you oh i know very well who i think would suit him and one i like to go into public with of all things who and one who has promised to present me at court next winter my dearest child is it possible that you mean me i do and why not why not my sweet love do you consider my age but you look so young to be sure mrs dutton looks older and is older but i could not bring myself especially after being a widow so long to think of marrying a young man to be sure your brother is not what one should call a very young man dear no you dont look above three or four or five years older than he does and in public and with dress and rouge and fashion and all that i think it would do vastly well and nobody would think it odd at all theres lady is not she ten years older than lord and every body says thats nothing and that she gives the most delightful parties oh i declare dearest mrs beaumont you must and shall marry my brother and thats the only way to make him amends and prevent mischief between the gentlemen the only way to settle every thing charmingly and i shall so like it and im so proud of its being my plan i vow ill go and write to my brother this minute and stay you dear mad creature only consider what you are about consider i have considered and i must and will have my own way said the dear mad creature struggling with mrs beaumont who detained her with an earnest hand my love said she i positively cannot let you use my name in such a strange way if your brother or the world should think i had any share in the transaction it would be so indelicate indelicate dear me maam but when nobody will know it how can it be indelicate and i will not mention your name and nobody will ever imagine that you knew any thing of my writing and i shall manage it all my own way and the plan is all my own so let me go and write this minute mercy upon me what shall i do with this dear headstrong creature said mrs beaumont letting miss hunter go as if exhausted by the struggle she had made to detain her impetuous young friend away ran miss hunter sometimes looking back in defiance and laughing whilst mrs beaumont shook her head at her whenever she looked back but found it impossible to overtake her and vain to make further opposition as mrs beaumont walked slowly homewards she meditated her own epistle to sir john hunter and arranged her future plan of operations if thought she miss hunters letter should not succeed it is only a suggestion of hers of which i am not supposed to know any thing and i am only just where i was before if it does succeed and if sir john transfers his addresses to me i avoid all danger of his anger on account of his disappointment with amelia for it must then be his play to convince me that he is not at all disappointed and then i shall have leisure to consider whether i shall marry sir john or not at all events i can draw on his courtship as long as i please till i have by degrees brought mr palmer round to approve of the match with these views mrs beaumont wrote an incomparable letter to sir john hunter in which she enveloped her meaning in so many words and so much sentiment that it was scarcely possible to comprehend any thing except that she should be glad to see sir john hunter the next day to explain to him a circumstance that had given her on his account heartfelt uneasiness miss hunters letter was carefully revised by mrs beaumont though she was to know nothing of it and such was the art with which it was retouched that after all proper corrections nothing appeared but the most childish and imprudent simplicity after having despatched these letters mrs beaumont felt much anxiety about the effect which they might produce but she was doomed by her own habits of insincerity to have perpetually the irksome task of assuming an appearance contrary to her real feelings amelia was better and mr palmers determination to stay in england had spread a degree of cheerfulness over the whole family which had not been felt for some time at beaumont park in this general delight mrs beaumont was compelled seemingly to sympathize she performed her part so well that even dr wheeler and captain lightbody who had been behind the scenes began to believe that the actress was in earnest amelia alas knew her mother too well to be the dupe even of her most consummate powers of acting all that mrs beaumont said about her joy and her hopes that captain walsingham would soon appear and confirm her happy pre sentiments amelia heard without daring to believe she had such an opinion of her mothers address such a sublime superstitious dread that her mother would by some inscrutable means work out her own purposes that she felt as if she could not escape from these secret machinations amelia still apprehended that sir john hunter would not be irrevocably dismissed and that by some turn of artifice she should find herself bound to him the next morning sir john hunter however finally relieved her from these apprehensions after having been closeted for upwards of two hours with mrs beaumont he begged to speak to miss beaumont and he resigned all pretensions to the honour which he had so long and so ardently aspired to it was his pride to show that his spirits were not affected by this disappointment he scarcely indeed exhibited that decent appearance of mortification which is usually expected on such an occasion but with provoking haughtiness professed himself sincerely obliged to miss beaumont for having however late in the business prevented him by her candour from the danger of crossing her inclinations for this he could scarcely be sufficiently thankful when he considered how every day showed the consequences of marrying young ladies whose affections were previously engaged he had only to add that he hoped the world would see the thing in the same light in which he took it and that miss beaumont might not find herself blamed for breaking off the matter after it had been so publicly reported that for his part he assured her he would as far as he was concerned do his utmost to silence unpleasant observations and that as the most effectual means to do this he conceived would be to show that he continued on an amicable footing with the family he should do himself the honour to avail himself of the permission invitation indeed he had just received from mrs beaumont to continue his visits as usual at beaumont park to this amelia could make no objection after the express declaration which he had just made that he renounced all pretensions to her favour however keenly she felt the implied reproach of having encouraged sir john as her admirer while her affections were previously engaged and of having shown candour late in this affair she could not vindicate herself without accusing her mother therefore she attempted neither excuse nor apology submitted to let the unfeeling baronet enjoy her confusion whilst she said in general terms she felt obliged by his assurance that she should not be the cause of any quarrel between two families who had hitherto lived in friendship chapter xiv him no soft thoughts no gratitude could move to gold he fled from beauty and from love dryden all that passed in the two hours conversation between the discarded baronet and the mother of his late mistress did not transpire but mrs beaumont said that she had taken infinite pains to reconcile sir john to his fate and his subsequent behaviour showed that she had succeeded his attention towards her also plainly proved that he was not dissatisfied by the part she had acted or rather by the part that he thought she had acted thus all things went on smoothly mrs beaumont in confidence told her friend miss hunter that sir john had behaved with the greatest propriety and candour candour that hackneyed word that he had acknowledged that his principal inducement to propose for her daughter had been a desire to be connected with a family for which he had such peculiar regard this my love continued mrs beaumont was all you know that your brother could with propriety say on such an occasion all indeed that i would permit him to say as to the rest on amelias account you know i could not refuse his request to continue his visits in this family on the same footing of friendship as usual whether this was the truth and the whole truth the mystery that involves all cabinet councils and more especially those of female politicians prevents the cautious historian from presuming to decide but arguing from general causes and from the established characters and ruling passions of the parties concerned we may safely conjecture that the baronet did not at this time make any decisive proposal to the lady but that he kept himself at liberty to advance or recede as circumstances should render it expedient his ruling passion was avarice and though he had been allured by the hints which his sister had thrown out concerning mrs beaumonts increased jointure and vast expectancies from mr palmer yet he was not so rash as to act decisively upon such vague information he had wisely determined to obtain accurate and positive evidence from captain lightbody who seemed in this case to be the common vouchee but lightbody happened to be gone out to shoot flappers consequently sir john wisely entrenched himself in general professions of regard to mrs beaumont and reflections on the happiness of being connected with such a respectable family mrs beaumont who understood the whole of the game now saw that her play must be to take captain lightbody again into her confidence ever careful not to commit herself she employed miss hunter to communicate her own scheme to the captain and to prepare him on the requisite points with proper answers to those inquiries which she foresaw the baronet would make you know my love said mrs beaumont you can find a proper moment to say all you wish to lightbody oh yes said miss hunter i will if i possibly can this day but it is so difficult to find a good time at dinner suppose said mrs beaumont at dinner surely maam thats an awkward time is not it for talking of secrets the best time in the world my dear you know we are to have the duttons and the lord knows whom besides to day and when theres a large company and every body talking at once and eating and drinking and carving it is the best time in the world you may say what you please your neighbours are all happily engaged too busy to mind you get near fat mr dutton and behind the screen of his prodigious elbow you will be comfortably recessed from curious impertinents my dear the most perfect solitude is not so convenient as one of these great dinners whilst mrs beaumont was demonstrating to miss hunter that the most convenient and secure time for a tte tte is at a large dinner she happened to look out of the window near which they were standing and she saw her son and daughter with mr palmer walking in the park they sat down under a tree within view of the house come away from the window my dear said mrs beaumont they will observe us and perhaps think we are plotting something i wonder what they are talking of look how earnestly amelia is stretching out her neck and mr palmer striking his cane upon the ground come back a little my dear come back you can see as well here but i see a gentleman on horseback galloping oh maam look he has stopped he has jumped off his horse captain walsingham it must be captain walsingham it really is said mrs beaumont pressing forward to look out of the window yet standing so that she could not be seen from without dear said miss hunter but how delighted mr beaumont seems and how mr palmer shakes captain walsinghams hand as if he had known him these hundred years what can make them so glad to see him do look at them maam i see it all said mrs beaumont with an involuntary sigh but dear mrs beaumont pursued miss hunter if he has actually come at last to propose for amelia dont you think he is doing it in a shabby sort of way when he has been in london too and if he has taken such a treasure too could not he have come down here a little more in style with some sort of an equipage of his own at least but now only look at him would you if you met him on the road know him from any common man another sigh deep and sincere was all the answer mrs beaumont made i am sure continued miss hunter as mrs beaumont drew her away from the window i am sure i think amelia has not gained much by the change of admirers for whats a captain of a ship he ranks with a colonel in the army to be sure said mrs beaumont but amelia might have looked much higher if she does not know her own interest and dignity that is not my fault if she had such a fortune as i shall have said miss hunter she might afford to marry for love because you know she could make her husband afterwards keep her proper equipages and take her to town and go into parliament and get a title for her too very true my darling said mrs beaumont who was at this instant so absent that she assented without having heard one syllable that her darling said but for amelia who has no such great fortune of her own it is quite another thing you know dearest mrs beaumont oh youll see how shell repent when she sees you lady puckeridge and herself plain mrs walsingham and when she sees the figure youll make in town next winter and the style my brother will live in oh then shell see what a difference there is between sir john hunter and captain walsingham very true indeed my dear said mrs beaumont and this time she did not answer without having heard the assertion the door opened captain walsingham dare i believe my eyes and do i see our friend captain walsingham again at last at last oh mrs beaumont you dont know how hard i have worked to get here how kind but wont you sit down and tell me no i can neither sit nor rest nor speak nor think upon any subject but one said captain walsingham thats right cried mr palmer mrs beaumont pardon my abruptness continued captain walsingham but you see before you a man whose whole happiness is at stake may i beg a few minutes conversation with you this instant said mrs beaumont hesitating but she saw that mr palmers eye was upon her so with a smile she complied immediately and giving her hand graciously to captain walsingham she accompanied him into a little reading room within the drawing room may i hope that we are friends said captain walsingham may i hope so mrs beaumont may i good heavens friends assuredly i hope so i have always had and expressed the highest opinion of you captain walsingham i have had one and hitherto but one opportunity of showing myself in any degree deserving of your esteem madam said captain walsingham when i was in this country some years ago you must have seen how passionately i was in love with your daughter but i knew that my circumstances were then such that i could not hope to obtain miss beaumonts hand and you will do me the justice to allow that i behaved with prudence of the difficulty of the task i alone can judge mrs beaumont declared that she admired captain walsinghams conduct inexpressibly now that she understood what his feelings and motives had been but really he had kept his own secret so honourably that she had not till within these few days when it was let out by mr walsingham to mr palmer had the most distant idea of his being attached to her daughter captain walsingham was too polite even to look a doubt of the truth of a ladys assertion he therefore believed because it was impossible mrs beaumont determining to make her story consistent repeated nearly what she had said to mr palmer and went on to confess that she had often with a mothers pride perhaps in her own secret thoughts wondered at the indifference captain walsingham showed towards amelia captain walsingham was surprised that mrs beaumonts penetration should have been so strangely mistaken especially as the symptoms of admiration and love must be so well known to a lady who had so many and such passionate admirers mrs beaumont smiled and observed that captain walsingham though a seaman had all the address of a courtier and she acknowledged that she loved address if by address mrs beaumont means politeness i admire it as much as she does but i disclaim and despise all that paltry system of artifice which is sometimes called address no person of a great mind ever condescends to use address in that sense of the word not because they cannot but because they will not certainly certainly said mrs beaumont there is nothing i love so much as frankness then frankly mrs beaumont may i hope for your approbation in addressing miss beaumont frankly then you have my full approbation this is the very thing i have long secretly wished as mr palmer can tell you you have ever been the son in law of my choice though not of my hopes delighted with this frank answer this full approbation this assurance that he had always been the son in law of her choice captain walsingham poured out his warm heart in joy and gratitude all suspicions of mrs beaumont were forgotten for suspicion was unnatural to his mind though he knew though he had experience almost from childhood of her character yet at this instant he thought he had till now been always prejudiced always mistaken happy those who can be thus duped by the warmth of their own hearts it is a happiness which they who smile in scorn at their credulity can never enjoy wakening a little to the use of his understanding captain walsingham disconcerted mrs beaumont by suddenly saying then there was not any truth in the report which i have heard with horror that you were going to marry miss beaumont to sir john hunter then there was not any truth in the report i heard with horror that you were going to marry yourself to a spanish nun said mrs beaumont who had learned from a veteran in public warfare that the best way to parry an attack is not to defend but to make an assault my dear captain walsingham added she with an arch smile i really thought you were a man of too much sense and above all too much courage to be terror struck by every idle report you should leave such horrors to us weak women to the visionary mind now i could not blame poor amelia if she were to ask then was there no truth in the report of the spanish incognita no no pursued mrs beaumont playfully refusing to hear captain walsingham not to me not to me must your defence be made appear before your judge appear before amelia i can only recommend you to mercy what a charming woman this mrs beaumont would be if one could feel quite sure of her sincerity thought captain walsingham as he followed the lady who with apparently playful but really polite grace thus eluded all further inquiry into her secret manoeuvres here my dearest amelia cried she is a culprit whom i am bringing to your august tribunal for mercy for justice said captain walsingham justice oh the pride of the mans heart and the folly who ever talks of justice to a woman my dear captain talk of mercy or cruelty if you will we ladies delight in being called cruel you know and sometimes are even pleased to be merciful but to be just is the last thing we think of so now for your trial public or private captain walsingham public as i am innocent oyes oyes all manner of men cried mr beaumont the spanish cause coming on cried mr palmer let me hear it and let me have a good seat that i may hear a seat near the judge oh you shall be judge mr palmer said amelia and here is the best seat for our good judge and you will remember said mr beaumont that it is the duty of a good judge to lean towards the prisoner to lean no to sit bolt upright as i will if i can said old mr palmer entering into the pleasantry of the young people as readily as if he had been the youngest man in the company as he looked round his good countenance beamed with benevolent pleasure now sir captain be pleased to inform the court what you have done or mean to do with a certain spanish nun whom as it is confidently asserted in a letter from one of your own men you carried off from her nunnery and did bring or cause to be brought with you to england my lord judge will you do me the favour or the justice to order that the letter alluded to may be read in court this was ordered and done accordingly my lord judge said captain walsingham i have nothing to object to the truth of the main points of this story and considering that it was told by a very young man and a traveller it contains but a reasonable share of travellers wonders considering the opportunity and temptation for embellishments afforded by such a romantic tale less has been added to it by the narrator than the usual progress of strange reports might have prepared me to expect it is most true as it has been stated that i did by her own desire carry away from a nunnery at this lady who was neither a nun nor a spanish lady nor as i am compelled by my regard to truth to add young nor yet handsome my lord judge far be it from me to impeach the veracity of the letter writer it is admitted by the highest and the lowest authorities that beauty is a matter of taste and that for taste there is no standard it is also notorious that to a sailor every woman is fair and young who is not as old as hecuba or as ugly as caifacaratadaddera i can therefore speak only to my own opinion and judgment and really my lord it grieves me much to spoil the romance to destroy the effect of a tale which might in future serve for the foundation of some novel over which belles and beaux yet unborn might weep and wonder it grieves me much i say to be compelled by the severity of this cross examination to declare the simple truth that there was no love in the case that to the very best of my belief and judgment the lady was not in love with any body much less with me as you have admitted sir said the judge as you have voluntarily stated that to a sailor every woman is fair and young who is not as old as hecuba or as ugly as that other woman with the unspeakable name you will be pleased to inform the court how it happened or how it was possible that in the course of a long voyage you could avoid falling in love with the damsel whom you had thus rescued and carried off experience shows us sir that at land and i presume at sea proximity is one of the most common causes of love now i understand she was the only woman you saw for some months and she had i think you allow possession of your cabin to and from which you had of course constant egress and regress sir human nature is human nature here is temptation and opportunity and circumstantial evidence enough in our days to hang a man what have you to offer in your defence young man the plain fact my lord is that instead of three months i was but three days in the dangerous state of proximity with the spanish lady but had it been three months or three years there is my defence my lord said captain walsingham bowing to amelia at the first blush you allow it i see to be powerful but how powerful you cannot feel as i do without having looked as i have done into the mind i have looked into the mind as well as you sir you have a great deal of assurance to tell me i cannot feel and judge as well as you can but nevertheless i shall do you justice i think your defence is sufficient i believe we must acquit him but pray the plain matter of fact which i wanted to hear i have not yet got at what have you done with this lady and where is she she was carried safely to her friends to her friend for she has but one friend that i could find out an old aunt who lives in an obscure lodging in a narrow street in london and upon honour this is all you know about her said mrs beaumont all except that she is in hopes of recovering some property of which she says she has been unjustly defrauded by some of her relations after i had paid my respects at the admiralty i made it my business to see the lady and to offer my services but into her lawsuits i thank god it was not my business to inquire i recommended to her a good honest lawyer and came here as fast as horses could carry me but was not there some giving of diamonds and exchanging of rings one day upon deck said mrs beaumont none said captain walsingham that was a mere fable of poor birchs imagination i recollect the lady showed me a spanish motto upon her ring that is all i can remember about rings she had no diamonds and very few clothes now cried captain walsingham growing a little impatient of the length of his trial for he had not yet been able to speak for more than an instant to amelia now i hope my trial is ended else its length will be as in some other cases the worst of punishments acquitted acquitted honourably acquitted said mr palmer acquitted acquitted honourably acquitted by general acclamation cried mr beaumont acquitted by a smile from amelia worth all our acclamations said mrs beaumont captain walsingham said miss hunter did the lady come to england and go to london in a spanish dress and long waist she spoke but captain walsingham did not hear her important question she turned to repeat it but the captain was gone and amelia with him bless me how quick how odd said miss hunter with a pouting look which seemed to add nobody carries me off mr beaumont looked duller than was becoming mrs beaumont applied herself to adjust the pretty curls of miss hunters hair and mr palmer in one of his absent fits hummed aloud as he walked up and down the room and its oh what will become of me oh what shall i do nobody coming to marry me nobody coming to woo chapter xv true loves the gift which god has givn to man alone beneath the heavn it is the secret sympathy the silver link the silken tie which heart to heart and mind to mind in body and in soul can bind happy love though the most delightful in reality is the most uninteresting in description and lovers are proverbially bad company except for one another therefore we shall not intrude on captain walsingham and amelia nor shall we give a journal of the days of courtship those days which by rousseau and many people have been pronounced to be the happiest by others the only happy days of existence and which by some privileged or prudent few have been found to be but the prelude to the increasing pleasures of domestic union now that mr beaumont saw his sister and his friend thus gratified in their mutual esteem and affection now that he saw all obstacles to their union removed he became uncontroulably impatient to declare his own attachment to miss walsingham my dear mother i can bear it no longer believe me you are mistaken in the whole romance you have imagined to yourself about miss hunter she is no more in love with me than i am with her since you fixed my attention upon her i have studied the young lady she is not capable of love i dont mean that she is not capable of wishing to be married but that is quite a different affair which need not give me any peculiar disturbance my dear mother find another husband for her and my life for it her heart will not break especially if you give her bales of wedding finery enough to think and talk about for a calendar year you abominably malicious monster of cruelty i will not smile nor will i allow you to indulge your humour in this manner at the expense of your poor victim victim never saw a girl look less like a victim except indeed as to her ornaments i believe it is the etiquette for victims to appear dressed out with garlands and ribands and flowers positively edward i wont allow you to go on in this style do you know you seriously hurt and offend me do you consider that miss hunters mother was my most intimate friend and this match i have anxiously wished in consequence of an agreement made between us at your birth and albinas oh maam those agreements never turned out well from the time of the arabian tales to the present moment and you must pardon me if after having tried all that reason and patience would do in vain i now come to impatience and a little innocent ridicule except by laughing i have no other way left of convincing you that i never can or will marry this young lady but so pretty a creature surely you have thought her pretty extremely pretty and i acknowledge that there have been moments when the influence of her beauty i cant call it prettiness joined to the power of my mothers irresistible address have almost lapped me in elysium a fools paradise but thank heaven and miss walsingham i unlapped myself and though the sweet airs took my fancy they never imprisoned my soul vastly poetical quite in the blue stocking style blue stocking dear mother that expression is not elegant enough for you that commonplace taunt is unworthy of my mother said mr beaumont warmly for he was thrown off his guard by the reflection implied on miss walsingham ignorant silly women may be allowed to sneer at information and talents in their own sex and if they have read them may talk of les prcieuses ridicules and les femmes savantes and may borrow from molire all the wit they want to support the cause of folly but from women who are themselves distinguished for talents such apostasy but i am speaking to my mother i forbear great forbearance to your mother you have shown in truth cried mrs beaumont reddening with genuine anger marry as you please i have done fool that i have been to devote my life to plans for the happiness and aggrandizement of my children it is now time i should think of myself you shall not see me the defeated deserted duped despised mother the old dowager permitted in the house of which she was once the mistress no no mr beaumont cried she rising indignantly this shall never never be touched and astonished by a burst of passion such as he scarcely had ever before seen from his mother mr beaumont stopped her as she rose and taking her hand in the most affectionate manner forgive me my dear mother the hasty words i said just now i was very much in the wrong i beg your pardon forgive your son mrs beaumont struggled to withdraw the hand which her son forcibly detained be always continued he be always mistress of this house of me and mine the chosen wife of my heart will never torment you or degrade herself with paltry struggles for power your days shall be happy and honoured believe me i speak from my heart mrs beaumont looked as if her anger had subsided yet as if struggling with unusual feelings she sat silent mr beaumont continued your son who is no sentimentalist no speech maker your son who has hitherto perhaps been too rough too harsh now implores you by these sincere caresses by all that is tender and true in nature to believe in the filial affection of your children give us simply give us your confidence and our confidence free and unconstrained shall be given in return then we shall be happy indeed touched vanquished mrs beaumont leaned her head on her son and said then we shall be happy indeed the exclamation was sincere at this moment she thought as she spoke all her schemes were forgotten the reversionary title the wigram estate all all forgotten miraculous eloquence and power of truth what happiness said mrs beaumont i ask no other you are right my dear son marry miss walsingham and we have enough and more than enough for happiness you are right and henceforward we shall have but one mind amongst us with true gratitude and joy her son embraced her and this was the most delightful perhaps the only really delightful moment she had felt for years she was sincere and at ease but this touch of nature strong as it was operated only for a moment habit resumed her influence art regained her pupil and her slave captain lightbody and miss hunter came into the room and with them came low thoughts of plots and notes and baronets and equipages and a reversionary title and the wigram estate what different ideas of happiness her son in the mean time had started up mounted his horse and had galloped off to realize some of his ideas of felicity by the immediate offer of his hand to the lady who possessed his whole heart cool as policy just recovered from the danger of imprudent sensibility could make her mrs beaumont was now all herself again have you found much amusement shooting this morning lightbody said she carelessly no maam done nothing just nothing at all for i met sir john in the grounds and could not leave him poor sir john maam i tell him we must get him a crook he is quite turned despairing shepherd never saw a man so changed upon my soul he is seriously now mrs beaumont you need not laugh i always told sir john that his time of falling in love would come and come it has at last with a vengeance oh nonsense nonsense lightbody this to me and of sir john hunter though mrs beaumont called it and thought it nonsense yet it flattered her and though she appeared half offended by flattery so gross as to seem almost an insult upon her understanding yet her vanity was secretly gratified even by feeling that she had dependents who were thus obliged to flatter and though she despised captain lightbody for the meanness yet he made his court to her successfully by persisting in all the audacity of adulation she knew sir john hunter too well to believe that he was liable to fall in love with any thing but a fair estate or a fine fortune yet she was gratified by feeling that she possessed so great a share of those charms which age cannot wither of that substantial power to which men do not merely feign in poetical sport to submit or to which they are slaves only for a honey moon but to which they do homage to the latest hour of life with unabating with increasing devotion besides this sense of pleasure arising from calculation it may be presumed that like all other female politicians our heroine had something of the woman lurking at her heart something of that feminine vanity which inclines to believe in the potency of personal charms even when they are in the wane captain lightbodys asseverations and the notes sir john hunter wrote to his sister were at last listened to by mrs beaumont with patience and even with smiles and after it had been sufficiently reiterated that really it was using sir john hunter ill not to give him some more decisive answer when he was so unhappy so impatient she at length exclaimed well lightbody tell your friend sir john then since it must be so i will consult my friends and see what can be done for him when may i say for i dare not see sir john again positively i dare not meet him without having some hope to give something decisive he says the next time he comes here he must be allowed to make it known to the family that he is mrs beaumonts admirer so when may i say oh dearest mrs beaumont cried miss hunter say to morrow to morrow impossible but when said miss hunter only look at my brothers note to me again you see he is afraid of being cast off at last as he was before about amelia if mr palmer should object and he says this disappointment would be such a very different affair indeed said captain lightbody i who am in sir johns confidence can vouch for that for i have reason to believe that that the connexion was the charm and that the daughter would not have been thought of stop i was charged not to say this but when mrs beaumont to return to my point oh name an early day cried miss hunter in a fondling tone name an early day for my brothers coming and then you know it will be so nice to have the wedding days fixed for both marriages and dearest mrs beaumont remember i am to be your brides maid and well have a magnificent wedding and i shall be brides maid the dear innocent little creature how mad she is with spirits well you shall be my brides maid if the thing takes place if if to the winds captain lightbody tell my brother no ill write myself and tell him he may come how she distresses me but she is so affectionate one does not know how to be angry with her but my dear as to naming the day when he may publicly declare himself i cannot for you know i have to break the affair to mr palmer and to my son and daughter and i must take my own time and find a happy moment for this so name a day i cannot but in general and its always safest to use general terms you may say soon this was mrs beaumonts ultimatum the note was written accordingly and committed to the care of the confidential captain this business of mysterious note writing and secret negotiations was peculiarly suited to our heroines genius and taste considering the negotiation to be now in effect brought within view of a happy termination her ambassador furnished with her ultimatum having now actually set out on his ostensible mission of duck shooting our fair negotiatrix prepared to show the usual degree of gratitude towards those who had been the principal instruments of her success the proper time she thought was now arrived when having no further occasion for miss hunters services she might finally undeceive her young friend as to any hopes she might retain of a union with mr beaumont and she felt that it was now indispensably necessary to disclose the truth that her son had declared his attachment to miss walsingham mrs beaumont opened the delicate case with a sigh which claimed the notice of her young confidante what a deep sigh said miss hunter who was perfect to use a musical term in her lessons pour observer les soupirs what a sigh i hope it was for my poor brother ah no my love for one nearer my heart for you for me dear me you see before you a mother all of whose fondest wishes and plans are doomed to be frustrated by her children amelia would have her way i was forced to yield my son follows her example insists upon marrying without fortune or extraordinary beauty or any of the advantages which i had fondly pointed out in the daughter in law of my heart you turn away from me my darling how shall i go on how shall i tell you all the terrible truth oh maam pray go on pray tell me all miss walsingham thats all in one word these walsinghams have forced themselves into my family fairly outwitted me i cannot tell you how much how deeply i am mortified thank heaven i am not mortified cried miss hunter throwing back her head with pettish disdain mrs beaumont who had prepared herself for a fainting fit or at least for a flood of tears rejoiced to see this turn in the young ladys temper thats right my own love hew i admire your spirit this pride becomes you and is what i expected from your understanding set a just value upon yourself and show it i should set but little value on myself indeed if i did not think myself equal to miss walsingham but mr beaumont knows best not best i fear said mrs beaumont but from a child he was ever the most self willed uncontrollable being there was no moving no persuading him there was no power no appeal my love i did not try dear maam i am excessively sorry you did why my dear i could not refrain from doing all i could not only for my sons sake but for yours when i saw your affections as i feared so deeply engaged but your present magnanimity gives me hopes that the shock will not be irrecoverable irrecoverable no really maam if mr beaumont expects to see me wear the willow for him all my life his vanity will be mistaken certainly my dear replied mrs beaumont you would not be so weak as to wear the willow for any man a young lady of your fortune should never wear the weeping but the golden willow turn your pretty little face again towards me and smile once more upon me miss hunter had sat with her face turned from mrs beaumont during the whole of this dialogue as if by hiding her face she could conceal the emotions of her mind from me thought her penetrating observer spare me spare me dearest mrs beaumont cried miss hunter hiding her face on the arm of the sofa and seeming now disposed to pass from the heights of anger to the depths of despair mrs beaumont less hard hearted than some politicians who care not who dies or lives provided they attain their own objects now listened at least with seeming commiseration to her young friend who with intermitting sighs and in a voice which her position or her sobs rendered scarcely audible talked of dying and of never marrying any other man upon the earth not much alarmed however by the dying words of young ladies mrs beaumont confined her attention to the absurdity of the resolution against marriage in general and at this instant formed a plan of marrying miss hunter to one of her nephews instead of her son she had one unmarried nephew a young man of good figure and agreeable manners but with only a younger brothers portion to him she thought miss hunters large fortune would be highly convenient and she had reason to believe that his taste in the choice of a wife would be easily governed by her advice or by his interest thus she could at least prevent her young friends affections and fortune from going out of the family in consequence of this glimpse of a new scheme our indefatigable politician applied herself to prepare the way for it with her wonted skill she soothed the lovelorn and pettish damsel with every expression that could gratify pride and rouse high thoughts of revenge she suggested that instead of making rash vows of celibacy which would only show forlorn constancy miss hunter should abide by her first spirited declaration never to wear the willow for any man and that the best way to assert her own dignity would be to marry as soon as possible after having given this consolatory advice mrs beaumont left the young ladys grief to wear itself out i know my love added she a friend of mine who would die for the happiness which my obstinate son does not it seems know how to value who maam said miss hunter raising her head im sure i cant guess whom you can possibly mean who maam ah my dear excuse me said mrs beaumont that is a secret i cannot tell you yet when you are fit to hear yourself convinced may be i may obtain leave to tell you your admirers name i can assure you hes a very fashionable and a very agreeable man a great favourite with our sex a particular friend of mine and an officer lord bless me exclaimed miss hunter starting quite up an officer i cant imagine whom you mean dear mrs beaumont whom can you mean mrs beaumont walked towards the door only tell me one thing dearest mrs beaumont did i ever see him mrs beaumont wisely declining to answer any more questions at present quitted the room and left miss hunter dying with curiosity the new delight of this fresh project with the prospect of bringing to a happy termination her negotiation with sir john hunter sustained mrs beaumonts spirits in the midst of the disappointments she experienced respecting the marriages of her son and daughter and enabled her with less effort of dissimulation to take apparently a share in the general joy which now pervaded her family her son expressed his felicity with unbounded rapture when he found his proposal to miss walsingham graciously received by the object of his affections and by all her family his gratitude to his mother for no longer opposing his wishes gave a tenderness to his manner which would have touched any heart but that of a politician amelia also even in the midst of her love for captain walsingham was anxiously intent upon showing dutiful attention to her mother and upon making her some amends for the pain she had caused her of late whenever the brother and sister were together in all their views of future happiness their mother was one of their principal objects and these dispositions both miss walsingham and captain walsingham were earnest to confirm no young people could have higher ideas than they had of the duty of children towards parents and of the delight of family confidence and union in former times when mr beaumont had been somewhat to blame in the roughness of his sincerity towards his mother and when he had been disposed to break from her artful restraints captain walsingham by his conversation and by his letters had always used his power and influence to keep him within bounds and whenever he could do so with truth to raise mrs beaumont in his opinion she now appeared in a more advantageous light to her family and they were more disposed to believe in her sincerity than they had ever been since the credulous days of childhood the days of love and childhood are perhaps in good minds almost equally credulous or at least confiding even mr walsingham was won over by the pleasure he felt in the prospect of his daughters happiness and good mr palmer was ten times more attentive than ever to madam beaumont in his attention however there was something more ceremonious than formerly it was evident for he was too honest to conceal his feelings that his opinion of her was changed and that his attention was paid to her rather as the widow of his old friend than on her own account amelia who particularly remarked this change and who feared that it must be severely painful to her mother tried by every honest art of kindness to reinstate her in his regard amelia however succeeded only in raising herself in his esteem do not disturb yourself my dear young lady said he to her one day about your mother and me things are on their right footing between us and can never be on any other she you see is quite satisfied mrs beaumont indeed had not amelias quick sensibility with regard to the real affections of her friends though she was awake to every external mark of attention she was content as mr palmer before others always treated her with marked deference and gave her no reason to apprehend any alteration in his testamentary dispositions when settlements were talked of for the intended marriages mr palmer seemed to consider mrs beaumont first in all their consultations appealed for her opinion and had ever a most cautious eye upon her interests this she observed with satisfaction and she was gratified by the demonstrations of increased regard from her son and daughter because she thought it would facilitate her projects she wished that her marriage with sir john hunter should appear well to the world and for this reason she desired that it should seem to be liked by all her family seem for as to their real opinions she was indifferent things were in this situation when mrs beaumont caused herself to be surprised one morning by mr palmer with a letter in her hand deep in reverie oh my dear mr palmer is it you cried she starting very naturally i was really so lost in thought mr palmer hoped that he did not disturb her disturb me no my good friend you are the very person i wished to consult her eye glanced again and again upon the letter she held in her hand but mr palmer seemed provokingly destitute of curiosity he however took a chair and his snuff box and with a polite but cold manner said he was much honoured by her consulting him but that of course his judgment could be of little service to a lady of mrs beaumonts understanding understanding ah said she there are cases where understanding is of no use to women but quite the contrary mr palmer did not contradict the assertion nor did he assent to it but waited with a pinch of snuff arrested in its way to have the cases specified in love affairs for instance we poor women said mrs beaumont looking down prettily but mr palmer afforded no assistance to her bashful hesitation she was under the necessity of finishing her sentence or of beginning another upon a different construction the latter was most convenient and she took a new and franker tone heres a letter from poor sir john hunter mr palmer still sat bending forward to listen with the most composed deference but pressed not in the slightest degree upon her confidence by any question or look down towards the letter or up towards the ladys face but straightforward looked he till quite provoked by his dulness mrs beaumont took the matter up again and in a new tone said to be candid with you my dear friend this is a subject on which i feel some awkwardness and reluctance in speaking to you for of all men breathing i should in any important action of my life wish for your approbation and yet on the present occasion i fear and so does sir john that you will utterly disapprove of the match she paused again to be asked what match but compelled by her auditors invincible silence to make out her own case she proceeded you must know my good sir that sir john hunter is it seems unconquerably bent upon a connexion with this family for being refused by the daughter he has proposed for the mother yes said mr palmer bowing i thought you would have been more surprised said mrs beaumont i am glad the first sound of the thing does not as i was afraid it would startle or revolt you startle me it could not madam said mr palmer for i have been prepared for it some time past is it possible and who could have mentioned it to you captain lightbody captain lightbody cried mr palmer with a sudden flash of indignation believe me madam i never thought of speaking to captain lightbody of your affairs i am not in the habit of listening to such people but still he might have spoken no madam no he would not have dared to bring me secret information honourable quite honourable but then my dear sir how came you to know the thing i saw it you know madam those who stand by always see more than the players and do you think my son and daughter and captain walsingham know it too i fancy not for they have not been standers by they have been deeply engaged themselves thats well for i wished to have your opinion and advice in the first place before i hinted it even to them or any one else living as i feared the match would not meet your approbation i told sir john so and i gave him only a provisional consent like the provisional consent of that young irish lady said mr palmer laughing who went through the marriage service with her lover adding at the end of each response provided my father gives his consent but madam though i am old enough certainly to be your father yet even if i had the honour to be so in reality as you are arrived at years of discretion you know you cannot need my consent but seriously my excellent friend cried she i never could be happy in marrying against your approbation and let me in my own vindication explain to you the whole of the affair here mr palmer dreading one of her long explanations which he knew he should never comprehend besought her not to invest him with the unbecoming character of her judge he represented that no vindication was necessary and that none could be of any use she however persisted in going through a sentimental defence of her conduct she assured mr palmer that she had determined never to marry again that her inviolable respect for her dear colonel beaumonts memory had induced her to persist in this resolution for many years that motives of delicacy and generosity were what first prevailed with her to listen to sir johns suit and that now she consoled and supported herself by the proud reflection that she was acting as her dear colonel beaumont himself could he know the circumstances and read her heart would wish and enjoin her to act here a smile seemed to play upon mr palmers countenance but the smile had vanished in an instant and was followed by a sudden gush of tears which were as suddenly wiped away not however before they reminded mrs beaumont to spread her handkerchief before her face perhaps resumed she after a decent pause perhaps i am doing wrong with the best intentions some people think that widows should never on any account marry again and perhaps mr palmer is of this opinion no by no means said mr palmer nor was colonel beaumont often and often he said in his letters to me that he wished his wife to marry again after he was gone and to be as happy after his death as she had been during his life i only hope that your choice may fulfil may justify mr palmer stopped again something in shakspeare about preying on garbage ran in his head and when mrs beaumont went on to some fresh topics of vindication and earnestly pressed for his advice he broke up the conference by exclaiming fore jupiter madam we had better say nothing more about the matter for after all what can the wit of man or woman make of it but that you choose to marry sir john hunter and that nobody in the world has a right to object to it there is certainly no occasion to use any management with me and your eloquence is only wasting itself for i am not so presumptuous or so unreasonable as to set myself up for the judge of your actions you do me honour by consulting me but as you already know my opinion of the gentleman i must decline saying any thing further on the subject mrs beaumont was left in a painful state of doubt as to the main point whether mr palmer would or would not alter his will however as she was determined that the match should be accomplished she took advantage of the declaration mr palmer made that he had no right to object to her following her own inclinations and she told sir john hunter that mr palmer was perfectly satisfied and that he had indeed relieved her mind from some foolish scruples by having assured her that it was colonel beaumonts particular wish often expressed in his confidential letters that his widow should marry again so far so good then the affair was to be broken to her son and daughter she begged mr palmer would undertake for her sake this delicate task but he declined it with a frank simplicity surely madam said he you can speak without difficulty to your own son and daughter and i have through life observed that employing one person to speak to another is almost always hurtful i should not presume however to regulate your conduct madam by my observations i should only give this as a reason for declining the office with which you proposed to honour me the lady compelled to speak for herself to her son and daughter opened the affair to them with as much delicacy and address as she had used with mr palmer their surprise was great for they had not the most remote idea of her intentions the result of a tedious conversation of three hours length was perfectly satisfactory to her though it would have been to the highest degree painful and mortifying to a woman of more feeling or one less intent upon an establishment a reversionary title and the wigram estate how low she sunk in the opinion of her children and her friends was comparatively matter of small consequence to mrs beaumont provided she could keep fair appearances with the world whilst her son and daughter were so much ashamed of her intended marriage that they would not communicate their sentiments even to each other they with becoming duty agreed that mrs beaumont was very good in speaking to them on the subject as she had an uncontroulable right to marry as she thought proper mrs beaumont now wrote letters innumerable to her extensive circle of connexions and acquaintance announcing her approaching nuptials and inviting them to her wedding it was settled by mrs beaumont that the three marriages should take place on the same day this point she laboured with her usual address and at last brought the parties concerned to give up their wishes for a private wedding to gratify her love for show and parade nothing now remained but to draw the settlements mrs beaumont who piqued herself upon her skill in business and who thought the sum of wisdom was to excel in cunning looked over her lawyers drafts and suggested many nice emendations which obtained for her from an attorney the praise of being a vastly clever woman sir john was not on his side deficient in attention to his own interests never was there a pair better matched in this respect never were two people going to be married more afraid that each should take the other in sir john however pressed forward the business with an eagerness that surprised every body mrs beaumont again and again examined the settlements to try to account prudentially for her lovers impatience but she saw that all was right there on her part and her self love at last acquiesced in the belief that sir johns was now the ardour of a real lover to the ladys entire satisfaction the liveries the equipages the diamonds the wedding clothes were all bought and the wedding day approached mrs beaumonts rich and fashionable connexions and acquaintance all promised to grace her nuptials nothing was talked of but the preparations for mrs beaumont and sir john hunters marriage and so full of business and bustle and mysteries and sentimentalities and vanities was she that she almost forgot that any body was to be married but herself the marriages of her son and daughter seemed so completely to merge in the importance and splendour of her own that she merely recollected them as things that were to be done on the same day as subordinate parts that were to be acted by inferior performers whilst she should engross the public interest and applause in the mean time miss hunter was engaged to mrs beaumonts satisfaction and her own in superintending the wedding dresses and in preparing the most elegant dress imaginable for herself as brides maid now and then she interrupted these occupations with sighs and fits of pretty sentimental dejection but mrs beaumont was well convinced that a new lover would soon make her forget her disappointment the nephew was written to and invited to spend some time with his aunt immediately after her marriage for she determined that miss hunter should be her niece since she could not be her daughter this secondary intrigue went on delightfully in our heroines imagination without interfering with the main business of her own marriage the day the long expected day that was to crown all her hopes at length arrived chapter xvi on peut tre plus fin quun autre mais pas plus fin que tous les autres rochefoucault the following paragraph extracted from the newspapers of the day will doubtless be acceptable to a large class of readers fashionable hymeneals yesterday sir john hunter of hunter hall devonshire bart led to the hymeneal altar the accomplished mrs beaumont relict of the late colonel beaumont of beaumont park on the same day her son and daughter were also married mr beaumont to miss walsingham daughter of e walsingham esq of walsingham house and miss beaumont to captain walsingham of the navy a near relation of edward walsingham esq of walsingham house these nuptials in the beaumont family were graced by an overflowing concourse of beauty nobility and fashion comprehending all the relations connexions intimate friends and particular acquaintances of the interesting and popular mrs beaumont the cavalcade reached from the principal front of the house to the south gate of the park a distance of three quarters of a mile mrs beaumont and her daughter two lovely brides in a superb landau were attired in the most elegant becoming fashionable and costly manner their dress consisting of the finest lace over white satin mrs beaumonts was point lace and she was also distinguished by a long veil of the most exquisite texture which added a tempered grace to beauty in its meridian in the same landau appeared the charming brides maids all in white of course among these miss hunter attracted particular attention by the felicity of her costume her drapery which was of delicate lace being happily adapted to show to the greatest advantage the captivating contour of her elegant figure and ornamented with white silk fringe and tassels marked every airy motion of her sylph like form the third bride on this auspicious day was miss walsingham who with her father and brides maids followed in mr walsinghams carriage miss walsingham we are informed was dressed with simple elegance in the finest produce of the indian loom but as she was in a covered carriage we could not obtain a full view of her attire next to the brides equipages followed the bridegrooms and chief of these sir john hunter sported a splendid barouche he was dressed in the height of the ton and his horses deserved particular admiration after sir johns barouche came the equipage belonging to mr beaumont highly finished but plain in this were the two bridegrooms mr beaumont and captain walsingham accompanied by mr palmer the great west indian palmer who we understand is the intimate friend and relative of the beaumont family then followed as our correspondent counted above a hundred carriages of distinction with a prodigious cavalcade of gentry the whole was closed by a long line of attendants and domestics the moment the park gates were opened groups of young girls of the beaumont tenantry habited in white with knots of ribands and emblematical devices suited to the occasion and with baskets of flowers in their hands began to strew vegetable incense before the brides especially before mrs beaumonts landau and whilst the priests accuse the brides delay roses and myrtles still obstruct her way the crowd which assembled as they proceeded along the road to the church and in the churchyard was such that however gratefully it evinced the popularity of the amiable parties it became at last evidently distressing to the principal object of their homage mrs beaumont who could not have stood the gaze of public admiration but for the friendly and becoming yet tantalizing refuge of her veil constables were obliged to interfere to clear the path to the church door and the amiable almost fainting lady was from the arms of her anxious and alarmed brides maids lifted out of her landau and supported into the church and up the aisle with all the marked gallantry of true tenderness by her happy bridegroom sir john hunter after the ceremony was over sir john and lady hunter and the two other new married couples returned to beaumont park with the cortge of their friends where the company partook of an elegant collation the artless graces and fascinating affability of lady hunter won all hearts and the wit festive spirits and politeness of sir john attracted universal admiration not to say envy of all present immediately after the collation the happy couple set off for their seat at hunter hall mr beaumont and the new mrs beaumont remained at beaumont park captain and mrs walsingham repaired to mr walsinghams it is a singular circumstance communicated to us by the indisputable authority of one of the brides maids that miss walsingham as it was discovered after the ceremony was actually married with her gown the wrong side outwards whether this be an omen announcing good fortune to all the parties concerned we cannot take upon us to determine but this much we may safely assert that never distinguished female in the annals of fashion was married under more favourable auspices than the amiable lady hunter and it is universally acknowledged that no lady is better suited to be as in the natural course of things she will soon be countess of puckeridge and at the head of the great wigram estate so ends our newspaper writer probably this paragraph was sent to the press before the fashionable hymeneals had actually taken place this may in some measure account for the extraordinary omissions in the narrative after the three marriages had been solemnized just when the ceremony was over and lady hunter was preparing to receive the congratulations of the brilliant congregation she observed that the clergyman instead of shutting his book kept it open before him and looked round as if expecting another bride mrs beaumont we should say lady hunter curtsied to him smiled and made a sign that the ceremony was finished but at this instant to her astonishment she saw her brides maid miss hunter quit her place and beheld captain lightbody seize her hand and lead her up towards the altar lady hunter broke through the crowd that was congratulating her and reaching miss hunter drew her hack forcibly and whispered are you mad miss hunter is this a place a time for frolic what are you about going to be married maam following your ladyships good example answered her brides maid flippantly at the same time springing forward from the detaining grasp regardless even of the rent she made in her lace dress she hurried or was hurried on by captain lightbody captain lightbody cried lady hunter but answering only with a triumphant bow he passed on with his bride heavens will nobody stop him cried lady hunter over taking them again as they reached the steps she addressed herself to the clergyman sir she is a ward in chancery and under my protection they have no licence their banns have not been published you cannot dare not surely marry them pardon me lady hunter said captain lightbody i have shown mr twigg my licence i have seen it i thought it was with your ladyships knowledge replied mr twigg i i cannot object it would be at my own peril if there is any lawful impediment your ladyship will make it at the proper response a friend of captain lightbodys appeared in readiness to give the young lady away the ceremony must go on madam said the clergyman at your peril sir said lady hunter this young lady is a ward of chancery and not of age i am of age of age last month cried the bride not till next year of age last month i have the parish register said captain lightbody go on sir if you please good heavens miss hunter can you bear said lady hunter to be the object of this indecent altercation retire with me and only let me speak to you i conjure you no the young lady stood her ground resolute to be a bride if there is any lawful impediment your ladyship will please to make it at the proper response said the chaplain i am under a necessity of proceeding the ceremony went on lady hunter in high indignation retired immediately to the vestry room with her bridegroom at least cried she throwing herself upon a seat it shall never be said that i countenanced by my presence such a scandalous marriage oh sir john hunter why did you not interfere to save your own sister save her egad she did not choose to be saved who can save a woman that does not choose it what could i do is not she your ladyships pupil he he he but ill fight the rascal directly if that will give you any satisfaction and he shall have a lawsuit too for her fortune said lady hunter for she is not of age i have a memorandum in an old pocket book oh who would have thought such a girl could have duped me so lady hunters exclamations were interrupted by the entrance of her son and daughter who came to offer what consolation they could the brilliant congregation poured in a few minutes afterwards with their mingled congratulations and condolence eager above all things to satisfy their curiosity captain lightbody with invincible assurance came up just as lady hunter was getting into her carriage and besought permission to present his bride to her but lady hunter turning her back upon him without reply said to her son if captain lightbody is going to beaumont park i am not going there mrs lightbody who was now emancipated from all control and from all sense of propriety called out from her own carriage in which she was seated that thank heaven she had a house of her own to go to and that nothing was farther from her thoughts than to interrupt the festivities of lady hunters more mature nuptials delighted with having made this tart answer mrs lightbody ordered her husband to order her coachman to drive off as fast as possible the captain by her particular desire had taken a house for her at brighton the gayest place she could think of we leave this amiable bride rejoicing in the glory of having duped a lady of mrs beaumonts penetration and her bridegroom rejoicing still more in the parish register by the help of which he hoped to obtain full enjoyment of what he knew to be his brides most valuable possession her portion and to defy lady hunters threatened lawsuit in the mean time lady hunter in her point lace and beautiful veil seated beside her baronet in his new barouche endeavoured to forget this interruption of her triumph she considered that though miss hunters fortune was lost to her family yet the title of countess and the wigram estate were secure this was solid consolation and recovering her features from their unprecedented discomposure she forced smiles and looks suitable to the occasion as she bowed to congratulating passengers arrived at beaumont park she prepared without appetite to partake of the elegant collation and to do the honours with her accustomed grace she took care to seat mr palmer beside her that she might show the world on what good terms they were together she was pleased to see that though two younger brides sat near her she engaged by far the largest share of public admiration they were so fully content and engrossed by their own feelings that they did not perceive that they were what is called thrown into the shade all the pride pomp and circumstance of these glorious hymeneals appeared to them but as a dream or as a scene that was acting before them in which they were not called to take a part towards the end of the collation one of the guests my lord rider a nobleman who always gave himself the air of being in a prodigious hurry declared that he was under the necessity of going off for he expected a person to meet him at his house in town on some particular business at an appointed day his lordships travelling companion who was unwilling to quit so prematurely the present scene of festivity observed that the man of business had engaged to write to his lordship and that he should at least wait till the post should come in lady hunter politely sent to inquire if any letters had arrived for his lordship and in consequence of his impatience all the letters for the family were brought lady hunter distributed them there was one for captain walsingham with a spanish motto on the seal lady hunter as she gave it to him whispered to amelia dont be jealous my dear but that i can tell you is a letter from his spanish incognita amelia smiled with a look of the most perfect confidence and love captain walsingham immediately opened the letter and looking at the signature said it is not from my spanish incognita it is from her aunt i will read it by and by a fine evasion indeed exclaimed lady hunter look how coolly he puts it into his pocket ah my credulous amelia do you allow him to begin in this manner pursued she in a tone of raillery yet as if she really suspected something wrong in the letter and have you no curiosity mrs walsingham amelia declared that she had none that she was not one of those who think that jealousy is the best proof of love right right said mr palmer confidence is the best proof of love and yours ill venture to say is and ever will be well placed captain walsingham with a grateful smile took his letter again out of his pocket and immediately began to read it in a low voice to amelia lady hunter and mr palmer dear sir though almost a stranger to you i should think myself wanting in gratitude if i did not after all the services you have done my family write to thank you in my nieces name and in my own and much i regret that my words will so ill convey to you the sentiments of our hearts i am an old woman not well accustomed to use my pen in the way of letter writing but can say truly that whilst i have life i shall be grateful to you you have restored me to happiness by restoring to me my long lost niece it will i am sure give you satisfaction to hear that my niece captain walsingham stopped short with a look which confirmed lady hunter in all her suspicions which made mr palmer take out his snuff box which startled even mr beaumont but which did not raise in the mind of amelia the slightest feeling of doubt or suspicion she smiled and looked round at her alarmed friends with a manner which seemed to say can you suppose it possible that there can be any thing wrong pray go on captain walsingham said lady hunter unless unless you have particular very particular reasons i have particular very particular reasons said captain walsingham and since turning to amelia this confiding lady does not insist upon my going on oh said lady hunter gaily snatching the letter i am not such a credulous or as you call it confiding lady i beg of your ladyship not to read it said captain walsingham in an earnest tone you beg of me not to read it and with that alarmed look oh positively i must and will read it not at present then i entreat you this very instant cried lady hunter affecting all the imperious vivacity of a young bride under favour of which she determined to satisfy her malicious curiosity pray lady hunter do not read it repeated captain walsingham laying his hand over the letter it is for your own sake added he in a low and earnest voice it is for your own sake not mine that i beg of you to forbear lady hunter imagining this to be only a subterfuge drew the letter from beneath captain walsinghams hand exclaiming for my sake oh captain that is a charming ruse de guerre but do not hope that it shall succeed oh mother believe him believe him cried amelia i am sure he tells you the truth and he speaks for your sake not for his own amelia interceded in vain mr palmer patted amelias shoulder fondly saying you are a dear good creature a dear credulous creature exclaimed lady hunter she had now undisturbed possession of the letter captain walsingham stood by with a face of great concern in which amelia and mr beaumont without knowing the cause seemed to sympathize the contest had early attracted the attention of all within hearing or view of her ladyship and by this time had been pointed out and accounted for in whispers even to the most remote parts of the room so that the eyes of almost every individual in the assembly were now fixed upon lady hunter she had scarcely glanced her eye upon the letter when she turned pale as death and exclaimed he knew it he knew it then recollecting herself she made a struggle to conceal her dismay the forced smile quivered on her lip she fell back in a swoon and was carried out of the room by her son and daughter sir john hunter was at another table eating eel pie and was the last person present who was made to understand what had happened it is the damned heat of the room i suppose said he that made her faint and swallowing the last morsel on his plate and settling his collar he came up to captain walsingham whats this i hear that lady hunter has fainted i hope they have carried her into the air but wheres the letter they say affected her so in my pocket said captain walsingham coolly any thing new in it said sir john with a sulky fashionable indifference nothing new to you probably sir john said captain walsingham walking away from him in disgust i suppose it was the heat overcame lady hunter continued sir john speaking to those who stood near him is any body gone to see how she is now i wonder if theyll let me in to see her with assumed carelessness but with real embarrassment the bridegroom went to inquire for his bride good mr palmer went soon afterwards and knocked softly at the ladys door is poor lady hunter any better oh yes quite well again now cried lady hunter raising herself from the bed on which she had been laid but mr palmer thought as he saw her through the half opened door she still looked a deplorable spectacle in all her wedding finery quite well again now it was nothing in the world but the heat amelia my love go back to the company and say so lest my friends should be uneasy thank you kind mr palmer for coming to see me excuse my not being able to let you in now for i must change my dress sir john sends me word his barouche will be at the door in ten minutes and i have to hurry on my travelling dress excuse me mr palmer retired seeing clearly that she wished to avoid any explanation of the real cause of her fainting in the gallery leading from her room he met captain walsingham who was coming to inquire for lady hunter poor woman do you know the cause of her fainting said captain walsingham no and i believe she does not wish me to know it therefore dont tell it me said mr palmer it is a secret that must be in the public papers in a few days said captain walsingham this lady that i brought over from lisbon well what can she have to say to mrs beaumont nothing to mrs beaumont but a great deal to lady hunter you may remember that i mentioned to you that some of her relations had contrived to have her kept in that convent abroad and had spread a report of her death that the heir at law might defraud her of her property and get and keep possession of a large estate which fell to him in case of her death of further particulars or even of the name of this estate i knew nothing till this morning when that letter from the aunt here it is tells me that the estate to which her niece was entitled is the great wigram estate and that old wigram was the rascally heir at law the lawyer i recommended to the lady was both an honest and a clever fellow and he represented so forcibly to old wigram the consequences of his having his fraud brought to light in a court of equity that he made him soon agree to a private reference the affair has been compromised and settled thus the possession of the estate is given up just as it stands to the rightful owner and she forbears to call the old sinner to an account for past arrears she will let him make it out to the world and to his own conscience if he can that he bona fide believed her to be dead so said mr palmer so end madam beaumonts hopes of being at the head of the wigram estate and so end her hopes of being a countess and actually married to this ruined spendthrift now we see the reason he pressed on the match so and urged her to marry him before the affair should become public she is duped and for life poor madam beaumont at this moment lady hunter came out of her room after having changed her dress and repaired her smiles ready for my journey now said she passing by mr palmer quickly i must show myself to the world of friends below and bid them adieu one word captain walsingham theres no occasion you know whispered she to say any thing below of that letter i really dont believe it too proud to let her mortification be known lady hunter constrained her feelings with all her might she appeared once more with a pleased countenance in the festive assembly she received their compliments and congratulations and invited them with all the earnestness of friendship to favour sir john and her as soon as possible with their company at hunter hall the company were now fast departing carriages came to the door in rapid succession lady hunter went through with admirable grace and variety the sentimental ceremony of taking leave and when her splendid barouche was at the door and when she was to bid adieu to her own family still she acted her part inimitably in all the becoming mixed smiles and tears of a bride she was seen embracing by turns her beloved daughter and son and daughter in law and son in law over and over again in the hall on the steps to the last moment contriving to be torn delightfully from the bosom of her family by her impatient bridegroom seated beside him in his barouche she kissed her hand to mr palmer smiled all her family who stood on the steps bowed and sir john drove away with his prize hes a swindler cried mr palmer and she is amelias mother interrupted captain walsingham right said mr palmer but amelia had a father too my excellent friend colonel beaumont whom she and her brother resemble in all that is open hearted and honourable well well i make no reflections i hate moral reflections every body can think and feel for themselves i presume i only say thank heaven weve done with manoeuvring almeria john hodgkinson was an eminent and wealthy yorkshire grazier who had no children of his own but who had brought up in his family almeria turnbull the daughter of his wife by a former husband a mr turnbull mr turnbull had also been a grazier but had not been successful in the management of his affairs therefore he could not leave his daughter any fortune and at the death of her mother she became entirely dependent on her father in law old hodgkinson was a whimsical man who except in eating and drinking had no inclination to spend any part of the fortune he had made but enjoying the consequence which money confers endeavoured to increase this importance by keeping all his acquaintance in uncertainty as to what he called his testamentary dispositions sometimes he hinted that his step daughter should be a match for the proudest riband in england sometimes he declared that he did not know of what use money could be to a woman except to make her a prey to a fortune hunter and that his girl should not be left in a way to be duped as to his daughters education that was an affair in which he did not interfere all that he wished was that the girl should be kept humble and have no fine notions put into her head nor any communication with fine people he kept company only with men of his own sort and as he had no taste for any kind of literature almerias time would have hung rather heavy upon her hands had she been totally confined to his society but fortunately for her there lived in the neighbourhood an elderly gentleman and his daughter whom her father allowed her to visit mr elmour was a country gentleman of a moderate fortune a respectable family and of a most amiable character between his daughter ellen and miss turnbull there had subsisted an intimacy from their earliest childhood the professions of this friendship had hitherto been much the warmest on the part of almeria the proofs were perhaps the strongest on the side of ellen miss elmour as the daughter of a gentleman whose family had been long settled in the country was rather more considered than miss turnbull who was the daughter of a grazier whose money had but lately raised him to the level of gentility at mr elmours house almeria had an opportunity of being in much better company than she could ever have seen at her fathers better company in every respect but chiefly in the popular or more properly in the aristocratic sense of the term her visits had consequently been long and frequent she appeared to have a peculiar taste for refinement in manners and conversation and often deplored the want she felt of these at home she expressed a strong desire to acquire information and to improve herself in every elegant accomplishment and ellen who was of a character far superior to the little meanness of female competition and jealousy shared with her friend all the advantages of her situation old hodgkinson never had any books in his house but such as almeria borrowed from mr elmours library ellen constantly sent miss turnbull all the new publications which her father got from town she copied for her friend the new music with which she was supplied showed her every new drawing or print gave her the advantage of the lessons she received from an excellent drawing master and let her into those little mysteries of art which masters sometimes sell so dear this was done with perfect readiness and simplicity ellen never seemed conscious that she was bestowing a favour but appeared to consider what she did as matters of course or as the necessary consequences of friendship she treated her friend at all times and in all companies with that uniform attention and equality of manner which most people profess and which so few have strength of mind to practise almeria expressed and probably at this time felt unbounded gratitude and affection for ellen indeed her expressions were sometimes so vehement that miss elmour rallied her for being romantic almeria one day declared that she should wish to pass all the days of her life at elmour grove without seeing any other human creatures but her friend and her friends father your imagination deceives you my dear almeria said ellen smiling it is my heart not my imagination that speaks said almeria laying her hand upon her heart or upon the place where she fancied her heart ought to be your understanding will perhaps speak a different language by and by and your heart will not be the worse for it my good young lady said old mr elmour almeria persisted even to tears and it was not till young mr elmour came home and till she had spent a few weeks in his company that she began to admit that three was the number sacred to friendship frederick elmour was a man of honour talents spirit and of a decided character he was extremely fond of his sister and was prepossessed in favour of every thing and person that she loved her intimate friend was consequently interesting to him and it must be supposed that miss elmours praises of almeria were managed more judiciously than eulogiums usually are by the effect which they produced frederick became attached to miss turnbull though he perceived that in firmness and dignity of character she was not equal to his sister this inferiority did not injure her in his opinion because it was always acknowledged with so much candour and humility by almeria who seemed to look up to her friend as to a being of a superior order this freedom from envy and this generous enthusiasm first touched young mr elmours heart next to possessing his sisters virtues and talents loving them was in his opinion the greatest merit he thought that a person capable of appreciating and admiring ellens character must be desirous of imitating her and the similarity of their tastes opinions and principles seemed to him the most secure pledge for his future happiness miss turnbulls fortune whatever it might be was an object of no great importance to him his father though not opulent was in easy circumstances and was willing he said to deprive himself of some luxuries for the sake of his son whom he would not controul in the choice of a wife a choice on which he knew from his own experience that the happiness of life so much depends the benevolent old gentleman had peculiar merit in this conduct because if he had a weakness in the world it was a prejudice in favour of what is called good family and birth it had long been the secret wish of his heart that his only son might marry into a family as ancient as his own frederick was fully sensible of the sacrifice that his father made of his pride but that which he was willing to make of what he called his luxuries his sons affection and sense of justice forbade him to accept he could not rob his father of any of the comforts of his declining years whilst in the full vigour of youth it was in his power by his own exertions to obtain an independent maintenance he had been bred to the bar no expense had been spared by his father in his education no efforts had been omitted by himself he was now ready to enter on the duties of his profession with ardour but without presumption our heroine must be pardoned by the most prudent and admired by the most romantic for being desperately in love with a youth of such a character and such expectations whilst the young ladys passion was growing every hour more lively her old father was growing every hour more lethargic he had a superstitious dread of making a will as if it were a preparation for death which would hasten the fatal moment hodgkinsons friends tried to conquer this prejudice but it was in vain to reason with a man who had never reasoned during the whole of his life about any thing except bullocks old hodgkinson died that was a matter of no great consequence to any body but he died without a will and that was a matter of some importance to his daughter after searching in every probable and improbable place there was at length found in his own handwriting a memorandum the beginning of which was in the first leaf of his cookery book and the end in the last leaf of his prayer book there was some difficulty in deciphering the memorandum for it was cross barred with miscellaneous observations in inks of various colours red blue and green as it is dangerous to garble law papers we shall lay the document

now it happened that mr hodgkinsons namesake and relation disdained the ten thousand pounds legacy and claimed the whole property as heir at law almeria who was utterly unacquainted with business applied to mr elmour in this difficulty and he had the goodness to undertake the management of her affairs frederick engaged to carry on her law suit and to plead her cause against this rapacious mr hodgkinson of hull whilst the suit was pending miss turnbull had an opportunity of seeing something of the ways of the world for the manners of her yorkshire acquaintance of all but ellen and the elmours varied towards her according to the opinion formed of the probable event of the trial on which her fortune depended she felt these variations most keenly in particular she was provoked by the conduct of lady stock who was at this time the fashionable lady of york sir thomas her husband was a great banker and whenever she condescended to visit her friends in the country she shone upon them in all the splendour and pride of wealth miss turnbull immediately after her fathers death went accompanied by old mr elmour to sir thomas stock to settle accounts with him she was received by his lady as a great heiress with infinite civility her visit punctually returned and an invitation to dinner sent to her and the elmours with all due expedition as she seemed to wish to accept of it her friends agreed to accompany her though in general they disliked fine dinners and though they seldom left their retirement to mix in the gaieties of york miss turnbull was received in rather a different manner from what she expected upon this occasion for between the sending and the accepting of the invitation lady stock had heard that her title to the fortune was disputed and that many were of an opinion that instead of having two hundred thousand pounds she would not have a shilling almeria was scarcely noticed on her entrance by the lady of the house she found herself in a formidable circle where every body seemed to consider her as being out of her place at dinner she was suffered to go to a side table from the moment she entered the house till she left it lady stock never deigned to speak to her nor for one instant to recollect that such a person existed not even madame roland when she was sent to the second table at the fermier generals expressed more indignation than almeria did at the insolence of this bankers lady she could think and speak of nothing else all the time she was going home in the evening to elmour grove ellen who had more philosophy than our heroine did not sympathize in the violence of her indignation on the contrary she was surprised that almeria could feel so much hurt by the slights of a woman for whom she had neither esteem nor affection and with whom she was indeed scarcely acquainted but does not her conduct excite your indignation said miss turnbull no it rather deserves my contempt if a friend if you for instance had treated me in such a manner it would have provoked my anger i dare say i oh how impossible cried almeria such insufferable pride such downright rudeness she was tolerably civil to you but me she never noticed and this sudden change it seems frederick arises from her doubts of my fortune is not such meanness really astonishing it would be astonishing perhaps replied frederick if we did not see similar instances every day lady stock you know is nothing but a mere woman of the world i hate mere women of the world cried almeria ellen observed that it was not worth while to hate it was sufficient to avoid them almeria grew warmer in her abhorrence and ellen at last expressed half in jest half in earnest some fear that if miss turnbull felt with such exquisite sensibility the neglect of persons of fashion she might in a different situation be ambitious or vain of their favour almeria was offended and was very near quarrelling with her friend for harbouring such a mean opinion of her character do you imagine that i could ever make a friend of such a person as lady stock a friend far from it i am very sure that you could not then how could i be ambitious of her favour i am desirous only of the favour esteem and affection of my friends but people who live in what is called the world you know my dear almeria desire to have acquaintance as well as friends said ellen and they value those by their fashion or rank and by the honour which may be received from their notice in public places yes my dear interrupted almeria though i have never been in london as you have i understand all that perfectly well i assure you but i only say that i am certain i should never judge and that i should never act in such a manner ellen smiled and said it is difficult to be certain of what we should do in situations in which we have never been placed almeria burst into tears and her friend could scarcely pacify her by the kindest expressions observe my dear almeria that i said we not you i do not pretend that till i have been tried i could be certain of my own strength of mind in new situations i believe it is from weakness that people are often so desirous of the notice of persons for whom they have no esteem if i were forced to live among a certain set of company i suppose i should in time do just as they do for i confess that i do not think i could bear every day to be utterly neglected in society even such as we have been in to day almeria wondered to hear her friend speak with so little confidence of her own spirit and independence and vehemently declared that she was certain no change of external circumstances could make any alteration in her sentiments and feelings ellen forbore to press the subject farther although the proofs which almeria had this day given of her stoicism were not absolutely conclusive about a month after this conversation had passed the suit against miss turnbull to set aside mr hodgkinsons will was tried at york the court was crowded at an early hour for much entertainment was expected from the oddity of old hodgkinsons testamentary dispositions besides the large amount of the property at stake could not fail to make the cause interesting several ladies appeared in the galleries among the rest lady stock miss elmour was there also to accompany almeria frederick was one of her counsel and when it came to his turn to speak he pleaded her cause with so much eloquence and ability as to obtain universal approbation after a trial which lasted many hours a verdict was given in miss turnbulls favour an immediate change appeared in the manners of all her acquaintance they crowded round her with smiles and congratulations and persons with whom she was scarcely acquainted or who had till now hardly deigned to acknowledge her acquaintance accosted her with an air of intimacy lady stock in particular recovered upon this occasion both her sight and speech she took almerias hand most graciously and went on chattering with the greatest volubility as they stood at the door of the court house her ladyships handsome equipage had drawn up and she offered to carry miss turnbull home almeria excused herself but felt ashamed when she saw the look of contempt which her ladyship bestowed on mr elmours old coach which was far behind a number of others and which could but ill bear a comparison with a new london carriage angry with herself for this weakness our heroine endeavoured to conceal it even from her own mind and feelings of gratitude to her friends revived in her heart the moment she was out of the sight of her fine acquaintance she treated ellen with even more than usual fondness and her acknowledgments of obligation to her counsel and his father were expressed in the strongest terms in a few days there came a pressing invitation from lady stock mr elmour had accounts of miss turnbulls to settle with sir thomas and notwithstanding the air of indifference with which she read the cards almeria was not sorry to accept of the invitation as she knew that she should be received in a very different manner from that in which she had been treated on her former visit she laughed and said that she should be entertained by observing the change which a few thousand pounds more or less could produce in lady stocks behaviour yet such is the inconsistency or the weakness of human wishes that the very attentions which our heroine knew were paid merely to her fortune and not to her merit flattered her vanity and she observed with a strange mixture of pain and pleasure that there was a marked difference in lady stocks manner towards her and the elmours when the evening was over and when she had leisure to be good almeria called herself severely to account for this secret satisfaction of which she had been conscious from the preference given her over her friends she accused herself of ingratitude and endeavoured to recover her own self complacency by redoubled professions of esteem and affection for those to whom she had so much reason to be attached but fresh invitations came from lady stock and the course of her thoughts again changed ellen declined accompanying her and miss turnbull regretted this exceedingly because it would be so distressing and awkward for her to go alone then why do you go at all my dear said ellen you speak as if there were some moral necessity for your visit moral necessity oh no said almeria laughing but i really think there is a polite necessity if you will allow me the expression would it not be rude for all of us to refuse when lady stock has made this music party as she says entirely on my account on our account i mean for you see she mentions your fondness for music and if she had not written so remarkably civilly to you i assure you i would neither go myself nor think of pressing you to go this oratory had no effect upon ellen our heroine went alone to the music meeting the old coach returned to elmour grove at night empty the servant brought lady stocks compliments and she would send her carriage home with miss turnbull early the next morning after waiting above an hour and a half beyond their usual time the family were sitting down to dinner the next day when miss turnbull in lady stocks fine carriage drove up the avenue frederick handed her out of the carriage with more ceremony and less affection than he had ever shown before old mr elmours manner was also more distant and ellens colder almeria attempted to apologize but could not get through her speech she then tried to laugh at her own awkwardness but her laugh not being seconded she sat down to dinner in silence colouring prodigiously and totally abashed good old mr elmour was the first to relent and to endeavour by resuming his usual kind familiarity to relieve her painful confusion ellens coolness was also dissipated when miss turnbull took her aside after dinner and with tears in her eyes declared she was sorry she had not had sufficient strength of mind to resist lady stocks importunities to stay all night that as to the carriage it was sent back without her knowledge and that this morning though she had three or four times expressed her fears that she should keep her friends at elmour grove waiting for dinner yet lady stock would not understand her hints and she declared she got away the very instant her ladyships carriage came to the door by ellens kind interposition frederick whose pride had been most ready to take the alarm at the least appearance of slight to his father and sister was pacified he laid aside his ceremony to miss turnbull called her almeria as he used to do and all was well again with difficulty and blushes almeria came out with an after confession that she had been so silly as to make half a promise to lady stock of going to her ball and of spending a few days with her at york before she left the country but this promise was only conditional said she if you or your father would take it the least ill or unkindly of me i assure you i will not go i would rather offend all the lady stocks in the world than you my dearest ellen or your father to whom i am so much obliged do not talk of obligations interrupted ellen amongst friends there can be no obligations i will answer for it that my father will not be offended at your going to this ball and i assure you i shall not take it unkindly if you would not think me very proud i should tell you that i wish for our sakes as well as your own that you should see as much of this lady stock and as many lady stocks as possible for i am convinced that upon intimate acquaintance we must rise in your opinion almeria protested that she had never for an instant thought of comparing ellen with lady stock a friend a bosom friend with an acquaintance an acquaintance of yesterday i never thought of making such a comparison that is the very thing of which i complain said ellen smiling i beg you will make the comparison my dear almeria and the more opportunities you have of forming your judgment the better notwithstanding that there was something rather humiliating to miss turnbull in the dignified composure with which ellen now for the first time in her life implied her own superiority almeria secretly rejoiced that it was at her friends own request that the visits to her fine acquaintance were repeated at lady stocks ball miss turnbull was much distinguished as it is called sir thomass eldest son was her partner and though he was not remarkably agreeable yet his attentions were flattering to her vanity because the rival belles of york vied for his homage the delight of being taken notice of in public was new to almeria and it quite intoxicated her brain six hours sleep afterwards were not sufficient to sober her completely as her friends at elmour grove perceived the next morning she neither talked looked nor moved like herself though she was perfectly unconscious that in this delirium of vanity and affectation she was an object of pity and disgust to the man she loved ellen had sufficient good nature and candour to make allowance for foibles in others from which her own character was totally free she was clear sighted to the merits but not blind to the faults of her friends and she resolved to wait patiently till almeria should return to herself miss turnbull in compliance with her friends advice took as many opportunities as possible of being with lady stock her ladyships company was by no means agreeable to almerias natural taste for her ladyship had neither sense nor knowledge and her conversation consisted merely of common place phrases or the second hand affectation of fashionable nonsense yet though miss turnbull felt no actual pleasure in her company she was vain of being of her parties and even condescended to repeat some of her sayings in which there was neither sense nor wit from having lived much in the london world her ladyship was acquainted with a prodigious number of names of persons of consequence and quality and by these our heroines ears were charmed her ladyships dress was also an object of admiration and imitation and the york ladies begged patterns of every thing she wore almeria consequently thought that no other clothes could be worn with propriety and she was utterly ashamed of her past self for having lived so long in ignorance and for having had so bad a taste as ever to have thought ellen elmour a model for imitation miss elmour her ladyship said was a very sensible young woman no doubt but she could hardly be considered as a model of fashion a new standard for estimating merit was raised in almerias mind and her friend for an instant sunk before the vast advantage of having the most fashionable mantua maker and milliner in town ashamed of this dereliction of principle she a few minutes afterwards warmly pronounced a panegyric on ellen to which lady stock only replied with a vacant supercilious countenance may be so no doubt of course the elmours are a very respectable family im told and really more genteel than the country families one sees but is not it odd they dont mix more one seldom meets them in town any where or at any of the watering places in summer to this charge almeria with blushes was forced to plead guilty for her friends she however observed in mitigation that when they were in town what company they did see was always the best she believed that she knew for one person the duchess of a was a friend of the elmours and corresponded with ellen this judicious defence produced an immediate effect upon lady stocks countenance her eyebrows descended from the high arch of contempt and after a pause she remarked it was strange that they had not accepted of any of the invitations she had lately sent them she fancied they were as indeed they had the character of being very proud people and very odd almeria denied the pride and the oddity but observed that they were all remarkably fond of home well my dear miss turnbull thats what i call odd but i am sure i have nothing to say against all that it is the fashion now to let every body do as they please if the elmours like to bury themselves alive im sure i cant have the smallest objection i only hope they dont insist upon burying you along with them im going to harrowgate for a few days and i must have you with me my dear our heroine hesitated lady stock smiled and said she saw miss turnbull was terribly afraid of these elmours that for her part she was the last person in the world to break through old connexions but that really some people ought to consider that other people cannot always live as they do that one style of life was fit for one style of fortune and one for another and that it would look very strange to the world if an heiress with two hundred thousand pounds fortune who if she produced herself might be in the first circles in town were to be boxed up at elmour grove and precluded from all advantages and offers that she might of course expect to do our heroine justice she here interrupted lady stock with more eagerness than strict politeness admitted and positively declared that her friends never for one moment wished to confine her at elmour grove on the contrary said she they urged me to go into company and to see something of the world before i marry she was going to say but paused lady stock waited for the finishing word but when it did not come she went on just as if it had been pronounced the elmours do vastly right and proper to talk to you in this style for they would be very much blamed in the world if they acted otherwise you know young elmour has his fortune to make very clever certainly he is and will rise no doubt im told in his profession but all that is not the same as a ready made fortune which an heiress like you has a right to expect but do not let me annoy you with my reflections perhaps there is nothing in the report i really only repeat what i hear every body say in what every body says you know there must be something i positively think you ought to show in justice to the elmours themselves that you are at liberty and that they do not want to monopolize you in this unaccountable sort of way to this last argument our heroine yielded or to this she chose to attribute her yielding she went to harrowgate with lady stock and every day and every hour she became more desirous of appearing fashionable to this one object all her thoughts were directed living in public was to her a new life and she was continually sensible of her dependence upon the opinion of her more experienced companion she felt the awkwardness of being surrounded by people with whom she was unacquainted at first whenever she appeared she imagined that every body was looking at her or talking about her and she was in perpetual apprehension that something in her dress or manners should become the subject of criticism or ridicule but from this fear she was soon relieved by the conviction that most people were so occupied with themselves as totally to overlook her sometimes indeed she heard the whispered question of who is that with lady stock and the mortifying answer i do not know however when lady stock had introduced her to some of her acquaintance as a great heiress the scene changed and she found herself treated with much consideration though still the fashionable belles took sufficient care to make her sensible of her inferiority she longed to be upon an equal footing with them whilst her mind was in this state sir thomas stock one morning when he was settling some money business with her observed that she would in another year be of age and of course would take her affairs into her own hands but in the mean time it would be necessary to appoint a guardian and that the choice depended upon herself she instantly named her friend mr elmour sir thomas insinuated that old mr elmour though undoubtedly a most unexceptionable character was not exactly the most eligible person for a guardian to a young lady whose large fortune entitled her to live in a fashionable style that if it was miss turnbulls intention to fix in the country mr elmour certainly was upon the spot and a very fit guardian but that if she meant to appear as doubtless she would in town she would of course want another conductor to cut the matter short at once my dear said lady stock you must come to town with me next winter and choose sir thomas for your guardian im sure it will give him the greatest pleasure in the world to do any thing in his power and you will have no difficulties with him for you see he is not a man to bore you with all manner of advice in short he would only be your guardian for forms sake and that you know would be the pleasantest footing imaginable come here is a pen and ink and gilt paper write to old elmour this minute and let me have you all to myself almeria was taken by surprise she hesitated all her former professions all her obligations to the elmour family recurred to her mind her friendship for ellen her love or what she had thought love for frederick she could not decide upon a measure that might offend them or appear ungrateful yet her desire of going to town with lady stock was ardent and she knew not how to refuse sir thomass offer without displeasing him she saw that all future connexion with the stocks depended on her present determination she took a middle course and suggested that she might have two guardians and then she should be able to avail herself of sir thomass obliging offer without offending her old friends in consequence of this convenient arrangement she wrote to mr elmour enclosing her letter in one to ellen in which the embarrassment and weakness of her mind were evident notwithstanding all her endeavours to conceal them after a whole page of incomprehensible apologies for having so long delayed to write to her dearest ellen and after professions of the warmest affection esteem and gratitude for her friends at elmour grove she in the fourth page of her epistle opened her real business by declaring that she should ever from the conviction she felt of the superiority of ellens understanding follow her judgment however repugnant it might sometimes be to her inclinations that she therefore had resolved in pursuance of ellens advice to take an opportunity of seeing the gay world and had accepted of an invitation from lady stock to spend the winter with her in town that she had also accepted of sir thomas stocks offer to become one of her guardians as she thought it best to trouble her good friend mr elmour as little as possible at his advanced age in answer to this letter she received a few lines from mr elmour requesting to see her before she should go to town accordingly upon her return to york she went to elmour grove to take leave of her friends she was under some anxiety but resolved to carry it off with that ease or affectation of ease which she had learnt during her six weeks apprenticeship to a fine lady at harrowgate she was surprised that no frederick appeared to greet her arrival the servant showed her into mr elmours study the good old gentleman received her with that proud sort of politeness which was always the sign and the only sign of his being displeased you will excuse me miss turnbull said he for giving you the trouble of coming here it was my business to have waited on you but i have been so far unwell lately that it was not in my power to leave home and these are papers continued he which i thought it my duty to deliver into your own hands whilst mr elmour was tying up these papers and writing upon them almeria began two sentences with i hope and i am afraid without in the least knowing what she hoped or feared she was not yet sufficiently perfect in the part of a fine lady to play it well mr elmour looked up from his writing with an air of grave attention when she began to speak but after waiting in vain for an intelligible sentence he proceeded you have judged very wisely for me miss turnbull in relieving my declining years from the fatigue of business no man understands the management or the value of money better than sir thomas stock and you could not madam in this point of view have chosen a more proper guardian almeria said that she hoped mr elmour would always permit her to consider him as her best friend to whose advice she should have recourse in preference to that of any person upon earth recovering her assurance as she went on speaking and recollecting some of the hints lady stock had given her about the envy and jealousy of the elmours and of their scheme of monopolizing her fortune she added a few commonplace phrases about respectability gratitude and great obligations then gave a glance at lady stocks handsome carriage which was waiting at the door then asked for miss elmour and hoped she should not be so unfortunate as to miss seeing her before she left the country as she came on purpose to take leave of her then looked at her watch but all this was said and done with the awkwardness of a novice in the art of giving herself airs mr elmour without being in the least irritated by her manner was all the time considering how he could communicate with the least possible pain what he had further to say you speak of me miss turnbull as of one of your guardians in the letter i had the favour of receiving from you a few days ago said he but you must excuse me for declining that honour circumstances have altered materially since i first undertook the management of your affairs and my future interference or perhaps even my advice might not appear as disinterested as formerly miss turnbull here interrupted him with an exclamation of astonishment and made many protestations of entire dependence upon his disinterested friendship he waited with proud patience till she had finished her eulogium how far the generous extent of your confidence madam reaches or may hereafter reach said he must be tried by others not by me nor yet by my son almeria changed colour he has left it to me madam to do that for him which perhaps he feared he might not have sufficient resolution to do for himself to return to you these letters and this picture and to assure you that he considers you as entirely at liberty to form any connexion that may be suited to your present views and circumstances mr elmour put into her hand a packet of her own letters to frederick and a miniature picture of herself which she had formerly given to her lover this was an unexpected stroke his generosity his firmness of character the idea of losing him for ever all rushed upon her mind at once artificial manners vanish the moment the natural passions are touched almeria clasped her hands in an agony of grief and exclaimed is he gone gone for ever i have deserved it the letters and picture fell from her hand and she sunk back quite overpowered when she recovered she found herself in the open air on a seat under mr elmours study windows and ellen beside her pity forgive and advise me my dear my best my only real friend said almeria never did i want your advice so much as at this moment you shall have it then without reserve said ellen and without fear that it should be attributed to any unworthy motive i could almost as soon wish for my brothers death as desire to see him united to any woman let her beauty and accomplishments be what they might who had a mean or frivolous character such as could consider money as the greatest good or dissipation as the prime object of life i am firmly persuaded my dear almeria that however you may be dazzled by the first view of what is called fashionable life you will soon see things as they really are and that you will return to your former tastes and feelings oh i am i am returned to them cried almeria i will write directly to lady stock and to sir thomas to tell them that i have changed my mind only prevail upon your father to be my guardian that is out of my power said ellen and i think that it is much better you should be as you are left completely at liberty and entirely independent of us i advise you almeria to persist in your scheme of spending the ensuing winter in town with lady stock then you will have an opportunity of comparing your own different feelings and of determining what things are essential to your happiness if you should find that the triumphs of fashion delight you more than the pleasures of domestic life pursue them your fortune will put it in your power you will break no engagements and you will have no reproaches to fear from us on the contrary if you find that your happiness depends upon friendship and love and that the life we formerly led together is that which you prefer you will return to elmour grove to your friend and your lover and your choice will not be that of romance but of reason it was with difficulty that almeria in her present fit of enthusiasm could be brought to listen to sober sense and true friendship her parting from ellen and mr elmour cost her many tears and she returned to her fashionable friend with swollen eyes and a heavy heart her sorrow however was soon forgotten in the bustle and novelty of a new situation upon her arrival in london fresh trains of ideas were quickly forced upon her mind which were as dissimilar as possible from those associated with love friendship and elmour grove at sir thomas stocks every thing she saw and heard served to remind or rather to convince her of the opulence of the owner of the house here every object was estimated not for its beauty or elegance but by its costliness money was the grand criterion by which the worth of animate and inanimate objects was alike decided in this society the worship of the golden idol was avowed without shame or mystery and all who did not bow the knee to it were considered as hypocrites or fools our heroine possessed of two hundred thousand pounds could not fail to have a large share of incense every thing she said or looked was applauded in sir thomas stocks family and she would have found admiration delightful if she had not suspected that her fortune alone entitled her to all this applause this was rather a mortifying reflection by degrees however her delicacy on this subject abated she learned philosophically to consider her fortune a thing so immediately associated with herself as to form a part of her personal merit upon this principle she soon became vain of her wealth and she was led to overrate the consequence that riches bestow on their possessor in a capital city such numerous claimants for distinction appear with beauty birth wit fashion or wealth to support their pretensions that the vanity of an individual however clamorous is immediately silenced if not humbled when miss turnbull went into public she was surprised by the discovery of her own nay even of lady stocks insignificance at york her ladyship was considered as a personage high as human veneration could look but in london she was lost in a crowd of fellow mortals it is perhaps from this sense of humiliation that individuals combine together to obtain by their union that importance and self complacency which separately they could never enjoy miss turnbull observed that a numerous acquaintance was essential to those who lived much in public that the number of bows and curtsies and the consequence of the persons by whom they are given or received is the measure of merit and happiness nothing can be more melancholy than most places of public amusement to those who are strangers to the crowds which fill them few people have such strength of mind as to be indifferent to the opinions of numbers even considered merely as numbers hence those who live in crowds in fact surrender the power of thinking for themselves either in trifles or matters of consequence our heroine had imagined before she came to town that lady stock moved in the highest circle of fashion but she soon perceived that many of the people of rank who visited her ladyship and who partook of her sumptuous entertainments thought they condescended extremely whilst they paid this homage to wealth one night at the opera almeria happened to be seated in the next box to lady bradstone a proud woman of high family who considered all whose genealogy could not vie in antiquity with her own as upstarts that ought to be kept down her ladyship either not knowing or not caring who was in the next box to her began to ridicule an entertainment which had been given a few days before by lady stock from her entertainment the transition was easy to her character and to that of her whole family young stock was pronounced to have all the purse proud self sufficiency of a banker and all the pertness of a clerk even his bow seemed as if it came from behind the counter till this moment almeria had at least permitted if not encouraged this gentlemans assiduities for she had hitherto seen him only in company where he had been admired his attentions therefore had been flattering to her vanity but things now began to appear in quite a different light she saw mr stock in the point of view in which lady bradstone placed him and felt that she might be degraded but could not be elevated in the ranks of fashion by such an admirer she began to wish that she was not so intimately connected with a family which was ridiculed for want of taste and whose wealth as she now suspected was their only ticket of admittance into the society of the truly elegant in the land of fashion alps on alps arise and no sooner has the votary reached the summit of one weary ascent than another appears higher still and more difficult of attainment our heroine now became discontented in that situation which but a few months before had been the grand object of her ambition in the mean time as mr stock had not overheard lady bradstones conversation at the opera and as he had a comfortably good opinion of himself he was sure that he was making a rapid progress in the ladys favour he had of late seldom heard her mention any of her friends at elmour grove and he was convinced that her romantic attachment to frederick must have been conquered by his own superior address her fortune was fully as agreeable to him as to his money making father the only difference between them was that he loved to squander and his father to hoard gold extravagance frequently produces premature avarice young mr stock calculated miss turnbulls fortune weighed it against that of every other young lady within the sphere of his attractions found the balance in her favour by some thousands made his proposal in form and could not recover his astonishment when he found himself in form rejected sir thomas and lady stock used all their influence in his favour but in vain they concluded that almerias passion for frederick elmour was the cause of this refusal and they directed their arguments against the folly of marrying for love our heroine was at this time more in danger of the folly of marrying for fashion not that she had fixed her fancy upon any man of fashion in particular but she had formed an exalted idea of the whole species and she regretted that frederick was not in that magic circle in which all her hopes of happiness now centred she wrote kind letters to miss elmour but each letter was written with greater difficulty than the preceding for she had lost all interest in the occupations which formerly were so delightful she and ellen had now few ideas in common and her epistles dwindled into apologies for long silence promises of being a better correspondent in future reasons for breaking these promises hopes of pardon c ellen however continued steady in her belief that her friend would at last prove worthy of her esteem and of her brothers love the rejection of mr stock which almeria did not fail to mention confirmed this favourable opinion when that gentleman was at length with some difficulty convinced that our heiress had decided against him his manners and those of his family changed towards her from the extreme of civility to that of rudeness they spoke of her as a coquette and a jilt and a person who gave herself very extraordinary airs she was vexed and alarmed and in her first confusion and distress thought of retreating to her friends at elmour grove she wrote a folio sheet to ellen unlike her late apologetic epistles full of the feelings of her heart and of a warm invective against fashionable and interested friends after a narrative of her quarrel with the stocks she declared that she would immediately quit her london acquaintance and return to her best friend but the very day after she had despatched this letter she changed her mind and formed a new idea of a best friend one morning she went with lady stock to a booksellers whose shop served as a fashionable lounge her ladyship valued books like all other things in proportion to the money which they cost she had no taste for literature but a great fancy for accumulating the most expensive publications which she displayed ostentatiously as part of the costly furniture of her house whilst she was looking over some literary luxuries rich in all the elegance of hot press and vellum binding lady bradstone and a party of her friends came into the room she immediately attracted and engrossed the attention of all present lady stock turned over the leaves of the fine books and asked their prices but she had the mortification to perceive that she was an object rather of derision than of admiration to the new comers none are so easily put out of countenance by airs as those who are most apt to play them off on their inferiors lady stock bit her lips in evident embarrassment and the awkwardness of her distress increased the confidence and triumph of her adversary she had some time before provoked lady bradstone by giving a concert in opposition to one of hers and by engaging at an enormous expense a celebrated performer for her night hostilities had thenceforward been renewed at every convenient opportunity by the contending fair ones lady bradstone now took occasion loudly to lament her extreme poverty and she put this question to all her party whether if they had it in their power they should prefer having more money than taste or more taste than money they were going to decide par acclamation but her ladyship insisted upon taking each vote separately because this prolonged the torments of her rival who heard the preference of taste to money reiterated half a dozen times over with the most provoking variety of insulting emphasis almerias sufferings during this scene were far more poignant than those of the person against whom the ridicule was aimed not that she pitied lady stock no she would have rejoiced to have seen her humbled to the dust if she could have escaped all share in her mortification but as she appeared as her ladyships acquaintance she apprehended that she might be mistaken for her friend an opportunity offered of marking the difference the bookseller asked lady stock if she chose to put her name down in a list of subscribers to a new work the book she saw was to be dedicated to lady bradstone and that was sufficient to decide her against it she declared that she never supported such things either by her name or her money that for her part she was no politician that she thought female patriots were absurd and odious and that she was glad none of that description were of her acquaintance all this was plainly directed against lady bradstone who was a zealous patriot her ladyship retorted by some reflections equally keen but rather more politely expressed each party addressing their inuendoes to the bookseller who afraid to disoblige either the rich or the fashionable preserved as much as it was in the power of his muscles a perfectly neutral countenance at last in order to relieve himself from his constraint he betook himself to count the subscribers and miss turnbull seized this moment to desire that her name might be added to the list lady bradstones eyes were immediately fixed upon her with complacency lady stocks flashed fire regardless of their fire almeria coolly added twelve copies sir if you please twelve copies miss turnbull at a guinea a piece lord bless me do you know what you are about my dear said lady stock perfectly well replied our heroine i think twelve guineas or twenty times that sum would be well bestowed in asserting independence of sentiment which i understand is the object of this work a whisper from lady bradstone to one of the shopmen of who is that charming woman gave our heroine courage to pronounce these words lady stock in great displeasure walked to her carriage saying you are to consider what you will do with your twelve copies miss turnbull for i am convinced your guardian will never let such a parcel of inflammatory trash into his house he admires female patriotism and all that sort of thing as little as i do the rudeness of this speech did not disconcert almeria for she was fortified by the consciousness that she had gained her point with lady bradstone this lady piqued herself upon showing her preferences and aversions with equal enthusiasm and clat she declared before a large company at dinner that notwithstanding miss turnbull was nobody by birth she had made herself somebody by spirit and that for her part she should contrary to her general principle which she confessed was to keep a strong line of demarcation between nobility and mobility take a pride in bringing forward merit even in the shape of a yorkshire graziers daughter pursuant to this gracious declaration she empowered a common friend to introduce miss turnbull to her on the first opportunity when people really wish to become acquainted with each other opportunities are easily and quickly found the parties met to their mutual satisfaction that very night in the waiting room of the opera house and conversed more in five minutes than people in town usually converse in five months or years when it is their wish to keep on a merely civil footing but this was not the footing on which miss turnbull desired to be with lady bradstone she took the utmost pains to please and succeeded she owed her success chiefly to the dexterous manner in which she manifested her contempt for her late dear friend lady stock her having refused an alliance with the family was much in her favour her ladyship admired her spirit but little suspected that the contemptuous manner in which she had once been overheard to speak of this bankers son was the real and immediate cause of his rejection the phrase only stock the bankers son decided his fate so much may be done by the mere emphasis on a single word from fashionable lips our heroine managed with considerable address in bringing her quarrel with one friend to a crisis at the moment when another was ready to receive her an ostensible pretext is never wanting to those who are resolved on war the book to which miss turnbull had subscribed was the pretext upon this occasion nothing could be more indifferent to her than politics but lady bradstones party and principles were to be defended at all events sir thomas stock protested that he might be hurt essentially in the opinion of those for whom he had the highest consideration if a young lady living under his roof known to be his ward and probably presumed to be guided by him should put her name as subscriber to twelve copies of a work patronized by lady bradstone the mere circumstance of its being dedicated to her ladyship showed what it must be sir thomas observed and he made it a point with miss turnbull that she should withdraw her name from the subscription this miss turnbull absolutely refused lady bradstone was her confidante upon the occasion and half a dozen notes a day passed between them at length the affair was brought to the long wished for crisis lady bradstone invited miss turnbull to her house feeling herself as she said bound in honour to bear her out in a dispute of which she had been the original occasion in this ladys society almeria found the style of dress manners and conversation different from what she had seen at lady stocks she had without difficulty imitated the affectation of lady stock but there was an ease in the decided tone of lady bradstone which could not be so easily acquired having lived from her infancy in the best company there was no heterogeneous mixture in her manners and the consciousness of this gave an habitual air of security to her words looks and motions lady stock seemed forced to beg or buy lady bradstone accustomed to command or levy admiration as her rightful tribute the pride of lady bradstone was uniformly resolute and successful the insolence of lady stock if it were opposed became cowardly and ridiculous lady bradstone seemed to have on all occasions an instinctive sense of what a person of fashion ought to do lady stock notwithstanding her bravadoing air was frequently perplexed and anxious and therefore awkward she had always recourse to precedents lady p said so or lady q did so lady g wore this or lady h was there and therefore i am sure it is proper on the contrary lady bradstone never quoted authorities but presumed that she was a precedent for others the one was eager to follow the other determined to lead the fashion our heroine who was by no means deficient in penetration and whose whole attention was now given to the study of externals quickly perceived these shades of difference between her late and her present friend she remarked in particular that she found herself much more at ease in lady bradstones society her ladyships pride was not so offensive as lady stocks vanity secure of her own superiority lady bradstone did not want to measure herself every instant with inferiors she treated almeria as her equal in every respect and in setting her right in points of fashion never seemed to triumph but to consider her own knowledge as a necessary consequence of the life she had led from her infancy with a sort of proud generosity she always considered those whom she honoured with her friendship as thenceforward entitled to all the advantages of her own situation and to all the respect due to a part of herself she now always used the word we with peculiar emphasis in speaking of miss turnbull and herself this was a signal perfectly well understood by her acquaintance almeria was received every where with the most distinguished attention and she was delighted and absolutely intoxicated with her sudden rise in the world of fashion she found that her former acquaintance at lady stocks were extremely ambitious of claiming an intimacy but this could not be done miss turnbull had now acquired by practice the power of looking at people without seeming to see them and of forgetting those with whom she was perfectly well acquainted her opinion of her own consequence was much raised by the court that was paid to her by several young men of fashion who thought it expedient to marry two hundred thousand pounds how quickly ambition extends her views our heroines highest object had lately been to form an alliance with a man of fashion she had now three fashionable admirers in her train but though she was flattered by their attention she had not the least inclination to decide in favour of any of these candidates the only young man of her present acquaintance who seemed to be out of the reach of her power was lord bradstone and upon the conquest of his heart or rather his pride her fancy was fixed he had all his mothers family pride and he had been taught by her to expect an alliance with a daughter of one of the first noble families in england the possibility of his marrying a graziers daughter had never entered into his or lady bradstones thoughts they saw indeed every day examples among the first nobility of such matches but they saw them with contempt almeria knew this and yet she did not despair of success nor was she wrong in her calculations lord bradstone was fond of high play his taste for gaming soon reduced him to distress his guardian was enraged and absolutely refused to pay his lordships debts what was to be done he must extricate himself from his difficulties by marrying some rich heiress miss turnbull was the heiress nearest at hand lord bradstones pride was compelled to yield to his interest and he resolved to pay his addresses to the yorkshire graziers daughter but he knew that his mother would be indignant at this idea and he therefore determined to proceed cautiously and to assure himself of the young ladys approbation before he should brave his mothers anger the winter was now passed and her ladyship invited miss turnbull to accompany her to cheltenham her son was of the party our heroine plainly understood his intentions and her friendship for lady bradstone did not prevent her from favouring his views neither was she deterred by her knowledge of his lordships taste for play so ardent was her desire for a coronet the recollection of frederick elmour sometimes crossed her imagination and struck her heart but the pang was soon over and she settled her conscience by the reflection that she was not in the least degree bound in honour to him he had set her entirely at liberty and could not complain of her conduct as to ellen every day she determined to write to her and every day she put it off till to morrow at last she was saved the trouble of making and breaking any more resolutions for one evening as she was walking with lady bradstone and her noble admirer in the public walk she met miss elmour and her brother she accosted ellen with great eagerness but it was plain to her friends discerning eyes that her joy was affected after repeating several times that she was quite delighted at this unexpected meeting she ran on with a number of commonplace questions commencing and concluding with when did you come how long do you stay where do you lodge we have been here about a fortnight and i believe we shall stay about a month longer indeed a month so long how fortunate but where are you we lodge a little out of the town on the road to cirencester how unfortunate we are at such a shocking distance im with lady bradstone a most charming woman whom are you with with my poor father said ellen he has been very ill lately and we came here on his account ill old mr elmour im extremely concerned but whom have you to attend him you should send to town for dr grant do you know he is the only man now the only man lady bradstone and i have any dependence on if i were dying he is the man i should send for do have him for mr elmour my dear and dont be alarmed above all things you know its so natural at your fathers age that he should not be as well as he has been but i distress you and detain you our heroine after running off these unmeaning sentences passed on being ashamed to walk with ellen in public because lady bradstone had whispered who is she not to be known in the world of fashion is an unpardonable crime for which no merit can atone three days elapsed before miss turnbull went to see her friends notwithstanding her extreme concern for poor mr elmour her excuse to her conscience was that lady bradstones carriage could not sooner be spared people in a certain rank of life are or make themselves slaves to horses and carriages with every apparent convenience and luxury they are frequently more dependent than their tradesmen or their servants there was a time when almeria would not have been restrained by these imaginary impossibilities from showing kindness to her friends but that time was now completely past she was at present anxious to avoid having any private conversation with ellen because she was ashamed to avow her change of views and sentiments in the short morning visit which she paid her almeria talked of public places of public characters of dress and equipages c she inquired indeed with a modish air of infinite sensibility for poor mr elmour and when she heard that he was confined to his bed she regretted most excessively that she could not see him but a few seconds afterwards with a suitable change of voice and countenance she made an easy transition to the praise of a new dress of lady bradstones invention frederick elmour came into the room in the midst of the eulogium on her ladyships taste she was embarrassed for a moment but quickly recovering the tone of a fine lady she spoke to him as if he had never been any thing to her but a common acquaintance the dignity and firmness of his manner provoked her pride she wished to coquet with him she tried to excite his jealousy by talking of lord bradstone but vain were all her airs and inuendoes they could not extort from him even a sigh she was somewhat consoled however by observing in his sisters countenance the expression as she thought of extreme mortification a few days after this visit miss turnbull received the following note from miss elmour my dear almeria if you still wish that i should treat you as a friend show me that you do and you will find my affection unaltered if on the contrary you have decided to pursue a mode of life or to form connexions which make you ashamed to own any one for a friend who is not a fine lady let our intimacy be dissolved for ever it could only be a source of mutual pain my father is better to day and wishes to see you will you spend this evening with him and with your affectionate ellen elmour it happened that the very day miss turnbull received this note lady bradstone was to have a concert and almeria knew that her ladyship would be offended if she were to spend the evening with the elmours it was as she said to herself impossible therefore to accept of ellens invitation she called upon her in the course of the morning to make an apology she found ellen beside her father who was seated in his arm chair he looked extremely pale and weak she was at first shocked at the change she saw in her old friend and she could not utter the premeditated apology ellen took it for granted that she was come in consequence of her note to spend the day with her and she embraced her with affectionate joy her whole countenance changed when our heroine began at last to talk of lady bradstone and the concert ellen burst into tears my dear child said mr elmour putting his hand upon his daughters which rested upon the arm of his chair i did not expect this weakness from you miss turnbull impatient to shorten a scene which she had neither strength of mind to endure nor to prevent rose to take leave my dear ellen said she in an irresolute tone my dearest creature you must not distress yourself in this way i must have you keep up your spirits you confine yourself too much indeed you do and you see you are not equal to it your father will be better and he will persuade you to leave him for an hour or two i am sure and we must have you amongst us and i must introduce you to lady bradstone shes a charming woman i assure you you would like her of all things if you knew her come dont let me see you in this way really my dear ellen this is so unlike you i can assure you that whatever you may think i love you as well as ever i did and never shall forget my obligations to all your family but you know a person who lives in the world as i do must make such terrible sacrifices of their time one cant do as one pleases ones an absolute slave so you must forgive me dear ellen for bidding you farewell for the present ellen hastily wiped away her tears and turning to almeria with an air of dignity held out her hand to her and said farewell for ever almeria may you never feel the want of a sincere and affectionate friend may the triumphs of fashion make you amends for all you sacrifice to obtain them miss turnbull was abashed and agitated she hurried out of the room to conceal her confusion stepped into a carriage with a coronet drove away and endeavoured to forget all that had passed the concert in the evening recalled her usual train of ideas and she persuaded herself that she had done all and more than was necessary in offering to introduce ellen to lady bradstone how could she neglect such an offer a few days after the concert almeria had the pleasure of being introduced to lady bradstones four daughters lady gabriella lady agnes lady bab and lady kitty of the existence of these young ladies almeria had scarcely heard they had been educated at a fashionable boarding school and their mother was now under the disagreeable necessity of bringing them home to live with her because the eldest was past seventeen lady gabriella was a beauty and determined to be a grace but which of the three graces she had not yet decided lady agnes was plain and resolved to be a wit lady bab and lady kitty were charming hoydens with all the modern simplicity of fourteen or fifteen in their manners lady bab had a fine long neck which was always in motion lady kitty had white teeth and was always laughing but it is impossible to characterize them for they differed in nothing from a thousand other young ladies these four sisters agreed in but one point in considering their mother as their common enemy taking it for granted that miss turnbull was her friend she was looked upon by them as being naturally entitled to a share of their distrust and enmity they found a variety of causes of complaint against our heroine and if they had been at any loss their respective waiting maids would have furnished them with inexhaustible causes of quarrel lady bradstone could not bear to go with more than four in a coach why was miss turnbull always to have a front seat in the coach and two of the young ladies to be always left at home on her account how could lady bradstone make such a favourite of a graziers daughter and prefer her to her own children as a companion c the young ladies never discouraged their attendants from saying all the ill natured things that they could devise of miss turnbull and they invented a variety of methods of tormenting her lady gabriella found out that almeria was horridly ugly and awkward lady agnes quizzed her perpetually and the ladies bab and kitty played upon her innumerable practical jokes she was astonished to find in high life a degree of vulgarity of which her country companions would have been ashamed but all such things in high life go under the general term dashing these young ladies were dashers alas perhaps foreigners and future generations may not know the meaning of the term our heroines temper was not proof against the trials to which it was hourly exposed perhaps the consciousness that she was not born to the situation in which she now moved joined to her extreme anxiety to be thought genteel and fashionable rendered her peculiarly irritable when her person and manners were attacked by ladies of quality she endeavoured to conciliate her young enemies by every means in her power and at length she found a method of pleasing them they were immoderately fond of baubles and they had not money enough to gratify this taste miss turnbull at first with great timidity begged lady gabriellas acceptance of a ring which seemed particularly to catch her fancy the facility with which the ring was accepted and the favourable change it produced as if by magic in her ladyships manners towards our heroine encouraged her to try similar experiments upon the other sisters she spared not ear rings crosses brooches pins and necklaces and the young ladies in return began to show her all the friendship which can be purchased by such presents or by any presents even whilst she rejoiced at the change in their behaviour she could not avoid despising them for the cause to which she knew it must be attributed nor did she long enjoy even the temporary calm procured by these peace offerings for the very same things which propitiated the daughters offended the mother lady bradstone one morning insisted upon lady gabriellas returning a necklace which she had received from almeria and her ladyship informed miss turnbull at the same time with an air of supreme haughtiness that she could not possibly permit her daughters to accept such valuable presents from any but their own relations that if the lady bradstones did not know what became them it was her duty to teach them propriety it was rather late in life to begin to teach even if they had been inclined to learn they resented her last lesson or rather her last act of authority with acrimony proportioned to the value of the object and miss turnbull was compelled to hear their complaints lady gabriella said she was convinced that her mothers only reason for making her return the necklace was because she had not one quite so handsome lady agnes between whom and her mamma there was pending a dispute about a pair of diamond ear rings left by her grandmother observed that her mother might if she pleased call jealousy propriety but that she must not be surprised if other people used the old vocabulary that her mammas pride and vanity were always at war for that though she was proud enough to see her daughters show well in public yet she required to have it said that she looked younger than any of them and that she was infinitely better dressed lady bab and lady kitty did not fail in this favourable moment of general discontent to bring forward their list of grievances and in the discussion of their rights and wrongs they continually appealed to our heroine crowding round her whilst she stood silent and embarrassed ashamed of them and of herself she compared the lady bradstones with ellen she compared the sisters in law she was soon to have with the friend she had forsaken the young ladies mistook the expression of melancholy in almerias countenance at this instant for sympathy in their sorrows and her silence for acquiescence in the justice of their complaints they were reiterating their opinions with something like plebeian loudness of voice when their mother entered the room the ease with which her daughters changed their countenances and the subject of conversation when she entered might have prevented all suspicion but for the blushes of almeria who though of all the party she was the least guilty looked by far the most abashed the necklace which hung from her hand and on which in the midst of her embarrassment her eyes involuntarily fell seemed to lady bradstone proof positive against her her ladyship recollected certain words she had heard as she opened the door and now applied them without hesitation to herself politeness restrained the expression of her anger towards miss turnbull but it burst furiously forth upon her daughters and our heroine was now as much alarmed by the violence of her future mother in law as she had been disgusted by the meanness of her intended sisters from this day forward lady bradstones manner changed towards almeria who could plainly perceive by her altered eye that she had lost her confidence and that her ladyship considered her as one who was playing a double part and fomenting dissensions in her family she thought herself bound in honour to the daughters not to make any explanation that could throw the blame upon them and she bore in painful silence the many oblique reproaches reflections upon ingratitude dissimulation and treachery which she knew were aimed at her the consciousness that she was treating lady bradstone with insincerity in encouraging the addresses of her son increased miss turnbulls embarrassment she repented having for a moment encouraged his clandestine attachment and she now urged him in the strongest manner to impart his intentions to his mother he assured her that she should be obeyed but his obedience was put off from day to day and in the mean time the more almeria saw of his family the more her desire to be connected with them diminished the affair of the necklace was continually renewed in some shape or other and a perpetual succession of petty disputes occurred in which both parties were in the wrong and each openly or secretly blamed her for not taking their part her mind was so much harassed that all her natural cheerfulness forsook her and the being obliged to assume spirits in company and among people who were not worth the toil of pleasing became every hour more irksome the transition from these domestic miseries to public dissipation and gaieties made her still more melancholy when she calmly examined her own heart she perceived that she felt little or no affection for lord bradstone though she had been flattered by his attentions when the assiduity of a man of rank and fashion was new to her but now the joys of being a countess began to fade in her imagination she hesitated she had not strength of mind sufficient to decide she was afraid to proceed yet she had not courage to retract ellens parting words recurred to her mind may you never feel the want of a sincere and affectionate friend may the triumphs of fashion make you amends for all you sacrifice to obtain them alas thought she ellen foresaw that i should soon be disgusted with this joyless heartless intercourse but how can i recede how can i disengage myself from this lord bradstone now that i have encouraged his addresses fool that i have been oh if i could now be advised by that best of friends who used to assist me in all my difficulties but she despises she has renounced me she has bid me farewell for ever notwithstanding this farewell for ever there was still at the bottom of almerias heart even whilst she bewailed herself in this manner a secret hope that ellens esteem and friendship might be recovered and she resolved to make the trial she was eager to put this idea into execution the moment it occurred to her and after apologizing to the lady bradstones for not as usual accompanying them in their morning ride she set out to walk to miss elmours lodgings it was a hot day she walked fast from the hurry and impatience of her mind the servant who attended her knocked twice at mr elmours door before any one answered at last the door was opened by a maid servant with a broom in her hand is miss elmour at home no sir she left cheltenham this morning betimes and we be getting the house ready for other lodgers almeria was very much disappointed she looked flushed and fatigued and the maid said maam if youll be pleased to rest a while youre welcome im sure and the parlours cleaned out be pleased to sit down maam almeria followed for she was really tired and glad to accept the good natured offer she was shown into the same parlour where she had but a few weeks before taken leave of ellen the maid rolled forward the great arm chair in which old mr elmour had been seated and as she moved it a gold headed cane fell to the ground almerias eyes turned upon it directly as it fell for it was an old friend of hers many a time she had played with it when she was a child and for many years she had been accustomed to see it in the hand of a man whom she loved and respected it brought many pleasing and some painful associations to her mind for she reflected how ill she had behaved to the owner of it the last time she saw him ay maam said the maid it is the poor old gentlemans cane sure enough it has never been stirred from here nor his hat and gloves see since the day he died died good heavens is mr elmour dead yes sure he died last tuesday and was buried yesterday youd better drink some of this water maam said the girl filling a glass that stood on the table why dear heart i would not have mentioned it so sudden in this way but i thought it could no way hurt you why it never came into my head you could be a friend of the familys nor more may be at the utmost than an acquaintance as you never used to call much during his illness this was the most cutting reproach and the innocence with which it was uttered made it still more severe almeria burst into tears and the poor girl not knowing what to say next and sorry for all she had said took up the cane which had fallen from almerias hands and applied herself to brightening the gold head with great diligence at this instant there was a double knock at the house door its only the young gentleman maam said the maid as she went towards the door what young gentleman said almeria rising from her seat young mr elmour maam he did not go away with his sister but stayed to settle some matters oh they have let him in the maid stood with the parlour door half open in her hand not being able to decide in her own fancy whether the lady wished that he should come into the room or stay out and before either she or perhaps almeria had decided this point it was settled for them by his walking in almeria was standing so as to be hid by the door and he was so intent upon his own thoughts that without perceiving there was any body in the room he walked straight forward to the table took up his fathers hat and gloves and gave a deep sigh he heard his sigh echoed looked up and started at the sight of almeria but immediately assumed an air of distant and cold respect he was in deep mourning and looked pale as if he had suffered much almeria endeavoured to speak but could get out only a few words expressive of the shock and astonishment she had just felt undoubtedly madam you must have been shocked replied frederick in a calm voice but you could not have reason to be much astonished my fathers life had been despaired of some time you must have seen how much he was changed when you were here a few weeks ago almeria could make no reply the tears in spite of all her efforts to restrain them rolled down her cheeks the cold and almost severe manner in which frederick spoke and the consciousness that she deserved it struck her to the heart he followed her as she abruptly quitted the room and in a tone of more kindness but with the same distant manner begged to have the honour of attending her home she bowed her head to give that assent which her voice could not at this instant utter and she was involuntarily going to put her arm within his but as he did not seem to perceive this motion she desisted coloured violently adjusted the drapery of her gown to give employment to the neglected hand then walked on with precipitation her foot slipped as she was crossing the street frederick offered his arm she could not guess from the way in which it was presented whether her former attempt had been perceived or not this trifle appeared to her a point of the utmost importance for by this she thought she could decide whether his feelings were really as cold towards her as they appeared whether he felt love and anger or contempt and indifference whilst she was endeavouring in vain to form her opinion all the time she leant upon his arm and walked on in silence a carriage passed them frederick bowed and his countenance was suddenly illuminated almeria turned eagerly to see the cause of the change and as the carriage drove on she caught a glimpse of a beautiful young lady a spasm of jealousy seized her heart she withdrew her arm from fredericks the abruptness of the action did not create any emotion in him his thoughts were absent in a few minutes he slackened his pace and turned from the road towards a path across the fields asking if miss turnbull had any objection to going that way to lady bradstones instead of along the dusty road she made no objection she thought she perceived that frederick was preparing to say something of importance to her and her heart beat violently miss turnbull will not i hope think what i am going to say impertinent she may be assured that it proceeds from no motive but the desire to prevent the future unhappiness of one who once honoured my family with her friendship you are too good i do not deserve that you should be interested in my happiness or unhappiness i cannot think you impertinent pray speak freely and quickly she would have added if she dared without abating any of his reserve from this encouragement he proceeded precisely in the same tone as before and with the same steady composure an accidental acquaintance with a friend of my lord bradstones has put me in possession of what perhaps you wish to be a secret madam and what i shall inviolably keep as such i cannot pretend to be ignorant of what you allude to said almeria but it is more than probable that you may not have heard the exact state of the business indeed it is impossible that you should because no one but myself could fully explain my sentiments in fact they were undecided i was this very morning going to consult your sister upon that subject you will not suppose that i am going to intrude my counsels upon you miss turnbull nothing can be farther from my intention i am merely going to mention a fact to you of which i apprehend you are ignorant and of which as you are circumstanced no one in your present society perhaps no one in the world but myself would choose to apprize you forgive me madam if i try your patience by this preface i am very desirous not to wound your feelings more than is necessary perhaps said almeria with a doubtful smile perhaps you are under a mistake and imagine my feelings to be much more interested than they really are if you have any thing to communicate to lord bradstones disadvantage you may mention it to me without hesitation and without fear of injuring my happiness or his for to put you at ease at once i am come to a determination positively to decline his lordships addresses this assurance certainly puts me at ease at once said frederick but almeria observed that he neither expressed by his voice nor countenance any of that joy which she had hoped to inspire by the assurance on the contrary he heard it as a determination in which he was personally unconcerned and in which pure benevolence alone could give him an interest this relieves me continued he from all necessity of explaining myself further nay said almeria but i must beg you will explain yourself you do not know but it may be necessary for me to have your antidote ready in case of a relapse no change at least none that betrayed the anxiety of a lover was visible in fredericks countenance at this hint of a relapse but he gravely answered that when so urged he could not forbear to tell her the exact truth that lord bradstone was a ruined man ruined by gaming and that he had been so indelicate as to declare to his friend that his sole object in marrying was money our heroines pride was severely hurt by the last part of this information but even that did not wound her so keenly as the manner in which frederick behaved she saw that he had no remains of affection for her lurking in his heart she saw that he now acted merely as he declared from a desire to save from misery one who had formerly honoured his family with her friendship stiff cold words she endeavoured to talk upon indifferent subjects but could not she was somewhat relieved when they reached lady bradstones door and when frederick left her the moment he was gone however she ran up stairs to her own apartment and looked eagerly out of her window to catch the last glimpse of him such is the strange caprice of the human heart that a lover appears the most valuable at the moment he is lost our heroine had felt all her affection for frederick revive with more than its former force within this last hour and she thought she now loved with a degree of passion of which she had never before found herself capable hope is perhaps inseparable from the existence of the passion of love she passed alternately from despair to the most flattering delusions she fancied that fredericks coldness was affected that he was acting only from honour that he wished to leave her at liberty and that as soon as he knew she was actually disengaged from lord bradstone he would fly to her with all his former eagerness this notion having once taken possession of her mind she was impatient in the extreme to settle her affairs with lord bradstone he was not at home he did not come in till late in the evening it happened that the next day almeria was to be of age and lord bradstone when he met her in the evening reminded her of her promise not to prolong the torments of suspense beyond that period she asked whether he had in compliance with her request communicated the affair to lady bradstone no but he would as soon as he had reasonable grounds of hope miss turnbull rejoiced that he had disobeyed her injunctions she said that lady bradstone might now be for ever spared hearing what would have inevitably excited her indignation his lordship stared and could not comprehend our heroines present meaning she soon made it intelligible we forbear to relate all that was said upon the occasion as it was a disappointment of the purse and not of the heart his lordship was of course obliged to make a proportional quantity of professions of eternal sorrow and disinterestedness almeria partly to save her own pride the mortification of the repetition forbore to allude to the confidential speech in which he had explained to a friend his motives for marrying she hoped that he would soon console himself with some richer heiress and she rejoiced to be disencumbered of him and even of his coronet for in this moment coronets seemed to her but paltry things so much does the appearance of objects vary according to the medium through which they are viewed better satisfied with herself after this refusal of the earl and in better spirits than she had been for some months she flattered herself with the hopes that frederick would call upon her again before he left cheltenham he would then know that lord bradstone was no longer her lover she fell asleep full of these imaginations dreamed of frederick and elmour grove but this was only a dream the next day and the next and the next passed without her seeing or hearing any thing of frederick and the fourth day as she rode by the house where the elmours had lodged she saw put up in the parlour window an advertisement of lodgings to be let she was now convinced that frederick had left cheltenham left it without thinking of her or of lord bradstone the young lady bradstones observed that she scarcely spoke a word during the remainder of her mornings ride at night she was attacked with a feverish complaint the image of the beautiful person whom she had seen in the coach that passed while she was walking with frederick was now continually before her eyes she had made all the inquiries she could to find out who that young lady might be but this point could not be ascertained because though she described the lady accurately she was not equally exact about the description of the carriage the arms and livery had totally escaped her observation the different conjectures that had been made by the various people to whom she had applied and the voices in which their answers were given ran in her head all this feverish night perhaps it was lady susanna quin very likely it was lady mary lowther very possibly miss grant you know she goes about with old mrs grant in a yellow coach but there are so many yellow coaches the arms or the livery would settle the point at once these words the arms and the livery would settle the point at once she repeated to herself perpetually though without annexing any ideas to the words in short she was very feverish all night and in the morning though she endeavoured to rise she was obliged to lie down again she was confined to her bed for about a week lady bradstone sent for the best physicians and the young ladies in the intervals of dressing and going out whenever they could remember it came into miss turnbulls room to hope she found herself better it was obvious to her that no one person in the house cared a straw about her and she was oppressed with the sense of being an encumbrance to the whole family whilst she was alone she formed many projects for her future life which she resolved to execute as soon as she should recover she determined immediately to go down to her own house in the country and to write to ellen a recantation of all her fine lady errors she composed whilst she lay on her feverish pillow twenty letters to her former friend each of them more eloquent and magnanimous than the other but in proportion as her fever left her the activity of her imagination abated and with it her eloquence and magnanimity her mind naturally weak and now enfeebled by disease became quite passive and received and yielded to the impressions made by external circumstances new trains of ideas perfectly different from those which had occupied her mind during her fever and in the days preceding her illness were excited during her convalescence she lay listening to or rather hearing the conversation of the young lady bradstones they used to come into her room at night and stay for some time whilst they had their hair curled and talked over the events of the day whom they had met what dresses they had worn what matches were on the tapis c they happened one night to amuse themselves with reading an old newspaper in which they came to an account of a splendid masquerade which had been given the preceding winter in london by a rich heiress lord what charming entertainments miss turnbull might give if she pleased why do you know she is richer than this woman whispered lady bab and she is of age now you know if i were she im sure id have a house of my own and the finest i could get in london now such a house as my aunt pierrepoints and servants and carriages and i would make myself of some consequence this speech was not lost upon our heroine and the whisper in which it was spoken increased its effect the next day as lady bab was sitting at the foot of almerias bed she asked for a description of my aunt pierrepoints house it was given to her con amore and a character of my aunt pierrepoint was added gratis she is the most charming amiable woman in the world quite a different sort of person from mamma she has lived all her life about court and she is connected with all the great people and a prodigious favourite at court and she is of such consequence you cannot imagine of what consequence she is lady gabriella then continued the conversation by telling miss turnbull a great secret that her aunt pierrepoint and her mother were not on the best terms in the world for mammas so violent you know about politics and quite on a contrary side to my aunt mamma never goes to court and between you and me they say she would not be received now that is a shocking thing for us but the most provoking part of the business is that mamma wont let my aunt pierrepoint present us why when she cannot or will not go to the drawing room herself what could be more proper you know than to let us be presented by lady pierrepoint lady pierrepoint you know who is such a prodigious favourite and knows every thing in the world thats proper at court and every where it really is monstrous of mamma now if you were in our places should not you be quite provoked by the bye you never were presented at court yourself were you never said almeria with a sudden feeling of mortification no you could not of course you could not living with mamma as you do for i am sure she would quarrel with an angel for just only talking of going to court lord if i was as rich as you what beautiful birthday dresses i would have these and similar conversations wrought powerfully upon the weak mind of our poor heroine she rose from her bed after her illness wondering what had become of her passion for frederick elmour certainly she was now able to console herself for his loss by the hopes of being presented at court and of being dressed with uncommon splendour she was surprised at this change in her own mind but she justified it to herself by the reflection that it would show an unbecoming want of spirit to retain any remains of regard for one who had treated her with so much coldness and indifference and who in all probability was attached to another woman pride and resentment succeeded to tenderness and she resolved to show frederick and ellen that she could be happy her own way it is remarkable that her friendship for the sister always increased or decreased with her love for her brother ambition as it has often been observed is a passion that frequently succeeds to love though love seldom follows ambition almeria who had now recovered her strength was one morning sitting in her own room meditating arrangements for the next winters campaign when she was roused by the voices of lady bab and lady kitty at her room door miss turnbull miss turnbull come come heres the king and queen and all the royal family and my aunt pierrepoint come quick to our dressing room windows or they will be out of sight the fair hoydens seized her between them and dragged her away mamma says its horribly vulgar to run to the windows but never mind that theres my aunt pierrepoints coach is not it handsome oh everything about her is so handsome you know she has lived all her life at court the eulogiums of these young ladies and the sight of lady pierrepoints entry in to cheltenham in the wake of royalty and the huzzas of the mob and the curiosity of all ranks who crowded the public walks in the evening to see the illustrious guest contributed to raise our heroines enthusiasm she was rather surprised afterwards to observe that lady pierrepoint passed her sister and nieces on the public walk without taking the slightest notice of them her head was turned indeed quite another way when she passed and she was in smiling conversation with one of her own party lady gabriella whispered my aunt pierrepoint cannot know us now because we are with mamma miss turnbull now for the first time saw lady bradstone in a situation in which she was neglected this served to accelerate the decline and fall of her ladyships power over her mind she began to consider her not as a person by whom she had been brought into notice in the circles of fashion but as one by whom she was prevented from rising to a higher orbit lady bradstone went to see her sister the day after her arrival but she was not at home some days afterwards lady pierrepoint returned her visit she came in a sedan chair because she did not wish that her carriage should be seen standing at lady bradstones door it was incumbent upon her to take every possible precaution to prevent the suspicion of her being biassed by sisterly affection her sister and she were unfortunately of such different opinions in politics and her sisters politics were so much disapproved of where lady pierrepoint most wished for approbation that she could not consistently with her principles or interest countenance them by appearing in public with one so obnoxious miss turnbull observed with the most minute attention every word and gesture of lady pierrepoint at first view her ladyship appeared all smiling ease and affability but in all her motions even in those of her face there was something that resembled a puppet her very smiles and the turns of her eyes seemed to be governed by unseen wires upon still closer observation however there was reason to suspect that this puppet might be regulated by a mind within of some sort or other for it could not only answer questions by a voice of its own and apparently without being prompted but moreover it seemed to hesitate and to take time for thought before it hazarded any reply lady pierrepoint spoke always as if she thought her words would be repeated and must lead to consequences and there was an air of vast circumspection and mystery about her which appeared sublime or ridiculous according to the light in which it was considered to our heroine it appeared sublime her ladyships conversation if a set of unmeaning phrases be deserving of that name at length turned upon the concern she felt that it had not been in her power to procure an increase of pension for a certain mrs vickars such a respectable character the widow of a distant relation of the pierrepoints there was no probability after all the interest and influence she had used she said that mrs vickars could ever be gratified in the line she had attempted that therefore it was her ladyships advice to her to look out for some situation of an eligible description which might relieve her from the distressing apprehension of appearing burdensome or importunate as well as her ladyships meaning could be made out cleared from the superfluity of words with which it was covered she wished to get rid of this poor widow and to fasten her as an humble companion upon any body who would be troubled with such a respectable character miss turnbull foresaw the possibility of obliging her ladyship by means of mrs vickars for as she proposed to purchase a house in town it would be convenient to her to have some companion and this lady who was of a certain age and who had always lived in the best company would be well suited to serve as her chaperon to do our heroine justice considering that she was unpractised in manoeuvring with court ladies she conducted her scheme with a degree of address worthy of her object through the medium of lady bab and lady gabriella she opened a correspondence with lady pierrepoint mrs vickars was introduced to miss turnbull liked her prodigiously and lady pierrepoint was most happy in the prospect of her relations being so eligibly situated in proportion as miss turnbull advanced in the good graces of lady pierrepoint she receded from lady bradstone this ladys indignation which had been excited against almeria by her not siding with her against her daughters now rose to the highest pitch when she perceived what was going on no crime could in her eyes be greater than that of seceding from her party her violence in party matters was heightened by the desire to contrast herself with her sister pierrepoints courtly policy lady bradstone all the time knew and cared very little about politics except so far as they afforded her opportunities for the display of spirit and eloquence she had a fine flow of words and loved to engage in argument especially as she had often been told by gentlemen that her enthusiasm became her extremely and that even if a man could resist the force of her arguments he must yield to the fire of her eyes it happened that miss turnbull was present one day when lady bradstone had been unusually warm in a political argument and lady pierrepoint as cool and guarded as her sister was eager almeria was appealed to and gave judgment in favour of lady pierrepoint who happened to be in the right regardless of right or wrong lady bradstone became more and more vehement whilst lady pierrepoint sat in all the composed superiority of silence maintaining the most edifying meekness of countenance imaginable as if it were incumbent on her to be or at least to seem penitent for a sisters perversity she sighed deeply when the tirade was finished and fixed her eyes upon her beautiful niece gabriella lady gabriella immediately filled up the pause by declaring that she knew nothing of politics and hoped she never should for that she did not know of what use they were to women except to prevent them from going to court lady bradstone expressed high indignation at perceiving that her daughters thought more of dancing at a birthnight ball than of the good of the nation mrs vickars who was present now interposed a word as mediatrix observing that it was natural for the young ladies at their age and miss turnbull catching or imitating something of the tone of lady pierrepoint ventured to add that it was a pity that lady bradstones daughters did not enjoy all the advantages of their high rank and that she really wished lady bradstone could be prevailed upon to enter into conciliatory measures on hearing this speech lady bradstone no longer able to restrain her anger within the bounds of politeness exclaimed i am not surprised at receiving such advice from you miss turnbull but i own i am astonished at hearing such sentiments from my daughters high sentiments are to be expected from high birth how lady bradstone contrived to make her aristocratic pride of birth agree with her democratic principles it may be difficult to explain but fortunately the idea of preserving consistency never disturbed her self complacency besides to keep her ladyship in countenance there are so many examples of persons who live as royalists and talk as republicans almeria could not brook the affront implied by lady bradstones last speech and matters were now brought to a crisis she resolved not to remain longer in a house where she was exposed to such insults she was of age and thank heaven independent lady bradstone made no opposition to her determination but congratulated her upon the prospect of becoming independent i agree with you miss turnbull in thanking heaven for making me independent independence of mind of course added she i value above independence of purse whatever vexation our heroine might feel from this speech and from the perfect indifference with which lady bradstone parted from her was compensated by the belief that she had by her conduct this evening ingratiated herself with lady pierrepoint she was confirmed in this opinion by mrs vickars who said that her ladyship afterwards spoke of miss turnbull as a very judicious and safe young person whom she should not scruple to protect she was even so condescending as to interest herself about the house in town which miss turnbull talked of purchasing she knew that a noble friend of hers who was going on a foreign embassy had thoughts of parting with his house and it would certainly suit miss turnbull if she could compass the purchase almeria felt herself highly honoured by her ladyships taking a concern in any of her affairs and she begged of mrs vickars to say that expense was no object to her she consequently paid a few hundred guineas more than the value of the house for the honour of lady pierrepoints interference her ladyship saw into the weakness of our heroines character and determined to make advantage of it it was a maxim of hers that there is no person so insignificant but some advantage may be made of them and she had acted upon this principle through life sometimes so as to excite in the minds of the ignorant a high admiration of her affability it is said that when lady pierrepoint was asked why she married she replied to increase my consequence and strengthen my connexions perhaps this speech was made for her by some malicious wit but it is certain that she never upon any occasion of her life neglected an opportunity of acting upon this principle she was anxious with this view to have as many dependents as possible and she well knew that those who were ambitious of a curtsy from her at the playhouse or a whisper at the opera were as effectually her dependents as the mendicants at her door who are in want of a shilling the poor may be held in the iron fetters of necessity but the rich are dragged behind the car of fashion by the golden chains of vanity the summer in the life of a fine lady is a season comparatively of so little consequence that the judicious historian may pass over some months of it without their being missed in the records of time he hastens to the busy and important season of winter our heroine took possession of her magnificent house in town and mrs vickars was established as arbitratrix elegantiarum this lady deemed herself a judge in the last appeal of every thing that became a person of fashion and her claim to infallibility upon those points was established by her being fourth cousin to lady pierrepoint almeria soon discovered in her companion an inordinate love of power and an irritability of temper which misfortunes and ill health had increased to such a degree that it required more than the patience of a female job to live with her upon good terms martyrs in the cause of vanity certainly exhibit wonderful if not admirable fortitude in the midst of the absurd and extravagant torments which they inflict upon themselves our heroine endured for a whole season without any outward complaint but with many an inward groan the penance which she had imposed upon herself the extent of it can be comprehended only by those who have been doomed to live with a thoroughly ill tempered woman the reward was surely proportioned to the sufferings miss turnbull received a smile or a nod or something like a curtsy from lady pierrepoint whenever she met her in public her ladyships cards were occasionally left at the yorkshire heiresss door and she sometimes honoured miss turnbulls crowded rooms by crowding them still more with her august presence there was further reason to hope that her ladyship might be induced to present almeria at court before the next birthday all these advantages were to be attributed to mrs vickars for she was the connecting link between two beings of inferior and superior order we forbear to describe or even to enumerate the variety of balls suppers dinners djeuns galas and masquerades which miss turnbull gave to the fashionable world during this winter the generous public forget these things the week after they are over and the consequence they bestow endures no longer than the track of a triumphal chariot our heroine was never fully convinced of this truth till it was confirmed by her own experience she found it necessary continually to renew her expensive efforts to keep herself alive in the memory of her great acquaintance towards the time when she expected to be presented at court by lady pierrepoint a sudden coolness was apparent in her ladyships manner and one morning almeria was surprised by a note from her regretting in the most polite but positive terms that it would be absolutely out of her power to have the honour of presenting miss turnbull at st jamess in the utmost consternation almeria flew for an explanation to mrs vickars mrs vickars was in a desperate fit of the sullens which had lasted now upwards of eight and forty hours ever since her advice had not been taken about the placing of certain bronze figures with antique lamps in their hands upon the great staircase it was necessary to bring the lady into a good humour in the first place by yielding to her uncontrolled dominion over the candelabras this point being settled and an unqualified submission in all matters of taste past present or to come declared or implied on the part of our heroine mrs vickars on her part promised to set out immediately on an embassy to lady pierrepoint to discover the cause of the present discontent after making sundry ineffectual attempts to see her noble relation she was at last admitted and after one hours private audience she returned to the anxious almeria with a countenance lengthened to the utmost stretch of melancholy significance what is the matter mrs vickars it was long before this question was answered but after many friendly lamentations mrs vickars could not help observing that miss turnbull had nobody to blame in this business but herself this or any thing else she was willing to admit to get at the point but what have i done i dare say it is as you say all my own fault but tell me how how can you my dearest miss turnbull forget that you did the most imprudent and really unaccountable thing that ever woman did lady pierrepoint had it from stock the banker now you must be certainly conscious to what i allude almeria still looked innocent till mrs vickars produced the book dedicated to lady bradstone for twelve copies of which miss turnbull had subscribed her name was printed among the list of subscribers and there was no palliating the fact when her companion saw that she was quite overwhelmed with the sense of this misfortune she began to hint that though the evil was great it was not without remedy that in her own private opinion lady pierrepoint might have passed over the thing if she had not heard it at a most unlucky moment the provoking banker mentioned it to her ladyship just after he had disappointed her of certain moneys for which she was negotiating from her situation and means of obtaining secret and early intelligence she had it frequently in her power to make money by selling in or out of the stocks such an opportunity at present occurred and it was a great pity mrs vickars observed that the want of a little ready money should preclude her from the possibility of profiting by her situation miss turnbull who was not deficient in quickness of comprehension upon this hint immediately said that her ladyship might command some thousands which she had in sir thomas stocks bank lady pierrepoint the next day found that it would be best to hush up the affair of the subscription to the fatal pamphlet she said that she had with infinite satisfaction ascertained that the thing had not been noticed in the quarter where she feared it would have created an insuperable prejudice that there were other turnbulls as she was happy to understand in the world besides mrs vickarss friend and that as in the list of subscribers she was mentioned only as miss turnbull not as almeria turnbull all was safe and nobody would suspect that a lady presented at court by my lady pierrepoint could be the same person that subscribed to a book of such a description this affair being adjusted the league was tacitly formed between interest and vanity miss turnbull was presented at court by lady pierrepoint and her ladyship bought into the stocks with the yorkshire heiresss money the gratification of almerias ambition however did not complete her happiness when she was at the summit of the alps of fashion she saw how little was to be seen though she liked to have it to say that she was a great deal with lady pierrepoint yet the time always passed most heavily in her company nor was the inferiority of this ladys understanding compensated by an affectionate heart her smoothly polished exterior prevented all possibility of obtaining any hold over her she had the art at once to seem to be intimate with people and to keep them at the greatest distance as in certain optical deceptions an object which appears close to us eludes our hand if we attempt to grasp it almeria felt the want of that species of unreserved confidence and friendship which she had formerly enjoyed with ellen in judging of what will make us happy we are apt to leave time out of the account and this leads to most important errors for a short period we may be amused or gratified by what will fatigue and disgust us if long continued the first winter that she spent in dissipation she was amused but winter after winter passed and the recurrence of the same public diversions and the same faces and the same common place conversation wearied instead of interesting her but as the pleasure of novelty declined the power of habit increased and she continued the same course of life for six years six long years against both her judgment and her feelings the absolute slave of an imaginary necessity thus the silly chicken remains prisoner in a circle of chalk even when the hand by which it was held down is removed it feels an imaginary pressure from which it dares not even attempt to escape almeria however was now arrived at an age when she could no longer with any propriety be called a chicken she was seven and twenty and the effect of keeping late hours and the continual petty irritations to which she had been subject were sufficiently visible in her countenance she looked in a morning so faded and haggard that any one not used to the wear and tear of fashionable faces would have guessed almerias age to be seven and thirty instead of seven and twenty during her six campaigns in london she or her fortune had made many conquests but none of her london captives had ever obtained any power over her affections and her ambition could not decide upon the pretensions of her several suitors lady pierrepoint who was her prime adviser had an interest in keeping her unmarried because during this time her ladyship employed most advantageously certain moneys which she had borrowed from our heiress this female politician made some objection to every proposal continually repeating that miss turnbull might do better that she might look higher that with her pretensions there could be no doubt that she would have a variety of advantageous offers and that her play should be to raise her value by rejecting without hesitation all pretenders but those of the first distinction lady pierrepoint who usually spoke with all the ambiguity of an oracle seemed on this subject more than usually mysterious she dropped half sentences then checked herself hinted that she was not at liberty to speak out but that she had her own private reasons for advising her friend miss turnbull not to be precipitate in her choice her ladyships looks said more than her words and almeria interpreted them precisely as she wished there was a certain marquis whom she sometimes met at lady pierrepoints and whom she would have been pleased to meet more frequently he was neither young nor handsome nor witty nor wise what was he then he was a marquis and is not that enough almeria saw that he was looked up to as a person of great influence and importance and she now had the habit of trusting to the eyes and ears of others she now considered what people were thought of not what they really were and according to this mode of estimation she could not fail to form a high opinion of this exalted personage he paid her distinguished but not decisive attention and perhaps the uncertainty in which she was kept as to his views increased her interest upon the subject there was always some obstacle which seemed to prevent him from declaring himself at one time he was suddenly obliged to go ambassador to some foreign court he went and stayed a year at his return he was immersed in politics and deplored his hard fate in terms which almeria thought it was impossible not to construe favourably to her wishes she thought she was upon the point of becoming a marchioness when his lordship was again sent into what he called banishment lady pierrepoint had constantly letters from him however passages from which she from time to time read to almeria in whose weak mind this kept alive an indistinct hope for which she had no rational foundation she was confirmed in her belief that the marquis had serious thoughts of her by the opinion of mrs vickars who she thought was in the secret and who certainly would not speak decidedly without sufficient reason indeed nothing but the pleasure she received from mrs vickarss favourable prognostics upon this subject could have in any degree balanced the pain she daily endured from this ladys fretful temper almeria submitted to her domineering humour and continued to propitiate her with petty sacrifices more from fear than love from fear that her adverse influence might be fatal to her present scheme of aggrandizement weak minds are subject to this apprehension of control from secret causes utterly inadequate to their supposed effects and thus they put their destiny into the hands of persons who could not otherwise obtain influence over their fate the time at length arrived when our heroine was to be confirmed in her expectations or wakened from her state of self delusion the marquis returned from abroad and lady pierrepoint wrote a note more mysteriously worded than usual signifying that she wished to have a conference with miss turnbull on a subject of some importance and begged to know at what hour in the morning she might be secure of the pleasure of finding her at home almeria named her hour and waited for its arrival with no small impatience lady pierrepoints thundering knock at the door was heard her ladyship was shown up stairs and she entered the room with a countenance that seemed to promise well she preluded with many flattering phrases declared that ever since she had been first acquainted with miss turnbull at cheltenham she had always considered her with sentiments of esteem of which she had since given indeed the most convincing proofs by accepting of obligations from her obligations exclaimed almeria with an air of polite astonishment yes my dear miss turnbull continued her ladyship with still more polite humility i am under obligations to you assuredly things of a pecuniary nature ought not to be named i confess in the same sentence with friendship yet for the sake of ones family it is whilst we remain in this world the duty of every one to pay a certain degree of attention to such points and a person who has like me advantages of situation and connexions would not be justifiable in neglecting under due limitations to make use of them miss turnbull readily assented to these guarded truisms but wondered to what all this was to lead the money which you have had the goodness to trust in my hands continued her ladyship has without in the least impoverishing or i hope inconveniencing you been of the most material advantage to me almeria comprehended that her ladyship referred to her speculations in the stocks and she congratulated her upon her success and added assurances that for her own part she had not been in the slightest degree inconvenienced whilst miss turnbull uttered these assurances however she was not sorry to see lady pierrepoint take out of her pocket book bank notes to the amount of her debt for in plain truth the interest of this loan had never been punctually paid and almeria had often regretted that she had placed so much of her fortune out of her own power let me now return these to you with a thousand thanks said her ladyship indeed my niece gabriella has more reason even than i have to thank you for you must know my dear miss turnbull that all my speculations have been for her from the time that she came to live with me i was determined that she should be properly established and you must be sensible that for a young ladys establishment in our days money is as essential as beauty la belle gabrielle is now provided for as she ought to be and of course the consequence will be a suitable alliance miss turnbull expressed her satisfaction at finding that her money had been instrumental in attaining so happy a purpose and presumed to ask if her ladyship had any immediate alliance in view it is a secret as yet but i have no secrets for you my dear miss turnbull indeed i came here this morning by our dear gabriellas particular desire to communicate it to you i flatter myself you will approve of her choice our favourite marquis almeria was so much astonished and shocked by these words that she turned as pale as if she were going to faint our favourite marquis she repeated in a faltering voice i thought the fear of becoming ridiculous restrained her anger and she paused you thought perhaps resumed the perfectly composed lady pierrepoint you thought perhaps my dear that there was too great a disparity of age between gabriella and the marquis oh no why that is an objection i confess at least it would be to some young ladies but as gabriella is satisfied we may waive that oh yes certainly one cannot help being interested for him he is such a respectable character and so much in love it would really surprise you my dear for you know he was a man one would have imagined so much immersed in politics i protest i never had a suspicion of his having a thought of gabriella till the proposal was absolutely made i am sure i never suspected the marquiss attachment to lady gabriella said miss turnbull on the contrary on the contrary pursued lady pierrepoint he paid her always as i remember less attention than to twenty others who were indifferent to him the struggle was still violent in our heroines mind between rage and the dread of exposing herself to ridicule lady pierrepoint saw this and coolly held her in this dilemma now continued her ladyship men are such unaccountable creatures one never can understand them do you know my dear miss turnbull i had till his lordship explained himself unequivocally to me a notion that he was in love with you really said our heroine forcing a laugh did your friend mrs vickars never tell you so yes she did frequently both of us mistaken you see my dear mortifying to find ones judgment so fallible i tell the marquis he might absolutely have been privately married to gabriella without my finding him out it is so easy now the easiest thing in the world to impose upon me well i must bid you adieu for the present my dear miss turnbull you may imagine i have a world of business on my hands with the utmost appearance of cordiality lady pierrepoint shook our heroines receding hand and without seeming to notice the painful emotions visible in almerias countenance departed smiling and perfectly composed the moment that her ladyship had left the room our heroine retired to her own apartment and hastily bolted the door to prevent the intrusion of mrs vickars whose curiosity and condolence whether real or affected she was not in a humour to endure she walked up and down the room in great agitation by turns angry with lady pierrepoint with the marquis with lady gabriella with mrs vickars and with herself after her anger had spent itself the sorrowful certainty that it was unavailing remained the disappointment was irremediable and her mortification was the more poignant because she had no human being to sympathize in her feelings no one to whom she could complain so this is fashionable friendship said she to herself this is the end of all lady pierrepoints and lady gabriellas professions of regard for me fool that i have been to become their dupe with my eyes open i saw nothing that was going forward though now i can recollect a thousand and a thousand circumstances by which i might have been undeceived but i trusted implicitly idiot that i was to the friendship of this treacherous unfeeling courtier once i had a friend to whom i might trust implicitly i never never shall find her equal a transient recollection of former times crossed her mind but those times could not be recalled and the present pressed upon her most forcibly frustrated in all her ambitious schemes she was sensible that all that now remained for her was to conceal her disappointment and to avoid the contempt to which she would be exposed in the world if it were whispered that miss turnbull had fancied that the marquis of was in love with her whilst he was all the while paying his addresses to lady gabriella bradstone this powerful fear of ridicule conquered or suppressed all other feelings with all the resolution she could assume almeria went to mrs vickars and congratulated her upon the happy event which was soon likely to take place in her family she even constrained herself so far as without expressing either suspicion or resentment to hear her companion disclaim all knowledge of the affair and declare that she had that morning for the first time heard of it from lady pierrepoint with a degree of astonishment from which she had not yet recovered in a few weeks afterwards lady gabriellas marriage took place our heroines mortification was much increased by the splendour in which the bride appeared and by the great share of the public attention which the fair marchioness seemed for some days to engross miss turnbull was weary of hearing the praises of her equipages and dress and the dissimulation she was continually obliged to practise towards mrs vickars became intolerable nothing but a pretext for quarrelling with this lady was wanting to almeria and nothing but an excuse for leaving almeria was now desired by mrs vickars who had received an invitation from the marchioness which she was impatient to accept the ladies one morning after breakfast fell into a dispute upon the comparative merits of blue and green it was not to all appearance a very dangerous subject but in certain situations every subject becomes dangerous this riband is a beautiful blue said miss turnbull i confess i do not think so said mrs vickars it is a very unbecoming shade of blue unbecoming i have been told by twenty people that it is remarkably becoming to me mrs ingoldsby told me yesterday that she never saw so beautiful a blue mrs ingoldsbys taste is not infallible i imagine said mrs vickars with a contemptuous smile it may not be infallible replied our heroine but it is at least as much to be relied upon as other peoples i am sure i do not pretend to compare my taste to mrs ingoldsbys but i may be permitted to have an opinion of my own i hope and in my opinion it is a frightful blue and shockingly unbecoming and at all events i like green infinitely better than blue and i beseech you miss turnbull not to wear this hideous riband i am sure i dont pretend to set my taste in competition with mrs vickarss but i must confess i cannot think this a frightful blue or shockingly unbecoming nor can i agree with any body in preferring green to blue and for once i shall take the liberty of following my own fancy for once i am sorry i ever presumed to offer an opinion upon this or any other subject to miss turnbull i shall be more cautious in future but i candidly own i did think i might prefer green to blue without giving offence it gives me no offence i assure you mrs vickars that you should prefer green to blue i am not so ridiculous but people who cannot bear to be contradicted themselves are always apt to fancy that others have the same strange sort of domineering temper people who can bear nothing but flattery miss turnbull should have such a friend as mrs ingoldsby who would swear that blue is green and black white i make no doubt said mrs vickars for my part i am sorry i cannot get rid of my troublesome sincerity sincerity sincerity to do you justice mrs vickars whatever i may have felt about trifles in affairs of importance i have never found your sincerity troublesome the ironical accent upon the word sincerity sufficiently marked miss turnbulls meaning the irritable temper of mrs vickars put it out of her power to act a part with that exquisite dissimulation for which some of her sex have been celebrated by the judicious davila thrown off her guard by the last sarcastic insinuation mrs vickars burst into an angry defence of her own sincerity with respect to the affair of the marquis and lady gabriella almeria observed that this defence was quite unnecessary as she had not made any accusation and these apologies could be prompted only by mrs vickarss own tenderness of conscience mrs vickars replied with increasing acrimony she said that her conduct needed no apologies and that she should not stoop to make any to soothe the disappointed ambition of any person whatever reproach succeeded reproach sarcasm produced sarcasm till at last mrs vickars declared that after what had passed it was impossible she should remain another day in miss turnbulls house this declaration was heard by almeria with undisguised satisfaction the next day mrs vickars accepted of an invitation from the marchioness and our heroine afterwards protested that she was as much rejoiced to be freed from the encumbrance of such a companion as sinbad the sailor was to get rid of the old man of the sea who fastened himself upon his shoulders with such remorseless tenacity she resolved to be more cautious in choice of her next companion there were many candidates for the honour of supplying the place of mrs vickars amongst these was mrs ingoldsby a lady who was perfect mistress of the whole art of flattery by means of which she had so far ingratiated herself with miss turnbull that she felt secure of a preference over all competitors almeria had indeed almost decided in her favour when she received a note from a mrs wynne an old lady with whom she had formerly been acquainted in yorkshire and who being just come to town was eager to renew her intimacy with miss turnbull she was a woman of an excellent heart and absolutely incapable of suspecting that others could be less frank or friendly than herself she was sometimes led into mistakes by this undistinguishing benevolence for she imagined that all which appeared wrong would prove right if properly understood that there must be some good reason for every thing that seemed to be bad that every instance of unkindness or insolence was undesigned and that every quarrel was only a misunderstanding possessed by this good natured kind of wrong headedness she frequently did the most provoking by way of doing the most obliging things imaginable upon this principle she would place contending parties by surprise in the very situation which of all others they most wished to avoid and then give the signal for a pitched battle by begging the enemies would shake hands with one another now she had heard it reported in yorkshire that there was some coolness between the elmours and miss turnbull but she was morally certain there could be no truth in this report for a variety of the very best reasons in the world in the first place argued mrs wynne to my certain knowledge miss turnbull was from her infancy always the greatest favourite at elmour grove the pupil of the good old gentleman and the intimate friend of the daughter during that odd hodgkinsons lifetime almeria was always with miss ellen elmour who treated her quite like a sister i am sure i remember as if it was yesterday her introducing miss turnbull to me and the affectionate way in which she spoke of her and i particularly recollect hearing almeria turnbull amongst other grateful things say that she should wish to live and die with her friends at elmour grove then she had stronger reasons afterwards for being attached to them you know it was mr frederick elmour who gained her large fortune for her i was in the court house in york the very day the cause was decided and i never heard a man speak with more energy and eloquence than frederick elmour did in her defence it was plain indeed that the eloquence came from his heart as to the law part of the business i know my nephew who understands those things said it was a very nice question and that if her cause had not been managed as ably as it was she would not have gained her fortune now of course this was a thing that never could be forgotten i own i expected that there would have been a match between miss turnbull and mr elmour but sir thomas stock her guardian took her away from us and mr elmour fell in love with another lady but all this time miss turnbull has never married though she has been so much in the great world and from her large fortune must have had so many offers i heard it said yesterday that she had refused sir thomas stocks eldest son and my lord bradstone and some others now it is plain she would not marry merely for money or title my nephew who is so amiable and sensible is just the man for her and he had used to admire her very much in former times when he met her at elmour grove mrs wynne hinted her wishes to her nephew but he seemed not much inclined towards miss turnbull because said he though frederick and his sister never uttered a syllable to her disadvantage i cannot from circumstances help imagining that she has not behaved well to them and besides after five or six years spent in the great world and in all the dissipation in which she has lived her disposition cannot probably be the same as it was when i knew her in the country mrs wynne could not with her good natured eyes see the force of any of these objections and she was determined to convince her nephew of their futility with this view she formed a scheme which was to be kept a profound secret from the parties concerned till the moment when it should be ripe for execution she heard that miss turnbull was in want of a companion and she knew that mrs henry elmour a very amiable young widow distantly related to the elmour family and who had formerly been a friend of almerias was at this moment in great distress she had no doubt that miss turnbull would be delighted with an opportunity of serving any one connected with a family to whom she owed such obligations mrs wynne fancied that this would be the finest occasion imaginable to prove to her nephew that notwithstanding almeria had lately lived so much in the fashionable world she had the same grateful heart as formerly eager to come to this demonstration mrs wynne wrote immediately to the distressed widow begging her to come to town with all possible expedition for i have found or at least i am morally sure of finding the most charming situation your heart can desire i say no more that i may not deprive you of the pleasure of the surprise the same day that she sent this letter to the post she despatched the following note to almeria my dear miss turnbull i am too well persuaded of the goodness of your heart to fear that you should think my present interference impertinent we used to be very good friends in yorkshire and i am sure shall be just the same in london therefore i write without ceremony as friends should i called upon you twice but found you were unluckily not at home now i have a matter very near my heart to speak to you about that perhaps will turn out as much to your satisfaction as to mine i cannot express myself so well as i could wish in writing but am sure you will not repent your kindness if you will do us the honour of dining with us in a family way on friday next and in the mean time let me beg you will not decide your choice of a companion i cannot be more explicit lest as i have said once before to day i should deprive you of the pleasure of the surprise dear madam forgive this freedom in one who most sincerely wishes you well as friday will prove my nephew henry wynne whom you may remember a great admirer of yours desires his best respects and with every good wish i remain dear miss turnbulls affectionate humble servant m wynne this letter at first surprised our heroine and afterwards afforded subject for much ridicule to mrs ingoldsby to whom almeria showed it she laughed at the odd freedom of the yorkshire dame at the old fashioned plainness of the style parenthesis within parenthesis at last concluding with respects and best wishes and remaining dear miss turnbulls humble servant she opined however upon the third perusal of the letter that mrs wynne was anxious to present her nephew to miss turnbull and that this was the real meaning of her curious note that probably she wished to surprise her with the sight of some yorkshire damsel who had formed the reasonable expectation that because miss turnbull had done her the honour to notice her ages ago in the country she was to be her companion in town mrs ingoldsby further observed that mrs wynne though she had not practised at court was no bad politician in thus attempting to recommend a companion to miss turnbull who would of course be entirely in her nephews interests almerias vanity was indirectly flattered by these insinuations which tended to prove her vast consequence in being thus the object of plots and counterplots and she the more readily believed this from the experience she had had of lady pierrepoints manoeuvres it is really a dreadful thing said she to be a great heiress one must be so circumspect so much upon ones guard with all the world but poor mrs wynne shows her cards so plainly one must be an idiot not to guess her whole play to mistake reverse of wrong for right is one of the most common errors in the conduct of life our heroine being sensible that she had been ridiculously credulous in her dealings with lady pierrepoint was now inclined to be preposterously suspicious she determined with her next admirer to pursue a system diametrically opposite to that which she had followed with the marquis she had shown him attractive complaisance she was now prepared to display the repulsive haughtiness becoming the representative of two hundred thousand pounds she had completely adopted lady pierrepoints maxim that a lady should marry to increase her consequence and strengthen her connexions her former ideas that love and esteem were necessary to happiness in a union for life seemed obsolete and romantic and the good qualities of her admirers though they were always to be mentioned as the ostensible reasons for her choice were never in reality to influence her decision to stoop at once from a marquis to a private gentleman would be terrible yet that private gentleman was worthy of some little consideration not because he was as almeria remembered a man of excellent sense temper and character but because he had a clear estate of eight thousand pounds a year and was next heir to an earldom miss turnbull cannot properly be called a female fortune hunter but to coin a new name for our heroine which may be useful to designate a numerous class of her contemporaries she was decidedly a female title hunter she accepted of the invitation to dinner and accompanied by a proper supporter in mrs ingoldsby went to mrs wynnes dressed in the utmost extravagance of the mode blazing in all the glory of diamonds in hopes of striking admiration even unto awe upon the hearts of all beholders though she had been expressly invited to a family party she considered that only as an humble country phrase to excuse beforehand any deficiency of magnificence she had no doubt that the finest entertainment and the finest company mrs wynne could procure or collect would be prepared for her reception she was somewhat surprised especially as she came fashionably late to find in the drawing room only old mrs wynne her nephew and a lady who from her dress and modest appearance was evidently nobody miss turnbull swept by her though she had a disagreeable recollection of having somewhere seen this figure in a former state of existence mrs wynne good soul did not believe in wilful blindness and she therefore said with provoking simplicity miss turnbull this is your good friend mrs henry elmour poor thing she is sadly altered in her looks since you saw her a gay rosy lass at elmour grove but though her looks are changed her heart i can answer for it is just the same as ever and she remembers you with all the affection you could desire she would not be like any other of her name indeed if she did otherwise the elmours were all so fond of you the name of elmour instead of having that irresistible charm which mrs wynne expected over almerias heart produced a directly contrary effect it recalled many associations that were painful to her pride she was vexed to perceive that obligations and intimacies which she had forgotten or which she wished to forget were remembered so obstinately by others all this passed in her mind whilst mrs wynne was speaking with a look of ill humoured surprise almeria half rose from her seat and as mrs henry elmour was presented to her uttered some phrases in an unintelligible voice and then sunk back again on the sofa mrs wynne made room for the widow between her and miss turnbull mr wynne kept aloof a dead silence ensued and miss turnbull seeing that in her present position there was nothing else to be done condescended to hope that all mrs henry elmours friends in yorkshire were well when she left them mrs wynnes countenance brightened up and she now addressed her conversation to mrs ingoldsby in order to leave the pair whom she had destined to be friends at perfect liberty to talk over old times mrs henry elmour naturally spoke of the happy days which they had spent together at elmour grove but miss turnbull was so much occupied in clasping one of her diamond bracelets that half of what was said to her seemed not to be heard and the other half to create no interest she looked up when she had at length adjusted her bracelet and with an insipid smile learnt from lady pierrepoint seemed to beg pardon for her fit of absence the unfortunate mrs elmour recommenced all she had said but though miss turnbulls eyes were at this time directed towards the widows face they wandered over her features with such insolent examination that she was totally abashed having gained her point our heroine now looked round as the door opened in expectation of the entrance of some persons who might be worthy of her attention but lo it was only a servant who announced that dinner was served miss turnbulls surprise could be equalled only by her indignation when she found that it was literally to a family party she was invited miss turnbull said mrs wynne as they were sitting down to dinner i have been much disappointed in not having the company of some friends of yours who i expected would dine with us to day but they will be with us i hope to night they were unluckily engaged to dine with the duchess of a miss turnbull vouchsafed to appear interested when the name of a duchess was mentioned but her countenance again changed to an expression of almost angry vexation when mrs wynne explained that these friends were mr and mrs elmour and mr charles wynne and his lady miss ellen elmour you know she was very true i saw her marriage in the papers i remember some time ago replied miss turnbull a year if im not mistaken two years ago madam said mrs wynne was it two i dare say it might you know it is so impossible to keep a register of deaths and marriages in ones head pray are you at all acquainted mrs wynne with the duchess of a she was always a prodigious friend of the elmours as i remember how is that are they any way related i wonder yes they are now related by marriage said mr wynne mrs elmour is a niece of the duchess indeed she is a charming woman said mr wynne so beautiful and yet so unaffected so sensible yet so unassuming pray interrupted mrs ingoldsby has not her grace conversaziones or reading parties or something in that style every week she is quite a learned lady i understand there was always something odd about her and i cannot help being afraid of her i assure you said mrs wynne that there is nothing odd or strange about the duchess of a she has always the most agreeable society that london can afford miss turnbull and mrs ingoldsby interchanged looks of affected contempt but mr wynne added her grace has you know a taste for literature and for the arts and the most celebrated literary characters as well as those who have distinguished themselves in active life assemble at her house where they can enjoy the most agreeable conversation that in which a knowledge of books and of the world is happily blended and as to being afraid of her grace resumed mrs wynne that is quite impossible she has such affable engaging manners i am sure even i am not in the least afraid of her but you know said miss turnbull with a malicious look of mock humility there is a difference between you and me i would not meet her grace for the world for i am persuaded i should not be able to articulate a syllable in her classical presence i have not been used to that style of company by any means i assure you i should be as mrs ingoldsby says horribly afraid of your witty duchess she has none of the airs of a wit believe me said mrs wynne growing more and more earnest and if you will not believe me ask your friend ellen oh excuse me i beseech i shall ask no questions i only beg leave to keep myself well when i am well the elmours who are so clever and have such merit and so on are all vastly better suited to her grace than i am no contradiction ensued our heroine was mortified beyond the power of concealment after dinner when the ladies retired mrs wynne though somewhat alarmed and puzzled by miss turnbulls behaviour summoned all the resolution which benevolence could inspire and resolved at once to come to the point with our heroine she flattered herself that all in miss turnbull that appeared inauspicious to her hopes was only her manner that sort of manner which people who live much in high life catch and practise without meaning to give themselves airs or to humble their neighbours many persons will perhaps think good mrs wynne almost an idiot but she was a woman of abilities and if she did not exert them in discovering with promptitude the follies of others she enjoyed much happiness in her benevolent scepticism this evening however she was doomed to be absolutely convinced against her will that she had formed too favourable an opinion of one of her fellow creatures she was eager to explain herself to almeria before ellen and mr frederick elmour should arrive she therefore took her aside and began without any preface my dear miss turnbull here is a charming opportunity for you to do a kind and generous and grateful action this poor mrs henry elmour she has told you how she has been reduced to distress without any imprudence of hers now you could not i am sure prove the goodness of your own heart better to your friends who will be here in half an hour than by showing kindness to this unfortunate widow i cannot presume to say more than that i think she would make a most agreeable companion to an amiable sensible young lady and you have not decided your choice have you pardon me i have decided beyond a possibility of retracting replied miss turnbull haughtily i am very sorry said mrs wynne with an expression of real concern in her countenance i have been very imprudent really i am infinitely distressed that it is out of my power to oblige her but the lady who is with me now mrs ingoldsby has a prior claim prior claim prior to that of the elmour family thought mrs wynne the decisive manner in which miss turnbull spoke precluded all further hope well i did think it would have been such a pleasure to miss turnbull to meet mrs henry elmour and all her old friends the elmours here to day and i fancied that if there had been any little coolness or misunderstanding it would quite have passed off and that i should have had the joy of seeing you all shake hands i thought it would have been such an agreeable surprise to you to see all the elmour family and ellens charming little girl and mr frederick elmours boy a more disagreeable surprise could scarcely have been imagined for our heroine she informed mrs wynne coldly that there was not the slightest quarrel between her and any of the elmours and that therefore there was no necessity or possible occasion for any shaking of hands or reconciliation scenes that undoubtedly the style of life she had been thrown into had entirely separated her from her yorkshire acquaintance and time had dissolved the sort of intimacy that neighbourhood had created that she should always notwithstanding be most particularly happy to meet any of the elmour family though from her situation it was a good fortune she had not often enjoyed nor indeed could in future expect but that she wished it to be understood and repeated that she always in all companies properly acknowledged the obligations she had to mr frederick elmour as a lawyer her cause she believed was the first in which he had distinguished himself and she was rejoiced to find that he had since risen so rapidly in his profession as to miss ellen elmour she was a very charming sensible young woman no doubt and miss turnbull assured mrs wynne she was delighted to hear she was so suitably married in point of understanding and temper and all that sort of thing and besides to a gentleman of a reasonable fortune which she was happy to hear mr charles wynne possessed here she was interrupted in her speech the door opened and the duchess of a mr and mrs elmour and mr and mrs charles wynne were announced our heroine was not prepared for the sight of the duchess and her graces appearance made her receive her old friends in a manner very different from that in which she had determined to meet them practised as she was she stood irresolute and awkward whilst ellen with easy graceful kindness accosted her and immediately introduced her to the duchess of a as mr frederick elmour approached and as his beautiful wife was presented to miss turnbull not all her efforts could conceal the mortification she endured whilst she pronounced that she was vastly happy quite delighted that all this was really such an agreeable and unexpected surprise to her for she did not even know any of her yorkshire friends were in town mrs ingoldsby came up to her assistance miss turnbull rallied her spirits and determined to make her stand upon the exclusive ground of fashion those who comprehend the rights of the privileged orders of fashion are aware that even a commoner who is in a certain set is far superior to a duchess who is not supposed to move in that magic circle almeria upon this principle began to talk to the duchess of some of her acquaintance who were of the highest ton and then affectedly checked herself and begged pardon and looked surprised at mrs ingoldsby when she found that her grace was not acquainted with them much as miss turnbull had reason to complain of lady pierrepoint and the young bride the marchioness she now thought that their names would do her honour and she scrupled not to speak of them as her best friends and as the most amiable creatures existing such is the meanness and insufficiency of vanity poor lady pierrepoint said the duchess of a with her independent fortune what could tempt her to enslave herself as she has done to a court life her ladyship finds herself suited to her situation i believe said miss turnbull lady pierrepoint is certainly formed more than most people i know to succeed and shine in a court and she is in favour and in power and in fashion does it follow of course that she is happy said ellen oh happy of course i suppose so no doubt said mrs ingoldsby she has every reason to be happy has not she just made her niece marchioness miss turnbull repeated happy to be sure lady pierrepoint is happy if any body in the world is happy a short sigh escaped from our heroine ellen heard the sigh and attended to it more than to her words she looked upon her with compassion and endeavoured to change the conversation we spend this winter in town and as i think i know your real tastes almeria said she taking almerias hand we must have the pleasure of introducing you to some of her graces literary friends who will i am sure please and suit you particularly mr frederick elmour who now really pitied almeria though in his pity there was a strong mixture of contempt joined his sister in her kindness and named and described some of the people whom he thought she would be most desirous of knowing the names struck miss turnbulls ears for they were the names of persons distinguished in the fashionable as well as in the literary world and she was dismayed and mortified by the discovery that her country friends had by some means incomprehensible to her gained distinction and intimacy in society where she had merely admission she was vexed beyond expression when she found that the elmours were superior to her even on her own ground at this instant mrs wynne with her usual simplicity asked mrs elmour and ellen why they had not brought their charming children with them adding you are my dears without exception the two happiest mothers and wives i am acquainted with and after all what happiness is there equal to domestic happiness oh my dear miss turnbull trust me though i am a silly old woman theres nothing like it and friends at court are not like friends at home and all the lady pierrepoints that ever were or ever will be born are not as youll find when you come to try them like one of these plain good ellens and elmours the address simple as it was came so home to almerias experience and so many recollections rushed at once upon her memory that all her factitious character of a fine lady gave way to natural feeling and suddenly she burst into tears good heavens my dear miss turnbull cried mrs ingoldsby what is the matter are not you well salts salts the heat of the room poor thing she has such weak nerves mr elmour may i trouble you to ring the bell for our carriage miss turnbull has such sensibility this meeting so unexpected with so many old friends has quite overcome her miss turnbull recalled to herself by mrs ingoldsbys voice repeated the request to have her carriage immediately and departed with mrs ingoldsby as soon as she possibly could utterly abashed and mortified mortified most at not having been able to conceal her mortification incapable absolutely of articulating she left mrs ingoldsby to cover her retreat as well as she could with weak nerves and sensibility even the charitable mrs wynne was now heard to acknowledge that she could neither approve of miss turnbulls conduct nor frame any apology for it she confessed that it looked very like what she of all things detested most ingratitude her nephew who had been a cool observant spectator of this evenings performance was glad that his aunts mind was now decided by almerias conduct he exclaimed that he would not marry such a woman if her portion were to be the mines of peru thus miss turnbull lost all chance of the esteem and affection of another man of sense and temper who might even at this late period of her life have recalled her from the follies of dissipation and rendered her permanently happy and now that our heroine must have lost all power of interesting the reader now that the pity even of the most indulgent must be utterly sunk in contempt we shall take our leave of her resigning her to that misery which she had been long preparing for herself it is sufficient to say that after this period she had some offers from men of fashion of ruined fortunes but these she rejected still fancying that with her wealth she could not fail to make a splendid match so she went on coquetting and coquetting rejecting and rejecting till at length she arrived at an age when she could reject no longer she ceased to be an object to matrimonial adventurers but to these succeeded a swarm of female legacy hunters among the most distinguished was her companion mrs ingoldsby whose character she soon discovered to be artful and selfish in the extreme this ladys flattery therefore lost all its power to charm but yet it became necessary to almeria and even when she knew that she was duped she could not part with mrs ingoldsby because it was not in her power to supply the place of a flatterer with a friend a friend that first blessing of life cannot be bought it must be deserved miss or as she must now be called mrs almeria turnbull is still alive probably at this moment haunting some place of public amusement or stationary at the card table wherever she may be she is despised and discontented one example more amongst thousands that wealth cannot purchase or fashion bestow real happiness see how the world its veterans rewards youth of folly an old age of cards edgeworths town vivian preface to the first edition miss edgeworths general views in these stories are explained in the preface to the first volume i cannot however omit repeating that public favour has not yet rendered her so presumptuous as to offer hasty effusions to her readers but that she takes a longer time to revise what she writes than the severe ancients required for the highest species of moral fiction vivian exposes one of the most common defects of mankind to be infirm of purpose is to be at the mercy of the artful or at the disposal of accident look round and count the numbers who have within your own knowledge failed from want of firmness an excellent and wise mother gave the following advice with her dying breath my son learn early how to say no this precept gave the first idea of the story of vivian the absentee is not intended as a censure upon those whose duties and employments and superior talents lead them to the capital but to warn the thoughtless and the unoccupied from seeking distinction by frivolous imitation of fashion and ruinous waste of fortune a country gentleman or even a nobleman who does not sit in parliament may be as usefully and as honourably employed in yorkshire mid lothian or ireland as at a club house or an assembly in london irish agents are here described as of two different species that there have been bad and oppressive irish agents many great landed english proprietors have felt that there are well informed just and honourable irish agents every day experience can testify madame de fleury points out some of the means which may be employed by the rich for the real advantage of the poor this story shows that sowing gold does not always produce a golden harvest but that knowledge and virtue when early implanted in the human breast seldom fail to make ample returns of prudence and felicity emilie de coulanges exposes a fault into which the good and generous are liable to fall great sacrifices and great benefits cannot frequently be made or conferred by private individuals but every day kindness and attention to the common feelings of others is within the power and may be the practice of every age and sex and station common faults are reproved by all writers on morality but there are errors and defects that require to be treated in a lighter manner and that come with propriety within the province of essayists and of writers for the stage r l edgeworth may chapter i to see the best and yet the worse pursue is it possible exclaimed vivian that you russell my friend my best friend can tell me that this line is the motto of my character to see the best and yet the worse pursue then you must think me either a villain or a madman no replied russell calmly i think you only weak weak but you must think me an absolute fool no not a fool the weakness of which i accuse you is not a weakness of the understanding i find no fault either with the logical or the mathematical part of your understanding it is not erroneous in either of the two great points in which bacon says that most mens minds be deficient in the power of judging of consequences or in the power of estimating the comparative value of objects well cried vivian impatiently but i dont want to hear just now what bacon says but what you think tell me all the faults of my character all unconscionable after the fatigue of this long days journey said russell laughing these two friends were at this time travelling from oxford to vivian hall in shire the superb seat of the vivian family to which vivian was heir mr russell though he was but a few years older than vivian had been his tutor at college and by an uncommon transition had from his tutor become his intimate friend after a pause vivian resumed now i think of it russell you are to blame if i have any faults dont you say that every thing is to be done by education and are not you though by much too young and infinitely too handsome for a philosopher are not you my guide philosopher and friend but i have had the honour to be your guide philosopher and friend only for these three years said russell i believe in the rational but not in the magical power of education how could i do or undo in three years the work of the preceding seventeen then if you wont let me blame you i must blame my mother your mother i had always understood that she had paid particular attention to your early education and all the world says that lady mary vivian though a woman of fashion is remarkably well informed and domestic and judging from those of her letters which you have shown me i should think that for once what all the world says is right what all the world says is right and yet i am not wrong my mother is a very clever woman and most affectionate and she certainly paid particular attention to my early education but her attention was too particular her care was too great you know i was an only son then i lost my father when i was an infant and a woman let her be ever so sensible cannot well educate an only son without some manly assistance the fonder she is of the son the worse even if her fondness is not foolish fondness it makes her over anxious it makes her do too much my mother took too much a great deal too much care of me she over educated over instructed over dosed me with premature lessons of prudence she was so afraid that i should ever do a foolish thing or not say a wise one that she prompted my every word and guided my every action so i grew up seeing with her eyes hearing with her ears and judging with her understanding till at length it was found out that i had not eyes ears or understanding of my own when i was between twelve and thirteen my mother began to think that i was not sufficiently manly for my age and that there was something too yielding and undecided in my character seized with a panic my mother to make a man of me at once sent me to school there i was with all convenient expedition made ashamed of every thing good i had learned at home and there i learned every thing bad and nothing good that could be learned at school i was inferior in latin and greek and this was a deficiency i could not make up without more labour than i had courage to undertake i was superior in general literature but this was of little value amongst my competitors and therefore i despised it and overpowered by numbers and by ridicule i was of course led into all sorts of folly by mere mauvaise honte had i been in the habit of exercising my own judgment or had my resolution been strengthened by degrees had i in short been prepared for a school i might perhaps have acquired by a public education a manly independent spirit if i had even been wholly bred up in a public school i might have been forced as others were by early and fair competition to exercise my own powers and by my own experience in that microcosm as it has been called i might have formed some rules of conduct some manliness of character and might have made at least a good schoolboy half home bred and half school bred from want of proper preparation one half of my education totally destroyed the other from school of course i went to college and at college of course i should have become one of the worst species of college lads and should have had no chance in my whole future life of being any thing but a dissipated fool of fashion one of the four in hand club or the barouche club or the tandem club or the defiance club had not i by the greatest good fortune met with such a friend as you and by still greater good fortune found you out for myself for if my mother had recommended you to me i should have considered you only as a college tutor i should never have discovered half your real merit i doubt whether i should have even seen that you are young and handsome so prejudiced should i have been with the preconceived notion of a college tutor that i am not certain whether i should have found out that you are a gentleman as well born and well bred as myself but be that as it may i am positive that i never should have made you my companion and friend i should never have thrown open my whole soul to you as i have done nor could you ever have obtained such wondrous power as you possess over my mind if you had been recommended to me by my mother i am sorry said russell smiling that after so many wise reflections and so many fine compliments you end by proving to me that my wondrous power is founded on your wondrous weakness i am mortified to find that your esteem and friendship for me depended so much upon my not having had the honour of your mothers recommendation and have not i reason to fear that now when i have a chance of becoming acquainted with lady mary vivian and perhaps a chance of her thinking me a fit companion and friend for her son i must lose his regard and confidence because i shall labour under the insuperable objection of an affectionate mothers approbation no no said vivian my wilful folly does not go quite so far as that so that i maintain the privilege of choosing my friends for myself i shall always be pleased and proud to find my mother approve my choice after a few moments pause vivian added you misunderstand quite misunderstand me if you think that i am not fond of my mother i respect and love her with all my soul i should be a most ungrateful wretch if i did not i did very wrong to speak as i did just now of any little errors she may have made in my education but believe me i would not have said so much to any one living but yourself nor to you but in strict confidence and after all i dont know whether i ought not to lay the blame of my faults on my masters more than on my poor mother lay the blame where we will said russell remember that the punishment will rest on ourselves we may with as much philosophic justice as possible throw the blame of our faults on our parents and preceptors and on the early mismanagement of our minds yet after we have made out our case in the abstract to the perfect satisfaction of a jury of metaphysicians when we come to overt actions all our judges learned and unlearned are so awed by the ancient precedents and practice of society and by the obsolete law of common sense that they finish by pronouncing against us the barbarous sentence that every man must suffer for his own faults i hope i shall be able to bear it my lord as the english sailor said when the judge but look out there let down that glass on your side of the carriage cried vivian starting forward theres vivian hall that fine old castle said russell looking out of the window no but farther off to the left dont you see amongst the trees that house with wings ha quite a new modern house i had always fancied that vivian hall was an old pile of building so it was till my father threw down the old hall and built this new house and a very handsome one it is is it as good within as without quite i think but ill leave you to judge for yourself are not those fine old trees in the park from this time till the travellers arrived at vivian hall their conversation turned upon trees and avenues and serpentine approaches and alterations that vivian intended to make when he should be of age and master of this fine place and he now wanted but a twelvemonth of being at legal years of discretion when they arrived at the hall lady mary vivian showed much affectionate joy at the sight of her son and received mr russell with such easy politeness that he was prepossessed at first in her favour to this charm of well bred manners was united the appearance of sincerity and warmth of feeling in her conversation there was a mixture of excellent sense and general literature with the frivolities of the fashionable world and the anecdotes of the day in certain high circles of which she seemed to talk more from habit than taste and to annex importance more from the compulsion of external circumstances than from choice but her son her son was the great object of all her thoughts serious or frivolous she was delighted by the improvements she saw in his understanding and character by the taste and talents he displayed both for fine literature and for solid information this flattered her hope that he would both shine as a polished gentleman and make a figure in public life to his friend russell she attributed these happy improvements and though he was not a tutor of her own original selection yet her pride on this occasion yielded to gratitude and she graciously declared that she could not feel jealous of the pre eminent power he had obtained over her son when she saw the admirable use he made of this influence vivian like all candid and generous persons being peculiarly touched by candour and generosity in others felt his affection for his mother rapidly increased by this conduct nor did his enthusiasm for his friend in the least abate in consequence of the high approbation with which she honoured him nor even in consequence of her ladyships frequent and rather injudicious expressions of her hopes that her son would always preserve and show himself worthy of such a friend he joined in his mothers entreaties to russell to prolong his visit and as her ladyship declared she thought it of essential consequence to her sons interest and future happiness that he should at this turn of his life have such a companion russell consented to remain with him some time longer all parties were thus pleased with each other and remained united by one common interest about the same objects during several weeks of a delightful summer but alas this family harmony and this accord of reason and will between the mother and son were not of longer duration as usual there were faults on both sides lady mary vivian whose hopes of her sons distinguishing himself by his abilities had been much exalted since his last return from oxford had indulged herself in pleasing anticipations of the time when he should make his appearance in the fashionable and in the political world she foresaw the respect that would be paid to her on his account both by senators and by matrons by ministers who might want to gain a rising orators vote and by mothers who might wish to make an excellent match for their daughters not only by all mothers who had daughters to marry but by all daughters who had hearts or hands to dispose of lady mary felt secure of having her society courted now she had rather extravagant expectations for her son she expected him to marry so as to secure domestic happiness and at the same time to have fashion and beauty and rank and high connexions and every amiable quality in a wife this vision of a future daughter in law continually occupied her ladyships imagination already with maternal alnascharism she had in her reveries thrown back her head with disdain as she repulsed the family advances of some wealthy but low born heiress or as she rejected the alliance of some of the new nobility already she had arranged the very words of her answers to these and determined the degrees and shades of her intimacies with those already had she settled to whom to nod whom take into her coach whom honour with her hand when one morning as she sat at work absorbed in one of these reveries she was so far rapt into future times that without perceiving that any body was present she began to speak her thoughts and said aloud to herself as if my son could possibly think of her her son who was opposite to her lying on a sofa reading or seeming to read started up and putting down his book exclaimed in a voice which showed at once that he was conscious of thinking of some particular person and determined to persist in the thought as if your son could possibly think of her of whom maam whats the matter child are you mad not in the least maam but you said what cried lady mary looking round what did i say that has occasioned so much disturbance i was not conscious of saying any thing my dear selina continued her ladyship appealing to a young lady who sat very intent upon some drawing beside her my dear selina you must have heard what did i say the young lady looked embarrassed and the colour which spread over her face brought a sudden suspicion into lady marys mind her eye darted back upon her son the suspicion the fear was confirmed and she grew instantly pale silent and breathless in the attitude in which she was struck with this panic the young ladys blush and embarrassment had a very different effect on vivian joy suddenly sparkled in his eyes and illumined his whole countenance for this was the first instant he had ever felt any hope of having obtained an interest in her heart he was too much transported at this moment to think either of prudence or of his mother and when he recollected himself he was too little practised in dissimulation to repair his indiscretion something he did attempt to say and blundered and laughed at his blunder and when his mother looked up at him in serious silence he only begged pardon for his folly confessed he believed he was mad and turning away abruptly left the room exclaiming that he wondered where russell had been all the morning and that he must go and look for him a long silence ensued between vivians mother and the young lady who were left alone together lady mary first broke the silence and in a constrained tone asked as she took up the newspaper whether miss sidney had found any news i dont know maam answered miss sidney in a voice scarcely articulate i should have imagined there must be some news from the continent but you did not find any i think you say miss sidney continued lady mary with haughty averted eyes after turning over the pages of the paper without knowing one word it contained she laid it down and rose to leave the room miss sidney rose at the same time lady mary one instant my dear lady mary lady mary turned and saw selinas supplicating eyes full of tears but her ladyship still retaining her severity of manner coldly said does miss sidney desire that i should stay does miss sidney wish to speak to me i do as soon as i can said selina in a faltering voice but raising her eyes and perceiving the contemptuous expression of lady marys countenance her own instantly changed with the firm tone of conscious innocence she repeated i do wish to speak to your ladyship if you will hear me with your usual candour i do not expect or solicit your usual indulgence miss sidney replied lady mary before you say more it becomes me to point out to you that the moment is past for confidence between us two and that in no moment could i wish to hear from any person much less from one whom i had considered as my friend confessions extorted by circumstances degrading and unavailing your ladyship need not be apprehensive of hearing from me any degrading confessions said miss sidney i have none to make and since without any just cause without any cause for suspicion but what a blush perhaps or a moments embarrassment of manner may have created you think it becomes you to point out to me that the moment for confidence between us is past i can only lament my mistake in having believed that it ever existed lady marys countenance and manner totally changed the pride of rank yielded before the pride of virtue and perhaps the hope that she had really no cause for suspicion at once restored her affection for her young friend let us understand one another my dear selina said she if i said a hasty or a harsh word forgive it you know my affection for you and my real confidence in actions not in words i have shown it in thought as well as in actions my confidence in you has been entire for upon my word and you know this is not an asseveration i lightly use upon my word till that unfortunate moment a suspicion of you never crossed my imagination the proof if there could need any proof to you of what i assert the proof is the delight i take in your society the urgent manner in which i have so frequently this summer begged your company from your mother you know this would have not only been the height of insincerity but of folly and madness if i had not felt a reliance upon you that made me consider it as an absolute impossibility that you could ever disappoint my friendship i thank your ladyship said selina softened by the kind tone in which lady mary now spoke yet still retaining some reserve of manner i thank your ladyship for all your kindness it has flattered me much touched me deeply commanded my gratitude and influenced my conduct uniformly i can and do entirely forgive the injustice of a moment and i now bid you adieu my dear lady mary with the conviction that if we were never to meet again i should always hold that place in your esteem and affection with which you have honoured me and which if it be not too proud an expression i hope i have deserved wont you bid me farewell the tears gushed from lady marys eyes my dear charming and prudent selina i understand you perfectly and i thank you it grieves me to part with you but i believe you are right i believe there is no other safety no other remedy how indeed could i expect that my son could see and hear you live in the house with you and become intimately acquainted with such a character as yours without danger i have been very imprudent unaccountably imprudent to expose him to such a temptation but i hope i trust that your prudence will repair in time the effects of my rashness and again and again i thank you my dear young friend but perhaps it might be still better that you should not leave us abruptly still better than your absence i think would be the conviction you might impress on his mind of the impossibility of his hopes if you were to stay a day or two and convince him by your indifference that excuse me that is what i cannot undertake said selina blushing and conscious of blushing lady mary was too polite and too delicate to seem to observe her confusion but embracing her said if we must part then take with you my highest esteem affection and gratitude and this much let me add that my most sanguine expectations for my sons happiness would be realized if amongst the women to whom family interests must restrict his choice he could meet with one of half your merit and half your attractions amongst the women to whom family interests must restrict his choice repeated selina to herself many times as she journeyed homewards and she pondered much upon the meaning of this phrase vivian was sole heir to a very large property without encumbrances of any kind what therefore was the necessity that restricted his choice the imaginary necessity of ambition which confined him to a certain circle of fashionable or highly connected people selina sidney though she was not rich was of a very good gentlemans family her father had been a colonel in the british army during his life mrs sidney had been in the habit of living a great deal in what is called the world and in the best company and though since his death she had lived in retirement miss sidney had received an education which put her upon a footing with young ladies of the highest accomplishments and refinement in the kingdom with every solid and amiable quality she had all those external advantages of appearance and manner which lady mary vivian valued most highly selina who was convinced that lady mary appreciated her character and was peculiarly fond of her company and conversation could not but feel surprise mixed with some indignation perhaps with a little resentment when she perceived that her ladyships prejudices and ambition made her act so completely in contradiction to her better judgment to her professions and to her feelings of affection whatever miss sidney thought upon this subject however she determined to continue to avoid seeing vivian any more an excellent resolution in which we leave her and return to her lover a walk with russell had brought him back in the full determination of avowing his attachment sincerely to his mother and of speaking to her ladyship in the most respectful manner but when he found that miss sidney was gone anger and disappointment made him at once forget his prudence and his intended respect he declared in the most passionate terms his love for selina sidney and his irrevocable determination to pursue her to the end of time and space in spite of all opposition whatsoever from any person whatever his mother who was prepared for a scene of this sort though not for one of this violence had sufficient command of temper to sustain it properly her command of temper was indeed a little assisted by the hope that this passion would be transitory in proportion to its vehemence much by the confidence she had in miss sidneys honour and in her absence lady mary therefore calmly disclaimed having had any part in persuading miss sidney to that measure which had so much enraged her lover but her ladyship avowed that though it had not been necessary for her to suggest the measure she highly approved of it and admired now as she had ever admired that young ladys prudent and noble conduct softened by the only thing that could at this moment soften him praise of his mistress vivian in a most affectionate manner assured his mother that it was her warm eulogiums of miss sidney which had first turned his attention to the perfections of her character and he now inquired what possible objections she could make to his choice with the generous enthusiasm of his disposition heightened by all the eloquence of love he pleaded that his fortune was surely sufficient to put him above mercenary considerations in the choice of a wife that in every point except this one of money selina sidney was in his own mothers opinion superior to every other woman she could name or wish for as a daughter in law but my tastes are not to blind me to your interests said lady mary you are entitled to look for rank and high connexion you are the representative of an ancient family have talents to make a figure in public and in short prejudice or not i confess it is one of the first wishes of my heart that you should marry into a noble family or at least into one that shall strengthen your political interest as well as secure your domestic happiness vivian of course cursed ambition as all men do whilst they are in love his arguments and his eloquence in favour of a private station and of the joys of learned leisure a competence and domestic bliss were worthy of the most renowned of ancient or modern philosophers russell was appealed to with much eagerness both by mother and son during their debates he frankly declared to lady mary that he thought her son perfectly right in all he now urged and especially in his opinion of miss sidney but at the same time added russell i apprehend that he speaks at this moment more from passion than from reason and i fear that in the course of a few months he might perhaps entirely change his mind therefore i think your ladyship is prudent in refusing during the minority of your son your consent to a hasty union of which he might afterwards repent and thus render both himself and a most amiable woman miserable russell after having given his opinion with the utmost freedom when it was required by lady mary assured her that he should no farther interfere and he trusted his present sincerity would be the best pledge to her of his future discretion and honour this equitable judgment and sincerity of russells at first displeased both parties but in time operated upon the reason of both not however before contests had gone on long and loud between the mother and son not before a great deal of nonsense had been talked on both sides people of the best abilities often talk the most nonsense where their passions are concerned because then the whole of their ingenuity is exercised to find arguments in favour of their folly they are not like fools content to say this is my will but they pique themselves on giving reasons for their will and their reasons are the reasons of madmen excellent upon false premises it happened here as in most family quarrels that the disputants did not allow sufficiently for the prejudices and errors incident to their different ages the mother would not allow for the romantic notions of the son nor could the son endure the worldly views of the mother the son who had as yet no experience of the transitory nature of the passion of love thought his mother unfeeling and barbarous for opposing him on the point where the whole happiness of his life was concerned the mother who had seen the decline and fall of so many everlasting loves considered him only as a person in a fever and thought she prevented him by her calmness from doing that which he would repent when he should regain his sober senses without detailing the daily disputes which now arose it will be sufficient to mark the result vivians love had been silent tranquil and not seemingly of any great consequence till it was opposed but from the instant that an obstacle intervened it gathered strength and force and it presently rose rapidly with prodigious uproar threatening to burst all bounds and to destroy every thing that stopped its course lady mary was now inclined to try what effect lessening the opposition might produce to do her justice she was also moved to this by some nobler motives than fear or at least her fears were not of a selfish kind she dreaded that her sons health and permanent happiness might be injured by this violent passion she was apprehensive of becoming an object of his aversion of utterly losing his confidence and all power over his mind but chiefly her generous temper was moved and won by selina sidneys admirable conduct during the whole time that vivian used every means to see her to write to her and to convince her of the fervour of his love though he won all her friends over to his interests though she heard his praises from morning till night from all who surrounded her and though her own heart perhaps pleaded more powerfully than all the rest in his favour yet she never for one instant gave him the slightest encouragement lady marys esteem and affection were so much increased by these strong proofs of friendship and honour that her prejudices yielded and she at length declared that if her son continued till he was of age to feel the same attachment for this amiable girl she would give her consent to their union but this she added she promised only on one condition that her son should abstain from all attempts in the interval to see or correspond with miss sidney and that he should set out immediately to travel with mr russell transported with love and joy and victory vivian promised every thing that was required of him embraced his mother and set out upon his travels allow said he triumphantly to russell as the chaise drove from the door allow my good friend that you were mistaken in your fears of the weakness of my character and of the yielding facility of my temper you see how firm i have been you see what battle i have made you see how i have stood out i never doubted said russell your love of your own free will i never doubted your fear of being governed especially by your mother but you do not expect that i should allow this to be a proof of strength of character what do you suppose i act from love of my own free will merely do you call my love for selina sidney weakness oh take care russell for if once i find you pleading my mothers cause against your conscience you will never find me pleading any cause against my conscience i have told your mother as i have told you my opinion of miss sidney my firm opinion that she is peculiarly calculated to make the happiness of your life provided you continue to love her provided oh cried vivian laughing spare your musty provisoes my dear philosopher would not any one think now you were an old man of ninety if this is all you have to fear i am happy indeed at present said russell calmly i have no fear as i have just told your mother but that you should change your mind before you are of age vivian grew quite indignant at this suggestion you are angry with me said russell and so was your mother she was angry because i said i feared instead of i hoped you would change your mind both parties are angry with me for my sincerity sincerity no but i am angry with you for your absurd suspicions of my constancy if they are absurd you need not be angry said russell i shall be well pleased to see their absurdity demonstrated then i can demonstrate it this moment pardon me not this moment you must take time into the account i make no doubt but that at this moment you are heartily in love with miss sidney but the thing to be proved is that your passion will not decline in force in proportion as it meets with less resistance if it does you will acknowledge that it was more a love of your own free will than a love of your mistress that has actuated you which was the thing to be proved hateful qed cried vivian you shall see the contrary and at least i will triumph over you if russell had ever used art in his management of vivians mind he might have been suspected of using it in favour of miss sidney at this instant for this prophecy of vivians inconstancy was the most likely means to prevent its accomplishment frequently in the course of their tour when vivian was in any situation where his constancy was tempted he recollected russells prediction and was proud to remind him how much he had been mistaken in short the destined time for their return home arrived vivian presented himself before his mother and claimed her promise she was somewhat surprised and a little disappointed by our heros constancy but she could not retract her word and since her compliance was now unavoidable she was determined that it should be gracious she wrote to selina therefore with great kindness saying that whatever views of other connexions she might formerly have had for her son she had now relinquished them convinced by the constancy of her sons attachment and by the merit of its object that his own choice would most effectually ensure his happiness and that of all his friends her ladyship added expressions of her regard and esteem and of the pleasure she felt in the thoughts of finding in her daughter in law a friend and companion whose society was peculiarly agreeable to her taste and suited to her character this letter entirely dissipated selinas scruples of conscience vivians love and merit all his good and all his agreeable qualities had now full and unreproved power to work upon her tender heart his generous open temper his candour his warm attachment to his friends his cultivated understanding his brilliant talents his easy well bred agreeable manners all heightened in their power to please by the charm of love justified even in the eyes of the aged and prudent the passion he inspired selina became extremely attached to him and she loved with the delightful belief that there was not in the mind of her lover the seed of a single vice which threatened danger to his virtues or to their mutual happiness with his usual candour he had laid open his whole character to her as far as he knew it himself and had warned her of that vacillation of temper that easiness to be led which russell had pointed out as a dangerous fault in his disposition but of this propensity selina had seen no symptoms on the contrary the steadiness of her lover in his attachment to her the only point on which she had yet seen him tried decided her to trust to the persuasive voice of love and hope and to believe that russells friendship had in this instance been too harsh or too timorous in its forebodings nothing now delayed the marriage of vivian and selina but certain legal rites which were to be performed on his coming of age and before marriage settlements could be drawn and the parties were doomed to wait for the arrival of some trustee who was with his regiment abroad all these delays vivian of course cursed but upon the whole they were borne by him with heroic patience and by selina with all the tranquillity of confiding love happy in the present and not too anxious for the future chapter ii my dear russell said vivian love shall not make me forget friendship before i marry i must see you provided for believe me this was the first one of the first pleasures i promised myself in becoming master of a good fortune other thoughts i confess have put it out of my head so now let me tell you at once i hate paltry surprises with my friends i have you know or rather probably you do not know for you are the most disinterested fellow upon earth i have an excellent living in my gift it shall be yours consider it as such from this moment if i knew a more deserving man i would give it to him upon my honour so you cant refuse me the incumbent cant live long he is an old very old infirm man youll have the living in a year or two and in the mean time stay with me i ask it as a favour from a friend and you see how much i want a friend of your firm character and i hope you see also how much i can value in others the qualities in which i am myself deficient russell was much pleased and touched by vivians generous gratitude and by the delicacy as well as kindness of the manner in which he made this offer but russell could not consistently with his feelings or his principles live in a state of dependent idleness waiting for a rich living and the death of an old incumbent he told vivian that he had too much affection for him and too much respect for himself ever to run the hazard of sinking from the rank of an independent friend after rallying him without effect on his pride vivian acknowledged that he was forced to admire him the more for his spirit lady mary too who was a great and sincere admirer of independence of character warmly applauded mr russell and recommended him in the highest terms to a nobleman in the neighbourhood who happened to be in want of a preceptor for his only son this nobleman was lord glistonbury his lordship was eager to engage a person of russells reputation for talents so the affair was quickly arranged and lady mary vivian and her son went to pay a morning visit at glistonbury castle on purpose to accompany russell on his first introduction to the family as they approached the castle vivian was struck with its venerable gothic appearance he had not had a near view of it for some years and he looked at it with new eyes formerly he had seen it only as a picturesque ornament to the country but now that he was himself possessor of an estate in the vicinity he considered glistonbury castle as a point of comparison which rendered him dissatisfied with his own mansion as he drove up the avenue and beheld the towers turrets battlements and massive entrance his mother who was a woman of taste strengthened by her exclamations on the beauty of gothic architecture the wish that was rising in his mind to convert his modern house into an ancient castle she could not help sighing whilst she reflected that if her sons affections had not been engaged he might perhaps have obtained the heart and hand of one of the fair daughters of this castle lady mary went no farther even in her inmost thoughts incapable of double dealing she resolved never even to let her son know what her wishes had been with respect to a connexion with the glistonbury family but the very reserve and discretion with which her ladyship spoke a reserve unusual with her and unsuited to the natural warmth of her manner and temper might have betrayed her to an acute and cool observer vivian however at this instant was too much intent upon castle building to admit any other ideas when the carriage drove under the great gateway and stopped vivian exclaimed what a fine old castle how surprised selina sidney would be how delighted to see my house metamorphosed into such a castle it is a magnificent castle indeed said lady mary with a sigh i think there are the lady lidhursts on the terrace and here comes my lord glistonbury with his son my pupil said russell i hope the youth is such as i can become attached to life would be wretched indeed without attachment of some sort or other but i must not expect added he to find a second time a friend in a pupil and such a friend sentiment or the expression of the tenderness he felt for his friends was so unusual from russell that it had double effect and vivian was so much struck by it that he could scarcely collect his thoughts in time to speak to lord glistonbury who came to receive his guests attended by three hangers on of the family a chaplain a captain and a young lawyer his lordship was scarcely past the meridian of life yet in spite of his gay and debonair manner he looked old as if he were paying for the libertinism of his youth by premature decrepitude his countenance announced pretensions to ability his easy and affable address and the facility with which he expressed himself gained him credit at first for much more understanding than he really possessed there was a plausibility in all he said but if it were examined there was nothing in it but nonsense some of his expressions appeared brilliant some of his sentiments just but there was a want of consistency a want of a pervading mind in his conversation which to good judges betrayed the truth that all his opinions were adopted not formed all his maxims commonplace his wit mere repetition his sense merely tact after proper thanks and compliments to lady mary and mr vivian for securing for him such a treasure as mr russell he introduced lord lidhurst a sickly bashful boy of fourteen to his new governor with polite expressions of unbounded confidence and a rapid enunciation of undefined and contradictory expectations mr russell will i am perfectly persuaded make lidhurst every thing we can desire said his lordship an honour to his country an ornament to his family it is my decided opinion that man is but a bundle of habits and its my maxim that education is second nature first indeed in many cases for except that i am staggered about original genius i own i conceive with hartley that early impressions and associations are all in all his vibrations and vibratiuncles are quite satisfactory but what i particularly wish for lidhurst sir is that he should be trained as soon as possible into a statesman mr vivian i presume you mean to follow up public business and no doubt will make a figure so i prophesy and i am used to these things and from lidhurst too under similar tuition i may with reason expect miracles hope to hear him thundering in the house of commons in a few years confess am not quite so impatient to have the young dog in the house of incurables for you know he could not be there without being in my shoes which i have not done with yet ha ha ha each in his turn my boy in the mean time lady mary shall we join the ladies yonder on the terrace lady glistonbury walks so slow that she will be seven hours in coming to us so we had best go to her ladyship if the mountain wont go to mahomet you know of course what follows on their way to the terrace lord glistonbury who always heard himself speak with singular complacency continued to give his ideas on education sometimes appealing to mr russell sometimes happy to catch the eye of lady mary now my idea for lidhurst is simply this that he should know every thing that is in all the best books in the library but yet that he should be the farthest possible from a book worm that he should never except in a set speech in the house have the air of having opened a book in his life mother wit for me in most cases and that easy style of originality which shows the true gentleman as to morals lidhurst walk on my boy as to morals i confess i couldnt bear to see any thing of the joseph surface about him a youth of spirit must you know mr vivian excuse me lady mary this is an aside be something of a latitudinarian to keep in the fashion not that i mean to say so exactly to lidhurst no no on the contrary mr russell it is our cue as well as this reverend gentlemans looking back at the chaplain who bowed assent before he knew to what it is our cue as well as this reverend gentlemans to preach prudence and temperance and all the cardinal virtues cardinal virtues very good faith my lord said the lawyer looking at the clergyman temperance repeated the chaplain winking at the officer upon my soul my lord thats too bad prudence repeated the captain thats too clean a cut at poor wicksted my lord before his lordship had time to preach any more prudence they arrived within bowing distance of the ladies who had indeed advanced at a very slow rate vivian was not acquainted with any of the ladies of the glistonbury family for they had till this summer resided at another of their country seats in a distant county his mother had often met them at parties in town lady glistonbury was a thin stiffened flattened figure she was accompanied by two other female forms one old the other young not each a different grace but alike all three in angularity and in a cold haughtiness of mien after reconnoitring with their glasses the party of gentlemen these ladies quickened their step and lady glistonbury making her countenance as affable as it was in its nature to be exclaimed my dear lady mary vivian have i the pleasure to see your ladyship they told me it was only visitors to my lord mr vivian had then the honour of being introduced to her ladyship to her eldest daughter lady sarah lidhurst and to miss strictland the governess by all of these ladies he was most graciously received but poor russell was not so fortunate nothing could be more cold and repulsive than their reception of him this did not make lady sarah appear very agreeable to vivian he thought her at this first view one of the least attractive young women he had ever beheld where is my julia inquired lord glistonbury ah there she goes yonder all life and spirits vivian looked as his lordship directed his eye and saw at the farthest end of the terrace a young girl of about fifteen running very fast with a hoop which she was keeping up with great dexterity for the amusement of a little boy who was with her the governess no sooner saw this than she went in pursuit of her young ladyship calling after her in various tones and phrases of reprehension in french italian and english and asking whether this was a becoming employment for a young lady of her age and rank heedless of these reproaches lady julia still ran on away from her governess to chase the rolling circles speed down the slope of the terrace thither miss strictland dared not pursue but contented herself with standing on the brink reiterating her remonstrances at length the hoop fell and the young lady returned not to her governess but running lightly up the slope of the terrace to her surprise she came full in view of the company before she was aware that any strangers were there her straw hat being at the back of her head lady glistonbury with an indignant look pulled it forwards what a beautiful colour what a sweet countenance lady julia has whispered lady mary vivian to lord glistonbury at the same time she could not refrain from glancing her eyes towards her son to see what effect was produced upon him vivians eyes met hers and this single look of his mothers revealed to him all that she had in her great prudence resolved to conceal he smiled at her and then at russell as much as to say surely there can be no comparison between such a child as this and selina sidney a few minutes afterwards in consequence of a sign from lady glistonbury julia disappeared with her governess and the moment was unnoticed by vivian who was then as his mother observed looking up at one of the turrets of the old castle all its inhabitants were at this time uninteresting to him except so far as they regarded his friend russell but the castle itself absorbed his attention lord glistonbury charmed to see how he was struck by it offered to show him over every part of the edifice an offer which he and lady mary gladly accepted lady glistonbury excused herself professing to be unable to sustain the fatigue she deputed her eldest daughter to attend lady mary in her stead and this was the only circumstance which diminished the pleasure to vivian for he was obliged to show due courtesy to this stiff taciturn damsel at every turn whilst he was intent upon seeing the architecture of the castle and the views from the windows of the towers and loop holes of the galleries all which lady sarah pointed out with a cold ceremonious civility and a formal exactness of proceeding which enraged vivians enthusiastic temper the visit ended he railed half the time he was going home against their fair or as he called her their petrified guide then full of the gothic beauties of glistonbury he determined as soon as possible to turn his own modern house into a castle the very next morning he had an architect to view it and to examine its capabilities it happened that about this time several of the noblemen and gentry in the county in which vivian resided had been seized with this rage for turning comfortable houses into uninhabitable castles and however perverse or impracticable this retrograde movement in architecture might seem there were always at hand professional projectors to convince gentlemen that nothing was so feasible provided always that gentlemen approve their estimates as well as their plans they undertake to carry buildings back in a trice two or three or half a dozen centuries as may be required to make them gothic or saracenic and to add every grace that time alone can give a few days after vivian had been at glistonbury castle when lord glistonbury came to return the visit russell who accompanied his lordship found his friend encompassed with plans and elevations surely my dear vivian said he seizing the first moment he could speak to him you are not going to spoil this excellent house it is completely finished in handsome modern architecture perfectly comfortable and convenient light airy large enough warm rooms well distributed with ample means of getting at each apartment and if you set about to new model and transform it into a castle you must i see by your plan alter the proportions of almost every room and spoil the comfort of the whole turn square to round and round again to square and worse than all turn light to darkness only for the sake of having what is called a castle but what has not in fact any thing of the grandeur or solid magnificence of a real ancient edifice these modern baby house miniatures of castles which gentlemen ruin themselves to build are after all the most paltry absurd things imaginable to this vivian was after some dispute forced to agree but he said that his should not be a baby house that he would go to any expense to make it really magnificent as magnificent i suppose as glistonbury castle if possible that is i confess the object of my emulation ah said russell shaking his head these are the objects of emulation for which country gentlemen often ruin themselves barter their independence and real respectability reduce themselves to distress and disgrace these are the objects for which they sell either their estates or their country become placemen or beggars and end either in the liberties of the kings bench or the slaveries of st jamess impossible for me you know my public principles said vivian and you know that i think the life of an independent country gentleman the most respectable of all others you know my principles i know your facility said russell if you begin by sacrificing thus to your taste do you think you will not end by sacrificing to your interest never never cried vivian then you imagine that a strong temptation will not act where a weak one has been found irresistible of this i am certain said vivian i could never be brought to sell my country or to forfeit my honour perhaps not said russell you might in your utmost need have another alternative you might forfeit your love you might give up selina sidney and marry for money all for the sake of a castle struck by this speech vivian exclaimed i would give up a thousand castles rather than run such a hazard let us then coolly calculate said russell what would the castle cost you the expense even by the estimates of the architects which in the execution are usually doubled was enormous such as vivian acknowledged was unsuited even to his ample fortune his fortune though considerable was so entailed that he would if he exceeded his income be soon reduced to difficulties for ready money but then his mother had several thousands in the stocks which she was ready to lend him to forward this castle building it was a project which pleased her taste and gratified her aristocratic notions vivian assured his friend at parting that his reason was convinced that he would not yield to the whims of taste and that he would prudently give up his folly so he determined and he abided by his determination till he heard numbers speak on the other side of the question with vivian those who spoke last frequently seemed to speak best and in general the number of voices overpowered the weight of argument by the persuasions of his mother the example of his neighbours and the urgency of architects and men of taste who got about him soon afterwards he was convinced that there was no living without a castle and that the expense would be next to nothing at all convinced we should not say for he yielded against his conviction from mere want of power to resist reiterated solicitations he had no other motive for the enthusiasm raised by the view of glistonbury castle had passed away he plainly saw what russell had pointed out to him that he should spoil the inside of his house for the sake of the outside and for his own part he preferred comfort to show it was not therefore to please his own taste that he ran into this imprudent expense but merely to gratify the taste of others now the bustle of building began and workmen swarmed round his house the foundations sank the scaffolds rose and many times did vivian sigh and repent when he saw how much was to be undone before any thing could be done when he found his house dismantled saw the good ceilings and elegant cornices knocked to pieces saw the light domes and modern sashes give way all taken out to be replaced at profuse expense by a clumsy imitation of gothic how often did be sigh and calculate when he saw the tribes of workmen file off as their dinner bell rang how often did he bless himself when he beheld the huge beams of timber dragged into his yards and the solid masses of stone brought from a quarry at an enormous distance vivian perceived that the expense would be treble the estimate and said that if the thing were to be done again he would never consent to it but now as lady mary observed it was too late to repent and it was at any rate best to go on and finish it with spirit since it was impossible nobody knew why to stop he hurried on the workmen with impatience for he was anxious to have the roof and some apartments in his castle finished before his marriage the dilatoriness of the lawyers and the want of the trustee who had not yet arrived in england were no longer complained of so grievously by the lover russell one day as he saw vivian overlooking his workmen and urging them to expedition smiled and asked whether the impatience of an architect or of a lover was now predominant in his mind vivian rather offended by the question replied that his eagerness to finish this part of his castle arose from his desire to give an agreeable surprise to his bride and he declared that his passion for selina was as ardent at this moment as it had ever been but that it was impossible to make lawyers move faster than their accustomed pace and that miss sidney was too secure of his affection and he too well convinced of hers to feel that sort of anxiety which persons who had less confidence in each other might experience in similar circumstances this was all very true and very reasonable but russell could not help perceiving that vivians language and tone were somewhat altered since the time when he was ready to brave heaven and earth to marry his mistress without license or consent of friends without the possibility of waiting a few months till he was of age in fact though vivian would not allow it this consent of friends this ceasing of opposition this security and tranquillity of happiness had considerably changed the appearance at least of his love lady mary perceived it with a resolution to say nothing and see how it would end selina did not perceive it for some time for she was of a most unsuspicious temper and her confidence in vivian was equal to the fondness of her love she began to think indeed that the lawyers were provokingly slow and when vivian did not blame them as much as he used to do she only thought that he understood business better than she did besides the necessary trustee was not come and in short the last thing that occurred to her mind was to blame vivian the trustee at length arrived and the castle was almost in the wished for state of forwardness when a new cause of delay arose a county election but how this election was brought on and how it was conducted it is necessary to record it happened that a relation of vivians was appointed to a new seventy four gun ship of which he came to take the command at yarmouth which was within a few miles of him vivian recollected that russell had often expressed a desire to go on board a man of war vivian therefore after having appointed a day for their going went to glistonbury to invite russell his pupil lord lidhurst begged to be permitted to accompany them and lady julia the moment she heard of this new seventy four gun ship was as her governess expressed it wild to be of the party indeed any thing that had the name of a party of pleasure and that promised a transient relief from the tedious monotony in which her days passed any thing that gave a chance of even a few hours release from the bondage in which she was held between the restraints of the most rigid of governesses and the proudest of mothers appeared delightful to this lively and childish girl she persecuted her governess with entreaties till at last she made miss strictland go with her petition to lady glistonbury whilst in the mean time lady julia overwhelmed her father with caresses till he consented and with much difficulty prevailed upon lady glistonbury to give her permission for the young ladies to go with their governess their brother their father and lady mary vivian on this excursion the invitation was now extended to all the company then at the castle including the representative of the county who being just threatened with a fit of the gout brought on by hard drinking at the last election expressed some reluctance to going with this party on the water but this gentleman was now paying his humble devoirs to the lady sarah lidhurst and it was represented to him by all who understood the ground that he would give mortal offence if he did not go so it was ruled that hot or cold gout or no gout he must appear in the lady sarahs train he submitted to this perilous necessity in the most gallant manner the day proved tolerably fine vivian had an elegant entertainment provided for the company under a marquee pitched on the shore they embarked in a pleasure boat lady sarah was very sick and her admirer very cold but lady julia was in extasies at every thing she saw and felt she feared nothing found nothing inconvenient was charmed to be drawn so easily from the boat up the high side of the ship charmed to find herself on deck charmed to see the sails the ropes the rigging the waves the sea the sun the clouds the sailors the cook dressing dinner all all indiscriminately charmed her and like a school girl broke loose she ran about wild with spirits asking questions some sensible some silly laughing at her own folly flying from this side to that from one end of the ship to the other down the ladders and up again whilst mr russell who was deputed to take care of her could scarcely keep up with her lord glistonbury stood by holding his sides and laughing aloud miss strictland quite disabled by the smell of the ship was lying on a bed in the state cabin and lady sarah all the time shaded by an umbrella held by her shivering admirer sat as if chained upright in her chair of state upon deck scorning her sisters childish levity and proving herself with all due propriety incapable of being moved to surprise or admiration by any object on land or sea lady mary vivian while she observed with a quick eye all that passed and read her sons thoughts was fully persuaded that neither of the lady lidhursts would be likely to suit his taste even if his affections were disengaged the one was too childish the other too stiff yet their birth and connexions and their consequence in the county thought lady mary would have made their alliance highly desirable every body seemed weary at the close of this days entertainment except lady julia who kept it up with indefatigable gaiety and could hardly believe that it was time to go home when the boat was announced to row them to shore heedless and absolutely dizzy with talking and laughing her ladyship escaping from the assistance of sailors and gentlemen made a false step in getting into the boat and falling over would have sunk for ever but for mr russells presence of mind he seized her with a strong grasp and saved her the fright sobered her completely and she sat wrapped in great coats as silent as tractable and as wet as possible during the remainder of the way to shore the screams the ejaculations the reprimands from miss strictland the questions the reflections to which this incident led may possibly be conceived but cannot be enumerated this event however alarming at the moment had no serious consequence for lady julia caught neither fever nor cold though miss strictland was morally certain her ladyship would have one or the other indeed she insinuated that her ladyship deserved to have both lady sarahs poor shivering knight of the shire however did not escape so well obliged to row home in a damp evening without his great coat which he had been forced to offer to lady julia in a pleasure boat when he should have been in flannels or in bed he had cause to rue the boating of that day his usual panacea of the gout did not come as expected to set him up again the cold he caught this day killed him lady sarah lidhurst was precisely as sorry as decorum required but the bustle of a new election was soon to obliterate the memory of the old member in the minds of his numerous friends lord glistonbury and several other voices in the county called upon vivian to stand on the independent interest there was to be a contest for a government candidate declared himself at the same moment that application was made to vivian the expense of a contested election alarmed both vivian and his mother gratified as she was by the honour of this offer yet she had the prudence to advise her son rather to go into parliament as representative for a borough than to hazard the expense of a contest for the county miss sidney also whom he consulted upon this occasion supported his mothers prudent advice in the most earnest manner and vivian was inclined to follow this counsel till lord glistonbury came one morning to plead the contrary side of the question he assured vivian that from his experience of the county he was morally certain they should carry it without trouble and with no expense worth mentioning these were only general phrases to be sure not arguments but these joined to her ambition to see her son member for the county at length overpowered lady marys better judgment her urgent entreaties were now joined to those of lord glistonbury and of many loud tongued electioneerers who proved to vivian by every thing but calculation that he must be returned if he would but stand if he would only declare himself russell and his own prudence strongly counselled him to resist these clamorous importunities the two preceding candidates whose fortunes had been nearly as good as his had been ruined by the contests vivian was very young but just of age and russell observed that it would be better for him to see something more of the world before he should embark in politics and plunge into public business true said vivian but mr pitt was only three and twenty when he was minister of england i am not ambitious but i should certainly like to distinguish myself if i could and whilst i feel in youth the glow of patriotism why should i not serve my country serve it and welcome said russell but dont begin by ruining yourself by a contested election or else whatever glow of patriotism you may feel it will be out of your power to be an honest member of parliament if you must go into parliament immediately for the good of your country go in as member for some borough which will not ruin you but the committee of our friends will be so disappointed if i decline and my mother who has now set her heart upon it and lord glistonbury and mr c and mr g and mr d who are such zealous friends and who urge me so much judge for yourself said russell and dont let any persons who happen to be near you persuade you to see with their eyes and decide with their wishes zealous friends indeed because they love to make themselves of consequence by bawling and scampering about at an election and you would let such people draw you on to ruin yourself i will show you that they shall not cried vivian seizing a sheet of paper and sitting down immediately to write the copy of a circular letter to his friends informing them with many thanks that he declined to stand for the county russell eagerly wrote copies of this letter which vivian declared should be sent early the next morning but no sooner was russell out of sight than lady mary vivian resumed her arguments in favour of commencing his canvass immediately and before his friends should cool when she saw the letters that he had been writing she was excessively indignant and by a torrent of female and maternal eloquence he was absolutely overwhelmed auxiliaries poured in to her ladyship on all sides horsemen after horsemen freeholders of all degrees now flocked to the house hearing that mr vivian had thoughts of standing for the county they were unanimously loud in their assurances of success old and new copies of poll books were produced and the different interests of the county counted and recounted balanced and counterbalanced again and again by each person after his own fashion and it was proved to mr vivian in black and white and as plain as figures could make it that he had the game in his own hands and that if he would but declare himself the other candidate would the very next day they would be bound for it decline the contest vivian had a clear head and a competent knowledge of arithmetic he saw the fallacies and inaccuracies in their modes of computation he saw upon examining the books that the state of the county interests was very different from what they pretended or believed and he was convinced that the opposite candidate would not decline but after vivian had stated these reasons ten times and his mother and his electioneering partisans had reiterated their assertions twenty times he yielded merely because they had said twice as much as he had and because poor easy man he had not power to resist continuity of solicitation he declared himself candidate for the county and was soon immersed in all the toil trouble vexation and expense of a contested election of course his marriage was now to be postponed till the election should be over love and county politics have little affinity what the evils of a contested election are can be fully known only to those by whom they have been personally experienced the contest was bitter the glistonbury interest was the strongest which supported vivian lord glistonbury and his lordships friends were warm in his cause not that they had any particular regard for vivian but he was to be their member opposed to the court candidate whom his lordship was anxious to keep out of the county lord glistonbury had once been a strong friend to government and was thought a confirmed courtier especially as he had been brought up in high aristocratic notions but he had made it his great object to turn his earldom into a marquisate and government having delayed or refused to gratify him in this point he quitted them with disgust and set up his standard amongst the opposition he was now loud and zealous on every occasion that could as he said annoy government and merely because he could not be a marquis he became a patriot mistaken abused name how glorious in its original how despicable in its debased signification lord glistonburys exertions were indefatigable vivian felt much gratitude for this apparently disinterested friendship and during a few weeks whilst this canvass was going on he formed a degree of intimacy with the glistonbury family which in any other circumstances could scarcely have been brought about during months or years an election in england seems for the time to level all distinctions not only of rank but even of pride lady glistonbury herself at this season found it necessary to relax from her usual rigidity there was an extraordinary freedom of egress and regress and the haughty code of glistonbury lay dormant vivian of course was the centre of all interest and whenever he appeared every individual of the family was eager to inquire what news what news how do things go on to day how will the election turn out have you written to mr such a one have you been to mr such a ones ill write a note for you ill copy a letter there was one common cause miss strictland even deigned to assist mr vivian and to try her awkward hand to forward his canvass for it was to support the glistonbury interest and there was no impropriety could attach to the thing russells extreme anxiety made vivian call more frequently even than it was necessary at the castle to quiet his apprehensions and to assure him that things were going on well young lord lidhurst who was really good natured and over whose mind russell began to gain some ascendancy used to stand upon the watch for vivians appearance and would run up the back stairs to russells apartment to give him notice of it and to be the first to tell the news lady sarah the icy lady sarah herself began to thaw and every day in the same phrase she condescended to say to mr vivian that she hoped the poll was going on as well as could be expected it was of course reported that vivian was to succeed the late representative of the county in all its honours in eight days he was confidently given to lady sarah by the generous public and the day of their nuptials was positively fixed as the lady was even by the account of her friends two or three years older than mr vivian and four or five years older by her looks and as she was peculiarly unsuited to his taste he heard the report without the slightest apprehension for his own constancy to selina he laughed at the idea as an excellent joke when it was first mentioned to him by russell lord glistonburys manners however and the cordial familiarity with which he treated vivian gave every day increasing credit to the report if he were his son my lord could not be more anxious about mr vivian said one of the plain spoken freeholders in the presence of the lady lidhursts lady sarah pursed up her mouth and threw back her head but lady julia archly looking at her sister smiled the vivacity of lady julias manner did not appear excessive during this election time when all the world seemed mad on the contrary there was in her utmost freedom and raillery that air of good breeding and politeness in which vulgar mirth and liberty are always deficient vivian began to think that she was become less childish and that there was something of a mixture of womanish timidity in her appearance which rendered her infinitely more attractive one evening in particular when her father having sent her for her mornings work she returned with a basket full of the vivian cockade which she had made with her own delicate hands vivian thought she looked very pretty her father desired her to give them to the person for whom they were intended and she presented them to mr russell saying they are for your friend sir vivian thought she looked very graceful lady mary vivian suppressed half a sigh and thought she kept the whole of her mind to herself these happy days of canvassing and this freedom of election could not last for ever after polling the county to the last freeholder the contest was at length decided and vivian was declared duly elected he was chaired and he scattered money with a lavish hand as he passed over the heads of the huzzaing populace and he had all the honours of an election the horses were taken from his carriage and he was drawn by men who were soon afterwards so much intoxicated that they retained no vestige of rationality not only the inferior but the superior rank of electors as usual upon such occasions thought proper to do honour to their choice and to their powers of judgment by drinking their members health at the expense of their own till they could neither see hear nor understand our hero was not by any means fond of drinking but he could not refuse to do as others did and lord glistonbury swore that now he had found out that vivian could be such a pleasant companion over a bottle he should never listen to his excuses in future a few days after this election parliament met for the dispatch of business and as some important question was to come on all the members were summoned by a peremptory call of the house vivian was obliged to go to town immediately and compelled to defer his marriage he regretted being thus hurried away from selina and with a thousand tender and passionate expressions assured her that the moment his attendance on public business could be spared he should hasten to the country to claim his promised happiness the castle would be finished by the time the session was over the lawyers would also have completed their settlements and vivian said he should make every other necessary preparation whilst he was in town therefore he urged selina now to fix the time for their marriage and to let it be the first week of the recess of parliament but miss sidney who had great delicacy of feeling and dignity of character thought that vivian had of late shown some symptoms of decreased affection and that he had betrayed signs of unsteadiness of character in the whole affair of the castle building and of the election he had evidently been led by others instead of following his own conviction she wisely dreaded that he might in more important actions yield his judgment to others and then what security could she have for his principles he might perhaps be led into all sorts of fashionable dissipation and vice besides these fears she considered that vivian was the possessor of a large fortune that his mother had with difficulty consented to this match that he was very young had seen but little of the world and might perhaps in future repent of having made thus early in life a love match she therefore absolutely refused to let him now bind himself to her by any fresh promises she desired that he should consider himself as perfectly at liberty and released from all engagement to her it was evident however from the manner in which she spoke that she wished to restore her lovers liberty for his sake only and that her own feelings however they might be suppressed were unchanged vivian was touched and charmed by her delicacy and generosity in the fervour of his feelings he swore that his affections could never change and he believed what he swore lady mary vivian was struck also with miss sidneys conduct at parting and she acknowledged that it was impossible to show at once more tenderness and dignity no one however not even vivian knew how much pain this separation gave selina her good sense and prudence told her indeed that it was best both for her happiness and vivians that he should see something more of the world and that she should have some farther proof of the steadiness of his attachment before she should unite herself with him irrevocably but whilst she endeavoured to fortify her mind with these reflections love inspired many painful fears and though she never repented having set him free from his promises and engagements she trembled for the consequences of his being thus at liberty in such scenes of temptation as a london life would present chapter iii when our hero arrived in london and when he was first introduced into fashionable society his thoughts were so intent upon selina sidney that he was in no danger of plunging into dissipation he was surprised at the eagerness with which some young men pursued frivolous pleasures he was still more astonished at seeing the apathy in which others of his own age were sunk and the listless insignificance in which they lounged away their lives the call of the house which brought vivian to town brought lord glistonbury also to attend his duty in the house of peers with his lordships family came mr russell whom vivian went to see as soon and as often as he could russell heard with satisfaction the indignant eloquence with which his friend spoke and only wished that these sentiments might last and that fashion might never lead him to imitate or to tolerate fools whom he now despised in the mean time tell me how you go on yourself said vivian how do you like your situation here and your pupil and all the glistonbury family let me behind the scenes at once for you know i see them only on the stage russell replied in general terms that he had hopes lord lidhurst would turn out well and that therefore he was satisfied with his situation but avoided entering into particulars because he was a confidential person in the family he thought that a preceptor and a physician were in some respects bound by a similar species of honour to speak cautiously of the maladies of their patients or the faults of their pupils admitted into the secrets of families they should never make use of the confidence reposed in them to the disadvantage of any by whom they are trusted russells strictly honourable reserve upon this occasion was rather provoking to vivian who to all his questions could obtain only the dry answer of judge for yourself the nature of a town life and the sort of intercourse which capital cities afford put this very little in vivians power the obligations he was under to lord glistonbury for assistance at the election made him anxious to show his lordship respect and attention and the sort of intimacy which that election had brought on was to a certain degree kept up in town lady mary vivian was constantly one at lady glistonburys card parties and vivian was frequently at his lordships dinners considering the coldness and formality of lady glistonburys manners she was particularly attentive to lady mary vivian and our hero was continually an attendant upon the ladies of the glistonbury family to all public places this was by no means disagreeable to him as they were persons of high consideration and they were sure of drawing into their circle the very best company lady mary vivian observed that it was a great advantage to her son to have such a house as lord glistonburys open to him to go to whenever he pleased besides the advantage to his morals her ladyship was by no means insensible to the gratification her pride received from her sons living in such high company the report which had been raised in the country during the election that mr vivian was going to be married to lady sarah lidhurst now began to circulate in town this was not surprising since a young man in london of any fortune or notoriety can hardly dance three or four times successively with the same young lady cannot even sit beside her and converse with her in public half a dozen times without its being reported that he is going to be married to her of this vivian during his noviciate in town was not perhaps sufficiently aware he was soon surprised at being asked by almost every one he met when his marriage with lady sarah lidhurst was to take place at first he contented himself with laughing at these questions and declaring that there was no truth in the report but his asseverations were not to be believed they were attributed to motives of discretion he was told by his companions that he kept his own counsel very well but they all knew the thing was to be he was congratulated upon his good fortune in making such an excellent match for though as they said he would have but little money with lady sarah yet the connexion was so great that he was the luckiest fellow upon earth the degree of importance which the report gave him among the young men of his acquaintance and the envy he excited amused and gratified his vanity the sort of conversation he was now in the constant habit of hearing both from young and old in all companies about the marriages of people in the fashionable world where fortune and rank and connexion were always the first things spoken of or considered began insensibly to influence vivians mode of speaking if not of judging before he mixed in this society he knew perfectly well that these were the principles by which people of the world are guided but whilst he had believed this only on hearsay it had not appeared to him so entirely true and so important as when he saw and heard it himself the effect of the opinions of a set of fine people now he was actually in their society and whilst all other society was excluded from his perception was very different from what he had imagined it might be when he was in the country or at college to do our hero justice however he was sensible of this aberration in his own mind he had sense enough to perceive from what causes it arose and steadiness sufficient to adhere to the judgements he had previously and deliberately formed he did not in material points change his opinion of his mistress he thought her far far superior to all he saw and heard amongst the belles who were most admired in the fashionable world but at the same time he began to agree with his mothers former wish that selina added to all other merits had the advantage of high birth and connexions or at least of belonging to a certain class of high company he determined that as soon as she should be his wife he would have her introduced to the very first society in town he pleased his imagination with anticipating the change that would be made in her appearance by the addition of certain elegancies of the mode he delighted in thinking of the sensation she would produce and the respect that would be paid to her as mrs vivian surrounded as he would take care that she should be with all those external signs of wealth and fashion which command immediate and universal homage from the great and little world one day when vivian was absorbed in these pleasing reveries russell startled him with this question when are you to be married to lady sarah lidhurst from you such a question said vivian why not from me it is a question that every body asks of me because i am your intimate friend and i should really be obliged to you if you would furnish me with an answer that may give me an air of a little more consequence than that which i have at present being forced to answer i dont know you dont know but why do not you answer never as i do said vivian to all the fools who ask me the same question because they say that is your answer and only a come off i cant help it is it my fault if they wont believe the truth why people are apt to trust to appearances in these cases and if appearances are contrary to your assertions you should not wonder that you are not believed well time will show them their mistake said vivian but i dont know what appearances you mean what appearances are against me i never in my life saw a woman i was less disposed to like whom it would be more impossible for me to love than lady sarah lidhurst and i am sure i never gave her or any of her family the least reason to imagine i had a thought of her very likely yet you are at lord glistonburys continually and you attend her ladyship to all public places is this the way do you think to put a stop to the report that has been raised i care not whether it stops or goes on said vivian how dont i know it is false thats enough for me it may embarrass you yet said russell good heavens can you who know me so well russell fancy me so weak as to be embarrassed by such a report look i would rather put this hand into that fire and let it be burned off than offer it to lady sarah lidhurst very likely i dont doubt you think so said russell and i would do so said vivian possibly yet you might be embarrassed nevertheless if you found that you had raised expectations which you could not fulfil and if you found yourself accused of having jilted this lady if all her friends were to say you had used her very ill i know your nature vivian these things would disquiet you very much and is it not better to prevent them but neither lady sarah nor her friends blame me i see no signs in the family of any of the thoughts or feelings you suppose ladies especially young and fashionable ladies do not always show their thoughts or feelings said russell lady sarah lidhurst has no thoughts or feelings said vivian any more than an automaton ill answer for her i am sure i can do her the justice to proclaim that she has always from the first moment i saw her till this instant conducted herself towards me with the same petrified and petrifying propriety i do not know what petrified propriety exactly means said russell but let it mean what it may it is nothing to the present purpose for the question is not about the propriety of lady sarah lidhursts conduct but of yours now allowing you to call her ladyship a petrifaction or an automaton or by whatever other name you please still i apprehend that she is in reality a human creature and a woman and i conceive it is the duty of a man of honour or honesty not to deceive her i would not deceive her or any woman living upon any account said vivian but how is it possible i can deceive her when i tell you i never said a word about love or gallantry or any thing like it to her in my life but you know language is conventional especially in gallantry said russell true but ill swear the language of my looks has been unequivocal if that is what you mean not exactly there are certain signs by which the world judges in these cases if a gentleman is seen often with the same lady in public absurd troublesome ridiculous signs which would put a stop to all society which would prevent a man from conversing with a woman either in public or private and must absolutely preclude one sex from obtaining any real knowledge of the characters and dispositions of the other i admit all you say i feel the truth of it i wish this were changed in society it is a great inconvenience a real evil said russell but an individual cannot alter a custom and as you have not by your own account any particular interest in becoming more intimately acquainted with the character and disposition of lady sarah lidhurst you will do well not to expose yourself to any inconvenience on her account by neglecting common received forms and opinions well well say no more about it said vivian impatiently spare me all farther logic and morality upon this subject and ill do what you please only tell me what you would have me do gradually withdraw yourself for some time from this house and the report will die away of itself withdraw myself that would be very hard upon me cried vivian for this house is the most agreeable house in town to me because you live in it in the first place and then though the women are as stiff as pokers one is always sure of meeting all the pleasant and clever men at glistonburys good dinner let me tell you good dinners and good company and good conversation and good music make altogether a very pleasant house which i should be confoundedly sorry to be forced to give up i dont doubt it said russell but we must often give up more even than this for the sake of acting with consistency and honour we must sacrifice the less to the greater good and it is on these occasions that people show strength or weakness of mind vivian felt the justice of his friends observations resolved to follow his advice and to withdraw himself gradually from the glistonbury circle he had not however steadiness enough to persist in this resolution one engagement linked on another and he would soon probably have relapsed into his habit of being continually of their parties if accident had not for a time suspended this intimacy by leading him into another which seemed to him still more attractive among the men of talents and political consequence whom he met at lord glistonburys was mr wharton whose conversation particularly pleased vivian and who now courted his acquaintance with an eagerness which was peculiarly flattering vivian knew him only as a man of great abilities with his real character he was not acquainted wharton had prepossessing manners and wit sufficient whenever he pleased to make the worse appear the better reason in private or in public debate he had at his command and could condescend to employ all sorts of arms and every possible mode of annoyance from the most powerful artillery of logic to the lowest squib of humour he was as little nice in the company he kept as in the style of his conversation frequently associating with fools and willing even to be thought one he made alternately his sport and advantage of the weakness and follies of mankind wharton was philosophically politically and fashionably profligate after having ruined his private fortune by unbounded extravagance he lived on nobody knew how in careless profusion in public life he made a distinguished figure and seemed therefore to think himself raised above the necessity of practising any of the minor virtues of economy prudence or justice which common people find essential to their well being in society far from attempting to conceal he gloried in his faults for he knew full well that as long as he had the voice of numbers with him he could bully or laugh or shame plain reason and rigid principle out of countenance it was his grand art to represent good sense as stupidity and virtue as hypocrisy hypocrisy was in his opinion the only vice which merited the brand of infamy and from this he took sufficient care to prove or at least to proclaim himself free even whilst he offended against the decencies of life there seemed to be something frank and graceful in his manner of throwing aside all disguise there appeared an air of superior liberality in his avowing himself to be governed by that absolute selfishness which other men strive to conceal even from their own hearts he dexterously led his acquaintance to infer that he would prove as much better than his professions as other people are often found to be worse than theirs where he wished to please it was scarcely possible to escape the fascination of his manner nor did he neglect any mode of courting popularity he knew that a good table is necessary to attract even men of wit and he made it a point to have the very best cook and the very best wines he paid his cook and his cook was the only person he did pay in ready money his wine merchant he paid in words an art in which he was a professed and yet a successful adept as hundreds of living witnesses were ready to attest but though wharton could cajole he could not attach his fellow creatures he had a party but no friend with this distribution of things he was perfectly satisfied for he considered men only as beings who were to be worked to his purposes and he declared that provided he had power over their interests and their humours he cared not what became of their hearts it was his policy to enlist young men of talents or fortune under his banners and consequently vivian was an object worthy of his attention such was the disorder of whartons affairs that either ready money or political power was necessary to his existence our hero could at the same time supply his extravagance and increase his consequence wharton thought that he could borrow money from vivian and that he might command his vote in parliament but to the accomplishment of these schemes there were two obstacles vivian was attached to an amiable woman and was possessed of an estimable friend wharton had become acquainted with russell at lord glistonburys and in many arguments which they had held on public affairs had discovered that russell was not a man who ever preferred the expedient to the right nor one who could be bullied or laughed out of his principles he saw also that russells influence over vivian was so great that it supplied him with that strength of mind in which vivian was naturally deficient and if our hero should marry such a woman as miss sidney wharton foresaw that he should have no chance of succeeding in his designs therefore his first objects were to detach vivian from his friend russell and from selina one morning he called upon vivian with a party of his friends and found him writing poetry cried wharton carelessly looking at what he had been writing poetry i protest ay i know this poor fellows in love and every man who is in love is a poet with a woeful ditty to his mistresss eyebrow pray what colour may miss sidneys eyebrows be she is really a pretty girl i think i remember seeing her at some races why does she never come to town but of course she is not to blame for that but her fortune i suppose marrying a girl without a fortune is a serious thing in these expensive days but you have fortune enough for both yourself and your wife so you may do as you please well i thank god i have no fortune if i had been a young man of fortune i should have been the most unhappy rascal upon earth for i should have always suspected that every woman liked me for my wealth i should have had no pleasure in the smiles of an angel angels or their mothers are so venal now a days and so fond of the pomps and vanities of this wicked world i hope said vivian laughing you dont include the whole sex in your satire no there are exceptions and every man has his angel of an exception as every woman has her star it is well for weak women when these stars of theirs dont lead them astray and well for weak men when these angel exceptions before marriage dont turn out very women or devils afterwards but why do i say all this because i am a suspicious scoundrel i know and cant help it if other fellows of my standing in this wicked world would but speak the truth however they would show as much suspicion and more than i do bad as i am and such as i am you see and have the whole of me nobody can say whartons a hypocrite thats some comfort but seriously vivian i dont mean to laugh at love and angels i can just remember the time when i felt all your sort of romance but that is in the preterpluperfect tense with me completely past ambition is no bad cure for love my head is at this present moment so full of this new bill that we are bringing into parliament that cupid might empty his quiver upon me in vain look here is an impenetrable shield added he wrapping round him a thick printed copy of an act of parliament come vivian you must come along with us to the house and mixd with men a man you must appear vivian felt much ashamed of having been detected in writing a sonnet especially as it afforded wharton such a fine subject for raillery he accompanied the party to the house of commons where wharton made a brilliant speech it gained universal applause vivian sympathized in the general enthusiasm of admiration for whartons talents accepted an invitation to sup with him and was charmed by his convivial powers from this day he grew every hour more intimate with wharton i can enjoy thought vivian the pleasure of his society without being influenced by his libertine example lady mary vivian saw the rise and progress of this intimacy and was not insensible to its danger yet she was gratified by seeing her son distinguished by a man of whartons political consequence and she satisfied her conscience by saying he will bring my son forward in public life and as to the rest charles has too good principles ever to follow his example in private life wharton had too much address to alarm vivians moral prejudices on a first acquaintance he contented himself with ridiculing only the exaggeration of any of the virtues still affecting to believe in virtue and to love it wherever it could be found genuine by the success of his first petty attacks he learned the power that ridicule had over our heros mind and he did not fail to make use of it continually after having as he perceived succeeded in making vivian ashamed of his sonnet to selina and of appearing as a romantic lover he doubted not but in time he should make true love itself ridiculous and wharton thought it was now the moment to hazard another stroke and to commence his attack against friendship vivian my good fellow why do you let yourself be ruled by that modern stoic in the form of lord lidhursts tutor i never saw any of these cold moralists who were real warm hearted good friends i have a notion i see more of russells play in the house where he has got than he thinks i do and i can form a shrewd guess why he was so zealous in warning you of the report about lady sarah lidhurst he had his own snug reasons for wanting you away oh trust me for scenting out self interest through all the doublings and windings of your cunning moralist reddening with indignation at this attack upon his friend vivian warmly replied that mr wharton ought to restrain his wit where the feelings of friendship and the character of a man of honour were concerned that he did not in the least comprehend his insinuations with regard to russell but that for his own part he had such firm reliance upon his friends attachment and integrity that he was at any time ready to pledge his own honour for russells and to answer for it with his life spare your heroics my dear vivian cried wharton laughing for we are not in the days of pylades and orestes yet upon my soul instead of being as angry with you as you are with me at this instant i like you a thousand times the better for your enthusiastic credulity for my part i have ever since i lived in the world and put away childish things regretted that charming instinct of credulity which experience so fatally counteracts i envy you my dear boy as to the rest you know russells merits better than i do ill take him henceforward upon trust from you thus wharton finding that he was upon dangerous ground made a timely retreat the playful manner and open countenance with which he now spoke and the quick transition that he made to other subjects of conversation prevented vivian from suspecting that any settled design had been formed to detach him from russell from this time forward wharton forbore raillery on love and friendship and far from seeming desirous of interfering in vivians private concerns appeared quite absorbed in politics avowing as he did that he was guided solely by his interest in public life he laughed at vivian for professing more generous principles i know cried wharton how to make use of a fine word and to round a fine sentence as well as the best of you but what a simpleton he must be who is cheated by his own sophistry an artist an enthusiastic artist who is generally half a madman might fall in love with a statue of his own making but you never heard of a coiner did you who was cheated by his own bad shilling patriotism and loyalty are counterfeit coin i cant be taken in by them at my time of day vivian could not forbear to smile at the drollery and wit with which this profligate defended his want of integrity yet he sometimes seriously and warmly asserted his own principles upon these occasions wharton either overpowered him by a fine flow of words or else listened with the most flattering air of admiration and silenced him by compliments to his eloquence vivian thought that he was quite secure of his own firmness but the contagion of bad example sometimes affects the mind imperceptibly as certain noxious atmospheres steal upon the senses and excite the most agreeable sensations while they secretly destroy the principles of health and life a day was fixed when a question of importance was to come on in the house of commons wharton was extremely anxious to have vivians vote vivian according to the parliamentary phrase had not made up his mind on the subject a heap of pamphlets on the question lay uncut upon his table every morning he resolved to read them that he might form his judgment and vote according to his unbiassed opinion but every morning he was interrupted by some of the fashionable idlers whom his facility of temper had indulged in the habit of haunting him daily oh vivian we are going to such and such a place and you must come with us was a mode of persuasion which he could not resist if i dont do as they do thought he i shall be quite unfashionable russell may say what he pleases but it is necessary to yield to ones companions in trifles whoever would be pleased and please must do what others do with ease this couplet which had been repeated to him by wharton recurred to him continually and thus wharton by slight means in which he seemed to have no interest or design prepared vivian for his purposes by working gradually on the easiness of his disposition he always argued that it could not possibly signify what he did with an hour or two of his day till at last vivian found that he had no hours of his own that his whole time was at the disposal of others and now that he really wanted leisure to consider an important question when his credit as a member of the senate and as a man just entering political life depended on this decision he literally could not command time to read over the necessary documents so the appointed day arrived before vivians opinion was formed and from mere want of time to decide for himself he voted as wharton desired another and another political question came on the same causes operated and the same consequences ensued wharton managed with great address so as to prevent him from feeling that he gave up his freewill before vivian was aware of it whilst he thought that he was perfectly independent of all parties public opinion had enrolled him amongst whartons partisans of this russell was the first to give him warning russell heard of it amongst the political leaders who met at lord glistonburys dinners and knowing the danger there is of a young mans committing himself on certain points he with the eagerness of a true friend wrote immediately to put vivian upon his guard my dear vivian i am just going into the country with lord lidhurst and perhaps may not return for some time i cannot leave you without putting you on your guard once more against mr wharton i understand that you are thought to be one of his party and that he countenances the report take care that you are not bound hand and foot before you know where you are your sincere friend h russell with the natural frankness of his disposition vivian immediately spoke to wharton upon the subject what people say that you are one of my party do they said wharton i never heard this before but i am heartily glad to hear it you are in for it now vivian you are one of us and with us you must stand or fall excuse me there cried vivian i am not of any party and am determined to keep myself independent do you remember the honest quakers answer to the man of no party said wharton no i think it was about the year when party disputes about whig and tory ran high but no matter what year it will do for any time a gentleman of undeviating integrity an independent man just such a man as mr vivian offered himself candidate for a town in the east west north or south of england no matter where it will do for any place and the first person whose vote he solicited was a quaker who asked him whether he was a whig or tory neither i am an independent moderate man and when the members of administration are right i will vote with them when wrong against them and be these really thy principles quoth the quaker then a vote of mine thou shalt never have thou seest my door it leadeth into the street the right hand side of which is for the tory the left for the whigs and for a cold blooded moderate man like thee there is the kennel and into it thou wilt be jostled for thou beest not decided enough for any other situation but why should the moderate man be condemned to the kennel said vivian was there no middle to your quakers road a stout man cannot be easily jostled into the kennel pshaw pshaw said wharton jesting out of the question a man is nothing in public life or worse than nothing a trimmer unless he joins a party and unless he abides by it too as long as the party is in the right i presume you mean said vivian right or wrong cried wharton a man must abide by his party no power and no popularity trust me without it better stride on the greasy heads of the mob than be trampled under their dirtier feet an armed neutrality may be a good thing but an unarmed neutrality is fit only for fools besides in russells grand style i can bring down the ancients upon you and tell you that when the commonwealth is in danger he cannot be a good man who sides with neither party if it be so necessary to join a party and if after once joining it i must abide by it right or wrong for life said vivian it behoves me to consider well before i commit myself and before i go into the ranks i must see good reason to confide not only in the abilities but in the integrity and public virtue of my leader public virtue sounds fresh from college said wharton i would as soon and sooner hear a schoolboy read his theme as hear a man begin to prose about public virtue especially a member of parliament keep that phrase my dear vivian till some of the treasury bench come to court you then look superb like a french tragic actor swelling out your chest and throwing the head over the left shoulder thus exclaim public virtue forbid practise practise for if you do it well it may be worth a loud huzza to you yet or better still a snug place or pension but stay till youre asked stay till youre asked thats the etiquette never till then let me hear public virtue come out of your lips else youll raise suspicion of your virtue and lower your price what would you think of a pretty actress who began to talk to you of her reputation before you put it in any danger oh vivian my honest fellow unless you would make me think you no better than thousands that have gone before you never let me hear from your lips again till the proper time the hypocritical state phrase public virtue i had always till now understood that it was possible to be a patriot without being a hypocrite replied vivian i always understood that mr wharton was a patriot a very fair sarcasm on me said wharton laughing but you know im a sad dog never set myself up for a pattern man come lets home to dinner and a truce with politics and morality i find vivian youre a sturdy fellow and must have your own way no bending no leading you i see well it is a good thing to have so much strength of mind i envy you it must be recorded to the credit of our hero that in defiance of whartons raillery he talked and oh still more wonderful thought of public virtue during nearly half of his first session in parliament but alas whilst his political principles thus withstood the force of ridicule temptation soon presented itself to vivian in a new shape and in a form so seducing as to draw his attention totally away from politics and to put his private if not his public honour in the most imminent peril chapter iv one morning as vivian was walking with mr wharton up bond street they were met by a party of fashionable loungers one of whom asked whether mrs wharton was not come to town yet mrs wharton said vivian with an air of surprise yes she came to town this morning said wharton carelessly then laughing as he turned to look at vivian vivian my good fellow what smites you with such surprise did not you know i was married i suppose i must have heard it but i really forgot it said vivian there you had the advantage of me said wharton still laughing but if you never heard of mrs wharton before keep your own secret for i can tell you she would never forgive you though i might put a good face on the matter at any rate and swear youve heard so much of her that you were dying to see her some of these gentlemen who have nothing else to do will introduce you whenever you please and cannot i said vivian have the honour of your introduction mine the worst you could possibly have the honour as you are pleased to call it would be no favour i assure you the honour honour of a husbands introduction what a novice you are or would make me believe you to be but seriously i am engaged to day at glistonburys so good morning to you accustomed to hear wharton talk in the freest manner of women and marriage in general and scarcely having heard him mention his own wife vivian had as he said absolutely forgotten that wharton was a married man when he was introduced to mrs wharton he was still more surprised at her husbands indifference for he beheld a lady in all the radiance of beauty and all the elegance of fashion he was so much dazzled by her charms that he had not immediately power or inclination to examine what her understanding or disposition might be and he could only repeat to himself how is it possible that wharton can be indifferent to such a beautiful creature incapable of feeling any of what he called the romance of love the passion of course had always been with mr wharton of a very transient nature tired of his wifes person he showed his indifference without scruple or ceremony notorious and glorying in his gallantries he was often heard to declare that no price was too high to be paid for beauty except a mans liberty but that was a sacrifice which he would never make to any woman especially to a wife marriage vows and custom house oaths he classed in the same order of technical forms nowise binding on the conscience of any but fools and dupes whilst the husband went on in this manner the wife satisfied herself by indulgence in her strongest passions the passion for dress and public admiration childishly eager to set the fashion in trifles she spent unconscionable sums on her pretty person and devoted all her days or rather all her nights to public amusements so insatiable and restless is the passion for admiration that she was never happy for half an hour together at any place of public amusement unless she fixed the gaze of numbers the first winter after her marriage she enjoyed the prerogatives of a fashionable beauty but the reign of fashion is more transient even than the bloom of beauty mrs whartons beauty soon grew familiar and faded in the public eye some newer face was this season the mode mrs wharton appeared twice at the opera in the most elegant and becoming dresses but no one followed her lead mortified and utterly dejected she felt with the keenest anguish the first symptoms of the decline of public admiration it was just at this period when she was miserably in want of the consolations of flattery that vivians acquaintance with her commenced gratified by the sort of delighted surprise which she saw in his countenance the first moment he beheld her seeing that he was an agreeable man and knowing that he was a man of fortune and family she took pains to please him by all the common arts of coquetry but his vanity was proof against these the weakness of the ladys understanding and the frivolity of her character were for some weeks sufficient antidotes against all the power of her personal charms so much so that at this period he often compared or rather contrasted mrs wharton and selina and blessed his happy fate he wrote to his friend russell soon after he was introduced to this celebrated beauty and drew a strong and just parallel between the characters of these two ladies he concluded with saying notwithstanding your well founded dread of the volatility of my character you will not i hope my dear russell do me the injustice to apprehend that i am in any danger from the charms of mrs wharton vivian wrote with perfect sincerity he believed it to be impossible that he could ever become attached to such a woman as mrs wharton even if she had not been married and the wife of his friend so in all the security of conscious contempt he went every day to wait upon her or rather to meet agreeable company at her house a house in which all that was fashionable and dissipated assembled where beauty and talents and rank met and mingled and where political or other arrangements prevented the host and hostess from scrupulously excluding some whose characters were not free from suspicion lady mary vivian never went to mrs whartons but she acknowledged that she knew many ladies of unblemished reputation who thought it no impropriety to visit there and mrs whartons own character she knew was hitherto unimpeached she is indeed a woman of a cold selfish temper said lady mary not likely to be led into danger by the tender passion or by any of the delusions of the imagination vivian agreed with his mother in this opinion and went on paying his devoirs to her every day it was the fashion of the times and peculiarly the mode of this house for the gentlemen to pay exclusive attention to matrons few of the young men seemed to think it worth while to speak to an unmarried woman in any company and the few who might be inclined to it were as they declared deterred by the danger for either the young ladies themselves or their mothers immediately formed expectations and schemes of drawing them into matrimony the grand object of the ladies wishes and of the gentlemens fears the men said they could not speak to an unmarried woman or even dance with her more than twice without its being reported that they were going to be married and then the friends and relatives of the young ladies pretended to think them injured and ill treated if these reports were not realized our hero had some slight experience of the truth of these complaints in his own case with the lady sarah lidhurst he willingly took the rest upon trust believed all the exaggerations of his companions and began to think it prudent and necessary to follow their example and to confine his attentions to married women many irresistible reasons concurred to make mrs wharton the most convenient and proper person to whom he could pay this sort of homage besides she seemed to fall to his share by lot and necessity for at whartons house every other lady and every other gentleman being engaged in gallantry play or politics mrs wharton must have been utterly neglected if vivian had not paid her some attention common politeness absolutely required it the attention became a matter of course and was habitually expected still he had not the slightest design of going beyond the line of modern politeness but in certain circumstances people go wrong a great way before they are aware that they have gone a single step it was presently repeated to mr vivian by some of mrs whartons confidantes in whispers and under the solemn promise of secrecy that he certainly was a prodigious favourite of hers he laughed and affected to disbelieve the insinuation it made its impression however and he was secretly flattered by the idea of being a prodigious favourite with such a beautiful young creature in some moments he saw her with eyes of compassion pitying her for the neglect with which she was treated by her husband he began to attribute much of her apparent frivolity and many of her faults more to the want of a guide and a friend than to a deficiency of understanding or to defects of character mrs wharton had just sufficient sense to be cunning this implies but a very small portion she perceived the advantage which she gained by thus working upon vivians vanity and upon his compassion she continued her operations without being violently interested in their success for she had at first only a general wish to attract his attention because he was a fashionable young man one morning when he called upon wharton to accompany him to the house of commons he found mrs wharton in tears her husband walking up and down the room in evident ill humour he stopped speaking when vivian entered and mrs wharton endeavoured or seemed to endeavour to conceal her emotion she began to play on her harp and wharton addressing himself to vivian talked of the politics of the day there was some incoherence in the conversation for vivians attention was distracted by the air that mrs wharton was playing of which he was passionately fond theres no possibility of doing any thing while there is such a cursed noise in the room cried wharton here i have the heads of this bill to draw up i cannot endure to have music wherever i go he snatched up his papers and retired to an adjoining apartment begging that vivian would wait one quarter of an hour for him mrs whartons tears flowed afresh and she looked beautiful in tears you see you see mr vivian and i am ashamed you should see how i am treated i am indeed the most unfortunate creature upon the face of the earth and nobody in this world has the least compassion for me vivians countenance contradicted this last assertion most positively mrs wharton understood this and her attitude of despondency was the most graceful imaginable my dear mrs wharton it was the first time our hero had ever called her his dear mrs wharton but it was only a platonic dear you take trifles much too seriously wharton was hurried by business a moments impatience must be forgiven a moment replied mrs wharton casting up to heaven her beautiful eyes oh mr vivian how little do you know of him i am the most miserable creature that ever existed but there is not a man upon earth to whom i would say so except yourself vivian could not help feeling some gratitude for this distinction and as he leaned over her harp with an air of unusual interest he said he hoped that he should ever prove himself worthy of her esteem and confidence at this instant wharton interrupted the conversation by passing hastily through the room come vivian said he we shall be very late at the house we shall see you again of course at dinner said mrs wharton to vivian in a low voice our hero replied by an assenting bow five minutes afterwards he repented that he had accepted the invitation because he foresaw that he should resume a conversation which was at once interesting and embarrassing he felt that it was not right to become the depository of this ladys complaints against her husband yet he had been moved by her tears and the idea that he was the only man in the world to whom she would open her heart upon such a delicate subject interested him irresistibly in her favour he returned in the evening and was flattered by observing that amongst the crowd of company by which she was surrounded he was instantly distinguished he was perfectly persuaded of the innocence of her intentions and as he was attached to another woman he fancied that he could become the friend of the beautiful mrs wharton without danger the first time he had an opportunity of speaking to her in private he expressed this idea in the manner that he thought the most delicately flattering to her self complacency mrs wharton seemed to be perfectly satisfied with this conduct and declared that unless she had been certain that he was not a man of gallantry she should never have placed any confidence in his friendship i consider you said she quite as a married man by the bye when are you to be married and what sort of a person is miss sidney i am told she is excessively handsome and amiable and sensible what a happy creature she is just going to be united to the man she loves here the lady gave a profound sigh and vivian had an opportunity of observing that she had the longest dark eyelashes that he had ever seen i was married continued she before i knew what i was about you know mr wharton can be so charming when he pleases and then he was so much in love with me and swore he would shoot himself if i would not have him and all that sort of thing i protest i was terrified and i was quite a child you know i had been out but six weeks and i thought i was in love with him that was because i did not know what love was then besides he hurried and teased me to such a degree after all im convinced i married him more out of compassion than any thing else and now you see how he treats me most barbarously and tyrannically but i would not give the least hint of this to any man living but yourself i conjure you to keep my secret and pity me that is all i ask pity me sometimes when your thoughts are not absorbed in a happier manner vivians generosity was piqued he could not be so selfish as to be engrossed exclusively by his own felicity he thought that delicacy should induce him to forbear expatiating upon selinas virtues and accomplishments or upon his passion he carried this delicacy so far that sometimes for a fortnight or three weeks he never mentioned her name he could not but observe that mrs wharton did not like him the less for this species of sacrifice it may be observed that mrs wharton managed her attack upon vivian with more art than could be expected from so silly a woman but we must consider that all her faculties were concentrated on one object so that she seemed to have an instinct for coquetry the most silly animals in the creation from the insect tribe upwards show on some occasions where their interests are immediately concerned a degree of sagacity and ingenuity which compared with their usual imbecility appears absolutely wonderful the opinion which vivian had early formed of the weakness of this ladys understanding prevented him from being on his guard against her artifices he could not conceive it possible that he should be duped by a person so obviously his inferior with a woman of talents and knowledge he might have been suspicious but there was nothing in mrs wharton to alarm his pride or to awaken his fears he fancied that he could extricate himself in a moment and with the slightest effort from any snares which she could contrive and under this persuasion he neglected to make even that slight effort and thus continued from hour to hour in voluntary captivity insensibly vivian became more interested for mrs wharton and at the same time submitted with increased facility to the influence of her husband it was necessary that he should have some excuse to the world and yet more to his own conscience for being so constantly at whartons the pleasure he took in whartons conversation was still a sort of involuntary excuse to himself for his intimacy with the lady whartons wit more than mrs whartons beauty thought he is the attraction that draws me here i am full as ready to be of his parties as of hers and this is the best proof that all is as it should be whartons parties were not always such as vivian would have chosen but he was pressed on without power of resistance for instance one night wharton was going with lord pontipool and a set of dissipated young men to the house of a lady who made herself fashionable by keeping a faro bank vivian youll come along with us said wharton come we must have you unless you are more happily engaged his eye glanced with a mixture of contempt and jealousy upon his wife mrs whartons alarmed and imploring countenance at the same moment seemed to say for heavens sake go with him or i am undone in such circumstances it was impossible for vivian to say no he followed immediately acting as he thought from a principle of honour and generosity wharton was not a man to give up the advantage which he had gained every day he showed more capricious jealousy of his wife though he at the same time expressed the most entire confidence in the honour of his friend vivian still thought he could not do too much to convince him that his confidence was not misplaced and thus to protect mrs wharton from suspicion he yielded to all her husbands wishes vivian now felt frequently ashamed of his conduct but always proud of his motives and with ingenious sophistry he justified to himself the worst actions by pleading that he did them with the best intentions chapter v by this time lady mary vivian began to hear hints of her sons attachment to mrs wharton and much alarmed she repented having encouraged him to form a political or fashionable intimacy with the whartons suddenly awakened to the perception of the danger lady mary was too vehement in her terror she spoke with so much warmth and indignation that there was little chance of her counsels being of use but my dear madam it is only a platonic attachment argued vivian when his mother represented to him that the world talked loudly of his intimacy with mrs wharton a platonic attachment fashionable dangerous sophistry said lady mary why so maam said her son warmly and why should we mind what the world says the world is so fond of scandal that a man and woman cannot have any degree of friendship for one another without a hue and cry being immediately raised and all the prudes and coquettes join at once in believing or pretending to believe that there must be something wrong no wonder such a pretty woman as mrs wharton cannot escape envy and of course censure but her conduct can defy the utmost malice of her enemies i hope so said lady mary and at all events i am not one of them i know and care very little about mrs wharton whom i have always been accustomed to consider as a frivolous silly woman but what i wish to say though i fear i have lost your confidence and that my advice will not frivolous silly interrupted vivian believe me my dear mother you and half the world are and have been under a great mistake about her understanding and character her forming a platonic friendship with a young man is no great proof of her sense or of her virtue said lady mary the danger of platonic attachments i thought had been sufficiently understood pray my dear charles never let me hear more from you of platonics with married women i wont use the expression maam if you have any objection to it said vivian but mother you wish me to live in the most fashionable company and yet you desire me not to live as they live and talk as they talk now that is next to impossible pardon me but i should not have thought added he laughing that you who like most things that are fashionable would object to platonics object to them i despise detest abhor them platonics have been the ruin of more women the destruction of the peace of more families than open profligacy ever could have accomplished many a married woman who would have started with horror at the idea of beginning an intrigue has been drawn in to admit of a platonic attachment and many a man who would as soon have thought of committing murder as of seducing his friends wife has allowed himself to commence a platonic attachment and how these end all the world knows struck by these words vivian suddenly quitted his air of raillery and became serious had his mother stopped there and left the rest to his good sense and awakened perception of danger all would have been well but she was ever prone to say too much and in her ardour to prove herself to be in the right forgot that people are apt to be shocked by having it pointed out that they are utterly in the wrong indeed the very word platonics pursued she is considered by those who have seen any thing of life as the mere watchword of knaves or dupes of those who deceive or of those who wish to be deceived be assured maam said vivian that mrs wharton is not one of those who wish either to deceive or to be deceived and as to myself i hope i am as far from any danger of being a dupe as of being a knave my connexion with mrs wharton is perfectly innocent it is justified by the example of hundreds and thousands every day in the fashionable world and i should do her and myself great injustice if i broke off our intimacy suddenly as if i acknowledged that it was improper and what can be more improper since you force me to speak plainly cried lady mary what can be more improper than such an intimacy especially in your circumstances my circumstances what circumstances maam have you forgotten miss sidney by no means maam said vivian colouring deeply mrs wharton is well apprized and was from the first moment of our friendship clearly informed of my engagements with miss sidney and how do they agree with your attachment to mrs wharton perfectly well maam mrs wharton understands all that perfectly well maam and miss sidney do you think she will understand it and is it not extraordinary that i should think more of her feelings than you do at these questions vivian became so angry that he was incapable of listening farther to reason or to the best advice even from a mother for whom he had the highest respect the mother and son parted with feelings of mutual dissatisfaction vivian from that spirit of opposition so often seen in weak characters went immediately from his mothers lecture to a party at mrs whartons lady mary in the mean time sat down to write to miss sidney whatever reluctance she had originally felt to her sons marriage with this young lady it must be repeated to her ladyships credit that selinas honourable and disinterested conduct had won her entire approbation she wrote therefore in the strongest terms to press the immediate conclusion of that match which she now considered as the only chance of securing her sons morals and happiness her letter concluded with these words i shall expect you in town directly do not my dear let any idle scruples prevent you from coming to my house consider that my happiness your own and my sons depend upon your compliance i am persuaded that the moment he sees you the moment you exert your power over him he will be himself again but believe me i know the young men of the present day better than you do their constancy is not proof against absence if he lose the habit of seeing and conversing with you i cannot answer for the rest adieu i am so much harassed by my own thoughts and by the reports i hear that i scarcely know what i write pray come immediately my dear selina that i may talk to you of many subjects on which i dont like to trust myself to write my feelings have been too long repressed i must unburden my heart to you you only can console and assist me and independently of all other considerations you owe to my friendship for you selina not to refuse this first request i ever made you farewell i shall expect to see you as soon as possible yours c mary vivian st jamess street in this letter lady mary vivian had not explained the nature of her sons danger or of her fears for him motives of delicacy had prevented her from explicitly telling miss sidney her suspicions that vivian was attached to a married woman selina said her ladyship to herself must probably have heard the report from mr g who is so often at her mothers therefore there can be no necessity for my saying any more than i have done she will understand my hints unfortunately however miss sidney did not comprehend or in the least suspect the most material part of the truth she understood simply from lady marys letter that vivians affections wavered and she imagined that he was perhaps on the point of making matrimonial proposals for some fashionable belle probably for one of the lady lidhursts but the idea of his becoming attached to a married woman never entered her thoughts many motives conspired to incline selina to accept of the invitation the certainty that lady mary would be highly offended by a refusal the hint that her influence over vivian would operate immediately and in all its force if he were to see and converse with her and that on the contrary absence might extinguish his passion for ever curiosity to learn precisely the nature of the reports which his mother had heard to his disadvantage but above all a fond wish to be nearer to the man she loved and to have daily opportunities of seeing him prompted selina to comply with lady marys request on the contrary good sense and delicacy represented that she had released vivian from all promises all engagements that at parting she had professed to leave him perfectly at liberty that it would therefore be as indelicate as imprudent to make such an attempt to reclaim his inconstant heart she had told him that she desired to have proof of the steadiness both of his character and of his attachment before she could consent to marry him from this decision she could not she would not recede she had the fortitude to persist in this resolution she wrote to lady mary vivian in the kindest but at the same time in the most decided terms declining the tempting invitation it happened that vivian was with his mother at the moment when selinas answer arrived in the firm belief that such a pressing invitation as she had sent to a person in selinas circumstances and of selinas temper could not be refused her ladyship had made it a point with her son to dine tte tte with her this day and she had been talking to him in the most eloquent but imprudent manner of the contrast between the characters of mrs wharton and miss sidney he protested that his esteem and love for miss sidney were unabated yet when his mother told him that he would perhaps in a few minutes see his selina he changed colour grew embarrassed and melancholy and thus by his looks effectually contradicted his words he was roused from his reverie by the arrival of selinas letter his mothers disappointment and anger were expressed in the strongest terms when she found that selina declined her invitation but such are the quick and seemingly perverse turns of the human heart vivian grew warm in selinas defence the moment that his mother became angry with her he read her letter with tender emotion for he saw through the whole of it the strength as well as the delicacy of her attachment all that his mothers praises had failed to effect was immediately accomplished by this letter and he who but an instant before dreaded to meet selina now that she refused to come was seized with a strong desire to see her his impatience was so great that he would willingly have set out that instant for the country men of such characters as vivians are peculiarly jealous of their free will and precisely because they know that they are easily led they resist in affairs of the heart especially the slightest appearance of control lady mary was delighted to hear her son declare his resolution to leave town the next morning and to see miss sidney as soon as possible but she could not forbear reproaching him for not doing what she wanted precisely in the manner in which she had planned that it should be done i see my dear charles cried she that even when you do right i must not flatter myself that it is owing to any influence of mine give my compliments to miss sidney and assure her that i shall in future forbear to injure her in your opinion by my interference or even by expressing my approbation of her character my anger it is obvious has served her better than my kindness and therefore she has no reason to regret that my affection has been lessened as i confess it has been by her late conduct the next morning when vivian was prepared to leave town he called upon wharton to settle with him about some political business which was to be transacted in his absence wharton was not at home vivian knew that it would be best to avoid seeing mrs wharton but he was afraid that she would be offended and he could not help sacrificing a few minutes to politeness the lady was alone apparently very languid and charmingly melancholy before vivian could explain himself she poured forth in silly phrases but in a voice that made even nonsense please a rariety of reproaches for his having absented himself for such a length of time positively she would keep him prisoner now that she had him safe once more to be kept prisoner by a fair lady was so flattering that it was full an hour before he could prevail upon himself to assert his liberty the fear of giving pain indeed influenced him still more than vanity at last when mrs wharton spoke of her engagements for the evening and seemed to take it for granted that he would be of her party he summoned resolution sufficient oh wonderful effort of courage to tell her that he was under a necessity of leaving town immediately going i presume to to the country said vivian firmly to the country no no no say at once to selina tell me the worst in one word astonished beyond measure vivian had not power to move the lady fell back on the sofa in violent hysterics our hero trembled lest any of her servants should come in or lest her husband should at his return find her in this condition and discover the cause he endeavoured in vain to soothe and compose the weeping fair one he could not have the barbarity to leave her in this state by sweet degrees she recovered her recollection was in the most lovely confusion asked where she was and what was going to happen vivian had not the rashness to run the risk of a second fit of hysterics he gave up all thoughts of his journey for this day and the lady recovered her spirits in the most flattering manner vivian intended to postpone his journey only for a single day but after he had yielded one point he found that there was no receding he was now persuaded that mrs wharton was miserable that she would never forgive herself for having betrayed the state of her heart his self love pleaded powerfully in her favour he considered that her husband treated her with mortifying neglect and provoked the spirit of retaliation by his gallantries vivian fancied that mrs whartons attachment to him might render her wretched but would never make her criminal with sophistical delicacy he veiled his own motives and instead of following the plain dictates of reason he involved his understanding in that species of sentimental casuistry which confounds all principles of right and wrong but the dread that he felt lest wharton should discover what was going on might have sufficiently convinced him that he was not acting honourably the suspicions which mr wharton formerly showed of his wife seemed now to be completely lulled asleep and he gave vivian continually such proofs of confidence as stung him to the soul by an absurd but not an uncommon error of self love vivian was induced to believe that a man who professed to cheat mankind in general behaved towards him in particular with strict honour and even with unparalleled generosity honesty was too vulgar a virtue for wharton but honour the aristocratic exclusive virtue of a gentleman he laid claim to in the highest tone the very frankness with which wharton avowed his libertine principles with respect to women convinced vivian that he had not the slightest suspicion that these could be immediately applied to the ruin of his own wife how can you my dear wharton talk in this manner said vivian once when he had been speaking with great freedom but it is better added he with a sigh to speak than to act like a villain villain repeated wharton with a sarcastic laugh you are grown quite ridiculous vivian i protest i dont understand you women now a days are surely able if not willing enough to take care of themselves and villains though they were very common in the time of miss clarissa harlowe and of all the tragedy queens of the last century are not to be heard of in these days any strange tales of those male monsters called seducers could gain credit during the ages of ignorance and credulity but now the enlightened world cannot be imposed upon by such miracles and a gentleman may be a man of gallantry nay even a lady may be a woman of gallantry without being hooted out of society as a monster at all events the blame is as it should be equally divided between the parties concerned and if modern lovers quarrel they do not die of grief but settle their differences in a court of law where a spinster may have her compensation for a breach of contract of marriage a father or a husband their damages for the loss of the company affection solace services c as the case may be of his wife or daughter all this is perfectly well understood and the terrors of law are quite sufficient without the terrors of sentiment if a man punish himself or let himself be punished twice for the same offence once by his conscience and once by his king and his country he is a fool and moreover acts contrary to the spirit of the british law which sayeth see blackstone and others that no man shall be punished twice for the same offence suffer your risible muscles to relax i beseech you vivian and do not affect a presbyterian rigidity which becomes your face as ill as your age i affect nothing certainly i do not affect presbyterian rigidity cried vivian laughing but after all wharton if you had a daughter or a sister what would you think of any man your friend for instance who should attempt to cut your speech short at once interrupted wharton i should not think at all about the matter i should blow his brains out of course and afterwards probably blow out my own but treachery from a friend from a man of honour is a thing of which i can hardly form an idea where i give my confidence i give it without any paltry mental reservation i could not suspect a friend vivian suffered at this instant all the agony which a generous mind conscious of guilt could endure he thought that the confusion of his mind must be visible in his countenance his embarrassment was so great that he could not utter a word wharton did not seem to perceive his companions agitation but passed on carelessly to other subjects of conversation and at length completely relieved vivian from fear of immediate detection by asking a favour from him a pecuniary favour all is safe mrs wharton at least is safe thank heaven thought vivian had her husband the slightest suspicion he never would condescend to accept of any favour from me with eagerness and almost with tears of gratitude vivian pressed upon wharton the money which he condescended to borrow it was no inconsiderable sum wharton cried he you sometimes talk freely too freely but you are i am convinced the most open hearted unsuspicious generous fellow upon earth you deserve a better friend than i am unable any longer to suppress or conceal the emotions which struggled in his heart he broke away abruptly hurried home shut himself up in his own apartment and sat down immediately to write to mrs wharton the idea that mrs wharton loved him in preference to all the fashionable coxcombs and wits by whom she was surrounded had insensibly raised our heros opinion of her understanding so much that he now imagined that the world laboured under a prejudice against her abilities he gave himself credit for having discovered that this beauty was not a fool and he now spoke and wrote to her as if she had been a woman of sense with eloquence which might have moved a woman of genius with delicacy that might have touched a woman of feeling he conjured her to fortify his honourable resolutions and thus whilst it was yet time to secure her happiness and his own instead of writing this letter added he in a postscript i ought perhaps to fly from you for ever but that would show a want of confidence in you and in myself and besides upon the most mature reflection i think it best to stay and wait upon you to morrow as usual lest by my precipitation i should excite suspicion in whartons mind the weak apprehension that mrs wharton should betray herself by another fit of hysterics if he should leave town and if his departure should be suddenly announced to her by her husband or by some common acquaintance induced him to delay a few days longer that he might prepare her mind by degrees and convince her of the necessity for their absolute separation when he had finished his letter to mrs wharton he was sufficiently well pleased with himself to venture to write to miss sidney his letters to her had of late been short and constrained but this was written with the full flow of affection he was now in hopes that he should extricate himself honourably from his difficulties and that he might at last claim his reward from selina chapter vi after he had despatched his two letters he became excessively anxious to receive mrs whartons answer by trifling but unavoidable accidents it was delayed a few hours at last it arrived vivian tore it open and read with surprise these words your letter is just what i wished and makes me the happiest of women that is if you are sincere which after all youve said i cant doubt i am so hurried by visitors and annoyed that i cannot write more but shall have time to talk to night at the opera at the opera mrs wharton appeared in high spirits and was dressed with more than usual elegance it was observed that she had never been seen to look so beautiful there was something in her manner that puzzled vivian extremely this extraordinary gaiety was not what he had reason to expect is it possible thought he that this woman is a mere coquette who has been amusing herself at my expense all this time and can now break off all connexion with me without a moments regret vivians pride was piqued though he wished to part from the lady he could not bear that this parting should evidently cost her nothing he was mortified beyond expression by the idea that he had been duped after the opera was over whilst mrs wharton was waiting for her carriage he had an opportunity of speaking to her without being overheard i am happy said he with a constrained voice i am extremely happy to see you madam in such charming spirits to night but are not you a strange man to look so grave cried mrs wharton i vow i dont know what to make of you but i believe you want to quarrel for the pleasure of making it up again now that wont do by the bye i have a quarrel with you sir how came you to sign your name to that foolish stuff you wrote me yesterday never do so any more i charge you for fear of accidents but whats the matter now you are a strange mortal are you going to die upon the spot what is the matter my letter to you was not signed i believe said vivian in an altered voice indeed it was said mrs wharton it was signed charles vivian at full length but why are you in such tremors about it i only mentioned it to put you on your guard in future ive burnt the letter people always get themselves into scrapes if they dont burn love letters as ive often heard mr wharton say added she laughing to his unspeakable consternation vivian now discovered that he had sent the letter intended for selina to mrs wharton and that which was designed for mrs wharton he had directed to miss sidney vivian was so lost in thought that the cry of mrs whartons carriage stops the way was vociferated many times before he recovered sufficient presence of mind to hand the lady out of the house he went home immediately that he might reflect upon what was best to be done his servant presently gave him a letter which a messenger had just brought from the country the packet was from selina enclosed i return the letter which i received from you this morning i read the first three lines of it before i perceived that it could not be intended for me i went no farther i cannot help knowing for whom it was designed but you may be assured that your secret shall be kept inviolably you have no reproaches to fear from me this is the last letter i shall ever write to you leave it to me to explain my own conduct to my mother and to yours if they think me capricious i can bear it i shall tell them that my sentiments are totally changed i am sure i can say so with perfect truth oh vivian it is you who are to be pitied every thing may be endured except remorse would to heaven i could save you from the reproaches of your own heart adieu selina sidney the feelings of vivians mind on reading this letter cannot be described admiration love tenderness remorse successively seized upon his heart incapable of any distinct reflection he threw himself upon his bed and closed his eyes endeavouring to compose himself to sleep that he might forget his existence but motionless as he lay the tumult of his mind continued unabated his pulse beat high and before morning he was in a fever the dread that his mother should come to attend him and to inquire into the cause of his illness increased his agitation she came her kindness and anxiety were fresh torments to her unhappy son bitterly did he reproach himself as the cause of misery to those he loved and esteemed most in the world he became delirious and whilst he was in this state he repeated mrs whartons name sometimes in terms of endearment sometimes in accents of execration his mothers suspicions of his intrigue were confirmed by many expressions which burst from him and which were thought by his attendants to be merely the ravings of fever lady mary had at this crisis the prudence to conceal her doubts and to keep every body as much as possible out of her sons apartment in a few days his fever subsided and he recovered to the clear recollection of all that had passed previously to his illness he almost wished to be again delirious the first time he was left alone he rose from his bed unlocked his bureau and seized selinas letter which he read again and again studying each line and word as if he could draw from them every time a new meaning she read but three lines of my letter said he to himself then she only guesses that i have an intrigue with mrs wharton without knowing that in this very letter i used my utmost influence to recall mrs wharton to herself the belief that selina thought worse of him than he deserved was some consolation to vivian he was resolved to recover her esteem he determined to break off all connexion with mrs wharton and full of this intention he was impatient till the physicians permitted him to go abroad when he was at last free from their dominion had escaped from his chamber and had just gained the staircase he was stopped by his mother charles said she before you quit me again it is my duty to say a few words to you upon a subject of some importance lady mary led the way to her dressing room with a dignified air vivian followed with a mixture of pride and alarm in his manner from the bare idea of a maternal lecture his mind revolted he imagined that she was going to repeat the remonstrance which she had formerly made against his intimacy with mrs wharton and against platonics in general but he had not the least apprehension that she had discovered the whole truth he was therefore both surprised and shocked when she spoke to him in the following manner the libertinism of the age in which we live has so far loosened all the bonds of society and all the ties of nature that i doubt not but a mothers anxiety for the morals of her son her only son the son over whose education she has watched from his infancy may appear even in his eyes a fit subject for ridicule i am well aware that my solicitude and my counsels have long been irksome to him i have lost his affections by a steady adherence to my duty but i shall persevere with the less reluctance since the dread of my displeasure or the hope of my approbation cannot now touch his sensibility during your illness you have betrayed a secret you have reason to start with horror is it possible that a son of mine with the principles which i have endeavoured to instil into his mind should become so far depraved do i live to hear from his own lips that he is the seducer of a married woman and that woman the wife of his friend vivian walked up and down the room in great agony his mother continued with increased severity of manner i say nothing of your dissimulation with me nor of all your platonic subterfuges i know that with a man of intrigue falsehood is deemed a virtue i shall not condescend to inquire farther into your guilty secrets i now think myself fortunate in having no place in your confidence but i here declare to you in the most solemn manner that i never will see you again until all connexion between you and mrs wharton is utterly dissolved i do not advise i command and must be obeyed or i cast you off for ever lady mary left the room as she uttered these words her son was deeply struck with his mothers eloquence he knew she was right yet his pride was wounded by the peremptory severity of her manner his remorse and his good resolutions gave place to anger the more he felt himself in the wrong the less he could bear to be reproached by the voice of authority even because his mother commanded him to give up all connexion with mrs wharton he was inclined to disobey he could not bear to seem to do right merely in compliance to her will he went to visit mrs wharton in a very different temper from that in which half an hour before this conference with his mother he had resolved to see the lady mrs wharton knew how to take advantage both of the weakness of his character and of the generosity of his temper she fell into transports of grief when she found that lady mary vivian and miss sidney were in possession of her secret it was in vain that vivian assured her that it would be kept inviolably she persisted in repeating that her reputation was lost that she had sacrificed every thing for a man who would at last desert her in the most treacherous and barbarous manner leaving her at the mercy of her husband the most profligate hard hearted tyrant upon earth as to her being reconciled to him she declared that was totally out of the question his behaviour to her was such that she could not live with him even if her heart were not fatally prepossessed in favour of another her passions seemed wrought to the highest pitch with all the eloquence of beauty in distress she appealed to vivian as her only friend she threw herself entirely upon his protection she vowed that she could not would not remain another day in the same house with mr wharton that her destiny her existence were at vivians mercy vivian had not sufficient fortitude to support this scene he stood irresolute the present temptation prevailed over his better resolutions he was actually persuaded by this woman whom he did not love whom he could not esteem to carry her off to the continent whilst at the very time he admired esteemed and loved another the plan of the elopement was formed and settled in a few minutes on mrs whartons part apparently with all the hurry of passion on vivians with all the confusion of despair the same carriage the very same horses that had been ordered to carry our hero to his beloved selina conveyed him and mrs wharton the first stage of their flight towards the continent the next morning the following paragraph appeared in the newspapers yesterday the beautiful and fashionable mrs w whose marriage we announced last year to the celebrated mr w eloped from his house in st jamess street in company with c v member for shire this catastrophe has caused the greatest sensation and astonishment in the circles of fashion for the lady in question had always till this fatal step preserved the most unblemished reputation and mr and mrs w were considered as models of conjugal felicity the injured husband was attending his public duty in the house of commons and as we are credibly informed was with patriotic ardour speaking in his countrys cause when this unfortunate event which for ever bereaves him of domestic happiness took place what must increase the poignancy of his feelings upon the occasion remains to be stated that the seducer was his intimate friend a young man whom he had raised into notice in public life and whom he had with all that warmth and confidence of heart for which he is remarkable introduced into his house and trusted with his beloved wife mr w is we hear in pursuit of the fugitives chapter vii in the modern fashionable code of honour when a man has seduced or carried off his friends wife the next thing he has to do is to fight the man whom he has injured and betrayed by thus appealing to the ordeal of the duel he may not only clear himself from guilt but if it be done with proper spirit he may acquire celebrity and glory in the annals of gallantry and in the eyes of the fair and innocent in our heros place most men of fashion would have triumphed in the notoriety of his offence and would have rejoiced in an opportunity of offering the husband the satisfaction of a gentleman but unfortunately for vivian he had not yet suited his principles to his practice he had acted like a man of fashion but alas he still thought and felt like a man of virtue as the following letter will show to the rev henry russell indignant as you will be russell at all you hear of me you cannot be more shocked than i am myself i do not write to palliate or apologize my conduct admits of no defence i shall attempt none private or public i have written to my lawyer to give directions that no sort of defence shall be set up on my part when the affair comes into doctors commons as it shortly will for i understand that poor wharton has commenced a prosecution as to damages he has only to name them any thing within the compass of my fortune he may command would to god that money could make him amends but he is too generous too noble a fellow profligate as he is in some things how incapable would he be of acting as basely as i have done there is not perhaps at this moment a human being who has so high an opinion of the man i have injured as i have myself he did not love his wife but that is no excuse for me his honour is as much wounded as if i had robbed him of her during the time he loved her most fondly he once doted upon her and would have loved her again when he was tired of his gallantries and they might then have lived together as happily as ever if i had not been what was i what am i not a villain or i should glory in what i have done but the weakest of human beings and how true it is russell that all wickedness is weakness i understand that w wherever he goes calls me a coward as well as a scoundrel and says that i have kept out of the way to avoid fighting him he is mistaken it is true i had the utmost dread of having his life to answer for and nothing should have provoked me to fire upon him but i had determined how to act i would have met him and have stood his fire i should not be sorry at present to be put out of the world and would rather fall by his hand than by any other but since this is out of the question and that things have taken another turn i have only to live as long as it shall please god a life of remorse and at least to try to make the unfortunate woman who has thrown herself upon my protection as happy as i can if you have any remaining regard for a pupil who has so disgraced you do me one favour go to miss sidney and give her what comfort you can say nothing for me or of me but that i wish her to forget me as soon as possible she discarded me from her heart when she first discovered this intrigue before this last fatal step still i had hopes of recovering her esteem and affection for i had resolved but no matter what i resolved all my resolutions failed and now i am utterly unworthy of her love this and all that is good and happy in life all the fair hopes and virtuous promises of my youth i must give up early as it is in my day my sun has set i truly desire that she should forget me for you know i am bound in honour honour how dare i use the word i am bound after the divorce to marry the woman i have seduced oh russell what a wife for your friend what a daughter in law for my poor mother after all her care of my education all her affection all her pride in me it will break her heart mine will not break i shall drag on perhaps to a miserable old age i am of too feeble a nature to feel these things as strong minds would as you will for me but do not blame yourself for my faults all that man could do for me you did this must be some consolation to you my dear and excellent friend may i still call you friend or have i no friend left upon earth c vivian from this letter some idea may be formed of what this unhappy man suffered at this period of his life from the reflections of a mind not used to its own reproaches the view of the future was as dreadful as the retrospect of the past his thoughts continually dwelt upon the public trial which was preparing before him he saw all its disgraceful circumstances then the horror of marrying of passing his whole future existence with a woman whom he could not esteem or trust these last were secret subjects of anxiety and anguish the more intensely felt because he could not speak of them to any human being such as mrs wharton was she was to be his wife and he was called upon to defend her against reproach and insult if possible from contempt during the course of six weeks which they spent together in exile at brussels vivian became so altered in his appearance that his most intimate friends could scarcely have known him his worst enemies if he had had any could not have desired the prolongation of his sufferings one evening as he was sitting alone in his hotel ruminating bitter thoughts a letter was brought to him from mr russell the first he had received since he left england every one who has been absent from his friends in a foreign country must know the sort of emotion which the bare sight of a letter from home excites but in vivians circumstances abandoned as he felt himself and deserving to be abandoned by his best friends the sight of a letter from russell so struck him that he gazed upon the direction for some minutes almost without power or wish to open it at last he opened and read return to your country your friends and yourself vivian your day is not yet over your sun is not yet set resume your energy recover your self confidence carry your good resolutions into effect and you may yet be an honour to your family a delight to your fond mother and the pride of your friend russell your remorse has been poignant and sincere let it be salutary and permanent in its consequences this is the repentance which religion requires the part of a man of sense and virtue is to make his past errors of use to his future conduct whilst i had nothing to say that could give you pleasure i forbore to answer your letter i forbore to overwhelm a mind sinking under remorse my sacred duty is to waken the sinner to repentance not to shut the gates of mercy on the penitent now i can relieve your mind from part of the load by which it has been justly oppressed you know that nothing can palliate your conduct in an intrigue with a married woman from this i had hoped your moral and religious education would have preserved you but of the premeditated guilt of deceiving the husband and laying a plan to seduce the wife i never suspected you and i may now tell you that you have not betrayed mr wharton he has betrayed you you have not seduced mrs wharton you have been seduced by her you are not bound to marry her wharton cannot obtain a divorce he dare not bring the affair to trial if he does he is undone there has been collusion between the parties the proof of this you will find in the enclosed paper which will be sworn to in due legal form whenever it is necessary even when you see them you will scarcely believe these damning proofs of whartons baseness but i always knew i always told you that this pretence to honour and candour frankness and friendship with this avowed contempt of all principle and all virtue could not be safe could not be sincere would not stand the test no nothing should make me trust to the private honour of a man so corrupt in public life as mr wharton a man who sells his conscience for his interest will sell it for his pleasure a man who will betray his country will betray his friend it is in vain to palter with our conscience there are not two honours two honesties how i rejoice at this moment in the reflection that your character as a public man is yet untarnished you have still this great advantage feel its value return and distinguish yourself among your countrymen distinguish yourself by integrity still more than by talents a certain degree of talents is now cheap in england integrity is what we want true patriotism true public spirit noble ambition not that vile scramble for places and pensions which some men call ambition not that bawling brawling thersites character which other men call public spirit not that marketable commodity with which wharton and such as he cheat popular opinion for a season but that fair virtue which will endure and abide by its cause to the last which in place or out shall be the same which successful or unsuccessful shall sustain the possessors character through all changes of party which whilst he lives shall command respect from even the most profligate of his contemporaries upon which when he is dying he may reflect with satisfaction which after his death shall be the consolation of his friends and the glory of his country all this is yet in your power vivian come then and fulfil the promise of your early years come and restore to your mother a son worthy of her come and surpass the hopes of your true friend h russell the rapid succession of feelings with which vivian read this letter can scarcely be imagined the paper it enclosed was from a former waiting maid of mrs whartons a woman who was expected to be the principal evidence on mr whartons side she had been his mistress one of those innumerable mistresses to whom he had of course addressed his transferable promises of eternal constancy she too of course had believed the vow in spite of all experience and probability and while she pardoned his infidelities to her mistress c all which she deemed very natural for a gentleman like him yet she was astonished and outrageous when she found him faithless to her own charms in a fit of jealousy she flew to mr russell whom she knew to be vivians friend and to revenge herself on wharton revealed the secrets which she had in her power put into russells hands the proofs of collusion between mr wharton and his wife and took malicious pains to substantiate her evidence to a lawyers full satisfaction knowing that she might prevent the possibility of a divorce and that she should thus punish her perjured inconstant in the most sensible manner by at once depriving him of twenty thousand pounds damages and by chaining him again to a wife whom he abhorred the same post which brought vivian this womans deposition and russells letter brought mrs wharton notice that the whole plan of collusion was discovered she was therefore prepared for vivians reproaches and received the first burst of his astonishment and indignation with a studied magdalen expression of countenance then she attempted a silly apology laying all the blame on her husband and vowing that she had acted under terror and that her life would not have been safe in his hands if she had not implicitly obeyed and executed his horrid plans she wept and kneeled in vain finding vivian immoveable in his purpose to return immediately to england she suddenly rose from her knees and all beautiful as she was looked in vivians eyes like a fiend whilst with an unnatural smile she said to him you see fool as i am thought to be i have been too clever for some people and i can tell mr wharton that i have been too clever for him too his heart is set upon a divorce but he cant have it he cant marry miss p nor yet her fortune nor ever shall i shall remain at brussels i have friends here and friends who were my friends before i was forced to give my hand to mr wharton or my smiles to you sir people who will not tease me with talking of remorse and repentance and such ungallant ungentlemanlike stuff nor sit bewailing themselves like a country parson instead of dashing out with me here in a fashionable style as a man of any spirit would have done but you youre neither good nor bad and no woman will ever love you nor ever did now you know my whole mind would to heaven i had known it sooner said vivian no i rejoice that i did not sooner know and that i never could have suspected such depravity under such a form too mrs whartons eye glanced with satisfaction upon the large mirror opposite to her vivian left her in utter disgust and horror drive on cried he as he threw himself into the chaise that was to carry him away faster faster the words and no woman will ever love you nor ever did rung upon vivians ear there she is mistaken thank heaven said he to himself yet the words still dwelt upon his mind and gave him exquisite pain upon looking again at russells letter he observed that selina sidneys name was never mentioned that she was neither directly nor indirectly alluded to in the whole letter what omen to draw from this he could not divine again he read it and all that russell said of public life and his exhortations to him to come and distinguish himself in public and in the political world struck him in a new light it seemed as if russell was sensible that there were no farther hopes of selina and that therefore he tried to turn vivians mind from love to ambition fourteen times he read over this letter before he reached england but he could not discover from it any thing as to the point on which his heart was most interested he reached london in this uncertainty put me out of suspense my best friend cried he the moment he saw russell tell me is selina living yes she has been very ill but is now recovered quite recovered and with your mother who is grown fonder of her than ever she was selina alive well and with my mother and may i i dont mean may i now but may i ever hope believe me i feel myself capable of any exertions any forbearance to obtain her forgiveness to merit may i ever hope for it speak russell assured him that he need not dread miss sidneys resentment for that she felt none she had expressed pity more than anger that she had taken pains to sooth his mother and had expressed sincere satisfaction on hearing of his release from his unworthy bondage and at his return home to his friends the tone in which russell spoke and the seriousness and embarrassment of his manner alarmed vivian inexpressibly he stood silent and dared not ask farther explanation for some minutes at length he broke silence and conjured his friend to go immediately to miss sidney and his mother and to request permission for him to see them both in each others presence russell said that if vivian insisted he would comply with his request but that he advised him not to attempt to see miss sidney at present not till he had been some time in london till he had given some earnest of the steadiness of his conduct till he had appeared again and distinguished himself in public life this might raise you again in her esteem and continued russell you must be aware that her love depends on her esteem at least that the one cannot exist without the other will you deliver a letter to her from me said vivian if you think i had better not attempt to see her yet you will deliver a letter for me after some hesitation or rather some deliberation russell answered in a constrained voice i will deliver your letter if you insist upon it vivian wrote russell undertook to deliver the letter though with evident reluctance in the mean time vivian went to see his mother whom he longed yet dreaded to meet her manner was not now severe and haughty as when she last addressed him but mild and benign she held out her hand to him and said thank god my son is restored to me and to himself she could say no more but embraced him tenderly russell had shown lady mary that her son had been the dupe of a preconcerted scheme to work upon his passions she deplored his weakness but she had been touched by his sufferings and was persuaded that his remorse would guard him against future errors therefore not a word or look of reproach escaped from her when he spoke of selina lady mary with great animation of countenance and warmth of eulogium declared that it was the first wish of her heart to see her son married to a woman of such a noble character and angelic temper but added her ladyship her manner changing suddenly as she pronounced the word but before she could explain the but russell came into the room and told vivian that miss sidney desired to see him vivian heard the words with joy but his joy was checked by the great gravity and embarrassment of his friends countenance and by a sigh of ill omen from his mother eager to relieve his suspense he hastened to selina who as russell told him was in lady marys dressing room the room in which he had first declared his passion for her hope and fear alternately seized him fear prevailed the moment that he beheld selina not that any strong displeasure appeared in her countenance no it was mild and placid but it was changed towards him and its very serenity was alarming whilst she welcomed him to his native country and to his friends and while she expressed hopes for his future happiness all hope forsook him and in broken sentences he attempted to stammer out some answer then throwing himself into a chair he exclaimed i see all future happiness is lost for me and i deserve it do not reproach yourself said selina in a sweet voice but the voice though sweet was so altered to him that it threw him into despair it is my wish not to inflict but to spare you pain i have therefore desired to see you as soon as possible that you might not form false expectations then you no longer love me selina now after all i have suffered you have the cruelty to tell me so and you who could form my character to every thing that is good and honourable you who alone could restore me to myself you reject you cast me from you for ever i have suffered much said selina in a trembling voice since we parted vivians eye quickly ran over her face and whole form as she spoke these words and he saw indeed traces of sickness and suffering with the idea of his power over her affections his hopes revived he seized the feeble hand which lay motionless but she withdrew it decidedly and his hopes again forsook him when she gently raised her head and continued to speak i have suffered much since we parted mr vivian and i hope you will spare me unnecessary and useless pain in this interview painful to a certain degree it must be to both of us for i cannot even now that all feelings of passion have subsided and that the possibility of my being united to you is past tell you so with all the composure which i had expected to do nor with all the firmness of voice and manner which is necessary perhaps to convince you of the truth and to restore your mind to itself the possibility of my being united to you is past why interrupted vivian incapable of understanding or listening to any thing else till this question was answered do not force me to what may seem like cruel reproach but let it suffice for me to say that my sentiments have been so much altered by a years experience that it is impossible for me ever to become your wife my love was founded on esteem i had indeed always fears of the instability of your character therefore i put your resolution to the proof the event has proved to me that my fears were but too just i speak with difficulty for i cannot easily give you so much pain as i know that i am inflicting at this moment but resumed she in a more resolute tone it is absolutely necessary for your future peace of mind as well as for my own that i should convince you i am sincere perfectly sincere at this moment that i know my own heart that my determination has not been hastily formed and cannot be altered the deliberate manner in which i now speak to you will i hope persuade you of this truth and if i have hesitated or showed any agitation in this interview attribute it to its real cause the weakness of my health feebleness of body not of mind she rose to leave the room but vivian detained her beseeching her with all the eloquence of passion in despair to hear him but for one moment whilst he urged that there was no probability of his ever relapsing into errors from which he had suffered so much that now his character was formed by adversity and that such was the power which selina possessed over his heart that a union with her would at this crisis decide his fate that her steadiness would give stability to his resolutions and that his gratitude would so increase his affection that he should have the strongest possible motives to make her a good husband that when he was happy in domestic life he should feel every energy of his mind revive that he should exert all his powers to distinguish himself and to justify the choice of the woman he adored in spite of the word adored which has usually such power to confound female judgment selina perceived that all he said was merely a repetition of his former arguments of which experience had proved the insufficiency she was aware that if before marriage his resolution and constancy had not been able to support the trial it would be folly or madness to marry him with the vague hope that she might reform his character she therefore continued steady to her resolution and as she found that vivians disappointment was greater than she had expected she immediately withdrew from his mothers house the next morning when vivian came to breakfast after having spent a sleepless night planning new arguments or new intreaties in favour of his love he found that miss sidney was gone his mother and his friend russell joined in representing to him that it would be useless to follow her that it would only give himself and selina unavailing pain vivian felt this stroke severely his mind was as it were adrift again after the first violence of his feelings had spent itself and when he sunk into that kind of apathy which is the consequence of exhausted passion his friend russell endeavoured to excite him to honourable ambition vivian caught the idea that if he distinguished himself in public life and if he there displayed any steadiness of character he might win back selinas esteem and affection fired with this hope he immediately turned his whole mind to the object applied with indefatigable ardour day and night to make himself master of the subjects likely to be discussed in the ensuing session of parliament at length his application and his energy were crowned with success on a question of considerable political importance which he had carefully considered he made an excellent speech a speech which directly made him of consequence in the house which in the language of the newspapers was received with unbounded applause was distinguished for strength of argument lucid order and a happy choice of expression but what encouraged our hero more than newspaper puffs or party panegyrics was the approbation of his friend russell russell never praised violently but a few words or even a look of satisfaction from him went farther than the most exaggerated eulogiums from others vivian pursued his course for some time with honour and increasing reputation there was one man who never joined in any of the compliments paid to the rising orator there was one man who always spoke of him with contempt who pronounced that vivian would never go far in politics that it was not in him that he was too soft que ctoit btir sur de la boue que de compter sur lui this depreciator and enemy of vivian was the man who but a few months before had been his political proneur and unblushing flatterer mr wharton exasperated by the consciousness of his own detected baseness and provoked still more by his being frustrated in all his schemes wharton now practised every art that a malicious and unprincipled wit could devise to lower the opinion of vivians talents and to prevent his obtaining either power or celebrity our hero was stimulated by this conduct to fresh exertions so far whartons enmity was of service to him but it was of disservice by changing in some measure the purity of the motives from which he acted with love and honourable ambition now mixed hatred thoughts of vengeance views of vulgar vanity and interest he thought more of contradicting mr whartons prophecies than of fulfilling his own ideas of what was fair and right he was anxious to prove that he could go far in politics that it was in him that he was not too soft and that it was not building on mud to depend on him these indefinite expressions operated powerfully and perniciously on his imagination to prove that wharton was mistaken in his prognostics it was necessary to our hero to obtain the price and stamp of talents it was essential to gain political power and this could not be attained without joining a party vivian joined the party then in opposition wharton and he though both in opposition of course after what had passed could never meet in any private company nor had they any communication in public though on the same side of the question their enmity was so great that not only the business of the nation but even the interests of their party were often impeded by their quarrels in the midst of these disputes vivian insensibly adopted more and more of the language and principles of the public men with whom he daily associated he began to hear and talk of compensations and jobs as they did and to consider all measures proved to be necessary for the support of his party as expedient if not absolutely right his country could not be saved unless he and his friends could obtain the management of affairs and no men be found could gain parliamentary influence or raise themselves into political power without acting as a body then of course all subordinate points of right were to be sacrificed to the great good of promoting the views of the party still however his patriotism was upon the whole pure he had no personal views of interest no desire even to be in place independently of a wish to promote the good of his country secret overtures were about this time made to him by government and inquiries were made if there was any thing which could gratify him or by which he could be induced to lay aside his opposition and to assist in supporting their measures many compliments to his talents and eloquence and all the usual commonplaces about the expediency and propriety of strengthening the hands of government were of course added something specific was at length mentioned it was intimated that as he was of an ancient family it might gratify him that his mother should be made a baroness in her own right the offer was declined and the temptation was firmly withstood by our hero his credit was now at its acme with his own coadjutors lady mary whispered the circumstance as a state secret to all her acquaintance and russell took care that miss sidney should hear of it vivian was now cited as an incorruptible patriot whartons malice and even his wit was almost silenced yet he was heard to say amidst the din of applause this is only the first offer he is in the right to make a show of resistance he will coquet for a time and keep philandering on till he suits himself and then hell jilt us youll see such speeches though they reached vivians ear by the kind officiousness of friends were never made by mr wharton so directly that he could take hold of them and russell strenuously advised him not to seek occasion to quarrel with a man who evidently desired only to raise his own reputation by making vivian angry getting him in the wrong and forcing him into an imprudent duel let your actions continue to contradict his words and they can never injure you said russell for some time vivian adhered to his friends advice and he proudly felt the superiority of principle and character but alas there was one defence that his patriotism wanted economy whilst he was thus active in the public cause and exulting in his disinterestedness his private affairs were getting into terrible disorder the expense of building his castle had increased beyond all his calculations the expense of his election the money he had lost at play whilst he was in whartons society the sums he had lent to wharton the money he had spent abroad all these accumulated brought him to great difficulties for though his estate was considerable yet it was so settled and tied up that he could neither sell nor mortgage his creditors became clamorous he had no means of satisfying or quieting them an execution was actually sent down to his castle just as it was finished lady mary vivian was in the greatest alarm and distress she had no means of extricating her son as to his fashionable friends no hopes from such extravagant and selfish beings what was to be done at this critical moment the offers from a certain quarter were renewed in another and as it seemed a more acceptable form a pension was proffered instead of a title and it was promised that the business should be so managed and the pension so held in another name that nothing of the transaction should transpire and that his seceding from opposition should be made to appear a change of sentiments from conviction not from interested motives vivians honourable feelings revolted from these offers and abhorred these subterfuges but distress pecuniary distress he had never before felt its pressure he had never till now felt how powerful how compulsatory it is over even generous and high spirited souls whilst vivian was thus oppressed with difficulties which his imprudence had brought upon him whilst his mind was struggling with opposing motives he was most fortunately for his political integrity relieved partly by accident and partly by friendship it happened that the incumbent of the rich living of which vivian had the presentation was dying just at this time and russell instead of claiming the living which vivian had promised to him relinquished all pretensions to it and insisted upon his friends disposing of his right of presentation the sum which this enabled vivian to raise was fully sufficient to satisfy the execution which had been laid on his castle and the less clamorous creditors were content to be paid by instalments annually from his income thus he was saved for the present and he formed the most prudent resolves for the future he was most sincerely grateful to his disinterested friend the full extent of the sacrifice which russell made him was not however known at this time nor for some years afterwards but without anticipation let us proceed with our story amongst those fashionable and political friends with whom our hero had since his return to england renewed his connexion was my lord glistonbury his lordship far from thinking the worse of him for his affair with mrs wharton spoke of it in modish slang as a new and fine feather in his cap and he congratulated vivian upon his having carried off the prize without paying the price vivians success as a parliamentary orator had still further endeared him to his lordship who failed not to repeat that he had always prophesied vivian would make a capital figure in public life that vivian was his member c at the recess lord glistonbury insisted upon carrying vivian down to spend the holidays with him at glistonbury castle you must come vivian so make your fellow put your worldly goods into my barouche which is at the door and we are to have a great party at glistonbury and private theatricals and the devil knows what and you must see my little julia act and i must introduce you to the rosamunda come come you cant refuse me why you have only a bachelors castle of your own to go to and thats a dismal sort of business compared with what i have in petto for you the feast of reason and the flow of soul in the first style i assure you you must know i always even in the midst of the wildest of my wild oats had a taste for the belles lettres and philosophy and the muses and the literati and so forth always a touch of the mecaenas about me and now my boys growing up its more particularly proper to bring these sort of people about him for you know clever men who have a reputation can sound a flourish of trumpets advantageously before a grecian youth of talents rare makes his appearance on the stage of the great world ha hey is not this what one may call prudence ha good to have a father who knows something of life and of books too hey then for my daughters too daughter i mean for lady sarahs lady glistonburys child her ladyship and miss strictland have manufactured her after their own taste and fashion and ive nothing to say to that but my little julia ah ive got a different sort of governess about her these few months past not without family battles you may guess but when jupiter gives the nod you know even juno stately as she is must bend so i have my rosamunda for my little julia who by the bye is no longer my little julia but a prodigious fine woman as you shall see but all this time is your fellow putting your things up no hey how oh i understand your long face of hesitation you have not seen the ladies since the wharton affair and you dont know how they might look never fear lady glistonbury shall do as i please and look as i please besides entre nous i know she hates the whartons so that her morality will have a loophole to creep out of and youll be safe and snug whilst all the blame will be thrown on them hey oh i understand things pique myself on investigating the human heart come we have not a moment to lose and youll have your friend russell too come come to have and to hold as the lawyers say seizing vivians arm lord glistonbury carried him off before he had half understood all his lordship had poured forth so rapidly and before he had decided whether he wished or not to accept of this invitation chapter viii on his way to glistonbury castle vivian had full leisure to repent of having accepted of this invitation recollecting as he did all the former reports about himself and lady sarah lidhurst he determined therefore that his visit should be as short as possible and the chief pleasure he promised himself was the society of his friend russell on his arrival at the castle he was told that mr russell was out riding and that every body else was in the theatre at a rehearsal except lady glistonbury the lady sarah and miss strictland he found these three ladies sitting in form in the great deserted drawing room each looking like a copy of the other and all as if they were deploring the degeneracy of the times vivian approached with due awe but to his great surprise and relief at his approach their countenances exhibited some signs of life lord glistonbury presented him on his return from abroad lady glistonburys features relaxed to a smile though she seemed immediately to repent of it and to feel it incumbent upon her to maintain her rigidity of mien whilst she and of course miss strictland and the lady sarah were thus embarrassed between the necessity of reprobating the sin and the desire of pleasing the sinner lord glistonbury ran on with one of his speeches of borrowed sense and original nonsense and then would have carried him off to the rehearsal but lady glistonbury called vivian back begging in her formal manner that her lord would do her the favour to leave mr vivian with her for a few minutes as it was so long since she had the pleasure of seeing him at glistonbury vivian returned with as good a grace as he could and to find means of breaking the embarrassing silence that ensued took up a book which lay upon the table topladys sermons no hope of assistance from that he had recourse to another equally unlucky wesleys diary another the pilgrims progress he went no farther but looking up he perceived that the lady sarah was motioned by her august mother to leave the room vivian had again recourse to toplady very unfashionable books mr vivian said miss strictland bridling and smiling as in scorn very unfashionable books repeated lady glistonbury with the same inflection of voice and the same bridling and smiling very different continued her ladyship very different from what you have been accustomed to see on some ladies tables no doubt mr vivian without mentioning names or alluding to transactions that ought to be buried in eternal oblivion and that are so very distressing to your friends here to think of sir give me leave to ask mr vivian whether it be true what i have heard that the prosecution and every thing relative to it is entirely given up entirely madam then said lady glistonbury glancing her eye at miss strictland we may welcome mr vivian with safe consciences to glistonbury and since the affair will never become public and since lady sarah knows none of the improper particulars and since she may and from her education naturally will class all such things under the head of impossibilities and false reports of which people in our rank of life especially are subject every hour to hear so many there cannot as i am persuaded you will agree with me in thinking miss strictland be any impropriety in our and lady sarahs receiving mr vivian again on the same footing as formerly miss strictland bowed her formal assent vivian bowed because he saw that a bow was expected from him and then he pondered on what might be meant by the words on the same footing as formerly and he had just framed a clause explanatory and restrictive of the same when he was interrupted by the sound of laughter and of numerous loud and mingled voices coming along the gallery that led to the drawing room as if these were signals for her departure and as if she dreaded the intrusion and contamination of the revel rout lady glistonbury arose looked at her watch pronounced her belief that it was full time for her to go to dress and retired through a venetian door followed by miss strictland repeating the same belief and bearing her ladyships tapestry work her steps quickened as the door at the opposite end of the room opened and curtsying an unnecessary apology to mr vivian as she passed she left him to himself and now he sees a train profusely gay come pranckling oer the place some were dressed for comic some for tragic characters but all seemed equally gay and talked equally fast there had been a dressed rehearsal of the fair penitent and of the romp and all the spectators and all the actors were giving and receiving exuberant compliments vivian knew many of the party some of them bel esprits some fashionable amateurs all pretenders to notoriety either as judges or performers in the midst of this motley group there was one figure who stood receiving and expecting universal homage she was dressed as the fair penitent but her affected vivacity of gesture and countenance was in striking contrast to her tragic attire and vivian could hardly forbear smiling at the minauderies with which she listened and talked to the gentlemen round her now languishing now coquetting rolling her eyes and throwing herself into a succession of studied attitudes dealing repartees to this side and to that and in short making the greatest possible exhibition both of her person and her mind dont you know her did you never see her before no youve been out of england but youve heard of her certainly rosamunda whispered lord glistonbury to vivian and who is rosamunda said vivian an actress actress hush bless you no but the famous poetess is it possible that you havnt read the poems of rosamunda they were in every bodys hands a few months ago but you were abroad better engaged or as well hey but as i was going to tell you thats the reason shes called the rosamunda i gave her the name for i patronized her from the first her real name is bateman and lady glistonbury and her set call her miss bateman still but nobody else shes an amazing clever woman i assure you more genius than any of em since the time of rousseau devil of a salary and devil of a battle i had to fight with some of my friends before i could fix her here but i was determined i would follow my own ideas in julias education lady glistonbury had her way and her routine with lady sarah and its all very well vastly well virtue for her too painful an endeavour content to dwell in decencies for ever you know the sort of thing yes yes but i was not content to have my julia lost among the mediocres as i call them so i took her out of miss strictlands hands and the rosamundas her governess her governess repeated vivian with uncontrollable astonishment lady julia lidhursts governess yes you may well be surprised pursued lord glistonbury mistaking the cause of the surprise no one in england could have done it but myself she refused innumerable applications immense offers and after all you know she does not appear as governess titre only as a friend of the family who directs lady julia lidhursts literary talents oh you understand a man of the world knows how to manage these things sacrifices always to the vanity of the sex or the pride as the case may be i never mind names but things as the metaphysicians say distinguish betwixt essentials and accidents sound philosophy that hey and thank heaven a gentleman or a nobleman need not apologize in these days for talking of philosophy before ladies even if any body overheard us which as it happens i believe nobody does so let me now that you know your paris introduce you to the rosamunda mr vivian the rosamunda rosamunda mr vivian after vivian had for a few minutes acted audience very little to his own satisfaction he was relieved by lord glistonburys exclaiming but julia wheres julia all this time rosamunda looked round with the air of one interrupted by a frivolous question which requires no answer but some one less exalted and more attentive to the common forms of civility told his lordship that lady julia was in the gallery with her brother lord glistonbury hurried vivian into the gallery he was struck the moment he met lady julia with the great change and improvement in her appearance instead of the childish girl he had formerly seen flying about full only of the frolic of the present moment he now saw a fine graceful woman with a striking countenance that indicated both genius and sensibility she was talking to her brother with so much eagerness that she did not see vivian come into the gallery and as he walked on towards the farther end where she was standing he had time to admire her a fine girl faith though she is my daughter whispered lord glistonbury and would you believe that she is only sixteen only sixteen ay and stay till you talk to her stay till you hear her you will be more surprised such genius such eloquence shes my own girl well julia my darling cried he raising his voice in the clouds as usual lady julia started but it was a natural not a theatric start colouring at the consciousness of her own absence of mind she came forward with a manner that apologized better than words could do and she received mr vivian so courteously and with such ingenuous pleasure in her countenance that he began to rejoice in having accepted the invitation to glistonbury at the same instant he recollected a look which his mother had given him when he first saw lady julia on the terrace of the castle well what was she saying to you lidhurst hey my boy we were arguing sir arguing ay ay shes the devil for that words at will persuasive words and more persuasive sighs ah woman woman for ever always talking us out of our senses and which of the best of us would not wish it to be so oh let me let me be deceived is the cream of philosophy epicurean and stoic at least thats my creed but to the point what was it about that she was holding forth so charmingly a book or a lover a book ill wager shes such a romantic little fool and so unlike other women leaves all her admirers there in the drawing room and stays out here talking over musty books with her brother but come what was the point i will have it argued again before me lets see the book lord lidhurst pointed out a speech in the fair penitent and said that they had been debating about the manner in which it should be recited lord glistonbury called upon his daughter to repeat it she showed a slight degree of unaffected timidity at first but when her father stamped and bid her let him see no vulgar bashfulness she obeyed recited charmingly and when urged by a little opposition from her brother grew warm in defence of her own opinion displayed in its support such sensibility with such a flow of eloquence accompanied with such animated and graceful yet natural gesture that vivian was transported with sudden admiration he was astonished at this early development of feeling and intellect and if in the midst of his delight he felt some latent disapprobation of this display of talent from so young a woman yet he quickly justified her to himself by saying that he was not a stranger that he had formerly been received by her family on a footing of intimacy then he observed farther in her vindication that there was not the slightest affectation or coquetry in any of her words or motions that she spoke with this eagerness not to gain admiration but because she was carried away by her enthusiasm and thoughtless of herself was eager only to persuade and to make her opinions prevail such was the enchantment of her eloquence and her beauty that after a quarter of an hour spent in her company our hero did not know whether to wish that she had more sedateness and reserve or to rejoice that she was so animated and natural before he could decide this point his friend russell returned from riding after the first greetings were over russell drew him aside and asked pray my dear vivian what brings you here lord glistonbury to whom i had not time to say no he talked so fast but after all why should i say no i am a free man a discarded lover i am absolutely convinced that selina sidneys refusal will never be retracted my mother i know is of that opinion you suggested that if i distinguished myself in public life and showed steadiness i might recover her esteem and affection but i see no chance of it my mother showed me her last letter no hopes from that so i think it would be madness or folly to waste my time and wear out my feelings in pursuit of a woman who however amiable is lost to me of that you are the best judge said russell gravely i am far from wishing from urging you to waste your time lady mary vivian must know more of miss sidney and be better able to judge of the state of her heart than i can be it would not be the part of a friend to excite you to persevere in a pursuit that would end in disappointment but this much before we quit the subject for ever i feel it my duty to say that i think miss sidney the woman of all others the best suited to your character the most deserving of your love the most calculated to make you exquisitely and permanently happy all thats very true said vivian impatiently but since i cant have her why make me miserable about her am i to understand resumed russell after a long pause am i to understand that now you have regained your freedom you come here with the settled purpose of espousing the lady sarah lidhurst heaven forfend cried vivian starting back then i am to go over again on this subject with indefatigable patience and in due logical order all the arguments moral prudential and conventional which i had the labour of laying before you about a twelvemonth ago save yourself the trouble my dear friend said vivian i shall set all that upon a right footing immediately by speaking of the report at once to some of the family i was going to rise to explain this morning when i was with lady glastonbury but i felt a sort of delicacy it was an awkward time and at that moment somebody came into the room ay said russell you are just like the hero of a novel stopped from saying what he ought to say by somebodys coming into the room awkward time take care you dont sacrifice yourself at last to these awkwardnesses and this sort of delicacies i have still my fears that you will get into difficulties about lady sarah vivian could not help laughing at what he called his friends absurd fears if you are determined my dear russell at all events to fear for me ill suggest to you a more reasonable cause of dread suppose i should fall desperately in love with lady julia i assure you theres some danger of that she is really very handsome and very graceful uncommonly clever and eloquent as to the rest you know her what is she all that you have said and more she might be made any thing every thing an ornament to her sex an honour to her country were she under the guidance of persons fit to direct great powers and a noble character but yet i cannot vivian as your friend recommend her to you as a wife i am not thinking of her as a wife said vivian i have not had time to think of her at all yet but you said just now that in good hands she might be made every thing that is good and great why not by a husband instead of a governess and would not you call mine good hands good but not steady not at all the husband fit to guide such a woman he must be a man not only of superior sense but of superior strength of mind vivian was piqued by this remark and proceeded to compare the fitness of his character to such a character as lady julias every moment he showed more curiosity to hear further particulars of her disposition of the different characters of her governesses and of all her relations but russell refused to say more he had told him what he was called upon as his friend to reveal he left the rest to vivians own observation and judgment vivian set himself to work to observe and judge with all his might he soon perceived that all russell had told him of the mismanagement of lady julias education was true in this house there were two parties each in extremes and each with their systems and practice carried to the utmost excess the partisans of the old and the new school were here to be seen at daggers drawing lady glastonbury abhorrent of what she termed modern philosophy and classing under that name almost all science and literature especially all attempts to cultivate the understanding of women had with the assistance of her double miss strictland brought up lady sarah in all the ignorance and all the rigidity of the most obsolete of the old school she had made lady sarah precisely like herself with virtue stiff dogmatical and repulsive with religion gloomy and puritanical with manners cold and automatic in the course of eighteen years whilst lady glistonbury went on like clock work the same round punctual to the letter but unfeeling of the spirit of her duties she contrived even by the wearisome method of her minuted diary of education to make her house odious to her husband some task or master or hour of lesson continually and immitigably plagued him he went abroad for amusement and found dissipation thus by her unaccommodating temper and the obstinacy of her manifold virtues she succeeded in alienating the affections of her husband in despair he one day exclaimed ah que de vertus vous me faites har and repelled by virtue in this ungracious form he flew to more attractive vice finding that he could not have any comfort or solace in the society of his wife he sought consolation in the company of a mistress lady glistonbury had in the mean time her consolation in being a pattern wife and in hearing that at card tables it was universally said that lord glistonbury was the worst of husbands and that her ladyship was extremely to be pitied in process of time lord glistonbury was driven to his home again by the united torments of a virago mistress and the gout it was at this period that he formed the notion of being at once a political leader and a mecaenas and it was at this period that he became acquainted with both his daughters and determined that his julia should never resemble the lady sarah he saw his own genius in julia and he resolved as he said to give her fair play and to make her one of the wonders of the age after some months counteraction and altercation lord glistonbury with a high hand took his daughter from under the control of miss strictland and in spite of all the representations prophecies and denunciations of her mother consigned julia to the care of a governess after his own heart a miss bateman or as he called her the rosamunda from the moment this lady was introduced into the family there was an irreconcileable breach between the husband and wife lady glistonbury was perfectly in the right in her dread of such a governess as miss bateman for her daughter her ladyship was only partially and accidentally right right in point of fact but wrong in the general principle for she objected to miss bateman as being of the class of literary women to her real faults her inordinate love of admiration and romantic imprudence lady glistonbury did not object because she did not at first know them and when she did she considered them but as necessary consequences of the cultivation and enlargement of miss batemans understanding no wonder her ladyship would say i knew it must be so i knew it could not be otherwise all those clever women as they are called are the same this comes of literature and literary ladies thus moralizing in private with miss strictland and her own small party lady glistonbury appeared silent and passive before her husband and his adherents after prophesying how it all must end in the ruin of her daughter julia she declared that she would never speak on this subject again she showed herself ready with maternal resignation and in silent obduracy to witness the completion of the sacrifice of her devoted child lord glistonbury was quite satisfied with having silenced opposition his new governess established in her office and with full and unlimited powers went on triumphant and careless of her charge she thought of little but displaying her own talents in company the castle was consequently filled with crowds of amateurs novels and plays were the order of the day and a theatre was fitted up all in open defiance of poor lady glistonbury the daughter commenced her new course of education by being taught to laugh at her mothers prejudices such was the state of affairs when vivian commenced his observations and all this secret history he learnt by scraps and hints and inuendoes from very particular friends of both parties friends who were not troubled with any of mr russells scruples or discretion vivians attention was now fixed upon lady julia he observed with satisfaction that notwithstanding her governesss example and excitement lady julia did not show any exorbitant desire for general admiration and that her manners were free from coquetry and affectation she seemed rather to disdain the flattery and to avoid both the homage and the company of men who were her inferiors in mental qualifications she addressed her conversation principally to vivian and his friend russell with them indeed she conversed a great deal with much eagerness and enthusiasm expressing all her opinions without disguise and showing on most occasions more imagination than reason and more feeling than judgment vivian perceived that it was soon suspected by many of their observers and especially by lady glistonbury and the lady sarah that julia had a design upon his heart but he plainly discerned that she had no design whatever to captivate him and that though she gave him so large a share of her company it was without thinking of him as a lover he saw that she conversed with him and mr russell preferably to others because they spoke on subjects which interested her more and because they drew out her brother of whom she was very fond her being capable at so early an age to appreciate russells character and talents her preferring his solid sense and his plain sincerity to the brilliancy the fashion and even the gallantry of all the men whom her father had now collected round her appeared to vivian the most unequivocal proof of the superiority of her understanding and of the goodness of her disposition on various occasions he marked with delight the deference she paid to his friends opinion and the readiness with which she listened to reason from him albeit unused and averse from reason in general impatient as she was of control and confident both in her own powers and in her instinctive moral sense about which by the bye she talked a great deal of eloquent nonsense yet a word or a look from mr russell would reclaim her in her highest flights soon after vivian commenced his observations upon this interesting subject he saw an instance of what russell had told him of the ease with which lady julia might be guided by a man of sense and strength of mind the tragedy of the fair penitent calista by miss bateman was represented with vast applause to a brilliant audience at the glistonbury theatre the same play was to be reacted a week afterwards to a fresh audience it was proposed that vivian should play lothario and that lady julia should play calista miss bateman saw no objection to this proposal lord glistonbury might perhaps have had the parental prudence to object to his daughters appearing in public at her age in such a character before a mixed audience but unfortunately lady glistonbury bursting from her silence at this critical moment said so much and in such a prosing and puritanical manner not only against her daughters acting in this play and in these circumstances but against all stage plays playwrights actors and actresses whatsoever denouncing and anathematizing them all indiscriminately that immediately lord glistonbury laughed miss bateman took fire and it became a trial of power between the contending parties lady julia who had but lately escaped from the irksomeness of her mothers injudicious and minute control dreaded above all things to be again subjected to her and miss strictland therefore without considering the real propriety or impropriety of the point in question without examining whether miss bateman was right or wrong in the licence she had granted lady julia supported her opinion warmly and with all her eloquence at once asserted her own liberty and defended the cause of the theatre in general she had heard mr russell once speak of the utility of a well regulated public stage of the influence of good theatric representations in forming the taste and rousing the soul to virtue he had shown her marmontels celebrated letter to rousseau on this subject consequently she thought she knew what his opinion must be on the present occasion therefore she spoke with more than her usual confidence and enthusiasm her eloquence and her abilities transported her father and most of her auditors vivian among the rest with astonishment and admiration she enjoyed at this moment what the french call un grand succs but in the midst of the buzz of applause vivian observed that her eye turned anxiously upon russell who stood silent and with a disapproving countenance i am sure your friend mr russell is displeased at this instant and with me i must know why let us ask him do bring him here immediately she disengaged herself from all her admirers and making room for mr russell beside her waited as she said to hear from him ses vrits russell would have declined speaking but her ladyship appealed earnestly and urgently for his opinion saying who will speak the truth to me if you will not on whose judgment can i rely if not on yours you direct my brothers mind to every thing that is wise and good direct mine i am as desirous to do right as he can be and you will find me self willed and volatile as i know you think me you will find me a docile pupil then tell me frankly did i just now speak too much or too warmly i thought i was speaking your sentiments and that i must be right but perhaps it was not right for a woman or so young a woman as i am to support even just opinions so resolutely and yet is it a crime to be young and is the honour of maintaining truth to be monopolized by age no surely for mr russell himself has not that claim to stand forth as he so often does in its defence if you think that i ought not to act calista if you think that i had better not appear on the stage at all only say so all i ask is your opinion the advantage of your judgment and you see mr vivian how difficult it is to obtain it but his friend probably never felt this difficulty with a degree of sober composure which almost provoked vivian mr russell answered this animated lady and with a sincerity which though politely shown vivian thought severe and almost cruel russell acknowledged that her ladyship had anticipated some but not all of his objections he represented that she had failed in becoming respect to her mother in thus publicly attacking and opposing her opinions even supposing them to be ill founded and declared that as to the case in discussion he was entirely of lady glistonburys opinion that it would be unfit and injurious to a young lady to exhibit herself even on a private stage in the character in which it had been proposed that lady julia should appear whilst russell spoke vivian was charmed with the manner in which lady julia listened he thought her countenance enchantingly beautiful alternately softened as it was by the expression of genuine humility and radiant with candour and gratitude she made no reply but immediately went to her mother and in the most engaging manner acknowledged that she had been wrong and declared that she was convinced it would be improper for her to act the character she had proposed with that cold haughtiness of mien the most repulsive to a warm and generous mind the mother turned to her daughter and said that for her part she had no faith in sudden conversions and starts of good conduct made little impression upon her that as far as she was herself concerned she forgave as in charity it became her all the undutiful insolence with which she had been treated that as to the rest she was glad to find for lady julias own sake that she had given up her strange and as she must say scandalous intentions however added lady glistonbury i am not so sanguine as to consider this as any thing but a respite from ruin i am not so credulous as to believe in sudden reformations nor despicable as you and my lord do me the honour to think my understanding am i to be made the dupe of a little deceitful fondling julia withdrew her arms which she had thrown round her mother and miss strictland after breaking her netting silk with a jerk of indignation observed that for her part she wondered young ladies should go to consult their brothers tutor instead of more suitable and perhaps as competent advisers lady julia now indignant turned away and was withdrawing from before the triumvirate when lady sarah who had sat looking even more stiff and constrained than usual suddenly broke from her stony state and springing forward exclaimed stay julia stay my dear sister oh miss strictland do my sister justice when julia is so candid so eager to do right intercede for her with my mother first may i presume to ask said miss strictland drawing herself up with starch malice first may i presume to ask whether mr vivian upon this occasion declined to act lothario miss strictland you do not do my sister justice cried lady sarah miss strictland you are wrong very wrong miss strictland for a moment struck dumb with astonishment opening her eyes as far as they could open stared at lady sarah and after a pause exclaimed lady sarah i protest i never saw any thing that surprised me so much in my whole life wrong very wrong i my lady glistonbury i trust your ladyship lady glistonbury at this instant showed by a little involuntary shake of her head that she was inwardly perturbed lady sarah throwing herself upon her knees before her mother exclaimed oh madam mother forgive me if i failed in respect to miss strictland but my sister my sister rise sarah rise said lady glistonbury that is not a fit attitude and you are wrong very wrong to fail in respect to miss strictland my second self sarah lady julia lidhurst it is you who are the cause of this the only failure of duty your sister ever was guilty of towards me in the whole course of her life i beg of you to withdraw and leave me my daughter sarah at least i have found a sister and when i most wanted it said lady julia i always suspected you loved me but i never knew how much till this moment added she turning to embrace her sister but lady sarah had now resumed her stony appearance and standing motionless received her sisters embrace without sign of life or feeling lady julia lidhurst said miss strictland you humble yourself in vain i think your mother my lady glistonbury requested of you to leave your sister lady sarah to us and to her duty duty repeated lady julia her eyes flashing indignation is this what you call duty never will i humble myself before you again i will leave you i do leave you now and for ever duty she withdrew and thus was lost one of the fairest occasions of confirming a young and candid mind in prudent and excellent dispositions after humbling herself in vain before a mother this poor young lady was now to withstand a fathers reproaches and after the inexorable miss strictland she was to encounter the exasperated miss bateman whether the gorgon terrors of one governess or the fury passions of the other were most formidable it was difficult to decide miss bateman had written an epilogue for lady julia to recite in the character of calista and with the combined irritability of authoress and governess she was enraged at the idea of her pupils declining to repeat these favourite lines lord glistonbury cared not for the lines but considering his own authority to be impeached by his daughters resistance he treated his julia as a traitor to his cause and a rebel to his party but lady julia was resolute in declining to play calista and vivian admired the spirit and steadiness of her resistance to the solicitations and the flattery with which she was assailed by the numerous hangers on of the family and by the amateurs assembled at glistonbury russell who knew the warmth of her temper however dreaded that she should pass the bounds of propriety in the contest with her father and her governess and he almost repented having given any advice upon the subject the contest happily terminated in lord glistonburys having a violent fit of the gout which as the newspapers informed the public ended for the season the christmas hospitalities and theatrical festivities at glistonbury castle whilst his lordship suffered this fit of torture his daughter julia attended him with so much patience and affection that he forgave her for not being willing to be calista and upon his recovery he announced to miss bateman that it was his will and pleasure that his daughter julia should do as she liked on this point but that he desired it to be understood that this was no concession to lady glistonburys prejudices but an act of his own pure grace to celebrate his recovery his lordship determined to give a ball and miss bateman persuaded him to make it a fancy ball in this family unfortunately every occurrence even every proposal of amusement became a subject of dispute and a source of misery lady glistonbury as soon as her lord announced his intention of giving this fancy ball declined taking the direction of an entertainment which approached she said too near to the nature of a masquerade to meet her ideas of propriety lord glistonbury laughed and tried the powers of ridicule and wit but on thimpassive ice the lightnings playd the ladys cool obstinacy was fully a match for her lords petulance to all he could urge she repeated that such entertainments did not meet her ideas of propriety her ladyship lady sarah and miss strictland consequently declared it to be their resolution to appear in their own proper characters and their own proper dresses and no others these three rigid seceders excepted all the world at glistonbury castle and within its sphere of attraction were occupied with preparations for this ball miss bateman was quite in her element flattered and flattering consulting and consulted in the midst of novels plays and poetry prints and pictures searching for appropriate characters and dresses this preceptress seemed to think and to expect that others should deem her office of governess merely a subordinate part of her business she considered her having accepted of the superintendence of the education of lady julia lidhurst as a prodigious condescension on her part and a derogation from her rank and pretensions in the literary and fashionable world a peculiar and sentimental favour to lord glistonbury of which his lordship was bound in honour to show his sense by treating her as a member of his family not only with distinguished politeness but by deferring to her opinion in all things so as to prove to her satisfaction that she was considered only as a friend and not at all as a governess thus she was raised as much above that station in the family in which she could be useful as governesses in other houses have been sometimes depressed below their proper rank upon this as upon all occasions miss bateman was the first person to be thought of her character and her dress were the primary points to be determined and they were points of no easy decision she having proposed for herself no less than five characters the fair rosamond joan of arc cleopatra sigismunda and circe after minute consideration of the dresses which at a fancy ball were to constitute these characters fair rosamond was rejected because the old english dress muffled up the person too much joan of arc would find her armour inconvenient for dancing cleopatras diadem and royal purple would certainly be truly becoming but then her regal length of train was as inadmissible in a dancing dress as joan of arcs armour between sigismunda and circe miss batemans choice long vibrated the spanish and the grecian costume had each its claims on her favour for she was assured they both became her remarkably vivian was admitted to the consultation he was informed that there must be both a circe and a sigismunda and that lady julia was to take whichever of the two characters miss bateman declined pending the deliberation lady julia whispered to vivian for mercys sake contrive that i may not be doomed to be circe for circe is no better than calista vivian was charmed with her ladyships delicacy and discretion he immediately decided her governess by pointing out the beautiful head dress of flaxmans circe and observing that miss batemans hair which was a wig might easily be arranged so as to produce the same effect lady julia rewarded vivian for this able and successful manoeuvre by one of her sweetest smiles her smiles had now powerful influence over his heart he rebelled against russells advice to take more time to consider how far his character was suited to hers he was conscious indeed that it would be more prudent to wait a little longer before he should declare his passion as lady julia was so very young and enthusiastic and as her education had been so ill managed but he argued that the worse her education and the more imprudent the people about her the greater was her merit in conducting herself with discretion and in trying to restrain her natural enthusiasm russell acknowledged this and gave all due praise to lady julia yet still he represented that vivian had been acquainted with her so short time that he could not be a competent judge of her temper and disposition even if his judgment were cool but it was evident that his passions were now engaged warmly in her favour all that russell urged for delay so far operated however upon vivian that he adopted a half measure and determined to try what chance he might have of pleasing her before he should either declare his love to her ladyship or make his proposal to her father a favourable opportunity soon occurred on the day appointed for the fancy ball the young lord lidhurst who was to be tancred was taken ill of a feverish complaint he was of a very weakly constitution and his friends were much alarmed by his frequent indispositions his physicians ordered quiet he was confined to his own apartment and another tancred was of course to be sought for vivian ventured to offer to assume the character and his manner when he made this proposal to his fair sigismunda though it was intended to be merely polite and gallant was so much agitated that she now for the first time seemed to perceive the state of his heart colouring high her ladyship answered with hesitation unusual to her that she believed she fancied that is she understood from her brother that he had deputed mr russell to represent tancred in his place vivian was not displeased by this answer the change of colour and evident embarrassment appeared to him favourable omens and he thought that whether the embarrassment arose from unwillingness to let any man but her brothers tutor a man domesticated in the family appear as her tancred or whether she was afraid of offending mr russell by changing the arrangement her brother had made in either case vivian felt ready though a man in love to approve of her motives as to the rest he was certain that russell would decline the part assigned him and as vivian expected russell came in a few minutes to resign his pretensions or rather to state that though lord lidhurst had proposed it he had never thought of accepting the honour and that he should in all probability not appear at the ball because he was anxious to stay as much as possible with lord lidhurst whose indisposition increased instead of abating lord glistonbury after this explanation came in high spirits and with much satisfaction in his countenance and manner said he was happy to hear that his sigismunda was to have mr vivian for her tancred so far all was prosperous to our heros hopes but when he saw lady julia again which was not till dinner time he perceived an unfavourable alteration in her manner not the timidity or embarrassment of a girl who is uncertain whether she is or is not pleased or whether she should or should not appear to be pleased by the first approaches of a new lover but there was in her manner a decided haughtiness and an unusual air of displeasure and reserve though he sat beside her and though in general her delightful conversation had been addressed either to him or mr russell they were now both deprived of this honour whatever she said and all she said was unlike herself was directed to persons opposite to her even to the captain the lawyer and the family parasites whose existence she commonly seemed to forget she ate as well as spoke in a hurried manner and as if in defiance of her feelings whilst the courses were changing she turned towards mr vivian and after a rapid examining glance at his countenance she said in a low voice you must think me mr vivian very unreasonable and whimsical but i have given up all thoughts of being sigismunda will you oblige me so far as not to appear in the dress of tancred to night you will thus spare me all farther difficulty you know my mother and sister have declared their determination not to wear any fancy dress and though my father is anxious that i should i believe it may be best that in this instance i follow my own judgment may i expect that you will oblige me vivian declared his entire submission to her ladyships judgment and he now was delighted to be able to forgive her for all seeming caprice because he thought he saw an amiable motive for her conduct the wish not to displease her mother and not to excite the jealousy of her sister the hour when the ball was to commence arrived the room filled with company and vivian who flattered himself with the pleasure of dancing all night with lady julia as the price of his prompt obedience looked round the room in search of his expected partner but he searched in vain he looked to the door at every new entrance no lady julia appeared circe indeed was every where to be seen and heard and an uglier circe never touched this earth but she looked happily confident in the power of her charms whilst she was intent upon fascinating vivian he was impatiently waiting for a moments intermission of her volubility that he might ask what had become of lady julia lady julia shes somewhere in the room i suppose oh no i remember she told me she would go and sit a quarter of an hour with her brother she will soon make her appearance i suppose but i am so angry with her for disappointing us all and you in particular by changing her mind about sigismunda such a capital tancred as you would have made and now you are no character at all but then you are only on a par with certain ladies comfort yourself with the great popes i fear too true reflection that most women have no characters at all miss batemans eye glanced insolently as she spoke upon lady glistonburys trio who passed by at this instant all without fancy dresses vivian shocked by this ill breeding towards the mistress of the house offered his arm immediately to lady glistonbury and conducted her with lady sarah and miss strictland to their proper places where having seated themselves each in the same attitude precisely they looked more like martyrs prepared for endurance than like persons in a ball room vivian stayed to speak a few words to lady glistonbury and was just going away when her ladyship addressing him with more than her usual formality said mr vivian i see has not adopted the fashion of the day and as he is the only gentleman present whose fancy dress does not proclaim him engaged to some partner equally fanciful i cannot but wish that my daughter lady sarah should if she dance at all to night dance with a gentleman in his own proper character vivian thus called upon felt compelled to ask the honour of lady sarahs hand but he flattered himself that after the first dance he should have done his duty and that he should be at liberty by the time julia should make her appearance but to his great disappointment mr russell who came in just as he had finished the first two dances informed him that lady julia was determined not to appear at the ball but to stay with her brother who wished for her company so poor vivian found himself doomed to be lady sarahs partner for the remainder of the night it happened that as he was handing her ladyship to supper in passing through an antechamber where some of the neighbours of inferior rank had been permitted to assemble to see the show he heard one farmers wife say to another who beas that there thats handing of lady sarah they were detained a little by the crowd so that he had time to hear the whole answer dont you know was the answer that there gentleman is mr vivian of the new castle that is to be married to her directly and thats what hes come here for for theyve been engaged to one another ever since the time o the election this speech disturbed our heros mind considerably for it awakened a train of reflections which he had wilfully left dormant will it can it be believed that after all his friend russells exhortations after his own wise resolutions he had never yet made any of those explanatory speeches he had intended positively said he to himself this report shall not prevail four and twenty hours longer i will propose for lady julia lidhurst before i sleep russell to be sure advises me not to be precipitate to take more time to study her disposition but i am acquainted with her sufficiently he should have said i am in love with her sufficiently and really now i am bound in honour immediately to declare myself it is the best possible way of putting a stop to a report which will be ultimately injurious to lady sarah thus vivian made his past irresolution an excuse for his present precipitation flattering himself as men often do when they are yielding to the impulse of their passions that they are submitting to the dictates of reason at six oclock in the morning the company dispersed lord glistonbury and vivian were the last in the ball room his lordship began some raillery upon our heros having declined appearing as tancred and upon his having devoted himself all night to lady sarah vivian seized the moment to explain his real feelings and he made his proposal for lady julia it was received with warm approbation by the father who seemed to rejoice the more in this proposal because he knew that it would disappoint and mortify lady glistonbury the interests of his hatred seemed indeed to occupy his lordship more than the interests of vivians love but politeness threw a decent veil over these feelings and after saying all that could be expected of the satisfaction it must be to a father to see his daughter united to a man of mr vivians family fortune talents and great respectability and after having given incidentally and parenthetically his opinions not only concerning matrimony but concerning all other affairs of human life he wished his future son in law a very good night and left him to repose but no rest could vivian take he waited with impatience that made every hour appear at least two for the time when he was again to meet lady julia he saw her at breakfast but he perceived by her countenance that she as yet knew nothing of his proposal after breakfast lord glistonbury said come with me my little julia it is a long time since ive had a walk and a talk with you his lordship paced up and down the terrace conversing earnestly with her for some time he then went on to some labourers who were cutting down a tree at the farther end of the avenue vivian hastened out to meet lady julia who after standing deep in thought for some moments seemed returning towards the castle chapter ix mr vivian i trust that i am not deficient in maidenly modesty said lady julia when it is not incompatible with what i deem a higher virtue sincerity now and ever frankness is and shall be my only policy the confidence i am about to repose in you sir is the strongest proof of my esteem and of the gratitude i feel for your attachment my heart is no longer in my power to bestow it is young as i am i dare to pronounce the words irrevocably fixed upon one who will do honour to my choice your proposal was made to my father why was it not made to me men all men but one treat women as puppets and then wonder that they are not rational creatures forgive me this too just reproach but as i was going to say your proposal has thrown me into great difficulties the greater because my father warmly approves of it i have a strong affection for him and perhaps a year or two ago i should in the ignorance in which i was dogmatically brought up have thought it my duty to submit implicitly to parental authority and to receive a husband from the hands of a father without consulting either my own heart or my own judgment but since my mind has been more enlightened and has opened to higher views of the dignity of my sex and higher hopes of happiness my ideas of duty have altered and i trust i have sufficient courage to support my own idea of the rights of my sex and my firm conviction of what is just and becoming vivian was again going to say something but whether against or in favour of the rights of the sex he had not clearly decided when her ladyship saved him the trouble by proceeding with the train of her ideas my sincerity towards my father will perhaps cost me dear but i cannot repent of it as soon as i knew the state of my own heart which was not till very lately which was not indeed till you gave me reason to think you seriously liked me i openly told my father all i knew of my own heart would you believe it i am sure i should not unless i had seen and felt it my father who you know professes the most liberal opinions possible my father who in conversation is all for love and the world well lost my father who let miss bateman put the heloise into my hands was astonished shocked indignant at his own daughters confession i should say assertion of her preference of a man of high merit who wants only the advantages if they be advantages of rank and fortune mr vivian continued she may i hope that now when you must be convinced of the inefficacy of any attempt either to win or to control my affections you will have the generosity to spare me all unnecessary contest with my father it must render him more averse from the only union that can make his daughter happy and it may ruin the fortunes of the first in my opinion of human beings i will request another favour from you and let my willingness to be obliged by you convince you that i appreciate your character i request that you will not only keep secret all that i have said to you but that if accident or your own penetration should hereafter discover to you the object of my affection you will refrain from making any use of that discovery to my disadvantage you see how entirely i have thrown myself on your honour and generosity vivian assured her that the appeal was powerful with him and that by mastering his own passions and sacrificing his feelings to hers he would endeavour to show his strong desire to secure at all events her happiness you are truly generous mr vivian to listen to me with indulgence to wish for my happiness whilst i have been wounding your feelings but without any impeachment of your sincerity or yet of your sensibility let me say that yours will be only a transient disappointment your acquaintance with me is but of yesterday and the slight impression made on your mind will soon be effaced but upon my mind there has been time to grave a deep a first charactery of love that never whilst memory holds her seat can be erased i believe said julia checking herself whilst a sudden blush overspread her countenance i am afraid that i have said too much too much for a woman the fault of my character i know i have been told is the want of what is called reserve blushing still more deeply as she pronounced these last words the colour darting up to her temples spreading over her neck and making its way to the very tips of her fingers now i have done worse cried she covering her face with her hands but the next moment resuming or trying to resume her self possession she said it is time that i should retire now that i have revealed my whole heart to you it has perhaps been imprudently opened but for that your generosity sir is to blame had you shown more selfishness i should assuredly have exerted more prudence and have treated you with less confidence lady julia quitted him and vivian remained in a species of amaze from which he could not immediately recover her frankness her magnanimity her enthusiastic sensibility her eloquent beauty had altogether exalted to the highest ecstasy his love and admiration then he walked about beating his breast in despair at the thought of her affections being irrecoverably engaged next quarrelled with the boldness of the confession the assertion of her love then decided that with all her shining qualities and noble dispositions she was not exactly the woman a man should desire for a wife there was something too rash too romantic about her there was in her character as she herself had said and as russell had remarked too little reserve something like jealousy and distrust of his friend arose in vivians mind what said he to himself and is russell my rival and has he been all this time in secret my rival is it possible that russell has been practising upon the affections of this innocent young creature confided to him too all this time whilst he has been cautioning me against her charms beseeching me not to propose for her precipitately is it possible that he wanted only to get to keep the start of me no impossible utterly impossible if all the circumstances all the evidence upon earth conspired i would not believe it resolved not to do injustice even in his inmost soul to his friend our hero repelled all suspicion of russell by reflecting on his long and tried integrity and on the warmth and fidelity of his friendship in this temper he was crossing the castle yard to go to russells apartment when he was met and stopped by one of the domesticated friends of the family mr mainwaring the young lawyer he was in the confidence of lord glistonbury and proud to show it he let mr vivian know that he was apprised of the proposal that had been made and congratulated him and all the parties concerned on the prospect of such an agreeable connexion vivian was quite unprepared to speak to any one much less to a lawyer upon this subject he had not even thought of the means of obeying lady julia by withdrawing his suit therefore with a mixture of vexation and embarrassment in his manner he answered in commonplace phrases meant to convey no precise meaning and endeavoured to disengage himself from his companion but the lawyer who had fastened upon him linking his arm in vivians continued to walk him up and down under the great gateway saying that he had a word or two of importance for his private ear this man had taken much pains to insinuate himself into vivians favour by the most obsequious and officious attentions though his flattery had at first been disgusting yet by persevering in his show of civility he had at length inclined vivian to think that he was too harsh in his first judgment and to believe that after all mainwaring was a good friendly fellow though his manner was against him mr mainwaring with many professions of regard for vivian and with sundry premisings that he hazarded himself by the communication took the liberty of hinting that he guessed from mr vivians manner this morning that obstacles had arisen on the part of a young lady who should be nameless and he should make bold to add that in his private opinion the said obstacles would never be removed whilst a certain person remained in the castle and whilst the young lady alluded to was allowed to spend so much of her time studying with her brother when well or nursing him when sick mr mainwaring declared that he was perfectly astonished at lord glistonburys blindness or imprudence in keeping this person in the house after the hints his lordship had received and after all the proofs that must or may have fallen within his cognizance of the arts of seduction that had been employed here vivian interrupted mr mainwaring to beg that he would not keep him longer in suspense by inuendoes but that he would name distinctly the object of his suspicions this however mr mainwaring begged to be excused from doing he would only shake his head and smile and leave people to their own sagacity and penetration vivian warmly answered that if mr mainwaring meant mr russell he was well assured that mr mainwaring was utterly mistaken in attributing to him any but the most honourable conduct mr mainwaring smiled and shook his head smiled again and sighed and hoped mr vivian was right and observed that time would show and that at all events he trusted mr vivian would keep profoundly secret the hint which his friendship had indiscreetly perhaps hazarded scarcely had mr mainwaring retired when captain pickering met and seized upon vivian led to the same subject and gave similar hints that russell was the happy rival who had secretly made himself master of lady julias heart vivian though much astonished finding that these gentlemen agreed in their discoveries or their suspicions still defended his friend russell and strongly protested that he would be responsible for his honour with his life if it were necessary the captain shrugged his shoulders said it was none of his business that as mr vivian took it up so warmly he should let it drop for it was by no means his intention to get into a quarrel with mr vivian for whom he had a particular regard this said with all the frankness of a soldier captain pickering withdrew adding as the clergyman passed at this instant theres a man who could tell you more than any of us if he would but snugs the word with wicksted vivian in great anxiety and much curiosity appealed to mr wicksted he protested that he knew nothing suspected nothing at least could venture to say nothing for these were very delicate family matters and every gentleman should on these occasions make it a principle to see with his own eyes gradually however mr wicksted let out his opinion and implied infinitely more than captain pickering or mr mainwaring had asserted vivian still maintained in the warmest terms that it was impossible his friend russell should be to blame mr wicksted simply pronounced the word friend with a peculiar emphasis and with an incredulous smile left him to his reflections those reflections were painful for though he defended russell from the attacks of others yet he had not sufficient firmness of mind completely to resist the suggestions of suspicion and jealousy particularly when they had been corroborated by so many concurring testimonies he had no longer the courage to go immediately to russell to tell him of his proposal for lady julia or to speak to him of any of his secret feelings but turning away from the staircase that led to his friends apartment he determined to observe russell with his own eyes before he should decide upon the truth or falsehood of the accusations which had been brought against him alas vivian was no longer in a condition to observe with his own eyes his imagination was so perturbed that he could neither see nor hear any thing as it really was when he next saw russell and lady julia together he wondered at his blindness in not having sooner perceived their mutual attachment notwithstanding that lady julia had now the strongest motives to suppress every indication of her passion symptoms of it broke out continually the more violent perhaps from her endeavours to conceal them he knew that she was passionately in love with russell and that russell should not have perceived what every other man even every indifferent spectator had discovered appeared incredible russells calm manner and entire self possession sometimes provoked vivian and sometimes quelled his suspicions sometimes he looked upon this calmness as the extreme of art sometimes as a proof of innocence which could not be counterfeit at one moment he was so much struck with russells friendly countenance that quite ashamed of his suspicions he was upon the point of speaking openly to him but unfortunately these intentions were frustrated by some slight obstacle at length miss strictland who had lately been very courteous to mr vivian took an opportunity of drawing him into one of the recessed windows where with infinite difficulty in bringing herself to speak on such a subject after inconceivable bridlings of the head and contortions of every muscle of her neck she insinuated to him her fears that my lord glistonburys confidence had been very ill placed in lord lidhursts tutor she was aware that mr russell had the honour of mr vivians friendship but nothing could prevent her from speaking where she felt it to be so much her duty and that as from the unfortunate circumstances in the family she had no longer any influence over lady julia lidhurst nor any chance of being listened to on such a subject with patience by lord glistonbury she thought the best course she could take was to apply to mr russells friend who might possibly by his interference prevent the utter disgrace and ruin of one branch of a noble family miss strictland in all she said hinted not at vivians attachment to lady julia and gave him no reason to believe that she was apprised of his having proposed for her ladyship she spoke with much moderation and candour attributed all lady julias errors to the imprudence of her new governess miss bateman miss strictland now showed a desire not to make but to prevent mischief even the circumlocutions and stiffness of her habitual prudery did not on this occasion seem unseasonable therefore what she suggested made a great impression on vivian he still however defended russell and assured miss strictland that from the long experience he had himself had of his friends honour he was convinced that no temptation could shake his integrity miss strictland had formed her opinion on this point she said and it would be in vain to argue against it every new assertion the belief of each new person who spoke to him on the subject the combination the coincidence of all their opinions wrought his mind to such a height of jealousy that he was now absolutely incapable of using his reason he went in search of russell but in no fit mood to speak to him as he ought he looked for him in his own in lord lidhursts apartment in every sitting room in the castle but mr russell was not to be found at last lady sarahs maid who heard him inquiring for mr russell from the servants told him she fancied that if he took the trouble to go to the west walk he might find mr russell as that was a favourite walk of his vivian hurried thither with a secret expectation of finding lady julia with him there they both were in earnest conversation as he approached the trees concealed him from view and vivian heard his own name repeated stop cried he advancing let me not overhear your secrets i am not a traitor to my friends as he spoke his eyes fixed with an expression of concentrated rage upon russell terrified by vivians sudden appearance and strange address and still more by the fierce look he cast on russell lady julia started and uttered a faint scream with astonishment but without losing his self command russell advanced towards vivian saying you are out of your senses my dear friend i will not listen to you in your present humour take a turn or two with me to cool yourself the anger of a friend should always be allowed three minutes grace at least added russell smiling and endeavouring to draw vivian away but vivian stood immoveable russells calmness instead of bringing him to his senses only increased his anger to his distempered imagination this coolness seemed perfidious dissimulation you cannot deceive me longer mr russell by all your art cried he though i am the last to open my eyes i have opened them why did you pretend to be my counsellor and friend when you were my rival when you knew that you were my successful rival yes start and affect astonishment yes look if you can with innocent surprise upon that lady say that you have not betrayed her fathers confidence say that you have not practised upon her unguarded heart say that you do not know that she loves you to distraction oh mr vivian what have you done cried lady julia she could say no more but fell senseless on the ground vivians anger was at once sobered by this sight what have i done repeated he as they raised her from the ground wretch dishonourable villain that i am i have betrayed her secret but i thought every body knew it is it possible that you did not know it russell russell made no reply but ran to the river which was near them for some water vivian was incapable of affording any assistance or even of forming a distinct idea as soon as lady julia returned to her senses russell withdrew vivian threw himself on his knees before her and said something about the violence of his passion his sorrow and her forgiveness mr vivian said lady julia turning to him with a mixture of despair and dignity in her manner do not kneel to me do not make use of any commonplace phrases i cannot at this moment forgive you you have done me an irreparable injury i confided a secret to you a secret known to no human being but my father and yourself you have revealed it and to whom sooner would i have had it proclaimed to the whole world than to for what is the opinion of the whole world to me compared to his sir you have done me indeed an irremediable injury i trusted to your honour your discretion and you have betrayed sacrificed me vile suspicions cried vivian striking his forehead how could i listen to them for a moment suspicions of mr russell cried julia with a look of high indignation suspicions of your noble minded friend what wickedness or what weakness weakness miserable weakness the sudden effect of jealousy and could you know lady julia by what means by what arts my mind was worked up to this insanity i cannot listen to this now mr vivian interrupted lady julia my thoughts cannot fix upon such things i cannot go back to the past what is done cannot be undone what has been said cannot be unsaid you cannot recall your words they were heard they were understood i beg you to leave me sir that i may have leisure to think if possible to consider what yet remains for me to do i have no friend none none willing or capable of advising me i begged of you to leave me sir vivian could not at this moment decide whether he ought or ought not to tell lady julia that her secret was known or at least suspected by many individuals of the family theres a servant on the terrace who seems to be looking for us said vivian i had something of consequence to say but this man my lady miss bateman desired me to let you know my lady that there is the lady playdels and the colonel and sir james in the drawing room just come and she begs my lady you will be pleased to come to them for miss batemans waiting for you my lady to repeat the verses she bid me say my lady go to them mr vivian i cannot go my lady persisted the footman my lord himself begged you to come and he and all the gentlemen have been looking for you every where return to my father then and say that i am coming immediately forced into company thought lady julia as she walked slowly towards the house compelled to appear calm and gay when my heart is what a life of dissimulation how unworthy of me formed as i was once pronounced to be for every thing that is good and great but i am no longer mistress of myself no soul left but for one object why did i not better guard my heart no rather why can i not follow its dictates and at once avow and justify its choice vivian interrupted lady julias reverie by pointing out to her as they passed along the terrace a group of heads in one of the back windows of the castle that seemed to be watching them very earnestly miss strictlands face was foremost half her body was out of the window and as she drew back they heard her say it is not he it is not he as they passed another front of the castle another party seemed to be upon the watch at a staircase window the lawyer the captain the clergymans heads appeared for a moment and vanished they seem all to be upon the watch for us said vivian meanness cried lady julia to watch or to be watched i know not which is most degrading but i cannot think they are watching us my dear lady julia yet let me call you dear this once my hopes are gone even for your forgiveness i have no right to hope but let me do you one piece of service let me put your open temper on its guard you flatter yourself that the secret you confided to me is not known to any body living but to your father i have reason to believe that it is suspected if not positively known by several other persons in this castle impossible i am certain too certain of what i say lady julia made a sudden stop and after a pause exclaimed then farewell hope and with hope farewell fear my lady my lord sent me again for my lords very impatient for you my lady said the same footman returning lord glistonbury met them in the hall why julia where have you been all this time he began in an imperious tone but seeing mr vivian his brow grew smooth and his voice good humoured instantly ha so so hey well all right all right good girl good girl time for every thing hey mr vivian que la solitude est charmante as voltaire says beg pardon for sending for you but interruption you know prevents ttes ttes on the stage from growing tiresome and the stage they say holds the mirror up to nature but theres no nature now left to hold the mirror up to except in a few odd instances as in my julia here where so fast my blushing darling i thought you wished sir that i should go to lady playdel and sir james ay ay i sent for you to repeat those charming verses for them that i could not clearly remember go up go up well follow you we have a word or two to say about something thats nothing to you lord glistonbury kept vivian for a full hour in a state of considerable embarrassment talking to him of lady julia implying that she was favourably disposed towards him but that she had a little pride that might make her affect the contrary at first then came a disquisition on pride with quotations and commonplaces then an eulogium by his lordship on his lordships own knowledge of the human heart and more especially of that moving toyshop the female heart then anecdotes illustrative comprising the gallantries of thirty years in various ranks of life with suitable bon mots and embellishments then a little french sentiment by way of moral with some philosophical axioms to show that though he had led such a gay life he had been a deep thinker and that though nobody could have thought that he had had time for reading his genius had supplied him he could not himself really tell how with what other people with the study of years could not master all which vivian was compelled to hear whilst he was the whole time impatient to get away that he might search for mr russell with whom he was anxious to have an explanation but at last when lord glistonbury set him free he was not nearer to his object mr russell he found upon inquiry had not returned to the castle nor did he return to dinner he sent word that he was engaged to dine with a party of gentlemen at a literary club in a country town nine miles distant vivian spent the greatest part of the evening in lord lidhursts apartment expecting russells return but it grew so late that lord lidhurst who was still indisposed went to bed and when vivian quitted his lordship he met russells servant in the gallery who said his master had been come in an hour ago but sir added the man my master wont let you see him i am sure for he would not let me in and he said that if you asked for him i was to answer that he could not see you to night vivian knocked in vain at russells door he could not gain admission so he went reluctantly to bed determined to rise very early that he might see his friend as soon as possible obtain his forgiveness for the past and ask his advice for the future chapter x suspense curiosity love jealousy remorse any one of which is enough to keep a person awake all night by turns agitated poor vivian so violently that for several hours he could not close his eyes but at last when quite exhausted he fell into a profound sleep the first image that came before his mind when he awoke in the morning was that of lady julia his next recollection was of russell is mr russell up yet said vivian to his servant who was bringing in his boots up sir oh yes hours ago he was off at daybreak off cried vivian starting up in his bed off where is he gone i cant say sir yes indeed sir i heard mr russells man say that his master was going post to the north to some old uncle that was taken ill which he heard about at dinner from some of those gentlemen where he dined yesterday but i cant say positively but heres a letter he left for you with me a letter give it me why didnt you give it me sooner why really sir you lay so sound i didnt care to waken you and i was up so late myself too last night leave me now ill ring when i want you to c vivian esq i would not see you after what passed yesterday because i feared that i should not speak to you with temper lest you should misinterpret any thing i have formerly said i must now solemnly assure you that i never had the slightest suspicion of the secret you revealed to me till the moment when it was betrayed by your indiscretion still i can scarcely credit what appears to me so improbable but even under this uncertainty i think it my duty to leave this family had the slightest idea of what you suggested ever crossed my imagination i should then have acted as i do now i say this not to justify myself but to convince you that what i formerly hinted about reserve of manners and prudence was merely a general reflection for my own part i seem to act heroically but i must disclaim that applause to which i am not entitled all powerful as the temptation must appear to you dangerous as it must have been in other circumstances to me i cannot claim any merit for resisting its influence my safety i owe neither to my own prudence or fortitude i must now vivian impart to you a secret which you are at liberty to confide where and when you think necessary my heart is and has long been engaged whilst you were attached to miss sidney i endeavoured to subdue my love for her and every symptom of it was i hope and believe suppressed this declaration cannot now give you any pain except so far as it may perhaps excite in your mind some remorse for having unwarrantably unworthily and weakly suffered yourself to feel suspicions of a true friend well as i know the infirmity of your character and willing as i have always been to make allowance for a fault which i thought time and experience would correct i was not prepared for this last stroke i never thought your weakness of mind would have shown itself in suspicion of your best your long tried friend but i am at last convinced that your mind is not strong enough for confidence and friendship i pity but i see that i can no longer serve and i feel that i can no longer esteem you farewell vivian may you find a friend who will supply to you the place of h russell vivian knew russells character too well to flatter himself that the latter part of this letter was written in anger that would quickly subside from the tone of the letter he felt that russell was deeply offended in the whole course of his life he had depended on russells friendship as a solid blessing of which he could never be deprived by any change of circumstances by any possible chance in human affairs and now to have lost such a friend by his own folly by his own weakness was a misfortune of which he could hardly believe the reality at the same moment too he learned how nobly russell had behaved towards him in the most trying situation in which the human heart can be placed russells love for selina sidney vivian had never till this instant suspected what force what command of mind what magnanimity what a generous friend he has ever been to me and i poor vivian always sinning and always penitent was so much absorbed by sorrow for the loss of russells friendship that he could not for some time think even of the interests of his love or consider the advantage which he might derive from the absence of his rival and from that rivals explicit declaration that his affections were irrevocably engaged by degrees these ideas rose clearly to vivians view his hopes revived lady julia would see the absolute impossibility of russells returning or of his accepting her affection her good sense her pride would in time subdue this hopeless passion and vivian was generous enough or sufficiently in love to feel that the value of her heart would not be diminished but rather increased in his opinion by the sensibility she had shown to the talents and virtues of his friend his friend vivian ventured now to call him for with the hopes of love the hopes of friendship rose all may yet be well said he to himself russell will forgive me when he hears how i was worked upon by those parasites and prudish busybodies who infused their vile suspicions into my mind weak as it is i never will allow that it is incapable of confidence or of friendship no russell will retract that harsh sentence when he is happy as i am sure i ardently hope he will be in selinas love he will restore me to his favour without his friendship i could not be satisfied with myself or happy in the full accomplishment of all my other fondest hopes by the time that hope had thus revived and renovated our heros soul by the time that his views of things had totally changed and that the colour of his future destiny had turned from black to white from all gloom to all sunshine the minute hand of the clock had moved with unfeeling regularity or in plain unmeasured prose it was now eleven oclock and three times vivian had been warned that breakfast was ready when he entered the room the first thing he heard as usual was miss batemans voice who was declaiming upon some sentimental point in all the high sublime of deep absurd vivian little interested in this display and joining neither in the open flattery nor in the secret ridicule with which the gentlemen wits and amateurs listened to the rosamunda looked round for lady julia she breakfasts in her own room this morning whispered lord glistonbury before vivian had even pronounced her ladyships name so said mr pickering we have lost mr russell this morning yes said lord glistonbury he was forced to hurry away to the north i find to an old sick uncle lord lidhurst im afraid will break his heart for want of him cried the lawyer in a tone that might either pass for earnest or irony according to the fancy of the interpreter lord lidhurst did you say cried the captain are you sure you meant lord lidhurst i dont apprehend that a young nobleman ever broke his heart after his tutor but i was going to remark what farther the captain was going to remark can never be known to the world for lord glistonbury so startled him by the loud and rather angry tone in which he called for the cream which stood with the captain that all his few ideas were put to flight mr pickering who noticed lord glistonburys displeasure now resumed the conversation about mr russell in a new tone and the lawyer and he joined in a eulogy upon that gentleman lord glistonbury said not a word but looked embarrassed miss strictland cleared her throat several times and looked infinitely more rigid and mysterious than usual lady glistonbury and lady sarah ditto ditto almost every body except such visitors as were strangers at the castle perceived that there was something extraordinary going on in the family and the gloom and constraint spread so that towards the close of breakfast nothing was uttered by prudent people but awkward sentences about the weather the wind and the likelihood of there being a mail from the continent still through all this regardless and unknowing of it all the rosamunda talked on happily abstracted egotistically secured from the pains of sympathy or of curiosity by the all sufficient power of vanity even her patron lord glistonbury was at last provoked and disgusted he was heard under his breath to pronounce a contemptuous pshaw and as he rose from the breakfast table he whispered to vivian theres a woman now who thinks of nothing living but herself all talke talke i begin to be weary of her gentlemen continued his lordship ive letters to write this morning youll ride youll walk youre for the billiard room i suppose mr vivian i shall find you in my study i hope an hour hence but first i have a little business to settle with evident embarrassment lord glistonbury retired lady glistonbury lady sarah and miss strictland each sighed then with looks of intelligence rose and retired the company separated soon afterwards and went to ride to walk or to the billiard room and vivian to the study to wait there for lord glistonbury and to meditate upon what might be the nature of his lordships business as vivian crossed the gallery the door of lady glistonburys dressing room opened and was shut again instantaneously by miss strictland but not before he saw lady julia kneeling at her fathers feet whilst lady glistonbury and lady sarah were standing like statues on each side of his lordship vivian waited a full hour afterwards in tedious suspense in the study at last he heard doors open and footsteps and he judged that the family council had broken up he laid down a book of which he had read the same page over six times without any one of the words it contained having conveyed a single idea to his mind lord glistonbury came in with papers and parchments in his hands mr vivian i am afraid you have been waiting for me have a thousand pardons to ask i really could not come any sooner i wished to speak to you wont you sit down we had better sit down quietly theres no sort of hurry his lordship however seemed to be in great agitation of spirits and vivian was convinced that his mind must be interested in an extraordinary manner because he did not as was his usual practice digress to fifty impertinent episodes before he came to the point he only blew his nose sundry times and then at once said i wish to speak to you mr vivian about the proposal you did me the honour to make for my daughter julia difficulties have occurred on our side very extraordinary difficulties julia i understand has hinted to you sir the nature of those difficulties oh mr vivian said lord glistonbury suddenly quitting the constrained voice in which he spoke and giving way to his natural feelings you are a man of honour and feeling and a father may trust you heres my girl a charming girl she is but knowing nothing of the world self willed romantic open hearted imprudent beyond conception do not listen to any of the foolish things she says to you you are a man of sense you love her and you are every way suited to her it is the first wish of my heart i tell you frankly to see her your wife then do not let her childish folly persuade you that her affections are engaged dont listen to any such stuff we all know what the first loves of a girl of sixteen must be but its our fault my fault my fault since they will have it so i care not whose fault it is but we have had very improper people about her very very but all may be well yet if you sir will be steady and save her save her from herself i would farther suggest lord glistonbury was going on probably to have weakened by amplification the effect of what he had said when lady julia entered the room and advancing with dignified determination of manner said i have your commands father that i should see mr vivian again i obey that is right that is my darling julia i always knew she would justify my high opinion of her lord glistonbury attempted to draw her towards him fondly but with an unaltered manner that seemed as if she suppressed strong emotion she answered i do not deserve your caresses father do not oppress me with praise that i cannot merit i wish to speak to mr vivian without control and without witness lord glistonbury rose and growing red and almost inarticulate with anger exclaimed remember julia remember lady julia lidhurst that if you say what you said you would say and what i said you should not say i lord glistonbury your father i as well as all the rest of your family utterly disclaim and cast you off for ever youll be a thing without fortune without friends without a name without a being in the world lady julia lidhurst i am well aware of that replied lady julia growing quite pale yet without changing the determination of her countenance or abating any thing from the dignity of her manner i am well aware that on what i am about to do depends my having or my ceasing from this moment to have fortune friends and a father lord glistonbury stood still for a moment fixed his eyes upon her as if he would have read her soul but without seeking to elude his inquiry her countenance seemed to offer itself to his penetration by heaven there is no understanding this girl cried his lordship mr vivian i trust her to your honour to your knowledge of the world to your good sense in short sir to your love and constancy and i sir said lady julia turning to vivian after her father had left the room and looking at vivian so as to stop him short as he approached and to disconcert him in the commencement of a passionate speech and i too sir trust to your honour whilst i deprecate your love imprudent as i was in the first confidence i reposed in you and much as i have suffered by your rashness i now stand determined to reveal to you another yet more important yet more humiliating secret you owe me no gratitude sir i am compelled by the circumstances in which i am placed either to deceive or to trust you i must either become your wife and deceive you most treacherously or i must trust you entirely and tell you why it would be shameful that i should become your wife shameful to me and to you to me impossible cried vivian bursting into some passionate expressions of love and admiration listen to me sir and do not make any of those rash professions of which you will soon repent you think you are speaking to the same lady julia you saw yesterday no you are speaking to a very different person a few hours have made a terrible change you see before you sir one who has been till this day the darling and pride of her father who has lived in the lap of luxury who has been flattered admired by almost all who approached her who had fortune and rank and fair prospects in life and youth and spirits and all the pride of prosperity who had i believe good dispositions perhaps some talents and i may say a generous heart who might have been but that is all over no matter what she might have been she is a tale for evry prating she fallen fallen fallen under the feet of those who worshipped her fallen below the contempt of the contemptible worse worse fallen in her own opinion never to rise again lady julias voice failed and she was forced to pause she sunk upon a seat and hid her face for some moments she neither saw nor heard but at last raising her head she perceived vivian you are in amazement sir and i see you pity me but let me beg of you to restrain your feelings my own are as much as i can bear o that i could recall a few hours of my existence but i have not yet been able to tell you what has passed my father my friends wish to conceal it from you but whatever i have done however low i have sunk i will not deceive nor be an accomplice in deceit from my own lips you shall hear all this morning at daybreak not being able to sleep and having some suspicion that mr russell would leave the castle i rose and whilst i was dressing i heard the trampling of horses in the court i looked out of my window and saw mr russells man saddling his masters horse i heard mr russell a moment afterwards order the servant to take the horses to the great gate on the north road and wait for him there as he intended to walk through the park i thought these were the last words i should ever hear him speak love took possession of me i stole softly down the little staircase that leads from my turret to one of the back doors and got out of the castle as i thought unobserved i hurried on and waited in the great oak wood through which i knew mr russell would pass when i saw him coming nearer and nearer to me i would have given the world to have been in my own room again i hid myself among the trees yet when he walked on in reverie without noticing me taking me probably for one of the servants i could not bear to think that this was the last moment i should ever see him and i exclaimed i know not what but i know that at the sound of my voice mr russell started and never can i forget the look spare me the rest no i will not spare myself i offered my heart my hand and they were rejected in my madness i told him i regarded neither wealth nor rank nor friends nor that i would rather live with him in obscurity than be the greatest princess upon earth i said this and more and i was rejected and even at this moment instead of the vindictive passions which are said to fill the soul of a woman scorned i feel admiration for your noble friend i have not done him justice i cannot repeat his words or describe his manner he persuaded by his eloquence compelled me to return to this castle he took from me all hope he destroyed by one word all my illusions he told me that he loves another he has left me to despair to disgrace and yet i love esteem and admire him above all human beings admire one who despises me is it possible i know not but it is so i have more to tell you sir as i returned to the castle i was watched by miss strictland how she knew all that had passed i cannot divine perhaps it was by means of some spy who followed me and whom i did not perceive for i neither saw nor heard any thing but my passion miss strictland communicated her discovery immediately to my father i have been these last two hours before a family tribunal my mother with a coldness a thousand times worse than my poor fathers rage says that i have only accomplished her prophecies that she always knew and told my father that i should be a disgrace to my family but no reproaches are equal to my own i stand self condemned i feel like one awakened from a dream a few words a single look from mr russell how they have altered all my views all my thoughts two hours reflection two hours did i say whole years a whole existence have passed to me in the last two hours i am a different creature but it is too late too late self esteem is gone happiness is over for me in this world happiness over for you exclaimed vivian in a tone expressive of the deep interest he felt for her self esteem gone no lady julia do not blame yourself so severely for what has passed blame the circumstances in which you have been placed above all blame me blame my folly my madness your secret never would have been known if i had not i thank you interrupted lady julia rising from her seat but no consolation can be of any avail it neither consoles nor justifies me that others have been to blame permit me at least pursued vivian to speak of my own sentiments for one moment permit me to say lady julia that the confidence with which you have just honoured me instead of diminishing my attachment has so raised my admiration for your candour and magnanimity that no obstacles shall vanquish my constancy i will wait respectfully and if i can patiently till time shall have effaced from your mind these painful impressions i shall neither ask nor accept of the interference or influence of your father nor of any of your friends i shall rely solely on the operation of your own excellent understanding and shall hope for my reward from your noble heart you do not think it possible said lady julia looking at vivian with dignified determination you do not think it possible after all that has passed after all that i have told you that i could so far degrade myself or you as to entertain any thoughts of becoming your wife farewell mr vivian you will not see me again i shall obtain permission to retire and live with a relation in a distant part of the country where i shall no more be seen or heard of my fortune will i hope be of use to my sister my poor father i pity him he loves me he loses his daughter for ever worse than loses her my mother too i pity her for though she does not love me she will suffer for me she will suffer more than my father by the disgrace that would be brought upon my family if ever the secret should be publicly known my brother oh my beloved brother he knows nothing yet of all this but why do i grieve you with my agony of mind forget that lady julia lidhurst ever existed i wish you that happiness which i can never enjoy i wish you may deserve and win a heart capable of feeling real love adieu chapter xi convinced that all farther pursuit of lady julia lidhurst would be vain that it could tend only to increase her difficulties and his mortification vivian saw that the best thing he could possibly do was to leave glistonbury thus he should relieve the whole family from the embarrassment of his presence and by immediate change of scene and of occupation he had the best chance of recovering from his own disappointment if lady julia was to quit the castle he could have no inducement to stay if her ladyship remained his continuing in her society would be still more dangerous to his happiness besides he felt offended with lord glistonbury who evidently had wished to conceal from him the truth and without considering what was just or honourable had endeavoured to secure at all events an establishment for his daughter and a connexion for his family to the weight of these reasons must be added a desire to see mr russell and to effect a reconciliation with him the accumulated force of all these motives had power to overcome vivians habitual indecision his servant was surprised by an order to have every thing ready for his journey to town immediately whilst his man prepared to obey or at least to meditate upon the cause of this unusually decided order our hero went in quest of lord glistonbury to pay his compliments to his lordship previous to his departure his lordship was in his daughter julias dressing room and could not be seen but presently he came to vivian in great hurry and distress of mind a sad stroke upon us mr vivian a sad stroke upon us all but most upon me for she was the child of my expectations i hear she has told you every thing you also have been very ill used never was astonishment equal to mine when i heard miss strictlands story i need not caution you mr vivian as to secrecy you are a man of honour and you see the peace of our whole family is at stake the girl is going to a relation of ours in devonshire shant stay here shant stay here disgrace to my family she who was my pride and after all says she will never marry very well very well i shall never see her again that i am determined upon i told her that if she did not behave with common sense and propriety in her last interview with you i would give her up and so i will and so i do the whole is lady glistonburys fault she never managed her rightly when she was a child oh i should put you on your guard in one particular miss bateman knows nothing of what has happened i wish miss strictland knew as little i hate her what business had she to play the spy upon my daughter she does well to be a prude for she is as ugly as sin but we are in her power she is to go to morrow with julia to devonshire it will make a quarrel between me and miss bateman no matter for that for now the sooner we get rid of that rosamunda too the better she talks me dead and will let no one talk but herself and between you and me all this could not have happened if she had looked after her charge properly not but what i think miss strictland was still less fit to guide a girl of julias genius and disposition all was done wrong at first and i always said so to lady glistonbury but if the secret can be kept and that depends on you my dear friend after six months or a twelve months rustication with our poor parson in the country you will see how tamed and docile the girl will come back to us this is my scheme but nobody shall know my whole mind but you i shall tell her i will never see her again and that will pacify lady glistonbury and frighten julia into submission she says shell never marry stuff stuff you dont believe her what man who has seen any thing of the world ever believes such stuff vivians servant came into the room to ask his master some question about horses going where going when going how cried lord glistonbury as soon as the servant withdrew surely you are not going to leave us mr vivian vivian explained his reasons lord glistonbury would not allow them any weight entreated and insisted that he should stay at least a few days longer for his going just at this moment would seem quite like a break up in the family and would be the most unfriendly and cruel thing imaginable why lord glistonbury so earnestly pressed his stay perhaps even his lordship himself did not exactly know for with all the air of being a person of infinite address and depth of design his lordship was in reality childishly inconsistent what the french call inconsquent on any subject great or small where he once took it into his head or as he called it made it a point that a thing should be so or so he was as peremptory or where he could not be peremptory as anxious as if it were a matter of life and death in his views there was no perspective no keeping all objects appeared of equal magnitude and even now when it might be conceived that his whole mind was intent upon a great family misfortune he in the course of a few minutes became as eager about a mere trifle as if he had nothing else in the world to think of from the earnestness with which lord glistonbury urged him to stay a few days at least one day longer vivian was induced to believe that it must be a matter of real consequence to his lordship and in his present state of distress i cannot refuse such a request thought vivian he yielded therefore to these solicitations and consented to stay a few days longer though he knew the prolonging his visit would be in every respect disagreeable at dinner lord glistonbury announced to the company that the physician had advised change of air immediately for lord lidhurst and that in consequence his son would set out early the next morning for devonshire that his daughter julia wished to go with her brother and that miss strictland would accompany them lord glistonbury apologized for his daughters absence preparations for her journey so suddenly decided upon c lady glistonbury and lady sarah looked terribly grim whilst all this was saying but the gravity and stiffness of their demeanour did not appear any thing extraordinary to the greater part of the company who had no idea of what was going forward the lawyer the captain and the chaplain however interchanged significant looks and many times during the course of the evening they made attempts to draw out vivians thoughts but they found him impenetrable there was an underplot of a quarrel between miss strictland and miss bateman to which vivian paid little attention nor was he affected in the slightest degree by the rosamundas declaration to lord glistonbury that she must leave his family since she found that miss strictland had a larger share than herself of his lordships confidence and was for what reason she could not divine to have the honour of accompanying lady julia into devonshire vivian perceived these quarrels and heard the frivolous conversation of the company at glistonbury castle without interest and with a sort of astonishment at the small motives by which others were agitated whilst his whole soul was engrossed by love and pity for lady julia in vain he hoped for another opportunity of seeing and speaking to her she never appeared the next morning he rose at daybreak that he might have the chance of seeing her he begged miss strictland to entreat her ladyship would allow him to say a few words before she set out but miss strictland replied that she was assured the request would be vain and he thought he perceived that miss strictland though she affected to lament lady julias blindness to her own interests and contumacy in opposing her fathers wishes was in reality glad that she persisted in her own determination lord lidhurst on account of the weak state of his health was kept in ignorance of every thing that could agitate him and when vivian took leave of him the poor young man left many messages of kindness and gratitude for mr russell i am sorry that he was obliged to leave me for ill or well there is no human being i will not except any one but my sister julia whom i should so much wish to have with me tell him so and tell him be sure you remember my very words for perhaps i shall never see him again tell him that living or dying i shall feel grateful to him he has given me tastes and principles very different from those i had when he came into this house even in sickness i feel almost every hour the advantage of my present love for literature if i should live and recover i hope i shall do him some credit and i trust my family will join in my gratitude julia my dear sister why do you weep so bitterly if i had seen you come into the room i would not have spoken of my health lord glistonbury came up to tell them that miss strictland was ready mr vivian cried his lordship will you hand julia into the carriage julia mr vivian is offering you his services vivian as he attended lady julia had so much respect for her feelings that though he had been waiting with extreme impatience for an opportunity to say a few words yet now he would not speak but handed her along the gallery down the staircase and across the great hall in profound silence she seemed sensible of this forbearance and turning to him at a moment when they could not be overheard said it was not from unkindness mr vivian i refused to see you again but to convince you that my mind is determined if you have any thing to say i am ready to hear it is there nothing to be hoped from time said vivian your father i know has hopes that all i ask is that you will not make any rash resolutions i make none but i tell you for your own sake not to cherish any vain hope my father does not know my mind sufficiently therefore he may deceive you but i will not i thought after the manner in which i spoke to you yesterday you would have had too much strength of mind to have rendered this repetition of my sentiments necessary attach yourself elsewhere as soon as you can i sincerely wish your happiness miss strictland is waiting farewell she hurried forward to the carriage and when she was gone vivian repented that he had seen her again as it had only given them both additional and fruitless pain what passed during some succeeding days at glistonbury castle he scarcely knew no trace remained in his mind of anything but the confused noise of people who had been talking laughing and diverting themselves in a manner that seemed to him incomprehensible he exerted himself however so far as to write to russell to implore his forgiveness and to solicit a return of his friendship which in his present state of unhappiness was more necessary to him than ever when he had finished and despatched this letter he sunk again into a sort of reckless state without hope or determination as to his future life he could not decide whether he should go to his mother immediately on leaving glistonbury or to mr russell or which he knew was the best course he could pursue attend his duty in parliament and by plunging at once into public business change the course of his thoughts and force his mind to resume its energy after altering his determination twenty times after giving at least a dozen contradictory orders about his journey his servant at last had his ultimatum for london the carriage to be at the door at ten oclock the next morning every thing was ready at the appointed hour breakfast over vivian waited only to pay his compliments to lady glistonbury who had breakfasted in her own apartment lady sarah with a manner as formal as usual rose from the breakfast table and said she would let her mother know that mr vivian was going vivian waited half an hour an hour two hours lady glistonbury did not appear nor did lady sarah return the company had dispersed after the first half hour lord glistonbury began to believe that the ladies did not mean to make their appearance at length a message came from lady glistonbury lady glistonburys compliments to mr vivian her ladyship was concerned that it was out of her power to have the pleasure of seeing mr vivian as she was too much indisposed to leave her room she and lady sarah wished him a very good journey vivian went up to his room for his gloves which he missed at the moment when he was going whilst he was opening the empty drawers one after another in search of his gloves and at the same time calling his servant to find them he heard a loud scream from an adjoining apartment he listened again all was silent and he supposed that what he had heard was not a scream but at that moment lady sarahs maid flung open his door and running in with out stretched arms threw herself at vivians feet her sobs and tears prevented his understanding one syllable she said at last she articulated intelligibly oh sir dont be so cruel to go my lady my poor lady if you go it will kill lady sarah kill lady sarah why i saw her in perfect health this morning at breakfast dear dear sir you know nothing of the matter said the maid rising and shutting the door you dont know what a way she has been in ever since the talk of your going fits upon fits every night and my lady her mother and i up holding her and none in the house knowing it but ourselves very well at breakfast lord help us sir how little you know of what she has suffered lord have mercy upon me i would not be a lady to be so much in love and left so for any thing in the whole world and my lady sarah keeps every thing so to herself if it was not for these fits they would never have knowed she cared no more for you than a stone and probably you are quite mistaken said vivian and that i have nothing to do with the young ladys illness if she has fits i am very sorry for it but i cant possibly certainly you are quite mistaken lord sir mistaken as if i could be mistaken when i know my lady as well as i know myself why sir i know from the time of the election when you was given to her by all the country and to be sure when we all thought it would be a match directly and the lord knows what put it off i say from that time her heart was set upon you though she never said a word to me or any one i knew how it was through all her coldness and to be sure when you was in lonon so much with us all the town said as all the country did afore that to be sure it was to be a match but then that sad affair with that artfullest of women that took you off from all that was good and away the lord knows where to foreign parts well to be sure i never shall forget the day you come back again to us and the night of the ball and you dancing with my lady and all so happy then to be sure all were sarten it was to be immediately and now to go and break my poor ladys heart at the last oh sir sir if you could but see her it would touch a heart of marble vivians astonishment and dismay were so great that he suffered the girl who was an unpractised creature to go on speaking without interruption the warmth of affection with which she spoke of her lady also surprised him for till this instant he had no idea that any one could love lady sarah lidhurst and the accounts she gave of the ladys sufferings not only touched his compassion but worked upon his vanity this cold proud young lady that never loved none before to think as her maid said that she should come to such a pass as to be in fits about him and it was her belief that lady sarah never would recover it if he went away out of the castle this day the ringing of a bell had repeatedly been heard whilst lady sarahs maid was speaking it now rang violently and her name was called vehemently from the adjoining apartment i must go i must go oh sir one day for mercys sake stay one day longer vivian though he had been moved by this girls representations was determined to effect his retreat whilst it was yet in his power therefore he ran down stairs and had gained the hall where he was shaking hands with lord glistonbury when my lady glistonburys own woman came in a great hurry to say that her lady finding herself a little better now and able to see mr vivian begged he would be so good as to walk up to her dressing room vivian with a heavy heart and slow steps obeyed there was no refusing no evading such a request he summoned all his resolution at the same time saying to himself as he followed his conductor along the gallery it is impossible that i can ever be drawn in to marry lady sarah this is a concerted plan and i shall not be so weak as to be the dupe of so gross an artifice lady glistonburys maid showed him into her ladys dressing room and retired lady glistonbury was seated and without speaking pointed to a chair which was set opposite to her so a preparation for a scene thought vivian he bowed but still keeping his hat in his hand did not sit down he was extremely happy to hear that her ladyship found herself something better much honoured by her permitting him to pay his respects and to offer his grateful acknowledgments to her ladyship before his departure from glistonbury her ladyship still without speaking pointed to the chair vivian sat down and looked as if he had screwed his courage to the sticking place lady glistonbury had sometimes a little nervous trembling of her head which was the only symptom of internal agitation that was ever observable in her it was now increased to a degree which vivian had never before seen are you in haste sir to be gone said lady glistonbury not if her ladyship had any commands for him but otherwise he had intended if possible to reach town that night i shall not delay you many minutes mr vivian said her ladyship you need not be under apprehension that lady glistonbury should seek to detain you longer than your own inclinations induce you to stay it is therefore unnecessary to insult her with any appearance of haste or impatience vivian instantly laid down his hat and protested that he was not in the slightest degree impatient he should be very ungrateful as well as very ill bred if after the most hospitable manner in which he had been received and entertained at glistonbury castle he could be in haste to quit it he was entirely at her ladyships orders lady glistonbury bowed formally was again silent the trembling of her head very great the rest of her form motionless i have sent for you mr vivian said she that i might before you leave this castle set you right on a subject which much concerns me from the representations of a foolish country girl a maid servant of my daughter lady sarah lidhurst which i have just discovered she has made to you i had reason to fear that you might leave glistonbury with very false notions a cry was heard at this moment from the inner apartment which made vivian start but lady glistonbury without noticing it went on speaking with notions very injurious to my daughter sarah who if i know any thing of her would rather if it were so ordained go out of this world than condescend to any thing unbecoming her sex her education and her family vivian struck with respect and compassion for the mother who spoke to him in this manner was now convinced that there had been no concerted plan to work upon his mind that the maid had spoken without the knowledge of her lady and the more proudly solicitous lady glistonbury showed herself to remove what she called the false impression from his mind the more he was persuaded that the girl had spoken the truth he was much embarrassed between his good nature and his dread of becoming a sacrifice to his humanity he replied in general terms to lady glistonbury that he had the highest respect for lady sarah lidhurst and that no opinion injurious to her could be entertained by him respect she must command from all said lady glistonbury that it is out of any mans power to refuse her as to the rest she leaves you and i leave you sir to your own conscience lady glistonbury rose and so did vivian he hoped that neither her ladyship nor lady sarah had any cause he hesitated the words to reproach to complain to be displeased all came to his lips but each seemed improper and none other being at hand to convey his meaning he could not finish his sentence so he began another upon a new construction with i should be much concerned if in addition to all my other causes of regret in leaving glistonbury castle i felt that i had incurred lady glistonburys or lady sarahs displea disapprobation as to that sir said lady glistonbury i cannot but have my own opinion of your conduct and you can scarcely expect i apprehend that a mother such as i am should not feel some disapprobation of conduct which has sir i beg i may not detain you i have the honour to wish you a good journey and much happiness an attendant came from an inner apartment with a message from lady sarah who was worse and wished to see her mother immediately tell her immediately the servant returned with the answer vivian was retiring but he came back for he saw at that moment a convulsive motion contract lady glistonburys face she made an effort to walk but if vivian had not supported her instantly she must have fallen she endeavoured to disengage herself from his assistance and again attempted to walk for gods sake lean upon me madam said vivian much alarmed with his assistance she reached the door of the inner room summoning all the returning powers of life she then withdrew her arm from his and pointing back to the door at which vivian entered she said that is your way sir pardon me i cannot go i cannot leave you at this moment said vivian this is my daughters apartment sir said lady glistonbury stopping and standing still and fixed some of the attendants within hearing her ladyships voice opened the door lady glistonbury made an effort to prevent it but in vain the chamber was darkened but as the door opened the wind from an open window blew back the curtain and some light fell upon a canopy bed where lady sarah lay motionless her eyes closed and pale as death one attendant chafing her temples another rubbing her feet she looked up just after the door opened and raising her head she saw vivian a gleam of joy illumined her countenance and coloured her cheek sir repeated lady glistonbury this is my daughters she could articulate no more she fell across the threshold struck with palsy her daughter sprang from the bed and with vivians assistance raised and carried lady glistonbury to an arm chair near the open window drew back the curtain begged vivian to go to her father and instantly to despatch a messenger for medical assistance vivian sent his own servant who had his horse ready at the door and he bid the man go as fast as he could then you dont leave glistonbury to day sir said the servant do as i order you wheres lord glistonbury his lordship with the newspapers and letters open in his hand came up but they dropped on hearing the intelligence that vivian communicated his lordship was naturally humane and good natured and the shock was greater perhaps to him from the sort of enmity in which he lived with lady glistonbury i dread to go up stairs said he for gods sake vivian dont leave me in this distress do order your carriage away put up mr vivians carriage lady sarahs maid came to tell them that lady glistonbury had recovered her speech and that she had asked if mr vivian was gone do come up with me cried lord glistonbury and she will see you are not gone heres my lord and mr vivian my lady said the girl then turning to lady glistonburys woman she added in a loud whisper mr vivian wont go to day lady sarah gave her maid some commission which took her out of the room lady sarah no longer the formal cold slow personage whom vivian detested now seemed to him and not only seemed but was quite a different being inspired with energy and quickness and presence of mind she forgot herself and her illness and her prudery and her love and every other consideration in the sense of her mothers danger lady glistonbury had but imperfectly recovered her recollection at one moment she smiled on vivian and tried to stretch out her hand to him as she saw him standing beside lady sarah but when he approached lady glistonbury and spoke to her she seemed to have some painful recollection and looking round the room expressed surprise and uneasiness at his being there vivian retired and lord glistonbury who was crying like a child followed saying take me out with you dr g ought to be here before now ill send for another physician very shocking very shocking at lady glistonburys time of life too for she is not an old woman by any means lady glistonbury is eighteen months younger than i am nobody knows how soon it may be their turn its very shocking if i had known she was ill i would have had advice for her sooner she is very patient too patient a great deal too patient she never will complain never tells what she feels body or mind at least never tells me but that may be my fault in some measure should be very sorry lady glistonbury went out of the world with things as they are now between us hope to god she will get over this attack hey mr vivian vivian said whatever he could to fortify this hope and was glad to see lord glistonbury show feelings of this sort the physician arrived and confirmed these hopes by his favourable prognostics in the course of the day and night her face which had been contracted resumed its natural appearance she recovered the use of her arm a certain difficulty of articulation and thickness of speech with what the physician called hallucination of mind and a general feebleness of body were all the apparent consequences of this stroke she was not herself sensible of the nature of the attack or clear in her ideas of any thing that had passed immediately previous to it she had only an imperfect recollection of her daughters illness and of some hurry about mr vivians going away she was however well enough to go into her dressing room where vivian went to pay his respects to her with lord glistonbury by unremitting exertions and unusual cheerfulness lady sarah succeeded in quieting her mothers confused apprehensions on her account when out of lady glistonburys hearing all the attendants and the physicians repeatedly expressed fear that lady sarah would over fatigue and injure herself by this extraordinary energy but her powers of body and mind seemed to rise with the necessity for exertion and on this great occasion she suddenly discovered a warmth and strength of character of which few had ever before discerned even the slightest symptoms who would have expected this from sarah whispered lord glistonbury to vivian why her sister did not do more for me when i was ill i always knew she loved her mother but i thought it was in a quiet commonplace way who knows but she loves me too or might she came into the room at this moment sarah my dear said his lordship where are my letters and yesterdays papers which i never read ill see if there be any thing in them that can interest your mother lord glistonbury opened the papers and the first article of public news was a dissolution of parliament confidently expected to take place immediately this must put an end to vivians scheme of going to town to attend his duty in parliament but may be it is only newspaper information it was confirmed by all lord glistonbury and vivians private letters a letter from his mother which vivian now for the first moment had time to peruse mentioned the dissolution of parliament as certain she named her authority which could not be doubted and in consequence she had sent down supplies of wine for an election and she said that she would be immediately at castle vivian to keep open house and open heart for her son though not furnished she observed the castle would suit the better all the purposes of an election and she should not feel any inconvenience for her own part let the accommodations be what they might lord glistonbury directly proposed and insisted upon lady mary vivians making glistonbury her head quarters vivian objected lady glistonburys illness was an ostensible and he hoped would be a sufficient excuse for declining the invitation but lord glistonbury persisted lady glistonbury he was sure would wish it nothing would be more agreeable to her his lordships looks appealed to lady sarah but lady sarah was silent and when her father positively required her opinion by adding hey sarah she rather discouraged than pressed the invitation she said that though she was persuaded her mother would if she were well be happy to have the pleasure of seeing lady mary vivian yet she could not in her mothers present situation venture to decide how far her health might be able to stand any election bustle lady sarah said this with a very calm voice but blushed extremely as she spoke and for the first time vivian thought her not absolutely plain and for the first time he thought even the formality and deliberate coolness of her manner were not disagreeable he liked her more at this moment than he had ever imagined it possible he could like lady sarah lidhurst but he liked her chiefly because she did not press him into her service but rather forwarded his earnest wish to get away from glistonbury lord glistonbury appealed to the physician and asked whether company and amusement were not the best things possible for his patient lady glistonbury should not be left alone surely her mind should be interested and amused and an election would be a fortunate circumstance just at present the physician qualified the assent which his lordships peremptory tone seemed to demand by saying that certainly moderate amusement and whatever interested without agitating her ladyship would be salutary his lordship then declared that he would leave it to lady glistonbury herself to decide quitting the end of the room where they were holding their consultation he approached her ladyship to explain the matter but lady sarah stopped him beseeching so earnestly that no appeal might be made to her mother that vivian was quite moved and he settled the business at once to general satisfaction by declaring that though neither he nor lady mary vivian could think of intruding as inmates at present yet that they should as soon as lady glistonburys health would permit be as much at glistonbury castle as possible and that the short distance from his house would make it he hoped not inconvenient to his lordship for all election business lord glistonbury acceded and lady sarah appeared gratefully satisfied his lordship who always took the task of explanation upon himself now read the paragraph about the dissolution aloud to lady glistonbury informed her that lady mary vivian was coming immediately to the country and that they should hope to see lady mary and mr vivian almost every day though he could not prevail upon them to take up their abode during the election at glistonbury lady glistonbury listened and tried and seemed to understand bowed to mr vivian and smiled and said she remembered he was often at glistonbury during the last election that she was happy to hear she should have the pleasure to see lady mary vivian that some people disliked election times but for her part she did not when she was strong indeed the last election she recollected with particular pleasure she was happy that lord glistonburys interest was of service to mr vivian then she hoped his canvass to day had been successful and asked some questions that showed her mind had become confused and that she was confounding the past with the present lady sarah and mr vivian said a few words to set her right she looked first at one and then at the other listening and then said i understand god bless you both vivian took up his hat and looked out of the window to see if his carriage was at the door mr vivian wishes you a good morning madam said lady sarah he is going to castle vivian to get things ready for lady marys arrival i wish you health and happiness sir said lady glistonbury attempting to rise whilst some painful reminiscence altered her countenance pray do not stir dont disturb yourself lady glistonbury i shall pay my respects to your ladyship again as soon as possible and pray bring me good news of the election and how the poll stands to morrow mr vivian added her ladyship as he left the room chapter xii vivian who had felt oppressed and almost enslaved by his compassion breathed more freely when he at last found himself in his carriage driving away from glistonbury his own castle and the preparations for his mothers arrival and for the expected canvass occupied him so much for the ensuing days that he had scarcely time to think of lady julia or of lady sarah of russell or selina he could neither reflect on the past nor anticipate the future the present the vulgar present full of upholsterers and paper hangers and butlers and grooms and tenants and freeholders and parasites pressed upon his attention with importunate claims the dissolution of parliament took place lady mary vivian arrived almost as soon as the newspaper that brought this intelligence with her came a new set of thoughts all centering in the notion of her sons consequence in the world and of his happiness ideas which were too firmly associated in her mind ever to be separated she said that she had regretted his having made such a long stay in the country during the last session because he had missed opportunities of distinguishing himself farther in parliament the preceding session her ladyship had received gratifying compliments on her sons talents and on the figure he had already made in public life she felt her self love as well as her affection interested in his continuing his political career with spirit and success as to the present election she observed there could be little doubt that he would be re elected with the assistance of the glistonbury interest and added her ladyship smiling significantly i fancy your interest is pretty strong in that quarter the world has given you by turns to lady julia and lady sarah lidhurst and i am asked continually which of the lady lidhursts you are in love with one of these ladies certainly must be my daughter in law pray if you know empower me to say which lady mary vivian spoke but half in earnest till the extraordinary commotion her words created in her son convinced her that the report had not now at least been mistaken next to miss selina sidney continued lady mary who after her positive and long persisted in refusal is quite out of the question i have my dear son always wished to see you married to one of the lady lidhursts and of course lady julias talents and beauty and youth vivian interrupted and hastily told his mother that lady julia lidhurst was as much out of the question as miss sidney could be for that he had offered himself and had been refused and that he had every reason to believe that the determination of his second mistress against him would be at least as absolute and unconquerable as that of his first his mother was in amazement that her son could be refused by lady julia lidhurst appeared a moral and political impossibility especially when the desire for a connexion between the families had been so obvious on the side of the glistonburys what could be the meaning of this lady julia was perhaps under an error and fancied he was some way engaged to miss sidney or perhaps said lady mary who had a ready wit for the invention of delicate distresses perhaps there is some difficulty about the eldest sister lady sarah for you know the first winter you were given to her ay that must be the case i will go to glistonbury to morrow and i will have lady julia to myself for five minutes i think i have some penetration and i will know the truth lady mary was again surprised by hearing from her son that lady julia was not at glistonbury that she was gone with her brother into devonshire so there was a dead silence for some minutes succeeded by an exclamation from lady mary there is some grand secret here i must know it her ladyship forthwith commenced a close and able cross examination which vivian stopped at last by declaring that he was not at liberty to speak upon the subject he knew he said that his mother was of too honourable and generous a temper to press him farther his mother was perfectly honourable but at the same time extremely curious and though she continually repeated i will not ask you another question i would not upon any account lead you to say a syllable that could betray any confidence reposed in you my dear son yet she indulged herself in a variety of ingenious conjectures i know it is so or i am sure that i have guessed now but i dont ask you to tell me you do right to deny it amongst the variety of her conjectures lady mary did not find out the truth she was prepossessed by the idea that russell was attached to selina sidney a secret which her own penetration had discovered whilst her son was abroad with mrs wharton and which she thought no mortal living knew but herself pre occupied with this notion russell was now omitted in all her combinations his having quitted glistonbury did not create any suspicion of the real cause of his sudden departure because there was a sufficient reason for his going to the north to see his sick relation and lady mary was too good a philosopher to assign two causes for the same event when she had found one that was adequate to the production of the effect she therefore quietly settled it in her imagination that lady julia lidhurst was going to be married immediately to a certain young nobleman who had been lately at glistonbury whilst they were acting plays the next day she went with vivian to glistonbury castle for waiving all the ceremonials of visiting she was anxious to see poor lady glistonbury of whose illness she had been apprised in general terms by her son an impulse of curiosity mixed perhaps with motives of regard for her good friend lady glistonbury hastened this visit they found lady glistonbury much better she looked nearly as well as she had done before this stroke and she had now recovered her memory and the full use of her understanding vivian observed that she and lady sarah were both convinced by lady mary vivians curiosity that he had given no hint of any thing which they did not wish to be known and the pleasurable consciousness of his integrity disposed him to be pleased with them lord glistonbury on his side was convinced that vivian had behaved honourably with respect to his daughter julia so all parties were well satisfied with each other his lordship answered lady mary vivians inquiries after his son and his daughter julia by saying that miss strictland had just returned to glistonbury with rather more favourable accounts of lord lidhursts health and that julia and he were now at his brother the bishop of s between this brother and my lord glistonbury there had never been any great intimacy their characters and their politics being very different the moment lady mary vivian heard lord glistonbury pronounce with such unusual cordiality the words my brother the bishop she recollected that the bishop had a very amiable accomplished and remarkably handsome son so she arranged directly in her imagination that this was the person to whom lady julia was engaged being now thoroughly convinced that this last conjecture was just she thought no more about lady julias affairs but turned her attention to lady sarah whose cold and guarded manners however resisted her utmost penetration disappointed in all her attempts to lead to sentiment or love the conversation at last ran wholly upon the approaching election upon the canvass and the strength of the various interests of the county on all which subjects lady sarah showed surprisingly exact information presently lord glistonbury took vivian with him to his study to examine some poll book and then put into his hands a letter from lady julia lidhurst which had been enclosed in one to himself i told you that i intended to rusticate julia said his lordship with a poor parson and his wife relations distant relations of ours in devonshire but this plan has been defeated by my foolish good brother the bishop on their journey they passed close by his palace i charged miss strictland to be incog but they stayed to rest in the town for lidhurst was fatigued and some of the bishops people found them out and the bishop sent for them and at last came himself he was so sorry for lidhursts illness and as miss strictland says so much charmed with julia whom he had not seen since she was a child that he absolutely took possession of them and julia has made her party good with him for he writes me word he cannot part with her that i must allow her to remain with him and that they will take all possible care of lyndhursts health i believe i must yield this point to the bishop for altogether it looks better that julia should be at the palace than at the parsonage and though my poor brother has not the knowledge of the world one could wish or that is necessary to bring this romantic girl back to reason yet but i keep you from reading your letter and i see you are impatient hey very natural but i am afraid all in vain ill leave you in peace at any rate added lord glistonbury you know i have always stood your firm friend in this business and you know im discreet vivian never felt so grateful for any instance of his lordships friendship and discretion as for that which he gave at this moment by quitting the room and leaving him in peace to read his letter chapter xiii before you open this letter you will have heard probably that my uncle the bishop of has taken me under his protection i cannot sufficiently regret that i was not a few years a few months sooner blessed with such a mentor i never till now knew how much power kindness has to touch the mind in the moment of distress nor did i ever till now feel how deeply the eloquence of true piety sinks into the heart this excellent friend will i hope in time restore me to my better self from the abstraction the selfishness of passion i think i am already somewhat recovered after being wholly absorbed by one sentiment i begin to feel again the influence of other motives and to waken to the returning sense of social duty among the first objects to which in recovering from this trance or this fever of the soul i have power to turn my attention your happiness sir next to that of my own nearest relations i find interests me most after giving you this assurance i trust you will believe that to insure the felicity or even to restore the health and preserve the life of any relation or friend i have upon earth i should not think myself justified in attempting to influence your mind to any thing which i did not sincerely and firmly believe would be for your permanent advantage as well as for theirs under the solemn faith of this declaration i hope that you will listen to me with patience and confidence from all that i have myself seen and from all that i have heard of your character i am convinced that your wife should be a woman of a disposition precisely opposite in many respects to mine your character is liable to vary according to the situations in which you are placed and is subject to sudden but transient impressions from external circumstances you have hitherto had a friend who has regulated the fluctuations of your passions now that he is separated from you how much will you feel the loss of his cool and steady judgment should you not therefore in that bosom friend a wife look for a certain firmness and stability of character capable of resisting rather than disposed to yield to sudden impulse a character not of enthusiasm but of duty a mind which instead of increasing by example and sympathy any defects of your own pardon the expression should correct or compensate these by opposite qualities and supposing that with such sobriety and strength of character as i have described there should be connected a certain slowness formality and coldness of manner which might not at first be attractive to a man of your vivacity let not this repel you when once you have learned to consider this manner as the concomitant and indication of qualities essential to your happiness it would i am persuaded become agreeable to you especially as on nearer observation you would soon discover that beneath that external coldness under all that snow and ice there is an accumulated and concentrated warmth of affection of this sir you must lately have seen an example in my own family at the moment when my poor mother was struck with palsy you saw my sisters energy and her character probably then appeared to you in a new point of view from this burst of latent affection for a parent you may form some idea what the power of the passion of love would be in her soul some idea i say for i am persuaded that none but those who know her as well as i do can form an adequate notion of the strength of attachment of which she is capable you will be surprised perhaps sir to hear me reason so coolly for others on a subject where i have acted so rashly for myself and you may feel no inclination to listen to the advice of one who has shown so little prudence in her own affairs therefore having stated my reasons and suggested my conclusions i leave you to apply them as you think proper and i shall only add that the accomplishment of my wishes on this subject would give me peculiar satisfaction it would relieve my mind from part of a weight of self reproach i have made both my parents unhappy i have reason to fear that the shock my mother received by my means contributed much to her late illness an event that would restore my whole family to happiness must therefore be to me the most desirable upon earth i should feel immediate relief and delight even in the hope of contributing to it by any influence i can have over your mind and independently of the pleasure and pride i should feel in securing my sisters happiness and yours i should enjoy true satisfaction sir in that intimate friendship with you which only the ties of such near relationship could permit or justify you will accept of this assurance instead of the trite and insulting because unmeaning or unsafe offer of friendship which ladies sometimes make to those who have been their lovers julia lidhurst palace at the first reading of this letter vivian felt nothing but a renewal of regret for having lost all chance of obtaining the affections of the person by whom it was written on a second perusal he was moved by the earnest expression of her wishes for his happiness and the desire to gratify her on a point on which she was so anxious influenced him much more than any of her arguments whatever good sense the letter contained was lost upon him but all the sentiment operated with full force yet not with sufficient power to conquer the repugnance he still felt to lady sarahs person and manners lord glistonbury made no inquiries concerning the contents of his daughter julias letter but as far as politeness would permit he examined vivians countenance when he returned to the drawing room lady glistonburys manner was as calm as usual but the slight shake of her head was a sufficient indication of her internal feelings lady sarah looked pale but so perfectly composed that vivian was convinced she at least knew nothing of her sisters letter so great indeed was the outward composure and so immoveable was lady sarah that it provoked lady mary past endurance and as they drove home in the evening she exclaimed i never saw such a young woman as lady sarah lidhurst she is a stick a stone a statue she has completely satisfied my mind on one point i own that when i found lady julia was out of the question i did begin to think and wish that lady sarah might be my daughter in law because she has really been so carefully brought up and the connexion with the glistonbury family is so desirable then i had a notion before i saw her this morning that the girl liked you and might be really capable of attachment but now indeed i am convinced of the folly of that notion she has no feeling none upon earth scarcely common sense she thinks of nothing but how she holds her elbows the formality and importance with which she went on cutting off ends of worsted from that frightful tapestry work whilst i talked of you quite put me out of all manner of patience she has no feeling none upon earth oh maam said vivian you do her injustice she certainly has feeling for her mother ay for her mother may be a kind of mechanical affection but maam if you had seen her at the time that her mother was struck with palsy much to his own surprise vivian found himself engaged in a defence and almost in an eulogium upon lady sarah but the injustice of his mothers attack on this point was he knew so great that he could not join in lady marys invective why my dear charles said she do you recollect on this very road as we were returning from glistonbury castle this time two years you called lady sarah a petrifaction yes maam because i did not know her then well my dear i must have time to analyze her more carefully and i suppose i shall discover as you have done that she is not a petrifaction so then lady sarah really is to be the woman after all i am content but i absolutely cannot pretend to like her i like the connexion however and the rest is your affair you havent proposed yet bless me no maam god forbid how fast your imagination goes my dear mother is there no difference between saying that a woman is not a petrifaction and being in love with her in love i never said a word about being in love i know thats impossible i asked only if you had proposed for her dear maam no lady mary expressed her satisfaction and perhaps the injustice with which she continued for some days to asperse lady sarah lidhurst as being unfeeling served her more in vivians opinion than any other mode in which she could have spoken of her ladyship still he felt glad that he had not yet proposed he had not courage either to recede or advance circumstances went on and carried him along with them without bringing him to any decision the business of the election proceeded every day lord glistonbury was with him or he was at glistonbury castle every hour he saw more plainly the expectations that were formed sometimes he felt that he was inevitably doomed to fulfil these and at other times he cherished the hope that lady julia would soon return home and that by some fortunate revolution she might yet be his he had not now the advantage of russells firmness to support him in this emergency russells answer to his letter was so coolly determined and he so absolutely declined interfering farther in his affairs that vivian saw no hopes of regaining his friendship or of benefiting by his counsels thus was vivian in all the helplessness and all the horrors of indecision when an event took place which materially changed the face of affairs in the glistonbury family just at the time when the accounts of his health were the most favourable and when his friends were deceived by the most sanguine hopes of his recovery lord lidhurst died his mother was the only person in the family who was prepared for this catastrophe they dreaded to communicate the intelligence to her lest it should bring on another attack of her dreadful malady but to their astonishment she heard it with calm resignation said she had long foreseen this calamity and that she submitted to the will of heaven after pity for the parents who lost this amiable and promising young man heir to this large fortune and to this splendid title people began to consider what change would be made in the condition of the rest of the family the lady lidhursts from being very small fortunes became heiresses to a large estate the earldom of glistonbury was to devolve to a nephew of lord glistonbury in case the lady lidhursts should not marry or should not have heirs male but in case they should marry the title was to go to the first son all these circumstances were of course soon known and talked of in the neighbourhood and many congratulated vivian upon the great accession of fortune and upon the high expectations of the lady to whom they supposed him engaged on the first visit which vivian and his mother paid after the death of lord lidhurst at glistonbury castle they found there a young man very handsome but of a dark reserved countenance whose physiognomy and manner immediately prepossessed them against him on his part he seemed to eye them with suspicion and to be particularly uneasy whenever vivian either mentioned the election or approached lady sarah this young man was mr lidhurst lord glistonburys nephew and heir at law it was obvious almost at first sight that the uncle disliked the nephew but it was not so easy to perceive that the nephew despised the uncle mr lidhurst though young was an excellent politician and his feelings were always regulated by his interests he had more abilities than lord glistonbury less vanity but infinitely more ambition in lord glistonbury ambition was rather affected as an air suited to his rank and proper to increase his consequence mr lidhursts was an earnest inordinate ambition yet it was cold silent and calculating his pride preyed upon him inwardly but it never hurried him into saying or doing an extravagant thing those who were not actuated solely by ambition he always looked upon as fools and those who were he considered in general as knaves the one he marked as dupes the other as rivals he had been at the bishop of s during lord lidhursts illness and at the time of his death ever since lady julias arrival at the bishops he had foreseen the probability of this event and had in consequence of the long sightedness of his views endeavoured to make himself agreeable to her he found this impossible but was however easily consoled by hearing that she had resolved never to marry he only hoped that she would keep her resolution and he was now at glistonbury castle in the determination to propose for his other cousin lady sarah who would perhaps equally well secure to him his objects well my dear vivian said lord glistonbury drawing him aside how dye relish my nephew marmaduke lidhurst need not be afraid to speak the truth for i tell you at once that he is no particular favourite here not en bonne odeur but thats only between you and me he thinks that i dont know that he considers me as a shallow fellow because i havent my head crammed with a parcel of statistical tables all the fiscal and financiering stuff which he has at his calculating fingers ends but i trust that i am almost as good a politician as he is and im free to believe have rather more knowledge of the world in men not books experienced was my lord hey hey vivian and can see through him with half an eye i can tell him wants to get lady sarah yes yes but never came near us till we lost my poor boy he wont win lady sarah either or im much mistaken did you observe how jealous he was of you right right he has penetration stay stay you dont know marmaduke yet dont know half his schemes how his brow clouded when we were talking of the election i must hint to you he has been sounding me upon that matter he has a great mind to stand for this county talks of starting at the first day of the poll i told him it could not do as i was engaged to you he answered that of course was only a conditional promise in case none of my own relations stood i fought shy and he pressed confoundedly gad he would put me in a very awkward predicament if he was really to stand for you know what the world would say if they saw me opposing my own nephew a rising young man and not for a relation either and marmaduke lidhurst is just your deep fellow to plan such a thing and execute it not caring at what or whose expense i can tell him however i am not a man to be bullied out of my interest or to be outwitted either stand firm vivian my good friend and ill stand by you depend on me i only wish here his lordship paused but i cannot say more to you now for here is my precious heir at law coming to break up the confederacy ill ride over and see you to morrow now let us all be mute before marmaduke our master politician as becomes us hey vivian hey notwithstanding this sort of jealousy of marmaduke and the bravadoing style in which lord glistonbury spoke of him he spoke to him in a very different manner it was apparent to vivian that his lordship was under some awe of his nephew and that whilst he cherished this secret dislike he dreaded coming to any open rupture with a man who was as his lordship apprehended so well able to make his own party good in the world when marmaduke did emerge from that depth of thought in which he generally seemed to be sunk and when he did condescend to converse or rather to speak his theme was always of persons in power or his sarcasms against those who never would obtain it from any one thing he asserted it could never be proved but from all he said it might be inferred that he valued human qualities and talents merely as they could or could not obtain a price in the political market the power of speaking in public as it is a means in england of acquiring all other species of power he deemed the first of heavens gifts and successful parliamentary speakers were the only persons of whom he expressed admiration as vivian had spoken and had been listened to in the house of commons he was in this respect an object of marmaduke lidhursts envy but this envy was mitigated by contempt for our heros want of perseverance in ambition there is that mr vivian of yours said he to his uncle whilst vivian was gone to talk to the ladies youll find he will be but a womans man after all heavens with his fluency in public what i would have done by this time of day this poor fellow has no consistency of ambition no great views no reach of mind put him in for a borough and he would be just as well content as if he carried the county youll see he will after another session or two cut out and retire without a pension and settle down into a mere honest country gentleman he would be no connexion to increase the consequence of your family lady sarah lidhurst would be quite lost with such a nobody her ladyship i am convinced has too much discrimination and values herself too highly to make such a missy match lord glistonbury coughed and cleared his throat and blew his nose and seemed to suffer extremely but chiefly under the repression of his usual loquacity nothing could be at once a greater proof of his respect for his nephews abilities and of his lordships dislike to him than this unnatural silence mr lidhursts compliments on lady sarahs discrimination seemed however to be premature and unmerited for during the course of this day she treated all the vast efforts of her cousin marmadukes gallantry with haughty neglect and showed what she had never before suffered to be visible in her manner a marked preference for mr vivians conversation the sort of emulation which mr lidhursts rivalship produced increased the value of the object she for whom there was a contention immediately became a prize vivian was both provoked and amused by the alternate contempt and jealousy which mr lidhurst betrayed this gentlemans desire to keep him out of the glistonbury family and to supplant him in lady sarahs favour piqued him to prove his influence and determined him to maintain his ground insensibly vivians attentions to the lady became more vivacious and he was vain of showing the ease taste and elegance of his gallantry and he was flattered by the idea that all the spectators perceived both its superiority and its success lady sarah whose manners had much improved since the departure of miss strictland was so much embellished by our heros attentions that he thought her quite charming he had been prepared to expect fire under the ice but he was agreeably surprised by this sudden spring of flowers from beneath the snow the carriage was at the door in the evening and had waited half an hour before he was aware that it was time to depart you are right my dear son lady mary began the r moment they were seated in the carriage you are quite right and i was quite wrong about lady sarah lidhurst she has feeling indeed strong generous feeling and she shows it at the proper time a fine decided character her manners to day so easy and her countenance so animated really she looked quite handsome and i think her a charming woman what changes love can make well now i am satisfied this is what i always wished connexion family fortune every thing and the very sort of character you require in a wife the very person of all others that is suited to you if she were but a little more like her sister or selina sidney even said vivian with a sigh that very word even your saying like selina sidney even shows that you have not much cause for sighing for you see how quickly the mere fancy in these matters changes and you may love lady sarah presently as much as you loved even lady julia impossible maam impossible why my dear charles you astonish me for you cannot but see the views and expectations of all the family and of the young lady herself and your attentions to day were such as could bear but one construction were they maam i was not aware of that at the time that is i did not mean to engage myself good heavens surely i am not engaged you know a man is not bound like a woman by a few foolish words compliments and gallantry are not such serious things with us men men never consider themselves engaged to a woman till they make an absolute proposal i know that is a common maxim with young men of the present day but i consider it as dishonourable and base and very sorry should i be to see it adopted by my son cried lady mary indignantly ask your friend mr russells opinion on this point he long ago told you i know he did that if you had not serious thoughts of lady sarah lidhurst you would do very wrong after all the reports that have gone abroad to continue your intimacy with the glistonburys and thus to deceive her and her whole family i only appeal to mr russell will you ask your friend russells opinion vivian sighed again deeply for the loss of his friend russell but as he could not without touching upon lady julias affairs explain the cause of the coolness between him and his friend he answered only that an appeal to mr russell was unnecessary when he had his mothers opinion lady marys wish for the glistonbury connexion fortified her morality at this moment and she replied then my decided opinion is that it would be an immoral and dishonourable action to break such a tacit engagement as this which you have voluntarily contracted and which you absolutely could not break without destroying the peace and happiness of a whole family even that cold lady glistonbury grew quite warm to day and you must see the cause and in lady glistonburys state of health who could answer for the consequences of any disappointment about her favourite daughter just after the loss of her son too no more mother for heavens sake i see it all i feel it all i must marry lady sarah then by what fatality am i doomed am i forced to marry a woman whom i cannot love whose person and manners are peculiarly disagreeable to me and when im half in love with another woman that would be a shocking thing indeed said lady mary retracting and alarmed for now another train of associations was wakened and she judged not by her worldly but by her romantic system i am sure i would not upon any account urge you to act against your feelings i would not be responsible for such a marriage if you are really in love with her sister and if lady sarahs person and manners are peculiarly and absolutely disagreeable to you i should do a very wicked action should destroy my sons happiness and morals perhaps by insisting on such a marriage heaven forbid a silence of a mile and a half long ensued but charles after all i saw to day how can i believe that lady sarah is so disagreeable to you maam she happened not to be absolutely disagreeable to me to day oh well then she may not happen to be disagreeable to you to morrow or the next day or ever again and as to the fancy for her sister when all hope is over you know love soon dies of itself so ended the conversation the next morning at an unusual hour lord glistonbury made his appearance at castle vivian with an air of great vexation and embarrassment he endeavoured to speak of trivial topics but one after another these subjects dropped then lady mary who saw that he was anxious to speak to her son soon took occasion to withdraw not without feeling some curiosity and forming many conjectures as to the object his lordship might have in view in this conference lord glistonburys countenance exhibited in quick alternation a look of absolute determination and of utter indecision at length with abrupt effort he said vivian have you seen the papers to day the newspapers yes no they are on the table i did not look at them is there any thing extraordinary yes faith extraordinary very extraordinary but it is not here it is not there this is not the right paper it is not in your paper thats extraordinary too then feeling in both pockets i was a fool not to bring it with me may be i have it yes here it is not public news but private vivian was all expectation for he imagined that something about lady julia was coming lord glistonbury who in his commerce with public men had learned the art of paying in words to gain time when in danger of a bankruptcy of ideas went on stringing sentences together without much meaning whilst he was collecting his thoughts and studying the countenance of his auditor you recollect my suggestions the last time i had the honour of speaking to you on a particular subject i confess mr lidhursts conduct does not meet my ideas of propriety but other persons are free to form what judgment they think fit upon the occasion i shall submit the matter to you mr vivian feeling myself called upon to come forward immediately to explain it to your satisfaction and i do not fear to commit myself by stating at once my sentiments and the light in which it strikes me for there must be some decision shown somehow or other and on some side or other decision is all in all in public business as the great bacon or somebody says and nobody knows that better than marmaduke here his lordship grew warm and quitting his parliamentary cant assumed his familiar style gad he has stolen a march upon us out generalled us but in my private opinion not in the handsomest style possible hey vivian hey my dear lord i have not heard the fact yet said vivian oh the fact is simply look here he has without my encouragement or concurrence and indeed as he very well knew contrary to my approbation and wishes gone and declared himself candidate for this county and heres his fine flourishing patriotic damned advertisement in the paper to the gentlemen clergy and freeholders of the county gad how it startled me this morning when i first saw it i rubbed my eyes and could hardly believe it was marmaduke though i pique myself on knowing a mans style at the first line yet i could not have believed it was his unless i had seen his name at full length in these great abominable characters john marmaduke lidhurst glastonbury castle too as if i had countenanced the thing or had promised my support when he knew that but yesterday i was arguing the point with him in my study and told him i was engaged to you such an ungentlemanlike trick for you know it reduces me to the dilemma of supporting a man who is only my friend against my nearest relation by blood which of course would have an odd and awkward appearance in the eyes of the world vivian expressed much concern for his lordships difficulties but observed that the world would be very unjust if it blamed him and he was sure his lordship had too much decision of character but independently of the world interrupted his lordship even in our own family amongst all the lidhursts and their remotest connexions there would be quite a league formed against me and these family quarrels are ugly affairs for though our feudal times are done away party clanships have succeeded to feudal clanships and we chiefs of parties must keep our followers in good humour or we are nothing in the field i should say in the house ha ha ha i laugh but it is a very serious business for marmaduke lidhurst would be in private or public an impracticable enemy marmadukes a fellow capable of inextinguishable hatred and he is everywhere and knows every body of all the clubs a rising young man who is listened to and who would make his story credited and then with ones nephew one cant settle these things in an honourable way these family quarrels must be arranged amicably not honourably and thats the difficulty the laws of honour are dead letters in these cases and the laws of the land do not reach these niceties of feeling but of the most important fact you are still to be apprised indeed cried vivian yes you have not yet heard marmadukes master stroke of policy no what is it my lord i am all attention pray explain it to me but theres the delicacy theres the difficulty no no no upon my soul i cannot name it cried lord glistonbury it revolts my feelings all my feelings as a man as a gentleman as a father upon my honour as a peer i would speak if i could but for the soul of me i cannot you know my dear lord said vivian there can be no delicacies or difficulties with me your lordship has done me the honour to live always on such a footing of intimacy with me that surely there is not any thing you cannot say to me why thats true said lord glistonbury quitting his affected air of distress and endeavouring to throw off his real feeling of embarrassment you are right my dear vivian we are certainly upon terms of such intimacy that i ought not to be so scrupulous but there are certain things a well born well bred man in short it would look so like but in fact i am driven to the wall and i must defend myself as well as i can against this nephew of mine i know it will look like the most horrible thing upon earth like what i would rather be decapitated than do i know it will look absolutely as if i came here to ask you to marry my daughter which you know is a thing no gentleman could have the most remotely in his contemplation but since i am so pressed i must tell you the exact truth and explain to you however difficult marmadukes master stroke he has proposed for lady sarah and has had the assurance to ask me whether there is or is not any truth in certain reports which he is pleased to affirm have gone abroad heaven knows how or why and he urges me the deep dog for his cousins sake to contradict those reports in the only effectual manner by a temporary cessation of the intimate intercourse between castle vivian and glistonbury castle whilst lady sarah remains unmarried or if our master politician would speak plainly till he has married her himself at any rate i have spoken frankly vivian hey youll allow and i am entitled both to a candid interpretation of my motives and to equal frankness of reply whilst his lordship had been speaking compassion gratitude vanity rivalship honour lady mary vivians conversation lady julias letter then again the connexion the earldom in future the present triumph or disappointment about the election the insolent intrusion of mr lidhurst the cruelty of abandoning a lady who was in love with him the dishonour the impossibility of receding after certain reports all these ideas in rapid succession pressed on vivians mind and his decision was in consequence of the feelings and of the embarrassment of the moment his reply to lord glistonbury was a proposal for lady sarah followed by as many gallant protestations as his presence of mind could furnish he did not very well know what he said nor did lord glistonbury scrupulously examine whether he had the air and accent of a true lover nor did his lordship inquire what had become of vivians late love for lady julia but quite content that the object should be altered the desire the same he relieved vivian by exclaiming come come all this sort of thing lady sarah herself must hear and ive a notion but i can keep a secret youll return with me directly to glistonbury lady glistonbury will be delighted to see you and i shall be delighted to see marmadukes face when i tell him you have actually proposed for sarah for now i must tell you all our politician calculated upon the probability that you would not decide you see to make a proposal at once that would justify me to the world in supporting my son in law against my nephew as to the choice of the son in law sarah settles that part of the business herself you know for when two proposals are made both almost equally advantageous in the common acceptation of the word i am too good a father not to leave the decision to my daughter so you see we understand one another perfectly and will make marmaduke too understand us perfectly contrary to his calculations hey hey mr politician your advertisement must be withdrawn i opine in the next paper hey vivian my dear vivian with similar loquacity lord glistonbury continued in the fulness of his heart all the way they went together to glistonbury castle which was agreeable to vivian at least by saving him from all necessity of speaking so said vivian to himself the die is cast and i have actually proposed for lady sarah lidhurst who would have expected this two years ago i would not have believed it if it had been foretold to me even two months ago but it is a very a very suitable match and it will please the friends of both parties and lady sarah is certainly very estimable and capable of very strong attachment and i like her that is i liked her yesterday very much i really like her upon those mixed motives between convenience and affection from which dr johnson says most people marry our hero commenced his courtship of the lady sarah lidhurst as the minds of both parties on the subject are pretty well known to our readers it would be cruel to fatigue them with a protracted description of the formalities of courtship it is sufficient to say that my lord glistonbury had the satisfaction of seeing his nephew disappointed chapter xiv and the marriage was solemnized with much pomp and magnificence and every demonstration of joy novelists and novel readers are usually satisfied when they arrive at this happy catastrophe their interest and curiosity seldom go any farther but in real life marriage is but the beginning of domestic happiness or misery soon after the celebration of vivians nuptials an event happened which interrupted all the festivities at glistonbury and which changed the bridal pomp to mourning lady glistonbury who had been much fatigued by the multitude of wedding visits she was obliged to receive and return had another stroke of the palsy which in a few hours terminated fatally thus the very event which vivian had dreaded as the probable consequence of his refusal to marry her daughter was in fact accelerated by the full accomplishment of her wishes after the loss of her mother lady sarah vivians whole soul seemed to be engrossed by fondness for her husband in public and to all eyes but vivians her ladyship seemed much the same person as formerly but in private the affection she expressed for him was so great that he frequently asked himself whether this could be the same woman who to the rest of the world and in every other part of her life appeared so cold and inanimate on a very few occasions her character before her marriage had when much enforced given out a hasty spark and straight was cold again but now she permitted the steady flame to burn without restraint duty and passion had now the same object before marriage her attachment had been suppressed even at the hazard of her life she had no idea that the private demonstrations of unbounded love from a married woman to her husband could be either blameable or dangerous she believed it to be her duty to love her husband as much as she possibly could was not he her husband she had been taught that she should neither read speak nor think of love and she had been so far too much restricted on this subject that absolutely ignorant and unconscious even of her danger she now pursued her own course without chart or compass her injudicious tenderness soon imposed such restraint upon her husband as scarcely any lover much less any husband could have patiently endured she would hardly ever suffer him to leave her whenever he went out of the house she exacted from him a promise that he would be back again at a certain hour and if he were even a few minutes later than his appointment he had to sustain her fond reproaches even though he stayed at home all day she was uneasy if he quitted the room where she sat and he who by this time understood through all her exterior calmness the symptoms of her internal agitation saw by her countenance that she was wretched if he seemed interested in the conversation of any other person especially of any other woman one day when vivian after spending the morning tte tte with lady sarah signified to her his intention of dining abroad she repeated her fond request that he would be sure to come home early and that he would tell her at what oclock exactly she might expect to see him again he named an hour at hazard to free himself from her importunate anxiety but he could not help saying pshaw as he ran down stairs an exclamation which fortunately reached only the ears of a groom who was thinking of nothing but the tops of his own boots vivian happened to meet some agreeable people where he dined he was much pressed to stay to supper he yielded to entreaty but he had the good natured attention to send home his servant to beg that lady sarah and his mother would not sit up for him when he returned he found all the family in bed except lady sarah who was sitting up waiting for him with her watch in her hand the moment he appeared she assailed him with tender reproaches to which he answered but why would you sit up when i begged you would not my dear lady sarah she replied by a continuity of fond reproach and among other things she said but without believing it to be true ah i am sure you would have been happier if you had married my sister julia or that miss sidney vivian sighed deeply but the next instant conscious that he had sighed and afraid of giving his wife pain he endeavoured to turn the course of her thoughts to some other subject in vain poor lady sarah said no more but felt this exquisitely and with permanent anguish thus her imprudence reverted upon herself and she suffered in proportion to her pride and to her fondness by such slight circumstances is the human heart alienated from love struggling to be free the restive little deity ruffles and impairs his plumage and seldom recovers a disposition to tranquillity vivians good nature had induced him for some time to submit to restraint but if instead of weakly yielding to the fond importunity of his wife if instead of tolerating the insipidity of her conversation and the narrowness of her views he had with real energy employed her capacity upon suitable objects he might have made her attachment the solace of his life whoever possesses the heart of a woman who has common powers of intellect may improve her understanding in twelve months more than could all the masters and lectures and courses of philosophy and abridgments and documenting in the universe but vivian had not sufficient resolution for such an undertaking he thought only of avoiding to give or to feel present pain and the consequences were that the evils he dreaded every day increased vivians mother saw the progress of conjugal discontent with anguish and remorse alas said she to herself i was much to blame for pressing this match my son told me he could never love lady sarah lidhurst it would have been better far to have broken off a marriage at the church door than to have forced the completion of such an ill assorted union my poor son married chiefly from a principle of honour his duty and respect for my opinion had also great weight in his decision and i have sacrificed his happiness to my desire that he should make what the world calls a splendid alliance i am the cause of all his misery and heaven only knows where all this will end in her paroxysm of self reproach and her eagerness to set things to rights between her daughter in law and her son she only made matters worse she spoke with all the warmth and frankness of her own character to lady sarah beseeching her to speak with equal openness and to explain the cause of the alteration in vivian i do not know what you mean madam by alteration in mr vivian is not there some disagreement between you my dear there is no disagreement whatever madam as far as i know between mr vivian and me we agree perfectly said lady sarah well the misunderstanding i do not know of any misunderstanding madam mr vivian and i understand one another perfectly the coolness then oh what word shall i use surely my dear lady sarah there is some coolness something wrong i am sure madam i do not complain of any coolness on mr vivians part am i to understand that he complains to your ladyship of any thing wrong on mine if he does i shall think it my duty when he points out the particulars to make any alteration he may desire in my conduct and manners complain my son he makes no complaints my dear you misunderstand me my son does not complain that any thing is wrong on your part then madam if no complaints are made on either side all is as it should be i presume at present and if in future i should fail in any point of duty i shall hold myself obliged to your ladyship if you will then act as my monitor hopeless of penetrating lady sarahs sevenfold fence of pride the mother flew to her son to try what could be done with his open and generous mind he expressed a most earnest and sincere wish to make his wife happy conscious that he had given her exquisite pain he endeavoured to make atonement by the sacrifices which he thought would be most grateful to her he refrained often from company and conversation that was agreeable to him and would resign himself for hours to her society it was fortunate for lady julia lidhurst that by continuing with her good uncle the bishop she did not see the consequences of the union which she had so strenuously advised the advice of friends is often highly useful to prevent an imprudent match but it seldom happens that marriages turn out happily which have been made from the opinion of others rather than from the judgment and inclinations of the parties concerned for let the general reasons on which the advice is grounded be ever so sensible it is scarcely possible that the adviser can take in all the little circumstances of taste and temper upon which so much of the happiness or misery of domestic life depends besides people are much more apt to repent of having been guided by the judgment of another than of having followed their own and this is most likely to be the case with the weakest minds strong minds can decide for themselves not by the opinions but by the reasons that are laid before them weak minds are influenced merely by opinions and never either before or after their decision are firm in abiding by the preponderating reasons no letters no intelligence from home except a malicious hint now and then from her cousin marmaduke which she did not credit gave her reason to suspect that the pair whom she had contributed to unite were not perfectly happy so lady julia exulted in the success of her past counsels and indulged her generous romantic disposition in schemes for forwarding a union between russell and selina determining to divide her fortune amongst the children of her friends she concluded one of her letters to lady sarah vivian about this time with these words could i but see one other person whom i must not name rewarded for his virtues as you are by happy love i should die content and would write on my tomb je ne fus point heureux mais jai fait leur bonheur far removed from all romance and all generosity of sentiment lord glistonbury in the mean time went on very comfortably without observing any thing that passed in his family whatever uneasiness obtruded upon his attention he attributed to one cause anxiety relative to the question on which his present thoughts were exclusively fixed viz whether lady sarahs first child would be a boy or a girl heaven grant a boy said his lordship for then you know theres an end of marmaduke as heir at law whenever his lordship saw a cloud on the brows of lady mary of lady sarah or of vivian he had one infallible charm for dispelling melancholy he stepped up close to the patient and whispered it will be a boy my life upon it it will be a boy sometimes it happened that this universal remedy applied at random made the patient start or smile and then his lordship never failed to add with a nod of great sagacity ah you didnt know i knew what you were thinking of well well youll see we shall cut out marmaduke yet with this hope of cutting out marmaduke lord glistonbury went on very happily and every day grew fonder of the son in law who was the enemy of his heir at law or whom he considered as such the easiness of vivians temper was peculiarly agreeable to his lordship who enjoyed the daily pleasure of governing a man of talents which were far superior to his own this easiness of temper in our hero was much increased by the want of motive and stimulus he thought that he had now lost his chance of happiness he cared little for the more or less pain of each succeeding day and so passive was his listlessness that to a superficial observer like lord glistonbury it looked like the good nature of perfect content poor vivian in this wreck of his happiness one saving chance however yet remained he had still a public character he was conscious of having preserved unblemished integrity as a member of the senate and this integrity still more than his oratorical talents raised him far above most of his competitors and preserved him not only in the opinion of others but in his own when parliament met he went to town took a very handsome house for lady sarah determining to do all he could to oblige and please the wife whom he could not love lady sarah had complete power at home and abroad of her time and her expenses her dress her equipages her servants her whole establishment were above vivians fortune and equal to her ladyships birth and rank she was mistress of every thing but of his heart the less he liked her the more he endeavoured to compensate for this involuntary fault by allowing her that absolute dominion and that external splendour which he thought would gratify and perhaps fill her mind as for himself he took refuge in the house of commons there he forgot for a time domestic uneasiness and was truly animated by what so many affect zeal for the good of his country he was proud to recollect that the profligate wharton had failed in the attempt to laugh him out of his public virtue he was proud that whartons prophecies of his apostasy had never been accomplished that as a public character at least he had fulfilled the promise of his early youth and was still worthy of himself and of that friend whom he had lost he clung to this idea as to the only hope left him in life one night in a debate on some question of importance he made an excellent speech which was particularly well received by the house because it came from one who had an unblemished character when vivian went into the coffee room to refresh himself after he had done speaking several of his acquaintance crowded round him complimenting him upon his success he broke from them all for he saw advancing towards him with a smile of approbation the friend on whose approbation he set a higher value than he did even on the applauses of the house the friend whose lost affection he had so long and so bitterly regretted russell stretched out his hand vivian eagerly seized it and before they had either of them spoken one word they both understood each other perfectly and their reconciliation was completely effected yes said russell as they walked out arm in arm together yes it is fit that i should forget all private resentment in the pride and pleasure i feel not merely in your public success but in your public virtue talents even the rare talent of oratory you know i hold cheap in comparison with that which is so far more rare as well as more valuable political integrity the abhorrence and contempt of political profligacy which you have just expressed as a member of the senate and the consistent conduct by which you have supported your principles are worthy of you and allow me to say of your education vivian felt exalted in his own opinion by such praise and by these the warmest expressions he had ever received of russells regard he forgot even his domestic uneasiness and this day the first for many months he had spent happily he passed with his friend they supped together and related mutually all that happened since their parting russell told vivian that he had lately been agreeably surprised by the gift of a valuable living from the bishop of lady julia lidhursts uncle that the bishop whom he had till then never seen had written to him in the handsomest manner saying that he knew the obligations his family owed to mr russell that it had been the dying request of his nephew lord lidhurst that some token of the family esteem and gratitude should be offered to him to whom they owed so much but the bishop added that neither family gratitude nor private friendship could have induced him to bestow church preferments upon any but the person whose character best entitled him to such a distinction and such a trust this letter as vivian observed was well calculated to satisfy russells conscience and his delicacy the conversation next turned upon lady julia lidhurst russell was not aware that vivian knew more of her attachment to him than what had been discovered the day before he left glistonbury and vivian could not help admiring the honourable and delicate manner in which his friend spoke of her without any air of mystery and with the greatest respect he told vivian he had heard that proposals had been lately made to her ladyship by a gentleman of great talents and of high character but that she had positively declined his addresses and had repeated her declaration that she would never marry her good uncle left her on this point entirely at liberty and did not mention the proposal to lord glistonbury lest she should be exposed to any fresh difficulties russell expressed much satisfaction at this part of the bishops conduct as being not only the most kind but the most judicious and the most likely to dispose his niece to change her determination he repeated his opinion that united to a man of sense and strength of mind she would make a charming and excellent wife vivian agreed with him yet observed that he was convinced she would never marry there he paused could lady julia herself have overheard the conversation which afterwards passed between these two gentlemen one of whom she had loved and the other of whom she had refused not a word would have hurt her feelings on the contrary she would have been raised in her own opinion and gratified by the strong interest they both showed for her happiness they regretted only that a young woman of such talents and of such a fine generous disposition had been so injudiciously educated and now my dear russell cried vivian that we have finished the chapter of lady julia let us talk of miss sidney russells change of countenance showed that it was not quite so easy for him to talk upon this subject to spare him the effort vivian resumed as you are a rich man now my dear russell you will certainly marry and i know added he smiling that miss sidney will be your wife if ever man deserved such a prize you do and i shall be the first to wish you joy stay my good friend interrupted russell your kindness for me and your imagination are too quick in this anticipation of my happiness russell then told him that he never had declared his attachment to selina till vivians marriage had put an end to all probability of rivalship with his friend she had expressed high esteem for russell but had told him that she had suffered so much from a first unfortunate attachment that she felt averse from any new engagements shall i assure you as you assured me just now with regard to lady julia said vivian that miss sidney will he prevailed upon to alter her determination and shall i add that though i should like lady julia the less i should like selina the better for changing her mind he went on generously expressing sincere hopes that his friend might obtain selina sidneys affections and might enjoy that domestic happiness which vivian was going to say which he had himself forfeited but checking this regret he only said that domestic happiness which i consider as the summit of human felicity and which no man can deserve better than you do my dear russell russell easily guessed that poor vivian had not attained this summit of human felicity by his own marriage but never adverted to any of the conversations they had held about lady sarah lidhurst never recalled any of vivians vehement declarations concerning the absolute impossibility of his making such a match never evinced the least surprise at his marriage nor inquired how he had conquered his passion for lady julia with friendly forgetfulness he seemed to have totally obliterated from his mind all that it could do no good to remember vivian was sensible of this delicacy and grateful for it but to imitate russells reserve and silence upon certain subjects required a force a forbearance of which he was not capable at first he had determined not to say one word to russell of domestic uneasiness but they had not been many hours together before vivian poured forth all his complaints and confessed how bitterly he repented his marriage be declared that he had been persuaded by the united efforts of her family and of his mother against his own judgment or at least against his taste and inclinations to marry lady sarah by whatever persuasions or by whatever motives your choice was decided interrupted russell reflect that it is decided for life therefore abide by it and justify it above all make yourself happy with the means which are yet in your power instead of wasting your mind in unavailing regret you are united to a woman who has every estimable quality as you candidly acknowledge there are some particulars in which she does not please your taste but withdraw your attention from these and you will be happy with a wife who is so firmly attached to you consider besides that romance apart love though a delightful passion is not the only resource which a man of sense virtue and activity may find for happiness your public duties your success and your reputation as a public character will russell was interrupted in this consolatory and invigorating speech by the entrance of a servant of lord glistonburys who brought a note from his lordship to mr vivian requesting to see him as soon as he could make it convenient to come to glistonbury house as his lordship wanted to speak to him on particular business of the greatest importance vivian was provoked by being thus summoned away from his friend to attend to one of what he called lord glistonburys important mysteries about nothing russell was engaged to go into the country the ensuing day to take possession of his new living but he promised that he would see him again soon and with this hope the two friends parted vivian went to lord glistonburys he found his lordship in his study where have you been vivian exclaimed he i have sent messenger after messenger to look for you half over the town i thought you were to have dined with us but you ran away and nobody could tell where or with whom and we have been waiting for you at our cabinet council here with the utmost impatience vivian answered that he had unexpectedly met with his friend russell and was proceeding to tell his lordship how handsomely the bishop of had provided for his friend but lord glistonbury like many other great men having the habit of forgetting all the services of those from whom they have nothing more to expect cut short vivians narration by exclaiming true true well well thats all over now certainly that russell did his duty by my poor son and acted as he ought to do in all things and im glad to hear my brother has given him a good living and i hope as you say he will soon be married so best so best you know vivian for reasons of our own well well im glad he is provided for not but what that living would have been of essential service if it had been reserved for a friend of mine but my brother the bishop never can enter into any political views might as well not have a brother a bishop but however mr russells a friend of yours i am not regretting not so rude to you to regret on the contrary rejoice particularly as mr russell is a man of so much merit but all thats over now and i want to talk to you upon quite another matter you know i have always said i should sooner or later succeed in my grand object hey vivian your lordships grand object i am not sure that i know it oh surely you know my grand object you my son in law and forget my grand object the marquisate you know the marquisate the marquisate did not i always tell you that i would make government sooner or later change my earldom into a marquisate well the thing is done that is as good as done they have sent to treat with me upon my own terms i give you joy my dear lord said vivian joy to be sure you do my sober sir one would think you had no concern or interest in the business joy to be sure you give me joy but i can tell you you must give me something more than joy you must give me support how he looks continued lord glistonbury as if he did not know what is meant by support vivian did you never hear of parliamentary support i hope my dear lord replied vivian gravely that you have not entered into any engagements or made any promises for me which i cannot have it in my power to perform lord glistonbury hesitated in some confusion and then forcing a look of effrontery in an assured tone replied no i have not made any engagements or promises for you which you cannot perform vivian i am clear nor any which i have not a right to expect my son in law will confirm with alacrity what have you engaged what have you promised for me my lord said vivian earnestly only my dear boy said lord glistonbury assuming a facetious tone only that you will be always one of us and are not you one of us my son in law the deuce is in it if he is not one of us in short you know to be serious a party must go together that is a family party must go together and if a ministry do my business of course i do theirs if i have my marquisate they have my votes but not my vote pardon me my lord my vote cannot be bartered in this manner but you know mr vivian you know it is for your interest as much as for mine for you know the marquisate will probably descend in due course of time to your son so your interest is full as much concerned as mine and besides let me tell you i have not forgotten your immediate interest i have stipulated that you should have the valuable place which mr c was to have had all that russell had said of public virtue was fresh in our heros mind i thank you my dear lord said he for i am sure this was kindly intended but i am not one of those persons who in public affairs think only of their private interest i am not thinking of my interest but if a man maintains certain public measures one day and the next for valuable consideration supports diametrically opposite opinions and measures he will lose and deserve to lose all reputation for integrity integrity political integrity said lord glistonbury fine words which mean nothing behind the scenes as we are now vivian what use can there be in talking in that strain between you and me you know this is all nonsense for who of any party now thinks really and truly of any thing but getting power or keeping it power you know stands for the measure of talent and every thing else worth having is included in that word power i speak plainly and as honour is merely an affair of opinion and opinion again an affair of numbers and as there are numbers enough to keep one in countenance in these things really my dear vivian it is quite childish quite boyish smells of the lamp to declaim about political integrity and all that is not the language of a man who knows any thing of business any thing of the world but why do i say all this cried lord glistonbury checking himself and assuming an air of more reserved displeasure mr vivian certainly knows all this as well as i do i know how my nephew marmaduke who with all his faults is no fool would interpret your present language he would say as i have often heard him say that political integrity is only a civil put off political integrity only a civil put off repeated vivian with unfeigned astonishment when he formerly heard similar sentiments from the avowed profligate and hackneyed politician mr wharton he was shocked but to hear them repeated as being coolly laid down by so young a man as mr lidhurst excited so much disgust and contempt in vivians mind that he could hardly refrain from saying more than either prudence or politeness could justify now i am free to confess pursued lord glistonbury that i should think it more candid and manly and i will add more friendly and more the natural open conduct of a son in law to a father in law instead of talking of political integrity to have said at once i cannot oblige you in this instance surely my lord you cannot be in earnest said vivian i tell you sir i am in earnest cried his lordship turning suddenly in a rage as he walked up and down the room i say it would have been more candid more manly more every thing and much more like a son in law much much i am sure if i had known as much as i do now sir you never should have been my son in law never never seen lady sarah in her grave first i would i would yes sir i would and you are the last person upon earth i should have expected it from but i have a nephew i have a nephew and now i know the difference no man can distinguish his friends till he tries them vivian in vain endeavoured to appease lord glistonbury by assurances that he would do any thing in his power to oblige him except what he himself considered as dishonourable his lordship reiterated with divers passionate ejaculations that if vivian would not oblige him in this point on which he had set his heart where the great object of his life was at stake he could never believe he had any regard for him and that in short it must come to an open rupture between them for that he should never consider him more as his son having uttered this denunciation as distinctly as passion would permit lord glistonbury retired to rest vivian went immediately to his mother to tell her what had passed and he felt almost secure of her approbation but though she praised him for his generous spirit of independence yet it was evident the hopes that the title of marquis might descend to a grandson of her own weighed more with her than any patriotic considerations she declared that indeed she would not for any title or any thing upon earth have her son act dishonourably but what was asked of him as far as she could understand was only such a change of party such compliances as every public man in his place would make and though she would not have him like some she could name a corrupt tool of government yet on the other hand it was folly to expect that he alone could do any thing against the general tide of corruption that it would be madness in him to sacrifice himself entirely without the slightest possibility of doing any good to his country vivian interrupted her to represent that if each public man argued in this manner nothing could ever be accomplished for the public good that on the contrary if every man hoped that something might be done even by his individual exertion and if he determined to sacrifice a portion of his private interest in the attempt perhaps much might be effected very likely lady mary said she confessed she knew little of politics so from argument she went to persuasion and entreaties she conjured him not to quarrel with the glistonburys and not to provoke lord glistonburys displeasure i see all that artful marmadukes schemes said she he knows his uncles pertinacious temper and he hopes that your notions of patriotism will prevent you from yielding on a point on which his uncle has set his heart marmaduke will know how to take advantage of all this believe me vivian was shaken in his resolution by his mothers entreaties by the idea of all the family quarrels that would ensue and of all the difficulties in which he might be involved if he persisted in his generous determination my dear son resumed she it would be absolute madness to refuse the place that is now offered you only consider the situation of your affairs consider i beseech you the distress you will be in by and by if you reject this offer recollect the immense demands upon you recollect that heap of bills for the election and for the buildings and all the poor workmen about the castle and that coachmaker too and remember the purchase money of the house in town must be paid in three months and the only possible means by which you can get out of debt is by accepting this place which would put you at ease at once and enable you to continue in the style of life to which you have of late been accustomed as to that i could alter my style of life i would do any thing cried vivian to pay my debts and preserve my independence i will alter my mode of living and retrench decidedly and vigorously well my dear son i admire your spirit and if you can do this it will certainly be best but i fear that when it comes to the trial you will not be able to persevere i shall i shall believe me mother i have resolution enough for this you do me injustice said vivian no my dear charles i do you justice for i do not doubt your resolution as far as your own privations are concerned but consider your wife consider lady sarah consider the luxury in which she has always been accustomed to live and the high sphere in which her relations move how her pride would be hurt by their looking down upon her i have no doubt lady sarah would do her duty and make any sacrifices for her husband and if you were i must now speak plainly if you were passionately fond of her an all for love husband you could with honour and propriety accept of such sacrifices but what would retirement be to poor lady sarah and with lady sarah vivian told his mother that he would take a night to reconsider the matter coolly and satisfied with having gained so much she suffered him to go home as he was quitting his own dressing room he paused to consider whether he should consult his wife who was as yet in ignorance of the whole transaction and who knew nothing of the deranged state of his affairs he did her the justice to believe that she would be willing to live with him in retirement and to forego all the luxuries and pride of her rank for the sake of her duty and of her love he was convinced that in any opposition between her fathers interests and her husbands honour she would strongly abide by her husband he recollected all lady julia had said of the advantage that her sisters firmness of mind might be in steadying his vacillating temper in any moment of trial here was the first great occasion since his marriage where his wifes strength of mind could be of essential service to him yet he hesitated whether he should avail himself of this advantage and every moment as he approached nearer to her apartment he hesitated more and more he did not in the first place like to humble himself so far as to ask her counsel then he had not courage to confess those debts and embarrassments which he had hitherto concealed all that his mother had suggested about the indelicacy of requiring or accepting great sacrifices from a woman whom though he esteemed he could not love the horror of retirement with such a companion the long years tte tte all these ideas combined but chiefly the apprehension of the immediate present pain of speaking to her on a disagreeable subject and of being obliged to hear her speak with that formal deliberation which he detested added to this the dread of her surprise if not of her reproaches when all his affairs should be revealed operated so irresistibly upon his weakness that he decided on the common resource concealment his hand was upon the lock of his chamber door and he turned it cautiously and softly lest in entering his apartment he should waken lady sarah but she was not asleep what can have kept you so late mr vivian said she business my dear answered he with some embarrassment may i ask what sort of business oh only political business political business she looked earnestly at her husband but as if repressing her curiosity she afterwards added our sex have nothing to do with politics and turning away from the light she composed herself to sleep very true my dear replied vivian not a word more did he say content with this evasion of the difficulty he thus by his weakness deprived himself of the real advantage of his wifes strength of mind whilst lady sarah in total ignorance of the distress of her husband slept in peace he lay awake revolving painful thoughts in the silence of the night all that his mother had said about the pecuniary difficulties to which they must soon be reduced recurred with fresh force the ideas of the unpaid election bills all the masons carpenters painters glaziers and upholsterers bills with thousands yet unnamed behind rose in dreadful array before him and the enthusiasm of his patriotism was appalled with feverish reiteration he ran over and over in his mind the same circle of difficulties continually returning to the question then what can be done bitterly did he this night regret the foolish expenses into which he had early in life been led if it were to do over again he certainly would not turn his house into a castle if he had foreseen how much the expense would surpass the estimates assuredly nothing could have tempted him to such extravagance the architect the masons the workmen one and all were knaves but one and all they must be paid then what could he do and the debts incurred by the contested elections contested elections are cursed things when the bills come to be paid but cursed or not they must be paid then what could he do the distress in which he should involve his generous mother the sacrifices he should require from his wife the family quarrels all that lady sarah would suffer from them the situation of his wife then what could he do he must submit to lord glistonbury and take the place that was offered to him vivian sighed and turned in his bed and sighed and thought and turned and sighed again and the last sigh of expiring patriotism escaped him to this end to this miserable end must all patriotism come which is not supported by the seemingly inferior virtues of prudence and economy poor vivian endeavoured to comfort himself by the reflection that he should not act from merely mercenary considerations but that he was compelled to yield to the solicitations of his mother and of his father in law that he was forced to sacrifice his own public opinions to secure domestic peace and to prevent the distress of his mother the misery and perhaps danger of his wife and child dereliction of principle in these circumstances was something like an amiable a pardonable weakness and then see it in what light you will as lord glistonbury observed there are so many who will keep a patriot in countenance now a days for merely changing sides in politics a man is not even thought to be a man of talents till he gets something by his talents the bargain he makes the price he gains is in most peoples estimation the value of the public man all this vivian said to himself to quiet his conscience and all this he knew would be abundantly satisfactory to the generality of people with whom he associated therefore from them he could fear neither reproach nor contempt but he could not bear even to think of russell he felt all the pangs of remorse and agony of shame as the idea of such a friend came into his mind again he turned in his bed and groaned aloud so loud that lady sarah wakened and starting up asked what was the matter but receiving no answer she imagined that she had been in a dream or that her husband had spoken in his sleep he groaned no more nor did he even sigh but fatigued with thinking and with feeling he at last fell into a sort of slumber which lasted till it was time to rise before vivian was dressed lord glistonbury called upon him he went into his dressing room his lordship came with his best address and most courteous face of persuasion he held out his hand in a frank and cordial manner as he entered begging his dear sons pardon for the warmth and want of temper he was free to confess he had shown last night but he was persuaded he said that vivian knew his sincere regard for him and convinced that in short they should never essentially differ so that he was determined to come to talk the matter over with him when they were both cool and that he felt assured that vivian after a nights reflection would always act so as to justify his preference of his son in law to his nephew hey vivian lord glistonbury paused for an answer vivian cut himself as he was shaving and was glad of a moments reprieve instead of answering he only exclaimed cursed razor cut myself my lord wont you sit down will you do me the honour to lord glistonbury seated himself and in regular order with his tiresome parade of expletives went through all the arguments that could be adduced to prove the expediency of vivians taking this place and assisting him as he had taken it for granted his son in law would on such an occasion the letters of the great and little men who had negotiated the business of the marquisate were then produced and an account given of all that had passed in confidence and lord glistonbury finished by saying that the affair was absolutely concluded he having passed his word and pledged his honour for vivian that he would not have spoken or acted for him if he had not felt that he was when acting for his son in law in fact acting for himself his second self that there had been no time to wait no possibility of consulting vivian that the whole plan was suggested yesterday in two hours after the house broke up and was arranged in the evening that search and inquiries had been made every where for vivian but as he could not be found lord glistonbury said he had ventured to decide for him and as he hoped for his interest and for that of the family and the thing now done could not be undone his lordships word was sacred and could not be retracted vivian in a feeble irresolute tone asked if there was no possibility of his being allowed to decline the place that was offered him and suggested that he could take a middle course to avoid voting against his lordships wishes he could and he believed that he would accept of the chiltern hundreds and go out of parliament for the session lord glistonbury remonstrated against what he termed the madness of the scheme a man like you my dear vivian who have distinguished yourself so much already in opposition who will distinguish yourself so much more hereafter in place and in power no said vivian rising as he finished shaving himself no my lord i shall never more distinguish myself if i abandon the principles i believe to be just and true what eloquence i have if i have any has arisen from my being in earnest i shall speak ill i shall not be able to speak at all when i get up against my conscience oh said lord glistonbury laughing your romantic patriotism may be very nice in its feelings but believe me it will not deprive you of the use of your speech look at every one of the fine orators of our times and name me one if you can who has not spoken and spoken equally well on both sides of the house ay and on both sides of most political questions come come youll find you will get on quite as well as they got on before you hey you will find that i shall be of no use to you that i shall be a dead weight on your hands you a dead weight you who are formed to be now really without flattery you know theres no occasion for flattery between you and me to be the soul and in time the head of a party stay i know all you are going to say but give me leave to judge you know theres my own nephew a very clever young man no doubt he is allowed to be and yet you see i make no comparison between you i assure you i am a judge in these matters and you see the house has confirmed my judgment and what is more for i can keep nothing from you if it wont make you too vain and make you set too high a price upon yourself which will be very troublesome in the present case but i say be that as it may i will frankly own to you that i believe you have been of essential service in procuring me this great favourite object of my life the marquisate i my lord impossible for i never took the slightest step toward procuring it pardon me you took the most effectual step without knowing it perhaps you spoke so well in opposition that you made it the interest of ministry to muzzle you and there was no way so effectual of getting at you as through me i being your father in law and you my heir you dont see the secret concatenation of these things with a glance as i do who have been used to them so long and there was no way of coming to the point with me without the marquisate that was my sine qua non and you see i gained my point by your means chiefly i am free to allow though marmaduke would gladly persuade me it was by his negotiating but i do you justice i did you justice too in more than words when i stipulated for that place for you which in fact i knew you could not go on much longer without so my dear vivian all this explained to our mutual satisfaction we have nothing more to do but to shake hands upon it and go down stairs for i have engaged myself and secretary to breakfast with you and he has full powers and is to carry back our capitulation and continued lord glistonbury looking out of the window heres our friends carriage oh my lord it is not yet too late cried vivian it may yet be arranged otherwise is there no way no possibility a loud knock at the house door i wish to heaven my lord so do i wish to heaven with all my soul that you would finish this nonsense my dear vivian and come down to breakfast come come come hey hey hey this is absolutely too ridiculous and i must go if you dont only consider a political breakfast of this nature lord glistonbury hurried down stairs reluctantly and with a heavy heart and repugnant conscience vivian followed at this instant he wished for russell to prevent what he knew would be the consequence of this interview but russell was absent the keeper of his conscience the supporter of his resolution was not at hand woe to him who is not the keeper of his own conscience the supporter of his own resolution the result of this political breakfast was just what every reader who knows the world but half as well as lord glistonbury knew it has probably long since anticipated the capitulation of the patriots of the glistonbury band with vivian at their head was settled lord glistonbury lost no character by this transaction for he had none to lose he was quite at his ease or quite callous but vivian bartered for a paltry accommodation of his pecuniary difficulties a reputation which stood high in the public opinion which was invaluable in his own which was his last stake of happiness he knew this he felt it with all the anguish of exquisite but useless sensibility lord glistonbury and his new friend secretary who was a man of wit as well as a politician rallied vivian upon his gravity and upon his evident depression of spirits really my dear vivian cried lord glistonbury my patience is now exhausted and i must not let you expose yourself here before our friend as a novice hey hey why will you never open your eyes and see the world as it is why what did you never read the fable of the dog and his masters meat well it is come to that now in england and he is a foolish dog indeed who when he cant save the meat wont secure his share hey his lordship and the secretary laughed in concert look how vivian preserves his solemnity continued lord glistonbury and he really looks as if he was surprised at us my dear vivian it requires all my knowledge of your bonne foi to believe that you are in earnest and not acting the part of a patriot of older times oh cried the secretary with a facetious air mr vivian assuredly knows as well as we do that a patriot is a fool in evry age whom all lord chamberlains allow the stage but off the stage we lay aside heroics or how should we ever get on did you hear my lord continued the secretary turning to lord glistonbury that there is another blue riband fallen in to us by the death of lord g i had a great regard for poor lord g many applications i suppose for the vacant riband from the vacant riband they went on to talk over this mans pension and the other mans job and considered who was to get such and such a place when such and such a person should resign or succeed to something better then all the miserable mysteries of ministerial craft were unveiled to vivians eyes he had read he had heard he had believed that public affairs were conducted in this manner but he had never till now actually seen it he was really novice enough still to feel surprise at finding that after all the fine professions made on all sides the main the only object of these politicians was to keep their own or to get into the places of others vivian felt every moment his disgust and his melancholy increase and it is with these people i have consented to act and am i to be hurried along by this stream of corruption to infamy and oblivion then russell vivian resolved to retract the engagement he had just made with lord glistonbury and the secretary and he waited only for a pause in their conversation to explain himself but before any pause occurred more company came in the secretary hurried away saying to vivian who would have stopped him at the door oh my dear sir every thing is settled now and you must be with us in the house to night and you will find the whole business will go on as smoothly as possible if gentlemen will but act together and strengthen the hands of government i beg pardon for breaking away but so many people are waiting for me and any thing further we can settle when we meet in the house lord glistonbury also refused to listen to farther explanations said that all was settled and that it was impossible to make any recantations chapter xv the hour of going to the house of commons at length arrived lord glistonbury saw that vivian was so much out of spirits and in such confusion of mind that he began to fear that our heros own account of himself was just and that he would not be able to command ideas or even words when he was to speak in opposition to what he called his principles and his conscience this son of mine instead of being our great apollo will be a dead weight on our hands unless we can contrive to raise his spirits so to raise his spirits lord glistonbury accompanied him to the coffee room of the house and insisted upon his taking some refreshment before he should attempt to speak his lordship fortified him with bumper after bumper till at last vivian came up to the speaking point he took his seat in his new place in the house and endeavouring to brave away the sense of shame rose to speak notwithstanding the assistance of the wine and the example of mr marmaduke lidhurst who spoke before him with undaunted assurance vivian could scarcely get on with a hesitating confused inconsistent speech uttered in so low and indistinct a voice that the reporters in the gallery complained that they could not catch this honourable members meaning or that his words did not reach them conscious of his failure and still more conscious of its cause he retired again to the coffee room as soon as he had finished speaking and again lord glistonbury plied him with wine saying that he would find he would do very well in reply presently it happened that lord glistonbury was called away vivian remained mr wharton with a party of his friends entered the coffee room wharton seemed much heated both with wine and anger he was talking eagerly to the gentlemen with him and he pronounced the words infamous conduct shabby paltry fellow so loud that all the coffee room turned to listen colonel s a gentleman who was one of whartons party but who had a good opinion of vivian at this moment took him by the arm and drawing him aside whispered in confidence that he was persuaded there had been some mistake in the arrangements which as it was reported lord glistonbury had just made with the ministry for that mr wharton and many of his lordships former party complained of having been shamefully deserted and to break our word and honour to our party is a thing no gentleman can do wharton had a direct promise from his lordship that he never would come in till he should come in along with him and now it is confidently said that lord glistonbury has made his bargain for his own marquisate and provided only for himself his nephew and his son in law thrown into the utmost consternation by the idea of this double forfeiture of honour this breach both of public and private faith vivian after thanking colonel s for his friendly manner of communicating this information and declaring that the transaction was totally unknown to him begged that the colonel would do him the favour and the justice to be present when he should require an explanation from lord glistonbury to this colonel s consented and they hastened in search of his lordship his lordship was not to be found but mr marmaduke lidhurst was however in the coffee room and upon vivians referring to him he could not deny the truth of the charge though he used all his powers of circumlocution to evade giving a direct answer the shame the indignation that rapidly succeeded to each other in vivians countenance sufficiently convinced colonel s that he had no share in the private part of this disgraceful transaction and he very handsomely assured vivian that he would set the matter in its true point of view with his friends marmaduke soon found a pretence to withdraw some member was speaking in the house whom he must hear he said and away he went at this moment mr wharton who was walking down the room with his friends passed by vivian and as he passed said that private vices are public benefits we all know but that public vices are private benefits some of us alas have yet to learn but id have that little whiffling most noble and puissant prince expectant his majestys right trusty and entirely beloved cousin elect know that plain bob wharton is not a man to be duped and deserted with impunity whom does he mean what does he mean whispered some of the bystanders what prince is he talking of which of the princes oh none of the princes replied another you know most noble and puissant prince is the title of a marquis and our right trusty and entirely beloved cousin the style in which the king writes to him but who is this marquis expectant dont you know lord glistonbury but some of his lordships friends ought to take it up surely hush his son in law will hear you where there dont look vivian was with reason so much exasperated by the treacherous duplicity of lord glistonburys conduct that he was ill inclined to undertake his lordships defence and determined to leave it to himself or to his nephew yet the whispers operated not a little upon his weakness wharton who was walking with his set up and down the room again came within vivians hearing and as he passed exclaimed public vice and public virtue precious well matched pair who is public vice and who is public virtue said one of whartons companions dont you know replied wharton the heir at law and the son in law on hearing this speech vivian who knew that he was one of the persons to whom it alluded started forward to demand an explanation from wharton but colonel s held him back you are not called upon by any means to take notice of this said the colonel wharton did not address himself to you and though he might mean what he said for you yet he speaks under a false impression and besides he is not quite sober leave it to me and i will settle it all to your satisfaction before to morrow vivian listened unwillingly and uneasily to the friendly counsel he was more hurt than he had ever before felt himself by any of whartons sarcasms because there was now in them a mixture of truth and a man seldom feels more irritable than when he is conscious that he is partly to blame and apprehensive that others will think him more blameable than he really is his irritability was increased by the whispers he had heard and the looks he now perceived among the bystanders the voice the opinion of numbers the fear of what others would think or say operated against his better judgment come said colonel s let us go and see what they are doing in the house vivian refused to stir saying that it would be leaving the field to wharton wharton at this instant repassed and still running the changes with half intoxicated wit upon the same ideas reiterated public vice we all knew where that would end in these days in public honours but none of you would believe me when i told you where public virtue would end in private treachery thats neat thats strong faith thats home whispered some one mr wharton cried vivian going up to him i could not help hearing what you said just now did you intend it for me you heard it it seems sir and that is sufficient replied wharton in an insolent tone as to what i meant i presume it is pretty evident but if you think it requires any explanation i am as ready to give as you can be to ask it the sooner the better then sir said vivian the two gentlemen walked away together whilst the spectators exclaimed very spirited indeed very right very proper vivian could do no less than call him out but after all what was the quarrel about which of them was to blame long before these points were settled the challenge was given and accepted colonel s who followed vivian and wharton endeavoured to set things to rights by explaining that vivian had been deceived by lord glistonbury and kept totally in the dark respecting the negotiation for the marquisate but wharton aware that by taking up the matter immediately in such a spirited way he should do himself infinite honour with his party and with that majority of the world who think that the greatest merit of a man is to stand to be shot at was not at all willing to listen to these representations colonel s declared that were he in mr whartons place he should without hesitation make an apology to mr vivian and publicly acknowledge that what he said in the coffee room was spoken under a false impression which a plain statement of facts had totally removed but wharton disdained all terms of accommodation his policy pride and desire of revenge all conspired to produce that air of insolent determination to fight which with some people would obtain the glorious name of courage by this sort of courage can men of the most base and profligate characters often put themselves in a moment upon an equal footing with men of principle and virtue it was settled that mr wharton and vivian should meet at eight oclock the next morning in a field near town colonel s consented to be vivians second russell was not yet returned not expected till ten the next day left to his cool reflection vivian thought with horror of the misery into which the event of this duel might involve all with whom he was connected and all who were attached to him the affair was of course to be kept a secret from all at glistonbury house where vivian was engaged to dine with a large ministerial party he went home to dress hoping to have a quarter of an hour to himself but on entering his own dressing room he to his surprise and mortification found his wife seated there waiting for him with a face of anxious expectation a case of newly set diamonds on a table beside her i thought you were at your fathers my dear are you not to be at glistonbury house to day said vivian no replied lady sarah surely mr vivian you know that my father gives a political dinner and i suppose you are to be there oh yes cried vivian i did not know what i was saying i am to be there and must dress looking at his watch for i have no time to spare be that as it may i must intrude upon your time for a few minutes said lady sarah vivian stood impatiently attentive whilst lady sarah seemed to find it difficult to begin some speech which she had prepared women i know have nothing to do with politics she began in a constrained voice but suddenly quitting her air and tone of constraint she started up and exclaimed oh my dear dear husband what have you done no no i cannot will not believe it till i hear it from your own lips what is the matter my dear lady sarah you astonish and almost alarm me said vivian endeavouring to preserve composure of countenance i will not heaven forbid that i should alarm you as i have been alarmed said lady sarah commanding her voice again to a tone of tranquillity i ought and if i were not weak should be convinced that there is no reason for alarm there has been some mistake no doubt and i have been to blame for listening to idle reports let me however state the facts half an hour ago i was at grays the jewellers to call for my poor mothers diamonds which you know he has reset yes well and whilst i was in the shop a party of gentlemen came in all of them unknown to me and of course i was equally unknown to them for they began to speak of you in a manner in which none knowing me could venture in my presence they said i cannot bear to repeat or to think of what they said you cannot have bartered your public reputation for a marquisate for my father you cannot have done that which is dishonourable you cannot have deserted your party for a paltry place for yourself you turn pale i wish if it pleased god that i was this moment in my grave heaven forbid my dear lady sarah cried vivian forcing a smile and endeavouring to speak in a tone of raillery why should you wish to be in your grave because your husband has just got a good warm place live live said he raising her powerless hand for consider as i did and this consideration was of no small weight with me consider my dear sarah how much better you will live for it and you did consider me and that did weigh with you oh this is what i dreaded most cried lady sarah when will you know my real character when will you have confidence in your wife sir when will you know the power the unconquered unconquerable power of her affection for you vivian much struck by the strength of her expression as she uttered these words was a moment silent in astonishment and then could only in an incoherent manner protest that he did know that he had always done justice to her character that he believed in her affection and had the greatest confidence in its power no sir no do not say that which i cannot credit you have not confidence in the power of my affection or you would never have done this thing to save me pain what pain can be so great to me as the thought of my husbands reputation suffering abasement do you think that in comparison with this i your wife could put the loss of a service of plate or house in town or equipage or servants or such baubles as these added she her eyes glancing upon the diamonds then snatching them up take them take them cried she they were my mothers and if her spirit could look down from heaven upon us she would approve my offer she would command your acceptance then here on my knees i conjure you my beloved husband take them sell them sell plate furniture house equipage sell every thing rather than your honour it is sold said vivian in a voice of despair redeem it redeem it at any price cried lady sarah no i will kneel here at your feet you shall not raise me till i have obtained this promise this justice to me to yourself it is too late said vivian writhing in agony never too late cried lady sarah give up the place never too late give up the place write this moment and all will be well for your honour will be saved and the rest is as nothing in my eyes high minded woman cried vivian why did not i hear you sooner why did not i avail myself of your strength of soul use it now hear me now let us waste no time in words here is a pen and ink write my dearest husband and be yourself again you waste the energy of your mind on me cried vivian breaking from lady sarah and striking his forehead violently i am not worthy of such attachment it is done it cannot be undone i am a weak ruined dishonoured wretch i tell you it cannot be undone lady sarah rose and stood in despair then looking up to heaven she was silent for some moments after which approaching her husband she said in an altered calm voice since it cannot be undone i will urge you no more but whether in glory or in shame you are secure that your wife will abide by you vivian embraced her with a tenderness which he had never before felt excellent woman in justice to myself i must tell you cried he that i was deceived into this situation i can say no more at this moment a servant knocked at the door bringing a message from lord glistonbury to say that all the company were assembled and that dinner waited for mr vivian you are not in a fit state to go shall i send an apology to my father oh no i must go cried vivian starting up i must go or it will be thought or it will be suspected i cant explain it to you my dear but i must go i must appear to day and in spirits too if possible he hurried away a servant delivered to lady sarah a number of notes and cards the notes were notes of congratulation from many of her acquaintance upon the report in circulation that her father was immediately to be a marquis the cards were from people who were to be at her assembly that night this was one of her nights which were usually crowded lady sarahs first wish was to write apologies and to say that she was not well enough to see company but recollecting that her husband had said he must appear and in spirits too if possible she thought that it might be more for their interest and according to his wishes that she should see company and that no appearance of dejection should be discerned in his wife she prepared herself accordingly and with a heavy heart walked through her splendid apartments to see whether the decorations had been properly executed in the mean time vivian dined at lord glistonburys with a large ministerial party as soon as he could after dinner vivian got away and lord glistonbury attributed his retiring early to the awkwardness he might feel in the company of men whom he had till now so violently opposed this his lordship thought a foolish young mans feeling which would soon wear away vivian returned home anxious to escape from crowds and to have some hours of leisure to pass alone but the moment he entered his own house he saw the great staircase lined with roses and orange trees he found the rooms lighted up and prepared for company and lady sarah dressed for the first time in all her mothers diamonds good heavens do you see company to night cried he yes for i thought my dear that you would wish it i wish it oh if you knew how i wish to be alone then as no one is yet come i can still shut my doors and order them to say that i am not well enough to see company i am sure it is true shall i no my dear it is too late said vivian i am afraid it is impossible for you to do that not impossible if you wish it well do as you please which is most for your interest i have no other pleasure you are too good to me and i fear i shall never have it in my power to show you any gratitude but decide which is best to be done my dear said lady sarah why my dear i believe you judged rightly see your friends and make the best of it but i can appear only for a moment i have business of consequence letters papers that must be finished to night and i must go now to my study you shall not be interrupted said lady sarah i will exert myself as much as possible a tremendous knock at the door vivian passed through the saloon and gained his study where after remaining for some time in painful reflection he was roused by hearing the clock strike twelve he recollected that he had several arrangements to make in his affairs this night and that it was incumbent on him to sign and execute a will which had been for some time in his possession with certain blanks not yet filled up his wife was by his marriage settlements amply provided for but he inserted in his will some clauses which he thought would add to her peculiar comfort and took care to word them so that his respect and esteem should be known hereafter to all the world and that if he died he should leave her the consolation of knowing that his last feelings for her were those of gratitude and affection to his mother he left all that was in his power to contribute to the ease of her declining years often obliged to pause whilst he wrote overcome by the thoughts of what her grief would be if he died he left his friend russell in remainder to a considerable part of his estate and he was just adding the bequest of certain books which they had read together in his better days when the door of the study suddenly opened and his mother entered what is all this cried she immersed in papers at such a time as this i so hate crowded assemblies said vivian huddling his papers together and advancing to meet his mother so do i said lady mary but i have been waiting with exemplary patience where i was stationed by lady sarah at the card table every instant expecting your arrival that i might have a few minutes conversation with you and inquire how matters went on at the house and congratulate before she had finished the word congratulate she stopped short for she had by this time a full view of her sons countenance and she knew that countenance so well that it was impossible to disguise it so as to deceive her maternal penetration my dear son said she something is going wrong i conjure you tell me what is the matter her eye glanced upon the parchments and she saw that it was a will vivian forced a laugh and asked her if she had the weakness some people felt of disliking to see a will or of fancying that a man was going to die if he made his will then to quiet her apprehensions and to put a stop to her farther inquiries he threw aside his papers and returned with her to the company where he exerted himself to appear as gay as the occasion required lord glistonbury who had called in for a few moments was now playing the great man as well as his total want of dignity of mind and manners would permit he was answering in whispers questions about his marquisate and sustaining with all his might his new part of the friend of government every thing conspired to strike vivian with melancholy yet he constrained himself so far that his charming spirits delighted all who were uninterested in observing any but the external signs of gaiety but his mother saw that his vivacity was forced she made inquiries from all the gentlemen of her acquaintance about what had passed the preceding day both at the house of commons and to day at the dinner at lord glistonburys but those who had been at lord glistonburys dinner assured her that every thing had been as amicable as could be and his ministerial friends said that every thing had gone on as smoothly as possible at the house of what had passed between mr wharton and vivian in the coffee room nobody could give her an account baffled but not satisfied the anxious mother sent to the hotel where mr russell lodged to inquire whether he was returned to town and to beg to see him immediately from him she thought she should learn the truth or by his influence over her son she hoped that if there was any danger of a quarrel it might be in time prevented her servant however brought word that mr russell was not expected from the country till ten oclock the next morning but that her note would be given to him directly on his arrival she applied herself next to the study of her daughters countenance whilst she asked two or three questions calculated to discover whether lady sarah was under any anxiety about vivian but though lady sarahs countenance exhibited not the slightest variation under this trial yet this tranquillity was by no means decisively satisfactory because whatever might be her internal agitation she knew that lady sarah could maintain the same countenance lady sarah who plainly discerned her mothers anxious curiosity thought it her duty to keep her husbands secrets and imagining that she knew the whole truth was not farther alarmed by these hints nor did they lead her to suspect the real state of the case lady mary was at length tolerably well satisfied by a conversation with her son during the course of which she settled in her imagination that he had only been inserting in his will a bequest to his friend russell and that the depression of his spirits arose from the struggle he had had in determining to vote against his patriotic ideas she rose to depart and vivian as he conducted her down stairs and put her into her carriage could scarcely repress his feelings and he took so tender a leave of her that all her apprehensions revived but there was a cry of lady somebodys carriage and lady marys coachman drove on immediately without giving her time for one word more after his mothers departure vivian instead of returning to the company went to his study and took this opportunity of finishing his will but as the servants were all in attendance at supper he could not get any body to witness it and for this he was obliged to wait till a very late hour when all the company at last departed the rattle of carriages at length died away and when all was silence just as he was about to ring for his witnesses he heard lady sarahs step coming along the corridor towards the study he went out immediately to meet her drew her arm within his affectionately and took two or three turns with her up and down the empty saloon whilst a servant was extinguishing the lights vivians mind was so full that he could not speak and he was scarcely conscious that he had not spoken till lady sarah broke the silence by asking if he had finished his business no my dear i have more to do yet but you will oblige me if you will go to rest you must be fatigued mind and body you seem fatigued almost to death said lady sarah and cannot you finish the remainder of your business as well to morrow no replied vivian it must be finished before to morrow i am bound in duty to finish it before to morrow if it is a point of duty i have no more to say replied lady sarah but continued she in a tone of proud humility but if i might so far intrude upon your confidence as to inquire make no inquiries my dear for i cannot answer any even of yours said vivian and let me beg of you to go to rest my mind will then be more at ease i cannot command my thoughts whilst i am anxious about you and i am anxious more anxious than ever i was in my life about you at this moment you will oblige me if you will go to rest i cannot rest but i will leave you since you desire it i have no idle curiosity good night good night and thank you once more my excellent wife for all your kindness there cannot be a better woman said vivian to himself as she retired why have i not loved her as she deserved to be loved if i live i will do my utmost to make her happy if i live i will yet repair all and if i die she will have but little reason to deplore the loss of such a husband vivian now executed his will wrote several letters of business burnt letters and arranged papers regretted that russell who was to be his executor was not near him made many bitter reflections on the past many good resolutions for the future in case he should survive then overpowered with fatigue of mind slept for some time and was awakened by the clock striking seven by eight oclock he was at the place appointed mr wharton appeared a few minutes afterwards their seconds having measured out the distance they took their ground as vivian had given the challenge wharton had the first fire he fired vivian staggered some paces back fired his pistol into the air and fell the seconds ran to his assistance and raised him from the ground the bullet had entered his chest he stretched out his hand to mr wharton in token of forgiveness and as soon as he could speak desired the seconds to remember that it was he who gave the challenge and that he thought he deserved to bear the blame of the quarrel wharton callous as he was seemed struck with pity and remorse he asked what friends vivian would wish to have apprised of his situation a surgeon was in attendance vivian faint from loss of blood just pronounced russells name and the name of the hotel where he was to be found adding nobody else wharton rode off undertaking to find mr russell and vivian was carried into a little public house by the orders of the surgeon who thought that he could not bear the motion of a carriage wharton met mr russell who was coming from town he had come to london earlier than he had intended and in consequence of lady mary vivians note which he had received immediately on his arrival had made such inquiries as convinced him that her apprehensions were just and having discovered the place where the parties were to meet he had hastened thither in hopes of preventing the fatal event the moment he saw mr wharton he knew that he was too late without asking any other question than is vivian alive he pressed forwards the surgeon who was the next person he saw gave him no hopes of his friends recovery but said he might last till night or linger perhaps for a day or two vivian had by this time recovered his senses and his speech but when russell entered the room where he lay he was so much struck by the grief in his countenance that he could not recollect any one of the many things he had to say russell the firm russell was now quite overcome yes my dear friend said vivian this is the end of all your care of all your hopes of me oh my poor poor mother what will become of her where can we find consolation for her you and selina sidney you know how fond my mother was of her how fond she was of my mother till i the cause of evil to all my friends separated them you must reunite them you must repair all this hope this hope of your happiness my beloved friend will soothe my last moments how much happier selina will be with you than russell sobbed aloud yes yield to your feelings for i know how strong they are said vivian you that have always felt more for me than i have ever felt for myself but it is well for you that my life ends for i have never been any thing but a torment and a disgrace to you and yet i had good dispositions but there is no time for regret about myself i have others to think of better worth thinking of vivian called for pen ink and paper had himself raised in his bed and supported whilst he wrote to selina and to his mother do not stop me cried he to russell it is the only act of friendship the only thing i can do in this world now with pleasure and let me do it his notes contained nearly what he had just said to russell he put them open into his friends hand then good natured to the last vivian took up his pen again with no small difficulty and wrote a few affectionate words to his wife she well deserves this from me said he be a friend to her russell when i am gone she will i know want consolation after russell had assured him that he would do all he desired vivian said i believe there is no one else in the world who will regret my death except perhaps lady julia lidhurst how generous she was to forgive me tell her i remembered it when i was dying weakness weakness of mind the cause of all my errors oh russell how well you knew me from the first but all is over now my experience can be of no use to me every thing swims before my eyes one comfort is i have not the blood of a fellow creature to answer for my greatest error was making that profligate man my friend he was my ruin i little thought a few years ago that i should die by his hand but i forgive him as i hope to be forgiven myself is the clergyman who was sent for come my dear russell this would be too severe a task for you he is come then let me see him vivian was left for some time to his private devotions the clergyman afterwards summoned russell to return he found his friend calmed and resigned vivian stretched out his hand thanked him once more and expired oh worthy of a better fate thought russell with such a heart with such talents and so young with only one fault of character oh my friend is it all over and all in vain vivians mother and widow arrived just at this moment and russell and lord glistonbury who followed breathless could not stop them from entering the apartment the mothers grief bordered on distraction but it found relief in tears and cries lady sarah shed no tear and uttered no exclamation but advancing insensible of all opposition to the bed on which her dead husband lay tried whether there was any pulse any breath left then knelt down beside him in silent devotion lord glistonbury striking his forehead continually and striding up and down the room repeated i killed him i killed him i was the cause of his death my victim my victim but take her away take her away i cannot for mercys sake force her away mr russell there is no need of force said lady sarah rising as her father approached i am going to leave my husband for ever then turning to mr russell she inquired if his friend had left any message or letter for her desired to see the letter retired with it still without shedding a tear a few hours afterwards was taken ill and before night was delivered of a dead son lady sarah survived but has never since appeared in what is called the world footnotes it is to be regretted that a word used in the days of charles ii and still intelligible in our times should have become obsolete viz the feminine for intriguer an intriguess see the life of lord keeper north whose biographer in speaking of lord keeper bridgeman says and what was worst of all his family was no way fit for that place of chancellor his lady being a most violent intriguess in business had mr walsingham lived in ireland even there he might have found in the dialect of the lower irish both a substantive and a verb which would have expressed his idea the editor once described an individual of the beaumont species to an irish labourer and asked what he would call such a person id call her a policizer i would say she was fond of policizing life of admiral roddam monthly magazine this reminds us of an expression of charles the second it is very strange that every one of my friends keeps a tame knave note by the editor young wild ducks note by the editor it is much to be regretted that the original papers belonging to this correspondence including all the notes and letters which mrs beaumont either wrote herself or those still more important which she caused to be written by her confidential amanuensis which would doubtless form all together a body of domestic diplomacy equally curious and useful are irrecoverably lost to the world after the most diligent search the editor is compelled to rest under the persuasion that they must all have been collected and committed to the flames by the too great prudence of the principal party concerned had they been trusted to the discretion of a friend the public
