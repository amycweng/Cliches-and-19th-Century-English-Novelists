chapter v chapter vi chapter vii chapter viii chapter ix chapter x chapter xi chapter xii chapter xiii chapter xiv chapter xv chapter xvi chapter xvii notes on the absentee in august we are told she wrote a little play about landlords and tenants for the children of her sister mrs beddoes mr edgeworth tried to get the play produced on the london boards writing to her aunt mrs ruxton maria says sheridan has answered as i foresaw he must that in the present state of this country the lord chamberlain would not license the absentee besides there would be a difficulty in finding actors for so many irish characters the little drama was then turned into a story by mr edgeworths advice patronage was laid aside for the moment and the absentee appeared in its place in the second part of tales of fashionable life we all know lord macaulays verdict upon this favourite story of his the last scene of which he specially admired and compared to the odyssey lord macaulay was not the only notable admirer of the absentee the present writer remembers hearing professor ruskin on one occasion break out in praise and admiration of the book you can learn more by reading it of irish politics he said than from a thousand columns out of bluebooks mrs edgeworth tells us that much of it was written while maria was suffering a misery of toothache miss edgeworths own letters all about this time are much more concerned with sociabilities than with literature we read of a pleasant dance at mrs burkes of philosophers at sport in connemara of cribbage and company and country houses and lord longfords merry anecdotes during her visit to him miss edgeworth who scarcely mentions her own works seems much interested at this time in a book called mary and her cat which she is reading with some of the children little scraps of news i cannot resist quoting one or two of them come in oddly mixed with these personal records of work and family talk there is news of the empress marie louise who is liked not at all by the parisians she is too haughty and sits back in her carriage when she goes through the streets of josephine who is living very happily amusing herself with her gardens and her shrubberies this cidevant empress and kennedy and co the seedsmen are in partnership says miss edgeworth and then among the lists of all the grand people maria meets in london in madame de stael is mentioned as expected she gives an interesting account of an actual visitor peggy langan who was granddaughter to thady in castle rackrent peggy went to england with mrs beddoes and was for thirty years in the service of mrs haldimand we are told and was own sister to simple susan the story of the absentee is a very simple one and concerns irish landlords living in england who ignore their natural duties and station in life and whose chief ambition is to take their place in the english fashionable world the grand english ladies are talking of lady clonbrony if you knew all she endures to look speak move breathe like an englishwoman you would pity her said lady langdale yes and you cawnt conceive the peens she teekes to talk of the teebles and cheers and to thank q and with so much teeste to speak pure english said mrs dareville pure cockney you mean said lady langdale lord colambre the son of the lady in question here walks across the room not wishing to listen to any more strictures upon his mother he is the very most charming of walking gentlemen and when stung by conscience he goes off to ireland disguised in a big cloak to visit his fathers tenantry and to judge for himself of the state of affairs all our sympathies go with him on his way he stops at tusculum scarcely less well known than its classical namesake he is entertained by mrs raffarty that esthetical lady who is determined to have a little taste of everything at tusculum she leads the way into a little conservatory and a little pinery and a little grapery and a little aviary and a little pheasantry and a little dairy for show and a little cottage for ditto with a grotto full of shells and a little hermitage full of earwigs and a little ruin full of lookingglass to enlarge and multiply the effect of the gothic but you could only put your head in because it was just fresh painted and though there had been a fire ordered in the ruin all night it had only smoked as they proceeded and walked through the grounds from which mrs raffarty though she had done her best could not take that which nature had given she pointed out to my lord a happy moving termination consisting of a chinese bridge with a fisherman leaning over the rails on a sudden the fisherman was seen to tumble over the bridge into the water the gentlemen ran to extricate the poor fellow while they heard mrs raffarty bawling to his lordship to beg he would never mind and not trouble himself when they arrived at the bridge they saw the man hanging from part of the bridge and apparently struggling in the water but when they attempted to pull him up they found it was only a stuffed figure which had been pulled into the stream by a real fish which had seized hold of the bait the dinnerparty is too long to quote but it is written in miss edgeworths most racy and delightful vein of fun one more little fact should not be omitted in any mention of the absentee one of the heroines is miss broadhurst the heiress the edgeworth family were much interested soon after the book appeared to hear that a real living miss broadhurst an heiress had appeared upon the scenes and was moreover engaged to be married to sneyd edgeworth one of the eldest sons of the family in the story says mrs edgeworth miss broadhurst selects from her lovers one who unites worth and wit and then she goes on to quote an old epigram of mr edgeworths on himself which concluded withtheres an edge to his wit and theres worth in his heart mr edgeworth who was as usual busy building church spires for himself and other people abandoned his engineering for a time to criticise his daughters story and he advised that the conclusion of the absentee should be a letter from larry the postilion he wrote one she wrote another says mrs edgeworth he much preferred hers which is the admirable finale of the absentee and just about this time lord ross is applied to to frank the edgeworth manuscripts i cannot by any form of words express how delighted i am that you are none of you angry with me writes modest maria to her cousin miss ruxton and that my uncle and aunt are pleased with what they have read of the absentee i long to hear whether their favour continues to the end and extends to the catastrophe that dangerous rock upon which poor authors are wrecked the absentee chapter i are you to be at lady clonbronys gala next week said lady langdale to mrs dareville whilst they were waiting for their carriages in the crushroom of the opera house oh yes everybodys to be there i hear replied mrs dareville your ladyship of course why i dont knowif i possibly can lady clonbrony makes it such a point with me that i believe i must look in upon her for a few minutes they are going to a prodigious expense on this occasion soho tells me the reception rooms are all to be new furnished and in the most magnificent style at what a famous rate those clonbronies are dashing on said colonel heathcock up to anything who are theythese clonbronies that one hears of so much of late said her grace of torcaster irish absentees i know but how do they support all this enormous expense the son will have a prodigiously fine estate when some mr quin dies said mrs dareville yes everybody who comes from ireland will have a fine estate when somebody dies said her grace but what have they at present twenty thousand a year they say replied mrs dareville ten thousand i believe cried lady langdale make it a rule you know to believe only half the world says ten thousand have theypossibly said her grace i know nothing about themhave no acquaintance among the irish torcaster knows something of lady clonbrony she has fastened herself by some means upon him but i charge him not to commit me positively i could not for anybodyand much less for that sort of personextend the circle of my acquaintance now that is so cruel of your grace said mrs dareville laughing when poor lady clonbrony works so hard and pays so high to get into certain circles if you knew all she endures to look speak move breathe like an englishwoman you would pity her said lady langdale yes and you cawnt conceive the peens she teekes to talk of the teebles and cheers and to thank q and with so much teeste to speak pure english said mrs dareville pure cockney you mean said lady langdale but why does lady clonbrony want to pass for english said the duchess oh because she is not quite irish bred and bornonly bred not born said mrs dareville and she could not be five minutes in your graces company before she would tell you that she was henglish born in hoxfordshire she must be a vastly amusing personage i should like to meet her if one could see and hear her incog said the duchess and lord clonbrony what is he nothing nobody said mrs dareville one never even hears of him a tribe of daughters too i suppose no no said lady langdale daughters would be past all endurance theres a cousin though a grace nugent said mrs dareville that lady clonbrony has with her best part of her too said colonel heathcock dd fine girlnever saw her look better than at the opera tonight fine complexion as lady clonbrony says when she means a high colour said lady langdale grace nugent is not a ladys beauty said mrs dareville has she any fortune colonel pon honour dont know said the colonel theres a son somewhere is not there said lady langdale dont know pon honour replied the colonel yesat cambridgenot of age yet said mrs dareville bless me here is lady clonbrony come back i thought she was gone half an hour ago mamma whispered one of lady langdales daughters leaning between her mother and mrs dareville who is that gentleman that passed us just now which way towards the door there now mamma you can see him he is speaking to lady clonbronyto miss nugent now lady clonbrony is introducing him to miss broadhurst i see him now said lady langdale examining him through her glass a very gentlemanlikelooking young man indeed not an irishman i am sure by his manner said her grace heathcock said lady langdale who is miss broadhurst talking to eh now reallypon honourdont know replied heathcock and yet he certainly looks like somebody one certainly should know pursued lady langdale though i dont recollect seeing him anywhere before really now was all the satisfaction she could gain from the insensible immovable colonel however her ladyship after sending a whisper along the line gained the desired information that the young gentleman was lord colambre son only son of lord and lady clonbronythat he was just come from cambridgethat he was not yet of agethat he would be of age within a yearthat he would then after the death of somebody come into possession of a fine estate by the mothers side and therefore catrine my dear said she turning round to the daughter who had first pointed him out you understand we should never talk about other peoples affairs no mamma never i hope to goodness mamma lord colambre did not hear what you and mrs dareville were saying how could he child he was quite at the other end of the world i beg your pardon maam he was at my elbow close behind us but i never thought about him till i heard somebody say my lord good heavens i hope he didnt hear but for my part i said nothing cried lady langdale and for my part i said nothing but what everybody knows cried mrs dareville and for my part i am guilty only of hearing said the duchess do pray colonel heathcock have the goodness to see what my people are about and what chance we have of getting away tonight the duchess of torcasters carriage stops the waya joyful sound to colonel heathcock and to her grace and not less agreeable at this instant to lady langdale who the moment she was disembarrassed of the duchess pressed through the crowd to lady clonbrony and addressing her with smiles and complacency was charmed to have a little moment to speak to hercould not sooner get through the crowdwould certainly do herself the honour to be at her ladyships gala on wednesday while lady langdale spoke she never seemed to see or think of anybody but lady clonbrony though all the time she was intent upon every motion of lord colambre and whilst she was obliged to listen with a face of sympathy to a long complaint of lady clonbronys about mr sohos want of taste in ottomans she was vexed to perceive that his lordship showed no desire to be introduced to her or to her daughters but on the contrary was standing talking to miss nugent his mother at the end of her speech looked round for colambre called him twice before he heardintroduced him to lady langdale and to lady catrine and lady anne and to mrs dareville to all of whom he bowed with an air of proud coldness which gave them reason to regret that their remarks upon his mother and his family had not been made sotto voce lady langdales carriage stops the way lord colambre made no offer of his services notwithstanding a look from his mother incapable of the meanness of voluntarily listening to a conversation not intended for him to hear he had however been compelled by the pressure of the crowd to remain a few minutes stationary where he could not avoid hearing the remarks of the fashionable friends disdaining dissimulation he made no attempt to conceal his displeasure perhaps his vexation was increased by his consciousness that there was some mixture of truth in their sarcasms he was sensible that his mother in some pointsher manners for instancewas oblivious to ridicule and satire in lady clonbronys address there was a mixture of constraint affectation and indecision unusual in a person of her birth rank and knowledge of the world a natural and unnatural manner seemed struggling in all her gestures and in every syllable that she articulateda naturally free familiar goodnatured precipitate irish manner had been schooled and schooled late in life into a sober cold still stiff deportment which she mistook for english a strong hibernian accent she had with infinite difficulty changed into an english tone mistaking reverse of wrong for right she caricatured the english pronunciation and the extraordinary precision of her london phraseology betrayed her not to be a londoner as the man who strove to pass for an athenian was detected by his attic dialect not aware of her real danger lady clonbrony was on the opposite side in continual apprehension every time she opened her lips lest some treacherous a or e some strong r some puzzling aspirate or nonaspirate some unguarded note interrogative or expostulatory should betray her to be an irishwoman mrs dareville had in her mimickry perhaps a little exaggerated as to the teebles and cheers but still the general likeness of the representation of lady clonbrony was strong enough to strike and vex her son he had now for the first time an opportunity of judging of the estimation in which his mother and his family were held by certain leaders of the ton of whom in her letters she had spoken so much and into whose society or rather into whose parties she had been admitted he saw that the renegade cowardice with which she denied abjured and reviled her own country gained nothing but ridicule and contempt he loved his mother and whilst he endeavoured to conceal her faults and foibles as much as possible from his own heart he could not endure those who dragged them to light and ridicule the next morning the first thing that occurred to lord colambres remembrance when he awoke was the sound of the contemptuous emphasis which had been laid on the words irish absentees this led to recollections of his native country to comparisons of past and present scenes to future plans of life young and careless as he seemed lord colambre was capable of serious reflection of naturally quick and strong capacity ardent affections impetuous temper the early years of his childhood passed at his fathers castle in ireland where from the lowest servant to the welldressed dependant of the family everybody had conspired to wait upon to fondle to flatter to worship this darling of their lord yet he was not spoilednot rendered selfish for in the midst of this flattery and servility some strokes of genuine generous affection had gone home to his little heart and though unqualified submission had increased the natural impetuosity of his temper and though visions of his future grandeur had touched his infant thought yet fortunately before he acquired any fixed habits of insolence or tyranny he was carried far away from all that were bound or willing to submit to his commands far away from all signs of hereditary grandeurplunged into one of our great public schoolsinto a new world forced to struggle mind and body with his equals his rivals the little lord became a spirited schoolboy and in time a man fortunately for him science and literature happened to be the fashion among a set of clever young men with whom he was at cambridge his ambition for intellectual superiority was raised his views were enlarged his tastes and his manners formed the sobriety of english good sense mixed most advantageously with irish vivacity english prudence governed but did not extinguish his irish enthusiasm but in fact english and irish had not been invidiously contrasted in his mind he had been so long resident in england and so intimately connected with englishmen that he was not oblivious to any of the commonplace ridicule thrown upon hibernians and he had lived with men who were too well informed and liberal to misjudge or depreciate a sister country he had found from experience that however reserved the english may be in manner they are warm at heart that however averse they may be from forming new acquaintance their esteem and confidence once gained they make the most solid friends he had formed friendships in england he was fully sensible of the superior comforts refinement and information of english society but his own country was endeared to him by early association and a sense of duty and patriotism attached him to ireland and shall i too be an absentee was a question which resulted from these reflectionsa question which he was not yet prepared to answer decidedly in the meantime the first business of the morning was to execute a commission for a cambridge friend mr berryl had bought from mr mordicai a famous london coachmaker a curricle warranted sound for which he had paid a sound price upon express condition that mr mordicai barring accidents should be answerable for all repairs of the curricle for six months in three both the carriage and body were found to be good for nothingthe curricle had been returned to mr mordicainothing had since been heard of it or from himand lord colambre had undertaken to pay him and it a visit and to make all proper inquiries accordingly he went to the coachmakers and obtaining no satisfaction from the underlings desired to see the head of the house he was answered that mr mordicai was not at home his lordship had never seen mr mordicai but just then he saw walking across the yard a man who looked something like a bond street coxcomb but not the least like a gentleman who called in the tone of a master for mr mordicais barouche it appeared and he was stepping into it when lord colambre took the liberty of stopping him and pointing to the wreck of mr berryls curricle now standing in the yard began a statement of his friends grievances and an appeal to common justice and conscience which he unknowing the nature of the man with whom he had to deal imagined must be irresistible mr mordicai stood without moving a muscle of his dark wooden face indeed in his face there appeared to be no muscles or none which could move so that though he had what are generally called handsome features there was all together something unnatural and shocking in his countenance when at last his eyes turned and his lips opened this seemed to be done by machinery and not by the will of a living creature or from the impulse of a rational soul lord colambre was so much struck with this strange physiognomy that he actually forgot much he had to say of springs and wheels but it was no matter whatever he had said it would have come to the same thing and mordicai would have answered as he now did sir it was my partner made that bargain not myself and i dont hold myself bound by it for he is the sleepingpartner only and not empowered to act in the way of business had mr berryl bargained with me i should have told him that he should have looked to these things before his carriage went out of our yard the indignation of lord colambre kindled at these wordsbut in vain to all that indignation could by word or look urge against mordicai he replied maybe so sir the law is open to your friendthe law is open to all men who can pay for it lord colambre turned in despair from the callous coachmaker and listened to one of his more compassionatelooking workmen who was reviewing the disabled curricle and whilst he was waiting to know the sum of his friends misfortune a fat jolly falstaff looking personage came into the yard accosted mordicai with a degree of familiarity which from a gentleman appeared to lord colambre to be almost impossible how are you mordicai my good fellow cried he speaking with a strong irish accent who is this whispered lord colambre to the foreman who was examining the curricle sir terence ofay sir there must be entire new wheels now tell me my tight fellow continued sir terence holding mordicai fast when in the name of all the saints good or bad in the calendar do you reckon to let us sport the suicide mordicai forcibly drew his mouth into what he meant for a smile and answered as soon as possible sir terence sir terence in a tone of jocose wheedling expostulation entreated him to have the carriage finished out of hand ah now mordy my precious let us have it by the birthday and come and dine with us o monday at the hibernian hoteltheres a rare onewill you mordicai accepted the invitation and promised faithfully that the suicide should be finished by the birthday sir terence shook hands upon this promise and after telling a good story which made one of the workmen in the yardan irishmangrin with delight walked off mordicai first waiting till the knight was out of hearing called aloud you grinning rascal mind at your peril and dont let that there carriage be touched dye see till further orders one of mr mordicais clerks with a huge longfeathered pen behind his ear observed that mr mordicai was right in that caution for that to the best of his comprehension sir terence ofay and his principal too were over head and ears in debt mordicai coolly answered that he was well aware of that but that the estate could afford to dip further that for his part he was under no apprehension he knew how to look sharp and to bite before he was bit that he knew sir terence and his principal were leagued together to give the creditors the go by but that clever as they both were at that work he trusted he was their match will you be so good sir to finish making out this estimate for me interrupted lord colambre immediately sir sixtynine pound four and the perch let us seemr mordicai ask him ask paddy about sir terence said the foreman pointing back over his shoulder to the irish workman who was at this moment pretending to be wondrous hard at work however when mr mordicai defied him to tell him anything he did not know paddy parting with an untasted bit of tobacco began and recounted some of sir terence ofays exploits in evading duns replevying cattle fighting sheriffs bribing subs managing cants tricking custodees in language so strange and with a countenance and gestures so full of enjoyment of the jest that whilst mordicai stood for a moment aghast with astonishment lord colambre could not help laughing partly at and partly with his countryman all the yard were in a roar of laughter though they did not understand half of what they heard but their risible muscles were acted upon mechanically or maliciously merely by the sound of the irish brogue mordicai waiting till the laugh was over dryly observed that the law is executed in another guess sort of way in england from what it is in ireland therefore for his part he desired nothing better than to set his wits fairly against such sharks that there was a pleasure in doing up a debtor which none but a creditor could know in a moment sir if youll have a moments patience sir if you please said the slow foreman to lord colambre i must go down the pounds once more and then ill let you have it ill tell you what smithfield continued mr mordicai coming close beside his foreman and speaking very low but with a voice trembling with anger for he was piqued by his foremans doubts of his capacity to cope with sir terence ofay ill tell you what smithfield ill be cursed if i dont get every inch of them into my power you know how you are the best judge sir replied the foreman but i would not undertake sir terence and the question is whether the estate will answer the lot of the debts and whether you know them all for certain i do sir i tell you theres green theres blanchamtheres graytheres sohonaming several moreand to my knowledge lord clonbrony stop sir cried lord colambre in a voice which made mordicai and everybody present starti am his son the devil said mordicai god bless every bone in his body then hes an irishman cried paddy and there was the rason my heart warmed to him from the first minute he come into the yard though i did not know it till now what sir are you my lord colambre said mr mordicai recovering but not clearly recovering his intellects i beg pardon but i did not know you was lord colambre i thought you told me you was the friend of mr berryl i do not see the incompatibility of the assertion sir replied lord colambre taking from the bewildered foremans unresisting hand the account which he had been so long furnishing give me leave my lord said mordicai i beg your pardon my lord perhaps we can compromise that business for your friend mr berryl since he is your lordships friend perhaps we can contrive to compromise and split the difference to compromise and split the difference mordicai thought were favourite phrases and approved hibernian modes of doing business which would conciliate this young irish nobleman and dissipate the proud tempest which had gathered and now swelled in his breast no sir no cried lord colambre holding firm the paper i want no favour from you i will accept of none for my friend or for myself favour no my lord i should not presume to offerbut i should wish if youll allow me to do your friend justice lord colambre recollecting that he had no right in his pride to ding away his friends money let mr mordicai look at the account and his impetuous temper in a few moments recovered by good sense he considered that as his person was utterly unknown to mr mordicai no offence could have been intended to him and that perhaps in what had been said of his fathers debts and distress there might be more truth than he was aware of prudently therefore controlling his feelings and commanding himself he suffered mr mordicai to show him into a parlour to settle his friends business in a few minutes the account was reduced to a reasonable form and in consideration of the partners having made the bargain by which mr mordicai felt himself influenced in honour though not bound in law he undertook to have the curricle made better than new again for mr berryl for twenty guineas then came awkward apologies to lord colambre which he ill endured between ourselves my lord continued mordicai but the familiarity of the phrase between ourselvesthis implication of equalitylord colambre could not admit he moved hastily towards the door and departed chapter ii full of what he had heard and impatient to obtain further information respecting the state of his fathers affairs lord colambre hastened home but his father was out and his mother was engaged with mr soho directing or rather being directed how her apartments should be fitted up for her gala as lord colambre entered the room he saw his mother miss nugent and mr soho standing at a large table which was covered with rolls of paper patterns and drawings of furniture mr soho was speaking in a conceited dictatorial tone asserting that there was no colour in nature for that room equal to the bellyothe fawn which bellyothe fawn he so pronounced that lady clonbrony understood it to be la belle uniforme and under this mistake repeated and assented to the assertion till it was set to rights with condescending superiority by the upholsterer this first architectural upholsterer of the age as he styled himself and was universally admitted to be by all the world of fashion then with full powers given to him spoke en maitre the whole face of things must be changedthere must be new hangings new draperies new cornices new candelabras new everything the upholsterers eye in a fine frenzy rollingbr glances

lights now maam expense expense of the whole impossible to calculate here on the spotbut nothing at all worth your ladyships consideration at another moment lord colambre might have been amused with all this rhodomontade and with the airs and voluble conceit of the orator but after what he had heard at mr mordicais this whole scene struck him more with melancholy than with mirth he was alarmed by the prospect of new and unbounded expense provoked almost past enduring by the jargon and impertinence of this upholsterer mortified and vexed to the heart to see his mother the dupe the sport of such a coxcomb prince of puppiesinsufferablemy own mother lord colambre repeated to himself as he walked hastily up and down the room colambre wont you let us have your judgmentyour teeste said his mother excuse me maam i have no taste no judgment in these things he sometimes paused and looked at mr soho with a strong inclination tobut knowing that he should say too much if he said anything he was silent never dared to approach the council tablebut continued walking up and down the room till he heard a voice which at once arrested his attention and soothed his ire he approached the table instantly and listened whilst grace nugent said everything he wished to have said and with all the propriety and delicacy with which he thought he could not have spoken he leaned on the table and fixed his eyes upon heryears ago he had seen his cousinlast night he had thought her handsome pleasing gracefulbut now he saw a new person or he saw her in a new light he marked the superior intelligence the animation the eloquence of her countenance its variety whilst alternately with arch raillery or grave humour she played off mr soho and made him magnify the ridicule till it was apparent even to lady clonbrony he observed the anxiety lest his mother should expose her own foibleshe was touched by the respectful earnest kindnessthe soft tones of persuasion with which she addressed his motherthe care not to presume upon her own influencethe good sense the taste she showed yet not displaying her superioritythe address temper and patience with which she at last accomplished her purpose and prevented lady clonbrony from doing anything preposterously absurd or exorbitantly extravagant lord colambre was actually sorry when the business was endedwhen mr soho departedfor grace nugent was then silent and it was necessary to remove his eyes from that countenance on which he had gazed unobserved beautiful and graceful yet so unconscious was she of her charms that the eye of admiration could rest upon her without her perceiving itshe seemed so intent upon others as totally to forget herself the whole train of lord colambres thoughts was so completely deranged that although he was sensible there was something of importance he had to say to his mother yet when mr sohos departure left him opportunity to speak he stood silent unable to recollect anything butgrace nugent when grace nugent left the room after some minutes silence and some effort lord colambre said to his mother pray madam do you know anything of sir terence ofay i said lady clonbrony drawing up her head proudly i know he is a person i cannot endure he is no friend of mine i can assure younor any such sort of person i thought it was impossible cried colambre with exultation i only wish your father colambre could say as much added lady clonbrony lord colambres countenance fell again and again he was silent for some time does my father dine at home maam i suppose not he seldom dines at home perhaps maam my father may have some cause to be uneasy about about said lady clonbrony in a tone and with a look of curiosity which convinced her son that she knew nothing of his debts or distresses if he had any about what repeated her ladyship here was no receding and lord colambre never had recourse to artifice about his affairs i was going to say madam but since you know nothing of any difficulties or embarrassments i am persuaded that none exist nay i cawnt tell you that colambre there are difficulties for ready money i confess when i ask for it which surprise me often i know nothing of affairsladies of a certain rank seldom do you know but considering your fathers estate and the fortune i brought him added her ladyship proudly i cawnt conceive it at all grace nugent indeed often talks to me of embarrassments and economy but that poor thing is very natural for her because her fortune is not particularly large and she has left it all or almost all in her uncle and guardians hands i know shes often distressed for odd money to lend me and that makes her anxious is not miss nugent very much admired maam in london of coursein the company she is in you know she has every advantage and she has a natural family air of fashionnot but what she would have got on much better if when she first appeared in lonon she had taken my advice and wrote herself on her cards miss de nogent which would have taken off the prejudice against the iricism of nugent you know and there is a count de nogent i did not know there was any such prejudice maam there may be among a certain set but i should think not among wellinformed wellbred people i big your pawdon colambre surely i that was born in england an henglishwoman bawn must be well infawmed on this pint anyway lord colambre was respectfully silent mother resumed he i wonder that miss nugent is not married that is her own faut entirely she has refused very good offersestablishments that i own i think as lady langdale says i was to blame to allow her to let pass but young ledies till they are twenty always think they can do better mr martingale of martingale proposed for her but she objected to him on account of hes being on the turf and mr st albans l a yearbecausei reelly forget whati believe only because she did not like himand something about principles now there is colonel heathcock one of the most fashionable young men you see always with the duchess of torcaster and that setheathcock takes a vast deal of notice of her for him and yet im persuaded she would not have him tomorrow if he came to the pint and for no reason reelly now that she can give me but because she says hes a coxcomb grace has a tincture of irish pride but for my part i rejoice that she is so difficult for i dont know what i should do without her miss nugent is indeedvery much attached to you mother i am convinced said lord colambre beginning his sentence with great enthusiasm and ending it with great sobriety indeed then shes a sweet girl and i am very partial to her theres the truth cried lady clonbrony in an undisguised irish accent and with her natural warm manner but a moment afterwards her features and whole form resumed their constrained stillness and stiffness and in her english accent she continued before you put my idees out of my head colambre i had something to say to youoh i know what it waswe were talking of embarrassmentsand i wished to do your father the justice to mention to you that he has been uncommon liberal to me about this gala and has reelly given me carteblanche and ive a notionindeed i knowthat it is you colambre i am to thank for this memaam yes did not your father give you any hint no maam i have seen my father but for half an hour since i came to town and in that time he said nothing to meof his affairs but what i allude to is more your affair he did not speak to me of any affairs maamhe spoke only of my horses then i suppose my lord leaves it to me to open the matter to you i have the pleasure to tell you that we have in view for youand i think i may say with more than the approbation of all her familyan alliance oh my dear mother you cannot be serious cried lord colambre you know i am not of years of discretion yeti shall not think of marrying these ten years at least why not nay my dear colambre dont go i begi am serious i assure youand to convince you of it i shall tell you candidly at once all your father told me that now youve done with cambridge and are come to lonon he agrees with me in wishing that you should make the figure you ought to make colambre as sole heirapparent to the clonbrony estate and all that sort of thing but on the other hand living in lonon and making you the handsome allowance you ought to have are both together more than your father can afford without inconvenience he tells me i assure you mother i shall be content no no you must not be content child and you must hear me you must live in a becoming style and make a proper appearance i could not present you to my friends here nor be happy if you did not colambre now the way is clear before you you have birth and title here is fortune ready made you will have a noble estate of your own when old quin dies and you will not be any encumbrance or inconvenience to your father or anybody marrying an heiress accomplishes all this at once and the young lady is everything we could wish besidesyou will meet again at the gala indeed between ourselves she is the grand object of the gala all her friends will come en masse and one should wish that they should see things in proper style you have seen the young lady in question colambremiss broadhurst dont you recollect the young lady i introduced you to last night after the opera the little plain girl covered with diamonds who was standing beside miss nugent in dimonds yes but you wont think her plain when you see more of herthat wears off i thought her plain at firsti hope i hope said lord colambre that you will not take it unkindly of me my dear mother if i tell you at once that i have no thoughts of marrying at presentand that i never will marry for money marrying an heiress is not even a new way of paying old debtsat all events it is one to which no distress could persuade me to have recourse and as i must if i outlive old mr quin have an independent fortune there is no occasion to purchase one by marriage there is no distress that i know of in the case cried lady clonbrony where is your imagination running colambre but merely for your establishment your independence establishment i want noneindependence i do desire and will preserve assure my father my dear mother that i will not be an expense to him i will live within the allowance he made me at cambridgei will give up half of iti will do anything for his conveniencebut marry for money that i cannot do then colambre you are very disobliging said lady clonbrony with an expression of disappointment and displeasure for your father says if you dont marry miss broadhurst we cant live in lonon another winter this saidwhich had she been at the moment mistress of herself she would not have let outlady clonbrony abruptly quitted the room her son stood motionless saying to himself is this my motherhow altered the next morning he seized an opportunity of speaking to his father whom he caught with difficulty just when he was going out as usual for the day lord colambre with all the respect due to his father and with that affectionate manner by which he always knew how to soften the strength of his expressions made nearly the same declarations of his resolution by which his mother had been so much surprised and offended lord clonbrony seemed more embarrassed but not so much displeased when lord colambre adverted as delicately as he could to the selfishness of desiring from him the sacrifice of liberty for life to say nothing of his affections merely to enable his family to make a splendid figure in london lord clonbrony exclaimed thats all nonsensecursed nonsense thats the way we are obliged to state the thing to your mother my dear boy because i might talk her deaf before she would understand or listen to anything else but for my own share i dont care a rush if london was sunk in the salt sea little dublin for my money as sir terence ofay says who is sir terence ofay may i ask sir why dont you know terry ay youve been so long at cambridge i forgot and did you never see terry i have seen him siri met him yesterday at mr mordicais the coachmakers mordicais exclaimed lord clonbrony with a sudden blush which he endeavoured to hide by taking snuff he is a damned rascal that mordicai i hope you didnt believe a word he saidnobody does that knows him i am glad sir that you seem to know him so well and to be upon your guard against him replied lord colambre for from what i heard of his conversation when he was not aware who i was i am convinced he would do you any injury in his power he shall never have me in his power i promise him we shall take care of that but what did he say lord colambre repeated the substance of what mordicai had said and lord clonbrony reiterateddamned rascaldamned rascal ill get out of his hands ill have no more to do with him but as he spoke he exhibited evident symptoms of uneasiness moving continually and shifting from leg to leg like a foundered horse he could not bring himself positively to deny that he had debts and difficulties but he would by no means open the state of his affairs to his sonno father is called upon to do that said he to himself none but a fool would do it lord colambre perceiving his fathers embarrassment withdrew his eyes respectfully refrained from all further inquiries and simply repeated the assurance he had made to his mother that he would put his family to no additional expense and that if it was necessary he would willingly give up half his allowance not at allnot at all my dear boy said his father i would rather cramp myself than that you should be cramped a thousand times over but it is all my lady clonbronys nonsense if people would but as they ought stay in their own country live on their own estates and kill their own mutton money need never be wanting for killing their own mutton lord colambre did not see the indispensable necessity but he rejoiced to hear his father assert that people should reside in their own country ay cried lord clonbrony to strengthen his assertion as he always thought it necessary to do by quoting some other persons opinion so sir terence ofay always says and thats the reason your mother cant endure poor terry you dont know terry no you have only seen him but indeed to see him is to know him for he is the most offhand good fellow in europe i dont pretend to know him yet said lord colambre i am not so presumptuous as to form my opinion at first sight oh curse your modesty interrupted lord clonbrony you mean you dont pretend to like him yet but terry will make you like him i defy you not ill introduce you to himhim to you i meanmost warnhearted generous dog upon earthconvivialjovialwith wit and humour enough in his own way to split yousplit me if he has not you need not cast down your eyes colambre whats your objection i have made none sir but if you urge me i can only say that if he has all these good qualities it is to be regretted that he does not look and speak a little more like a gentleman a gentleman he is as much a gentleman as any of your formal prigsnot the exact cambridge cut maybe curse your english education twas none of my advice i suppose you mean to take after your mother in the notion that nothing can be good or genteel but whats english far from it sir i assure you i am as warm a friend to ireland as your heart could wish you will have no reason in that respect at least nor i hope in any other to curse my english education and if my gratitude and affection can avail you shall never regret the kindness and liberality with which you have i fear distressed yourself to afford me the means of becoming all that a british nobleman ought to be gad you distress me now said lord clonbrony and i didnt expect it or i wouldnt make a fool of myself this way added he ashamed of his emotion and whiffling it off you have an irish heart that i see which no education can spoil but you must like terry ill give you time as he said to me when first he taught me to like usquebaugh good morning to you whilst lady clonbrony in consequence of her residence in london had become more of a fine lady lord clonbrony since he left ireland had become less of a gentleman lady clonbrony born an englishwoman disclaiming and disencumbering herself of all the irish in town had by giving splendid entertainments at an enormous expense made her way into a certain set of fashionable company but lord clonbrony who was somebody in ireland who was a great person in dublin found himself nobody in england a mere cipher in london looked down upon by the fine people with whom his lady associated and heartily weary of them he retreated from them altogether and sought entertainment and selfcomplacency in society beneath himindeed both in rank and education but in which he had the satisfaction of feeling himself the first person in company of these associates the first in talents and in jovial profligacy was sir terence ofaya man of low extraction who had been knighted by an irish lordlieutenant in some convivial frolic no one could tell a good story or sing a good song better than sir terence he exaggerated his native brogue and his natural propensity to blunder caring little whether the company laughed at him or with him provided they laughed live and laughlaugh and live was his motto and certainly he lived on laughing as well as many better men can contrive to live on a thousand a year lord clonbrony brought sir terence home with him next day to introduce him to lord colambre and it happened that on this occasion terence appeared to peculiar disadvantage because like many other people il gatoit lesprit quil avoit en voulant avoir celui quil navoit pas having been apprised that lord colambre was a fine scholar fresh from cambridge and being conscious of his own deficiencies of literature instead of trusting to his natural talents he summoned to his aid with no small effort all the scraps of learning he had acquired in early days and even brought before the company all the gods and goddesses with whom he had formed an acquaintance at school though embarrassed by this unusual encumbrance of learning he endeavoured to make all subservient to his immediate design of paying his court to lady clonbrony by forwarding the object she had most anxiously in viewthe match between her son and miss broadhurst and so miss nugent said he not daring with all his assurance to address himself directly to lady clonbronyand so miss nugent you are going to have great doings im told and a wonderful grand gala theres nothing in the wide world equal to being in a good handsome crowd no later now than the last ball at the castle that was before i left dublin miss nugentthe apartments owing to the popularity of my ladylieutenant was so throngso throngthat i remember very well in the doorway a ladyand a very genteel woman she was too though a stranger to mesaying to me sir your fingers in my ear i know it madam says i but i cant take it out till the crowd give me elbow room but its gala im thinking of now i hear you are to have the golden venus my lady clonbrony wont you sir this freezing monosyllable notwithstanding sir terence pursued his course fluently the golden venussure miss nugent you that are so quick cant but know i would apostrophise miss broadhurst that is but that wont be long so i hope my lord colambre have you seen much yet of that young lady no sir then i hope you wont be long so i hear great talk now of the venus of medicis and the venus of this and that with the florence venus and the sable venus and that other venus thats washing of her hair and a hundred other venuses some good some bad but be that as it will my lord trust a foolye may when he tells you truththe golden venus is the only one on earth that can stand or that will stand through all ages and temperatures for gold rules the court gold rules the camp and men below and heaven above heaven above take care terry do you know what youre saying interrupted lord clonbrony do i dont i replied terry deny if you please my lord that it was for a golden pippin that the three goddesses fitand that the hippomenes was about golden applesand did not hercules rob a garden for golden applesand did not the pious eneas himself take a golden branch with him to make himself welcome to his father in hell said sir terence winking at lord colambre why terry you know more about books than i should have suspected said lord clonbrony nor you would not have suspected me to have such a great acquaintance among the goddesses neither would you my lord but apropos before we quit of what material think ye was that same venuss famous girdle now that made roses and lilies so quickly appear why what was it but a girdle of sterling gold ill engagefor gold is the only true thing for a young man to look after in a wife sir terence paused but no applause ensued let them talk of cupids and darts and the mother of the loves and graces minerva may sing odes and dythambrics or whatsoever her wisdomship pleases let her sing or let her say shell never get a husband in this world or the other without she had a good thumping fortin and then shed go off like wildfire no no terry there youre out minerva has too bad a character for learning to be a favourite with gentlemen said lord clonbrony tutdont tell meid get her off before you could say jack robinson and thank you too if she had fifty thousand down or a thousand a year in land would you have a man so dd nice as to balk when house and land is agoingagoingagoingbecause of the encumbrance of a little learning i never heard that miss broadhurst was anything of a learned lady miss broadhurst said grace nugent how did you get round to miss broadhurst oh by the way of tipperary said lord colambre i beg your pardon my lord it was apropos to a good fortune which i hope will not be out of your way even if you went by tipperary she has besides l in the funds a clear landed property of l per annum well some people talk of morality and some of religion but give me a little snug property but my lord ive a little business to transact this morning and must not be idling and indulging myself here so bowing to the ladies he departed really i am glad that man is gone said lady clonbrony what a relief to ones ears i am sure i wonder my lord how you can bear to carry that strange creature always about with youso vulgar as he is he diverts me said lord clonbrony while many of your correctmannered fine ladies or gentlemen put me to sleep what signifies what accent people speak in that have nothing to sayhey colambre lord colambre from respect to his father did not express his opinion but his aversion to sir terence ofay was stronger even than his mothers though lady clonbronys detestation of him was much increased by perceiving that his coarse hints about miss broadhurst had operated against her favourite scheme the next morning at breakfast lord clonbrony talked of bringing sir terence with him that night to her gala she absolutely grew pale with horror good heavens lady langdale mrs dareville lady pococke lady chatterton lady d lady g his grace of v what would they think of him and miss broadhurst to see him going about with my lord clonbronyit could not be no her ladyship made the most solemn and desperate protestation that she would sooner give up her gala altogethertie up the knockersay she was sickrather be sick or be dead than be obliged to have such a creature as sir terence ofay at her gala have it your own way my dear as you have everything else cried lord clonbrony taking up his hat and preparing to decamp but take notice if you wont receive him you need not expect me so a good morning to you my lady clonbrony you may find a worse friend in need yet than that same sir terence ofay i trust i shall never be in need my lord replied her ladyship it would be strange indeed if i were with the fortune i brought oh that fortune of hers cried lord clonbrony stopping both his ears as he ran out of the room shall i never hear the end of that fortune when ive seen the end of it long ago during this matrimonial dialogue grace nugent and lord colambre never once looked at each other grace was very diligently trying the changes that could be made in the positions of a chinamouse a cat a dog a cup and a brahmin on the mantelpiece lord colambre as diligently reading the newspaper now my dear colambre said lady clonbrony put down the paper and listen to me let me entreat you not to neglect miss broadhurst tonight as i know that the family come here chiefly on your account my dear mother i never can neglect any deserving young lady and particularly one of your guests but i shall be careful not to do more than not to neglect for i never will pretend what i do not feel but my dear colambre miss broadhurst is everything you could wish except being a beauty perhaps madam said lord colambre fixing his eyes on grace nugent you think that i can see no farther than a handsome face the unconscious grace nugent now made a warm eulogium of miss broadhursts sense and wit and independence of character i did not know that miss broadhurst was a friend of yours miss nugent she is i assure you a friend of mine and as a proof i will not praise her at this moment i will go farther stilli will promise that i never will praise her to you till you begin to praise her to me lord colambre smiled and now listened as if he wished that grace should go on speaking even of miss broadhurst thats my sweet grace cried lady clonbrony oh she knows how to manage these mennot one of them can resist her lord colambre for his part did not deny the truth of this assertion grace added lady clonbrony make him promise to do as we would have him no promises are dangerous things to ask or to give said grace men and naughty children never make promises especially promises to be good without longing to break them the next minute well at least child persuade him i charge you to make my gala go off well thats the first thing we ought to think of now ring the bell and all heads and hands i put in requisition for the gala chapter iii the opening of her gala the display of her splendid receptionrooms the turkish tent the alhambra the pagoda formed a proud moment to lady clonbrony much did she enjoy and much too naturally notwithstanding all her efforts to be stiff and stately much too naturally did she show her enjoyment of the surprise excited in some and affected by others on their first entrance one young very young lady expressed her astonishment so audibly as to attract the notice of all the bystanders lady clonbrony delighted seized both her hands shook them and laughed heartily then as the young lady with her party passed on her ladyship recovered herself drew up her head and said to the company near her poor thing i hope i covered her little naivete properly how new she must be then with wellpractised dignity and halfsubdued selfcomplacency of aspect her ladyship went gliding aboutmost importantly busy introducing my lady this to the sphynx candelabra and my lady that to the trebisond trellice placing some delightfully for the perspective of the alhambra establishing others quite to her satisfaction on seraglio ottomans and honouring others with a seat under the statira canopy receiving and answering compliments from successive crowds of select friends imagining herself the mirror of fashion and the admiration of the whole world lady clonbrony was for her hour as happy certainly as ever woman was in similar circumstances her son looked at her and wished that this happiness could last naturally inclined to sympathy lord colambre reproached himself for not feeling as gay at this instant as the occasion required but the festive scene the blazing lights the universal hubbub failed to raise his spirits as a dead weight upon them hung the remembrance of mordicais denunciations and through the midst of this eastern magnificence this unbounded profusion he thought he saw future domestic misery and ruin to those he loved best in the world the only object present on which his eye rested with pleasure was grace nugent beautifulin elegant and dignified simplicitythoughtless of herselfyet with a look of thought and with an air of melancholy which accorded exactly with his own feelings and which he believed to arise from the same reflections that had passed in his own mind miss broadhurst colambre all the broadhursts said his mother wakening him as she passed by to receive them as they entered miss broadhurst appeared plainly dressedplainly even to singularitywithout any diamonds or ornament brought philippa to you my dear lady clonbrony this figure rather than not bring her at all said puffing mrs broadhurst and had all the difficulty in the world to get her out at all and now ive promised she shall stay but half an hour sore throatterrible cold she took in the morning ill swear for her shed not have come for any one but you the young lady did not seem inclined to swear or even to say this for herself she stood wonderfully unconcerned and passive with an expression of humour lurking in her eyes and about the corners of her mouth whilst lady clonbrony was shocked and gratified and concerned and flattered and whilst everybody was hoping and fearing and busying themselves about hermiss broadhurst youd better sit hereoh for heavens sake miss broadhurst not there miss broadhurst if youll take my opinion and miss broadhurst if i may advise grace nugent cried lady clonbronymiss broadhurst always listens to you do my dear persuade miss broadhurst to take care of herself and let us take her to the inner little pagoda where she can be so warm and so retiredthe very thing for an invalid colambre pioneer the way for us for the crowds immense lady anne and lady catharine h lady langdales daughters were at this time leaning on miss nugents arm and moved along with this party to the inner pagoda there was to be cards in one room music in another dancing in a third and in this little room there were prints and chessboards etc here you will be quite to yourselves said lady clonbrony let me establish you comfortably in this which i call my sanctuarymy snuggerycolambre that little tablemiss broadhurst you play chess colambre youll play with miss broadhurst i thank your ladyship said miss broadhurst but i know nothing of chess but the moves lady catharine you will play and i will look on miss broadhurst drew her seat to the fire lady catharine sat down to play with lord colambre lady clonbrony withdrew again recommending miss broadhurst to grace nugents care after some commonplace conversation lady anne h looking at the company in the adjoining apartment asked her sister how old miss somebody was who passed by this led to reflections upon the comparative age and youthful appearance of several of their acquaintance and upon the care with which mothers concealed the age of their daughters glances passed between lady catharine and lady anne for my part said miss broadhurst my mother would labour that point of secrecy in vain for me for i am willing to tell my age even if my face did not tell it for me to all whom it may concern i am past threeandtwentyshall be fourandtwenty the th of next july threeandtwenty bless me i thought you were not twenty cried lady anne fourandtwenty next julyimpossible cried lady catharine very possible said miss broadhurst quite unconcerned now lord colambre would you believe it can you believe it asked lady catharine yes he can said miss broadhurst dont you see that he believes it as firmly as you and i do why should you force his lordship to pay a compliment contrary to his better judgment or to extort a smile from him under false pretences i am sure he sees that you ladies and i trust he perceives that i do not think the worse of him for this lord colambre smiled now without any false pretence and relieved at once from all apprehension of her joining in his mothers views or of her expecting particular attention from him he became at ease with miss broadhurst shelved a desire to converse with her and listened eagerly to what she said he recollected that grace nugent had told him that this young lady had no common character and neglecting his move at chess he looked up at grace as much as to say draw her out pray but grace was too good a friend to comply with that request she left miss broadhurst to unfold her own character it is your move my lord said lady catharine i beg your ladyships pardon are not these rooms beautiful miss broadhurst said lady catharine determined if possible to turn the conversation into a commonplace safe channel for she had just felt what most of miss broadhursts acquaintance had in their turn felt that she had an odd way of startling people by setting their own secret little motives suddenly before them are not these rooms beautiful beautifulcertainly the beauty of the rooms would have answered lady catharines purpose for some time had not lady anne imprudently brought the conversation back again to miss broadhurst do you know miss broadhurst said she that if i had fifty sore throats i could not have refrained from my diamonds on this gala night and such diamonds as you have now really i could not believe you to be the same person we saw blazing at the opera the other night really could not you lady anne that is the very thing that entertains me i only wish that i could lay aside my fortune sometimes as well as my diamonds and see how few people would know me then might not i grace by the golden rule which next to practice is the best rule in the world calculate and answer that question i am persuaded said lord colambre that miss broadhurst has friends on whom the experiment would make no difference i am convinced of it said miss broadhurst and that is what makes me tolerably happy though i have the misfortune to be an heiress that is the oddest speech said lady anne now i should so like to be a great heiress and to have like you such thousands and thousands at command and what can the thousands upon thousands do for me hearts you know lady anne are to be won only by radiant eyes bought hearts your ladyship certainly would not recommend theyre such poor thingsno wear at all turn them which way you will you can make nothing of them youve tried then have you said lady catharine to my cost very nearly taken in by them half a dozen times for they are brought to me by dozens and they are so made up for sale and the people do so swear to you that its real real love and it looks so like it and if you stoop to examine it you hear it pressed upon you by such elegant oathsby all thats lovelyby all my hopes of happinessby your own charming self why what can one do but look like a fool and believe for these men at the time all look so like gentlemen that one cannot bring oneself flatly to tell them that they are cheats and swindlers that they are perjuring their precious souls besides to call a lover a perjured creature is to encourage him he would have a right to complain if you went back after that oh dear what a move was there cried lady catharine miss broadhurst is so entertaining tonight notwithstanding her sore throat that one can positively attend to nothing else and she talks of love and lovers too with such connaissance de faitcounts her lovers by dozens tied up in truelovers knots loversno no did i say loverssuitors i should have said theres nothing less like a lover a true lover than a suitor as all the world knows ever since the days of penelope dozensnever had a lover in my life and fear with much reason i never shall have one to my mind my lord youve given up the game cried lady catharine but you make no battle it would be so vain to combat against your ladyship said lord colambre rising and bowing politely to lady catharine but turning the next instant to converse with miss broadhurst but when i talked of liking to be an heiress said lady anne i was not thinking of lovers certainly one is not always thinking of lovers you know added lady catharine not always replied miss broadhurst well lovers out of the question on all sides what would your ladyship buy with the thousands upon thousands oh everything if i were you said lady anne rank to begin with said lady catharine still my old objectionbought rank is but a shabby thing but there is so little difference made between bought and hereditary rank in these days said lady catharine i see a great deal still said miss broadhurst so much that i would never buy a title a title without birth to be sure said lady anne would not be so well worth buying and as birth certainly is not to be bought and even birth were it to be bought i would not buy said miss broadhurst unless i could be sure to have with it all the politeness all the noble sentiments all the magnanimityin short all that should grace and dignify high birth admirable said lord colambre grace nugent smiled lord colambre will you have the goodness to put my mother in mind i must go away i am bound to obey but i am very sorry for it said his lordship are we to have any dancing tonight i wonder said lady catharine miss nugent i am afraid we have made miss broadhurst talk so much in spite of her hoarseness that lady clonbrony will be quite angry with us and here she comes my lady clonbrony came to hope to beg that miss broadhurst would not think of running away but miss broadhurst could not be prevailed upon to stay lady clonbrony was delighted to see that her son assisted grace nugent most carefully in shawling miss broadhurst his lordship conducted her to her carriage and his mother drew many happy auguries from the gallantry of his manner and from the young ladys having stayed threequarters instead of half an houra circumstance which lady catharine did not fail to remark the dancing which under various pretences lady clonbrony had delayed till lord colambre was at liberty began immediately after miss broadhursts departure and the chalked mosaic pavement of the alhambra was in a few minutes effaced by the dancers feet how transient are all human joys especially those of vanity even on this long meditated this long desired this gala night lady clonbrony found her triumph incompleteinadequate to her expectations for the first hour all had been compliment success and smiles presently came the buts and the hesitated objections and the damning with faint praise all that could be borne everybody has his tasteand one persons taste is as good as anothers and while she had mr soho to cite lady clonbrony thought she might be well satisfied but she could not be satisfied with colonel heathcock who dressed in black had stretched his fashionable length of limb under the statira canopy upon the snowwhite swandown couch when after having monopolised attention and been the subject of much bad wit about black swans and rare birds and swans being geese and geese being swans the colonel condescended to rise and as mrs dareville said to vacate his couch that couch was no longer whitethe black impression of the colonel remained on the sullied snow eh now really didnt recollect i was in black was all the apology he made lady clonbrony was particularly vexed that the appearance of the statira canopy should be spoiled before the effect had been seen by lady pococke and lady chatterton and lady g lady p and the duke of v and a party of superlative fashionables who had promised to look in upon her but who late as it was had not yet arrived they came in at last but lady clonbrony had no reason to regret for their sake the statira couch it would have been lost upon them as was everything else which she had prepared with so much pains and cost to excite their admiration they came resolute not to admire skilled in the art of making others unhappy they just looked round with an air of apathy ah youve had sohosoho has done wonders for you here vastly wellvastly wellsohos very clever in his way others of great importance came in full of some slight accident that had happened to themselves or their horses or their carriages and with privileged selfishness engrossed the attention of all within their sphere of conversation well lady clonbrony got over all this and got over the history of a letter about a chimney that was on fire a week ago at the duke of vs old house in brecknockshire in gratitude for the smiling patience with which she listened to him his grace of vfixed his glass to look at the alhambra and had just pronounced it to be wellvery well when the dowager lady chatterton made a terrible discoverya discovery that filled lady clonbrony with astonishment and indignationmr soho had played her false what was her mortification when the dowager assured her that these identical alhambra hangings had not only been shown by mr soho to the duchess of torcaster but that her grace had had the refusal of them and had actually rejected them in consequence of sir horace grant the great travellers objecting to some of the proportions of the pillars soho had engaged to make a new set vastly improved by sir horaces suggestions for her grace of torcaster now lady chatterton was the greatest talker extant and she went about the rooms telling everybody of her acquaintanceand she was acquainted with everybodyhow shamefully soho had imposed upon poor lady clonbrony protesting she could not forgive the man for said she though the duchess of torcaster has been his constant customer for ages and his patroness and all that yet this does not excuse him and lady clonbronys being a stranger and from ireland makes the thing worse from irelandthat was the unkindest cut of all but there was no remedy in vain poor lady clonbrony followed the dowager about the rooms to correct this mistake and to represent in justice to mr soho though he had used her so ill that he knew she was an englishwoman the dowager was deaf and no whisper could reach her ear and when lady clonbrony was obliged to bawl an explanation in her car the dowager only repeated in justice to mr sohono no he has not done you justice my dear lady clonbrony and ill expose him to everybody englishwomanno no nosoho could not take you for an englishwoman all who secretly envied or ridiculed lady clonbrony enjoyed this scene the alhambra hangings which had been in one short hour before the admiration of the world were now regarded by every eye with contempt as cast hangings and every tongue was busy declaiming against mr soho everybody declared that from the first the want of proportion had struck them but that they would not mention it till others found it out people usually revenge themselves for having admired too much by afterwards despising and depreciating without mercyin all great assemblies the perception of ridicule is quickly caught and quickly too revealed lady clonbrony even in her own house on her gala night became an object of ridiculedecently masked indeed under the appearance of condolence with her ladyship and of indignation against that abominable mr soho lady langdale who was now for reasons of her own upon her good behaviour did penance as she said for her former imprudence by abstaining even from whispered sarcasms she looked on with penitential gravity said nothing herself and endeavoured to keep mrs dareville in order but that was no easy task mrs dareville had no daughters had nothing to gain from the acquaintance of my lady clonbrony and conscious that her ladyship would bear a vast deal from her presence rather than forego the honour of her sanction mrs dareville without any motives of interest or goodnature of sufficient power to restrain her talent and habit of ridicule free from hope or fear gave full scope to all the malice of mockery and all the insolence of fashion her slings and arrows numerous as they were and outrageous were directed against such petty objects and the mischief was so quick in its aim and its operation that felt but not seen it is scarcely possible to register the hits or to describe the nature of the wounds some hits sufficiently palpable however were recorded for the advantage of posterity when lady clonbrony led her to look at the chinese pagoda the lady paused with her foot on the threshold as if afraid to enter this porcelain elysium as she called itfools paradise she would have said and by her hesitation and by the halfpronounced word suggested the ideanone but belles without petticoats can enter here said she drawing her clothes tight round her fortunately i have but two and lady langdale has but one prevailed upon to venture in she walked on with prodigious care and trepidation affecting to be alarmed at the crowd of strange forms and monsters by which she was surrounded not a creature here that i ever saw before in nature well now i may boast ive been in a real chinese pagoda why yes everything is appropriate here i flatter myself said lady clonbrony and how good of you my dear lady clonbrony in defiance of bulls and blunders to allow us a comfortable english fireplace and plenty of newcastle coal in chinaand a white marbleno white velvet hearthrug painted with beautiful flowersoh the delicate the useful thing vexed by the emphasis on the word useful lady clonbrony endeavoured to turn off the attention of the company lady langdale your ladyships a judge of chinathis vase is an unique i am told i am told interrupted mrs dareville this is the very vase in which b the nabobs father who was you know a china captain smuggled his dear little chinese wife and all her fortune out of cantonpositively actually put the lid on packed her up and sent her off on shipboardtrue true upon my veracity ill tell you my authority with this story mrs dareville drew all attention from the jar to lady clonbronys infinite mortification lady langdale at length turned to look at a vast range of china jars ali baba and the forty thieves exclaimed mrs dareville i hope you have boiling oil ready lady clonbrony was obliged to laugh and to vow that mrs dareville was uncommon pleasant tonight but now said her ladyship let me take you on to the turkish tent having with great difficulty got the malicious wit out of the pagoda and into the turkish tent lady clonbrony began to breathe more freely for here she thought she was upon safe ground everything i flatter myself said she is correct and appropriate and quite picturesque the company dispersed in happy groups or reposing on seraglio ottomans drinking lemonade and sherbet beautiful fatimas admiring or being admiredeverything here quite correct appropriate and picturesque repeated mrs dareville this ladys powers as a mimic were extraordinary and she found them irresistible hitherto she had imitated lady clonbronys air and accent only behind her back but bolder grown she now ventured in spite of lady langdales warning pinches to mimic her kind hostess before her face and to her face now whenever lady clonbrony saw anything that struck her fancy in the dress of her fashionable friends she had a way of hanging her head aside and saying with a peculiar sentimental drawl how prettyhow elegant now that quite suits my teeste this phrase precisely in the same accent and with the head set to the same angle of affectation mrs dareville had the assurance to address to her ladyship apropos to something which she pretended to admire in lady clonbronys costumea costume which excessively fashionable in each of its parts was all together so extraordinarily unbecoming as to be fit for a printshop the perception of this added to the effect of mrs darevilles mimicry was almost too much for lady langdale she could not possibly have stood it but for the appearance of miss nugent at this instant behind lady clonbrony grace gave one glance of indignation which seemed suddenly to strike mrs dareville silence for a moment ensued and afterwards the tone of the conversation was changed salisburyexplain this to me said a lady drawing mr salisbury aside if you are in the secret do explain this to me for unless i had seen it i could not have believed it nay though i have seen it i do not believe it how was that daring spirit laid by what spell by the spell which superior minds always cast on inferior spirits very fine said the lady laughing but as old as the days of leonora de galigai quoted a million times now tell me something new and to the purpose and better suited to modern days well then since you will not allow me to talk of superior minds in the present days let me ask you if you have never observed that a wit once conquered in company by a wit of a higher order is thenceforward in complete subjection to the conqueror whenever and wherever they meet you would not persuade me that yonder gentlelooking girl could ever be a match for the veteran mrs dareville she may have the wit but has she the courage yes no one has more courage more civil courage where her own dignity or the interests of her friends are concerned i will tell you an instance or two tomorrow tomorrowtonighttell it me now not a safe place the safest in the world in such a crowd as this follow my example take a glass of orgeatsip from time to time thusspeak low looking innocent all the while straight forward or now and then up at the lampskeep on in an even toneuse no namesand you may tell anything well then when miss nugent first came to london lady langdale two names alreadydid not i warn ye but how can i make myself intelligible initialscant you useor genealogy what stops you it is only lord colambre a very safe person i have a notion when the eulogium is of grace nugent lord colambre who had now performed his arduous duties as a dancer and had disembarrassed himself of all his partners came into the turkish tent just at this moment to refresh himself and just in time to hear mr salisburys anecdotes now go on lady langdale you know sets an inordinate value upon her curtsies in public and she used to treat miss nugent as her ladyship treats many other people sometimes noticing and sometimes pretending not to know her according to the company she happened to be with one day they met in some fine companylady langdale looked as if she was afraid of committing herself by a curtsy miss nugent waited for a good opportunity and when all the world was silent leant forward and called to lady langdale as if she had something to communicate of the greatest consequence skreening her whisper with her hand as in an aside on the stagelady langdale you may curtsy to me nownobody is looking the retort courteous said lord colambrethe only retort for a woman and her ladyship deserved it so well but mrs dareville what happened about her mrs dareville you remember some years ago went to ireland with some ladylieutenant to whom she was related there she was most hospitably received by lord and lady clonbronywent to their country housewas as intimate with lady clonbrony and with miss nugent as possiblestayed at clonbrony castle for a month and yet when lady clonbrony came to london never took the least notice of her at last meeting at the house of a common friend mrs dareville could not avoid recognising her ladyship but even then did it in the least civil manner and most cursory style possible ho lady clonbronydidnt know you were in englandwhen did you comehow long shall you stay in townhope before you leave england your ladyship and miss nugent will give us a day a daylady clonbrony was so astonished by this impudence of ingratitude that she hesitated how to take it but miss nugent quite coolly and with a smile answered a daycertainlyto you who gave us a month admirable now comprehend perfectly why mrs dareville declines insulting miss nugents friends in her presence lord colambre said nothing but thought much how i wish my mother thought he had some of grace nugents proper pride she would not then waste her fortune spirits health and life in courting such people as these he had not seenhe could not have borne to have beheldthe manner in which his mother had been treated by some of her guests but he observed that she now looked harassed and vexed and he was provoked and mortified by hearing her begging and beseeching some of these saucy leaders of the ton to oblige her to do her the favour to do her the honour to stay to supper it was just readyactually announced no they would notthey could not they were obliged to run awayengaged to the duchess of torcaster lord colambre what is the matter said miss nugent going up to him as he stood aloof and indignant dont look so like a chafed lion others may perhaps read your countenance as well as i do none can read my mind so well replied he oh my dear grace suppersupper cried she your duty to your neighbour your hand to your partner lady catharine as they went downstairs to supper observed that miss nugent had not been dancing that she had kept quite in the background all nightquite in the shade those said lord colambre who are contented in the shade are the best able to bear the light and i am not surprised that one so interesting in the background should not desire to be the foremost figure in a piece the supper room fitted up at great expense with scenery to imitate vauxhall opened into a superb greenhouse lighted with coloured lamps a band of music at a distanceevery delicacy every luxury that could gratify the senses appeared in profusion the company ate and drankenjoyed themselveswent awayand laughed at their hostess some indeed who thought they had been neglected were in too bad humour to laugh but abused her in sober earnest for lady clonbrony had offended half nay threequarters of her guests by what they termed her exclusive attention to those very leaders of the ton from whom she had suffered so much and who had made it obvious to all that they thought they did her too much honour in appearing at her gala so ended the gala for which she had lavished such sums for which she had laboured so indefatigably and from which she had expected such triumph colambre bid the musicians stop they are playing to empty benches said lady clonbrony grace my dear will you see that these lamps are safely put out i am so tired so worn out i must go to bed and i am sure i have caught cold too what a nervous business it is to manage these things i wonder how one gets through it or why one does it chapter iv lady clonbrony was taken ill the day after her gala she had caught cold by standing when much overheated in a violent draught of wind paying her parting compliments to the duke of v who thought her a bore and wished her in heaven all the time for keeping his horses standing her ladyships illness was severe and long she was confined to her room for some weeks by a rheumatic fever and an inflammation in her eyes every day when lord colambre went to see his mother he found miss nugent in her apartment and every hour he found fresh reason to admire this charming girl the affectionate tenderness the indefatigable patience the strong attachment she showed for her aunt actually raised lady clonbrony in her sons opinion he was persuaded she must surely have some good or great qualities or she could not have excited such strong affection a few foibles out of the question such as her love of fine people her affectation of being english and other affectations too tedious to mention lady clonbrony was really a good woman had good principles moral and religious and selfishness not immediately interfering she was goodnatured and though her soul and attention were so completely absorbed in the duties of acquaintanceship that she did not know it she really had affectionsthey were concentrated upon a few near relations she was extremely fond and extremely proud of her son next to her son she was fonder of her niece than of any other creature she had received grace nugent into her family when she was left an orphan and deserted by some of her other relations she had bred her up and had treated her with constant kindness this kindness and these obligations had raised the warmest gratitude in miss nugents heart and it was the strong principle of gratitude which rendered her capable of endurance and exertions seemingly far above her strength this young lady was not of a robust appearance though she now underwent extraordinary fatigue her aunt could scarcely bear that she should leave her for a moment she could not close her eyes unless grace sat up with her many hours every night night after night she bore this fatigue and yet with little sleep or rest she preserved her health at least supported her spirits and every morning when lord colambre came into his mothers room he saw miss nugent look as blooming as if she had enjoyed the most refreshing sleep the bloom was as he observed not permanent it came and went with every emotion of her feeling heart and he soon learned to fancy her almost as handsome when she was pale as when she had a colour he had thought her beautiful when he beheld her in all the radiance of light and with all the advantages of dress at the gala but he found her infinitely more lovely and interesting now when he saw her in a sickrooma halfdarkened chamberwhere often he could but just discern her form or distinguish her except by her graceful motion as she passed or when but for a moment a windowcurtain drawn aside let the sun shine upon her face or on the unadorned ringlets of her hair much must be allowed for an inflammation in the eyes and something for a rheumatic fever yet it may seem strange that lady clonbrony should be so blind and deaf as neither to see nor hear all this time that having lived so long in the world it should never occur to her that it was rather imprudent to have a young lady not eighteen nursing herand such a young ladywhen her son not oneandtwentyand such a soncame to visit her daily but so it was lady clonbrony knew nothing of loveshe had read of it indeed in novels which sometimes for fashions sake she had looked at and over which she had been obliged to doze but this was only love in bookslove in real life she had never met within the life she led how should she she had heard of its making young people and old people even do foolish things but those were foolish people and if they were worse than foolish why it was shocking and nobody visited them but lady clonbrony had not for her own part the slightest notion how people could be brought to this pass nor how anybody out of bedlam could prefer to a good house a decent equipage and a proper establishment what is called love in a cottage as to colambre she had too good an opinion of his understandingto say nothing of his duty to his family his pride his rank and his being her sonto let such an idea cross her imagination as to her niece in the first place she was her niece and first cousins should never marry because they form no new connexions to strengthen the family interest or raise its consequence this doctrine her ladyship had repeated for years so often and so dogmatically that she conceived it to be incontrovertible and of as full force as any law of the land or as any moral or religious obligation she would as soon have suspected her niece of an intention of stealing her diamond necklace as of purloining colambres heart or marrying this heir of the house of clonbrony miss nugent was so well apprised and so thoroughly convinced of all this that she never for one moment allowed herself to think of lord colambre as a lover duty honour and gratitudegratitude the strong feeling and principle of her mindforbade it she had so prepared and habituated herself to consider him as a person with whom she could not possibly be united that with perfect ease and simplicity she behaved towards him exactly as if he was her brothernot in the equivocating sentimental romance style in which ladies talk of treating men as their brothers whom they are all the time secretly thinking of and endeavouring to please as loversnot using this phrase as a convenient pretence a safe mode of securing herself from suspicion or scandal and of enjoying the advantages of confidence and the intimacy of friendship till the propitious moment when it should be time to declare or avow the secret of the heart no this young lady was quite above all doubledealing she had no mental reservationno metaphysical subtletiesbut with plain unsophisticated morality in good faith and simple truth acted as she professed thought what she said and was that which she seemed to be as soon as lady clonbrony was able to see anybody her niece sent to mrs broadhurst who was very intimate with the family she used to come frequently almost every evening to sit with the invalid miss broadhurst accompanied her mother for she did not like to go out with any other chaperonit was disagreeable to spend her time alone at home and most agreeable to spend it with her friend miss nugent in this she had no design no coquetry miss broadhurst had too lofty and independent a spirit to stoop to coquetry she thought that in their interview at the gala she understood lord colambre and that he understood herthat he was not inclined to court her for her fortunethat she would not be content with any suitor who was not a lover she was two or three years older than lord colambre perfectly aware of her want of beauty yet with a just sense of her own merit and of what was becoming and due to the dignity of her sex this she trusted was visible in her manners and established in lord colambres mind so that she ran no risk of being misunderstood by him and as to what the rest of the world thought she was so well used to hear weekly and daily reports of her going to be married to fifty different people that she cared little for what was said on this subject indeed conscious of rectitude and with an utter contempt for mean and commonplace gossiping she was for a woman and a young woman rather too disdainful of the opinion of the world mrs broadhurst though her daughter had fully explained herself respecting lord colambre before she began this course of visiting yet rejoiced that even on this footing there should be constant intercourse between them it was mrs broadhursts warmest wish that her daughter should obtain rank and connect herself with an ancient family she was sensible that the young ladys being older than the gentleman might be an obstacle and very sorry she was to find that her daughter had so imprudently so unnecessarily declared her age but still this little obstacle might be overcome much greater difficulties in the marriage of inferior heiresses were every day got over and thought nothing of then as to the young ladys own sentiments her mother knew them better than she did herself she understood her daughters pride that she dreaded to be made an object of bargain and sale but mrs broadhurst who with all her coarseness of mind had rather a better notion of love matters than lady clonbrony perceived through her daughters horror of being offered to lord colambre through her anxiety that nothing approaching to an advance on the part of her family should be made that if lord colambre should himself advance he would stand a better chance of being accepted than any other of the numerous persons who had yet aspired to the favour of this heiress the very circumstance of his having paid no court to her at first operated in his favour for it proved that he was not mercenary and that whatever attention he might afterwards show she must be sure would be sincere and disinterested and now let them but see one another in this easy intimate kind of way and you will find my dear lady clonbrony things will go on of their own accord all the better for ourminding our cardsand never minding anything else i remember when i was youngbut let that passlet the young people see one another and manage their own affairs their own waylet them be togetherthats all i say ask half the men you are acquainted with why they married and their answer if they speak truth will be because i met miss suchaone at such a place and we were continually together propinquity propinquityas my father used to sayand he was married five times and twice to heiresses in consequence of this plan of leaving things to themselves every evening lady clonbrony made out her own little cardtable with mrs broadhurst and a mr and miss pratt a brother and sister who were the most obliging convenient neighbours imaginable from time to time as lady clonbrony gathered up her cards she would direct an inquiring glance to the group of young people at the other table whilst the more prudent mrs broadhurst sat plump with her back to them pursing up her lips and contracting her brows in token of deep calculation looking down impenetrable at her cards never even noticing lady clonbronys glances but inquiring from her partner how many they were by honours the young party generally consisted of miss broadhurst lord colambre miss nugent and her admirer mr salisbury mr salisbury was a middleaged gentleman very agreeable and well informed he had travelled had seen a great deal of the world had lived in the best company had acquired what is called good tact was full of anecdote not mere gossiping anecdotes that lead to nothing but anecdotes characteristic of national manners of human nature in general or of those illustrious individuals who excite public curiosity and interest miss nugent had seen him always in large companies where he was admired for his scavoirvivre and for his entertaining anecdotes but where he had no opportunity of producing any of the higher powers of his understanding or showing character she found that mr salisbury appeared to her quite a different person when conversing with lord colambre lord colambre with that ardent thirst for knowledge which it is always agreeable to gratify had an air of openness and generosity a frankness a warmth of manner which with good breeding but with something beyond it and superior to its established forms irresistibly won the confidence and attracted the affection of those with whom he conversed his manners were peculiarly agreeable to a person like mr salisbury tired of the sameness and egotism of men of the world miss nugent had seldom till now had the advantage of hearing much conversation on literary subjects in the life she had been compelled to lead she had acquired accomplishments had exercised her understanding upon everything that passed before her and from circumstances had formed her judgment and her taste by observations on real life but the ample page of knowledge had never been unrolled to her eyes she had never had opportunities of acquiring literature herself but she admired it in others particularly in her friend miss broadhurst miss broadhurst had received all the advantages of education which money could procure and had profited by them in a manner uncommon among those for whom they are purchased in such abundance she not only had had many masters and read many books but had thought of what she read and had supplied by the strength and energy of her own mind what cannot be acquired by the assistance of masters miss nugent perhaps overvaluing the information that she did not possess and free from all idea of envy looked up to her friend as to a superior being with a sort of enthusiastic admiration and now with charmed attention listened by turns to her to mr salisbury and to lord colambre whilst they conversed on literary subjectslistened with a countenance so full of intelligence of animation so expressive of every good and kind affection that the gentlemen did not always know what they were saying pray go on said she once to mr salisbury you stop perhaps from politeness to mefrom compassion to my ignorance but though i am ignorant you do not tire me i assure you did you ever condescend to read the arabian tales like him whose eyes were touched by the magical application from the dervise i am enabled at once to see the riches of a new worldoh how unlike how superior to that in which i have livedthe great world as it is called lord colambre brought down a beautiful edition of the arabian tales looked for the story to which miss nugent had alluded and showed it to miss broadhurst who was also searching for it in another volume lady clonbrony from her cardtable saw the young people thus engaged i profess not to understand these things so well as you say you do my dear mrs broadhurst whispered she but look there now they are at their books what do you expect can come of that sort of thing so illbred and downright rude of colambre i must give him a hint no no for mercys sake my dear lady clonbrony no hints no hints no remarks what would you haveshe reading and my lord at the back of her chair leaning overand allowed mind to lean over to read the same thing cant be better never saw any man yet allowed to come so near her now lady clonbrony not a word not a look i beseech well wellbut if they had a little music my daughters tired of music how much do i owe your ladyship nowthree rubbers i think now though you would not believe it of a young girl continued mrs broadhurst i can assure your ladyship my daughter would often rather go to a book than a ball well now thats very extraordinary in the style in which she has been brought up yet books and all that are so fashionable now that its very natural said lady clonbrony about this time mr berryl lord colambres cambridge friend for whom his lordship had fought the battle of the curricle with mordicai came to town lord colambre introduced him to his mother by whom he was graciously received for mr berryl was a young gentleman of good figure good address good family heir to a good fortune and in every respect a fit match for miss nugent lady clonbrony thought that it would be wise to secure him for her niece before he should make his appearance in the london world where mothers and daughters would soon make him feel his own consequence mr berryl as lord colambres intimate friend was admitted to the private evening parties at lady clonbronys and he contributed to render them still more agreeable his information his habits of thinking and his views were all totally different from mr salisburys and their collision continually struck out that sparkling novelty which pleases peculiarly in conversation mr berryls education disposition and tastes fitted him exactly for the station which he was destined to fill in societythat of a country gentleman not meaning by that expression a mere eating drinking hunting shooting ignorant country squire of the old race which is now nearly extinct but a cultivated enlightened independent english country gentlemanthe happiest perhaps of human beings on the comparative felicity of the town and country life on the dignity utility elegance and interesting nature of their different occupations and general scheme of passing their time mr berryl and mr salisbury had one evening a playful entertaining and perhaps instructive conversation each party at the end remaining as frequently happens of their own opinion it was observed that miss broadhurst ably and warmly defended mr berryls side of the question and in their views plans and estimates of life there appeared a remarkable and as lord colambre thought a happy coincidence when she was at last called upon to give her decisive judgment between a town and a country life she declared that if she were condemned to the extremes of either she should prefer a country life as much as she should prefer robinson crusoes diary to the journal of the idle man in the spectator lord bless me mrs broadhurst do you hear what your daughter is saying cried lady clonbrony who from the cardtable lent an attentive ear to all that was going forward is it possible that miss broadhurst with her fortune and pretensions and sense can really be serious in saying she would be content to live in the country whats that you say child about living in the country said mrs broadhurst miss broadhurst repeated what she had said girls always think so who have lived in town said mrs broadhurst they are always dreaming of sheep and sheephooks but the first winter the country cures them a shepherdess in winter is a sad and sorry sort of personage except at a masquerade colambre said lady clonbrony i am sure miss broadhursts sentiments about town life and all that must delight you for do you know maam he is always trying to persuade me to give up living in town colambre and miss broadhurst perfectly agree mind your cards my dear lady clonbrony interrupted mrs broadhurst in pity to your partner mr pratt has certainly the patience of jobyour ladyship has revoked twice this hand lady clonbrony begged a thousand pardons fixed her eyes and endeavoured to fix her mind on the cards but there was something said at the other end of the room about an estate in cambridgeshire which soon distracted her attention again mr pratt certainly had the patience of job she revoked and lost the game though they had four by honours as soon as she rose from the cardtable and could speak to mrs broadhurst apart she communicated her apprehensions seriously my dear madam said she i believe i have done very wrong to admit mr berryl just now though it was on graces account i did it but maam i did not know miss broadhurst had an estate in cambridgeshire their two estates just close to one another i heard them say lord bless me maam theres the danger of propinquity indeed no danger no danger persisted mrs broadhurst i know my girl better than you do begging your ladyships pardon no one thinks less of estates than she does well i only know i heard her talking of them and earnestly too yes very likely but dont you know that girls never think of what they are talking about or rather never talk of what they are thinking about and they have always ten times more to say to the man they dont care for than to him they do very extraordinary said lady clonbrony i only hope you are right i am sure of it said mrs broadhurst only let things go on and mind your cards i beseech you tomorrow night better than you did tonight and you will see that things will turn out just as i prophesied lord colambre will come to a pointblank proposal before the end of the week and will be accepted or my names not broadhurst why in plain english i am clear my girl likes him and when thats the case you know can you doubt how the thing will end mrs broadhurst was perfectly right in every point of her reasoning but one from long habit of seeing and considering that such an heiress as her daughter might marry whom she pleasedfrom constantly seeing that she was the person to decide and to rejectmrs broadhurst had literally taken it for granted that everything was to depend upon her daughters inclinations she was not mistaken in the present case in opining that the young lady would not be averse to lord colambre if he came to what she called a pointblank proposal it really never occurred to mrs broadhurst that any man whom her daughter was the least inclined to favour could think of anybody else quicksighted in these affairs as the matron thought herself she saw but one side of the question blind and dull of comprehension as she thought lady clonbrony on this subject she was herself so completely blinded by her own prejudices as to be incapable of discerning the plain thing that was before her eyes videlicet that lord colambre preferred grace nugent lord colambre made no proposal before the end of the week but this mrs broadhurst attributed to an unexpected occurrence which prevented things from going on in the train in which they had been proceeding so smoothly sir john berryl mr berryls father was suddenly seized with a dangerous illness the news was brought to mr berryl one evening whilst he was at lady clonbronys the circumstances of domestic distress which afterwards occurred in the family of his friend entirely occupied lord colambres time and attention all thoughts of love were suspended and his whole mind was given up to the active services of friendship the sudden illness of sir john berryl spread an alarm among his creditors which brought to light at once the disorder of his affairs of which his son had no knowledge or suspicion lady berryl had been a very expensive woman especially in equipages and mordicai the coachmaker appeared at this time the foremost and the most inexorable of their creditors conscious that the charges in his account were exorbitant and that they would not be allowed if examined by a court of justice that it was a debt which only ignorance and extravagance could have in the first instance incurred swelled afterwards to an amazing amount by interest and interest upon interest mordicai was impatient to obtain payment whilst sir john yet lived or at least to obtain legal security for the whole sum from the heir mr berryl offered his bond for the amount of the reasonable charges in his account but this mordicai absolutely refused declaring that now he had the power in his own hands he would use it to obtain the utmost penny of his debt that he would not let the thing slip through his fingers that a debtor never yet escaped him and never should that a mans lying upon his deathbed was no excuse to a creditor that he was not a whiffler to stand upon ceremony about disturbing a gentleman in his last moments that he was not to be cheated out of his due by such niceties that he was prepared to go all lengths the law would allow for that as to what people said of him he did not care a doitcover your face with your hands if you like it mr berryl you may be ashamed for me but i feel no shame for myselfi am not so weak mordicais countenance said more than his words livid with malice and with atrocious determination in his eyes he stood yes sir said he you may look at me as you pleaseit is possible i am in earnest consult what youll do now behind my back or before my face it comes to the same thing for nothing will do but my money or your bond mr berryl the arrest is made on the person of your father luckily made while the breath is still in the body yesstart forward to strike me if you dareyour father sir john berryl sick or well is my prisoner lady berryl and mr berryls sisters in an agony of grief rushed into the room its all useless cried mordicai turning his back upon the ladies these tricks upon creditors wont do with me im used to these scenes im not made of such stuff as you think leave a gentleman in peace in his last moments no he ought not nor shant die in peace if he dont pay his debts and if you are all so mighty sorry ladies theres the gentleman you may kneel to if tenderness is the order of the day its for the son to show it not me ay now mr berryl cried he as mr berryl took up the bond to sign it youre beginning to know im not a fool to be trifled with stop your hand if you choose it sirits all the same to me the person or the money ill carry with me out of this house mr beryl signed the bond and threw it to him there monsterquit the house monster is not actionablei wish you had called me rascal said mordicai grinning a horrible smile and taking up the bond deliberately returned it to mr berryl this paper is worth nothing to me sirit is not witnessed mr berryl hastily left the room and returned with lord colambre mordicai changed countenance and grew pale for a moment at sight of lord colambre well my lord since it so happens i am not sorry that you should be witness to this paper said he and indeed not sorry that you should witness the whole proceeding for i trust i shall be able to explain to you my conduct i do not come here sir interrupted lord colambre to listen to any explanations of your conduct which i perfectly understandi come to witness a bond for my friend mr berryl if you think proper to extort from him such a bond i extort nothing my lord mr berryl it is quite a voluntary act take notice on your part sign or not witness or not as you please gentlemen said mordicai sticking his hands in his pockets and recovering his look of black and fixed determination witness it witness it my dear lord said mr berryl looking at his mother and weeping sisters witness it quick mr berryl must just run over his name again in your presence my lord with a dry pen said mordicai putting the pen into mr berryls hand no sir said lord colambre my friend shall never sign it as you please my lordthe bond or the body before i quit this house said mordicai neither sir shall you have and you quit this house directly how howmy lord hows this sir the arrest you have made is as illegal as it is inhuman illegal my lord said mordicai startled illegal sir i came into this house at the moment when your bailiff asked and was refused admittance afterwards in the confusion of the family above stairs he forced open the house door with an iron bari saw himi am ready to give evidence of the fact now proceed at your peril mordicai without reply snatched up his hat and walked towards the door but lord colambre held the door openthe door was immediately at the head of the stairsand mordicai seeing his indignant look and proud form hesitated to pass for he had always heard that irishmen are quick in the executive part of justice pass on sir repeated lord colambre with an air of ineffable contempt i am a gentlemanyou have nothing to fear mordicai ran downstairs lord colambre before he went back into the room waited to see mordicai and his bailiff out of the house when mordicai was fairly at the bottom of the stairs he turned and white with rage looked up at lord colambre charity begins at home my lord said he look at homeyou shall pay for this added he standing halfshielded by the house door for lord colambre moved forward as he spoke the last words and i give you this warning because i know it will be of no use to youyour most obedient my lord the house door closed after mordicai thank heaven thought lord colambre that i did not horsewhip that mean wretch this warning shall be of use to me but it is not time to think of that yet lord colambre turned from his own affairs to those of his friend to offer all the assistance and consolation in his power sir john berryl died that night his daughters who had lived in the highest style in london were left totally unprovided for his widow had mortgaged her jointure mr berryl had an estate now left to him but without any income he could not be so dishonest as to refuse to pay his fathers just debts he could not let his mother and sisters starve the scene of distress to which lord colambre was witness in this family made a still greater impression upon him than had been made by the warning or the threats of mordicai the similarity between the circumstances of his friends family and of his own struck him forcibly all this evil had arisen from lady berryls passion for living in london and at wateringplaces she had made her husband an absenteean absentee from his home his affairs his duties and his estate the sea the irish channel did not indeed flow between him and his estate but it was of little importance whether the separation was effected by land or waterthe consequences the negligence the extravagance were the same of the few people of his age who are capable of profiting by the experience of others lord colambre was one experience as an elegant writer has observed is an article that may be borrowed with safety and is often dearly bought chapter v in the meantime lady clonbrony had been occupied with thoughts very different from those which passed in the mind of her son though she had never completely recovered from her rheumatic pains she had become inordinately impatient of confinement to her own house and weary of those dull evenings at home which had in her sons absence become insupportable she told over her visiting tickets regularly twice a day and gave to every card of invitation a heartfelt sigh miss pratt alarmed her ladyship by bringing intelligence of some parties given by persons of consequence to which she was not invited she feared that she should be forgotten in the world well knowing how soon the world forgets those they do not see every day and everywhere how miserable is the fine ladys lot who cannot forget the world and who is forgot by the world in a moment how much more miserable still is the condition of a wouldbe fine lady working her way up in the world with care and pains by her every the slightest failure of attention from persons of rank and fashion is marked and felt with jealous anxiety and with a sense of mortification the most acutean invitation omitted is a matter of the most serious consequence not only as it regards the present but the future for if she be not invited by lady a it will lower her in the eyes of lady b and of all the ladies of the alphabet it will form a precedent of the most dangerous and inevitable application if she has nine invitations and the tenth be wanting the nine have no power to make her happy this was precisely lady clonbronys casethere was to be a party at lady st jamess for which lady clonbrony had no card so ungrateful so monstrous of lady st jameswhat was the gala so soon forgotten and all the marked attentions paid that night to lady st jamesattentions you know pratt which were looked upon with a jealous eye and made me enemies enough i am told in another quarter of all people i did not expect to be slighted by lady st james miss pratt who was ever ready to undertake the defence of any person who had a title pleaded in mitigation of censure that perhaps lady st james might not be aware that her ladyship was yet well enough to venture out oh my dear miss pratt that cannot be the thing for in spite of my rheumatism which really was bad enough last sunday i went on purpose to the royal chapel to show myself in the closet and knelt close to her ladyship and my dear we curtsied and she congratulated me after church upon my being abroad again and was so happy to see me look so well and all thatoh it is something very extraordinary and unaccountable but i daresay a card will come yet said miss pratt upon this hint lady clonbronys hope revived and staying her anger she began to consider how she could manage to get herself invited refreshing tickets were left next morning at lady st jamess with their corners properly turned up to do the thing better separate tickets for herself and for miss nugent were left for each member of the family and her civil messages left with the footman extended to the utmost possibility of remainder it had occurred to her ladyship that for miss somebody the companion of whom she had never in her life thought before she had omitted to leave a card last time and she now left a note of explanation she further with her rheumatic head and arm out of the coachwindow sat the wind blowing keen upon her explaining to the porter and the footman to discover whether her former tickets had gone safely up to lady st james and on the present occasion to make assurance doubly sure she slid handsome expedition money into the servants handsir you will be sure to rememberoh certainly your ladyship she well knew what dire offence has frequently been taken what sad disasters have occurred in the fashionable world from the neglect of a porter in delivering or of a footman in carrying up one of those talismanic cards but in spite of all her manoeuvres no invitation to the party arrived next day pratt was next set to work miss pratt was a most convenient gobetween who in consequence of doing a thousand little services to which few others of her rank in life would stoop had obtained the entree to a number of great houses and was behind the scenes in many fashionable families pratt could find out and pratt could hint and pratt could manage to get things done cleverlyand hints were given in all directions to work round to lady st james but still they did not take effect at last pratt suggested that perhaps though everything else had failed dried salmon might be tried with success lord clonbrony had just had some uncommonly good from ireland which pratt knew lady st james would like to have at her supper because a certain personage whom she would not name was particularly fond of itwheel within wheel in the fine world as well as in the political worldbribes for all occasions and for all ranks the timely present was sent accepted with many thanks and understood as it was meant per favour of this propitiatory offering and of a promise of half a dozen pair of real limerick gloves to miss pratta promise which pratt clearly comprehended to be a conditional promisethe grand object was at length accomplished the very day before the party was to take place came cards of invitation to lady clonbrony and to miss nugent with lady st jamess apologies her ladyship was concerned to find that by some negligence of her servants these cards were not sent in proper time how slight an apology will do from some people thought miss nugent how eager to forgive when it is for our interest or our pleasure how well people act the being deceived even when all parties know that they see the whole truth and how low pride will stoop to gain its object ashamed of the whole transaction miss nugent earnestly wished that a refusal should be sent and reminded her aunt of her rheumatism but rheumatism and all other objections were overruledlady clonbrony would go it was just when this affair was thus in her opinion successfully settled that lord colambre came in with a countenance of unusual seriousness his mind full of the melancholy scenes he had witnessed in his friends family what is the matter colambre he related what had passed he described the brutal conduct of mordicai the anguish of the mother and sisters the distress of mr berryl tears rolled down miss nugents cheeks lady clonbrony declared it was very shocking listened with attention to all the particulars but never failed to correct her son whenever he said mr berryl sir arthur berryl you mean she was however really touched with compassion when he spoke of lady berryls destitute condition and her son was going on to repeat what mordicai had said to him but lady clonbrony interrupted oh my dear colambre dont repeat that detestable mans impertinent speeches to me if there is anything really about business speak to your father at any rate dont tell us of it now because ive a hundred things to do said her ladyship hurrying out of the room gracegrace nugent i want you lord colambre sighed deeply dont despair said miss nugent as she followed to obey her aunts summons dont despair dont attempt to speak to her again till tomorrow morning her head is now full of lady st jamess party when it is emptied of that you will have a better chance never despair never while you encourage me to hopethat any good can be done lady clonbrony was particularly glad that she had carried her point about this party at lady st jamess because from the first private intimation that the duchess of torcaster was to be there her ladyship flattered herself that the longdesired introduction might then be accomplished but of this hope lady st james had likewise received intimation from the doubledealing miss pratt and a warning note was despatched to the duchess to let her grace know that circumstances had occurred which had rendered it impossible not to ask the clonbronies an excuse of course for not going to this party was sent by the duchessher grace did not like large partiesshe would have the pleasure of accepting lady st jamess invitation for her select party on wednesday the th into these select parties lady clonbrony had never been admitted in return for her great entertainments she was invited to great entertainments to large parties but farther she could never penetrate at lady st jamess and with her set lady clonbrony suffered a different kind of mortification from that which lady langdale and mrs dareville made her endure she was safe from the witty raillery the sly innuendo the insolent mimicry but she was kept at a cold impassable distance by ceremonyso far shalt thou go and no farther was expressed in every look in every word and in a thousand different ways by the most punctilious respect and nice regard to precedency even by words of courtesyyour ladyship does me honour etclady st james contrived to mortify and to mark the difference between those with whom she was and with whom she was not upon terms of intimacy and equality thus the ancient grandees of spain drew a line of demarcation between themselves and the newlycreated nobility whenever or wherever they met they treated the new nobles with the utmost respect never addressed them but with all their titles with low bows and with all the appearance of being with the most perfect consideration anything but their equals whilst towards one another the grandees laid aside their state and omitting their titles it was alcalamedinasidoniainfantado and a freedom and familiarity which marked equality entrenched in etiquette in this manner and mocked with marks of respect it was impossible either to intrude or to complain of being excluded at supper at lady st jamess lady clonbronys present was pronounced by some gentleman to be remarkably high flavoured this observation turned the conversation to irish commodities and ireland lady clonbrony possessed by the idea that it was disadvantageous to appear as an irishwoman or as a favourer of ireland began to be embarrassed by lady st jamess repeated thanks had it been in her power to offer anything else with propriety she would not have thought of sending her ladyship anything from ireland vexed by the questions that were asked her about her country lady clonbrony as usual denied it to be her country and went on to depreciate and abuse everything irish to declare that there was no possibility of living in ireland and that for her own part she was resolved never to return thither lady st james preserving perfect silence let her go on lady clonbrony imagining that this silence arose from coincidence of opinion proceeded with all the eloquence she possessed which was very little repeating the same exclamations and reiterating her vow of perpetual expatriation till at last an elderly lady who was a stranger to her and whom she had till this moment scarcely noticed took up the defence of ireland with much warmth and energy the eloquence with which she spoke and the respect with which she was heard astonished lady clonbrony who is she whispered her ladyship does not your ladyship know lady oranmorethe irish lady oranmore lord bless mewhat have i saidwhat have i done oh why did not you give me a hint lady st james i was not aware that your ladyship was not acquainted with lady oranmore replied lady st james unmoved by her distress everybody sympathised with lady oranmore and admired the honest zeal with which she abided by her country and defended it against unjust aspersions and affected execrations every one present enjoyed lady clonbronys confusion except miss nugent who sat with her eyes bowed down by penetrative shame during the whole of this scene she was glad that lord colambre was not witness to it and comforted herself with the hope that upon the whole lady clonbrony would be benefited by the pain she had felt this instance might convince her that it was not necessary to deny her country to be received in any company in england and that those who have the courage and steadiness to be themselves and to support what they feel and believe to be the truth must command respect miss nugent hoped that in consequence of this conviction lady clonbrony would lay aside the little affectations by which her manners were painfully constrained and ridiculous and above all she hoped that what lady oranmore had said of ireland might dispose her aunt to listen with patience to all lord colambre might urge in favour of returning to her home but miss nugent hoped in vain lady clonbrony never in her life generalised any observations or drew any but a partial conclusion from the most striking facts lord my dear grace said she as soon as they were seated in their carriage what a scrape i got into tonight at supper and what disgrace i came toand all this because i did not know lady oranmore now you see the inconceivable disadvantage of not knowing everybodyeverybody of a certain rank of course i mean miss nugent endeavoured to slide in her own moral on the occasion but it would not do yes my dear lady oranmore may talk in that kind of style of ireland because on the other hand she is so highly connected in england and besides she is an old lady and may take liberties in short she is lady oranmore and thats enough the next morning when they all met at breakfast lady clonbrony complained bitterly of her increased rheumatism of the disagreeable stupid party they had had the preceding night and of the necessity of going to another formal party that night the next and the next and in the true fine lady style deplored her situation and the impossibility of avoiding those things which felt they curse yet covet still to feelbr miss nugent determined to retire as soon as she could from the breakfastroom to leave lord colambre an opportunity of talking over his family affairs at full liberty she knew by the seriousness of his countenance that his mind was intent upon doing so and she hoped that his influence with his father and mother would not be exerted in vain but just as she was rising from the breakfasttable in came sir terence ofay and seating himself quite at his ease in spite of lady clonbronys repulsive looks his awe of lord colambre having now worn off im tired said he and have a right to be tired for its no small walk ive taken for the good of this noble family this morning and miss nugent before i say more ill take a cup of ta from you if you please lady clonbrony rose with great stateliness and walked to the farthest end of the room where she established herself at her writingtable and began to write notes sir terence wiped his forehead deliberately then ive had a fine runmiss nugent i believe you never saw me run but i can run i promise you when its to serve a friend and my lord turning to lord clonbrony what do you think i run for this morningto buy a bargainand of whata bargain of a bad debta debt of yours which i bargained for and up just in timeand mordicais ready to hang himself this minute for what do you think but that rascal was bringing upon youbut an executionhe was an execution repeated everybody present except lord colambre and how has this been prevented sir said lord colambre oh let me alone for that said sir terence i got a hint from my little friend paddy brady who would not be paid for it either though hes as poor as a rat well as soon as i got the hint i dropped the thing i had in my hand which was the dublin evening and ran for the bare lifefor there wasnt a coachin my slippers as i was to get into the prior creditors shoes who is the little solicitor that lives in crutched friars which mordicai never dreamt of luckily so he was very genteel though he was taken on a sudden and from his breakfast which an englishman dont like particularlyi popped him a douceur of a draught at thirtyone days on garraghty the agent of which he must get notice but i wont descant on the law before the ladieshe handed me over his debt and execution and he made me prior creditor in a trice then i took coach in state the first i met and away with me to long acresaw mordicai sir says i i hear youre meditating an execution on a friend of mine am i said the rascal who told you so no matter said i but i just called in to let you know theres no use in life of your execution for theres a prior creditor with his execution to be satisfied first so he made a great many black faces and said a great deal which i never listened to but came off here clean to tell you all the story not one word of which do i understand said lady clonbrony then my dear you are very ungrateful said lord clonbrony lord colambre said nothing for he wished to learn more of sir terence ofays character of the state of his fathers affairs and of the family methods of proceeding in matters of business faith terry i know im very thankful to youbut an executions an ugly thingand i hope theres no danger never fear said sir terence havent i been at my wits ends for myself or my friends ever since i come to mans estateto years of discretion i should say for the deuce a foot of estate have i but use has sharpened my wits pretty well for your service so never be in dread my good lord for look ye cried the reckless knight sticking his arms akimbo look ye here in sir terence ofay stands a host that desires no better than to encounter single witted all the duns in the united kingdoms mordicai the jew inclusive ah thats the devil that mordicai said lord clonbrony thats the only man an earth i dread why he is only a coachmaker is not he said lady clonbrony i cant think how you can talk my lord of dreading such a low man tell him if hes troublesome we wont bespeak any more carriages and im sure i wish you would not be so silly my lord to employ him any more when you know he disappointed me the last birthday about the landau which i have not got yet nonsense my dear said lord clonbrony you dont know what you are talking of terry i say even a friendly execution is an ugly thing phoo phooan ugly thing so is a fit of the goutbut ones all the better for it after tis just a renewal of life my lord for which one must pay a bit of a fine you know take patience and leave me to manage all properlyyou know im used to these things only you recollect if you please how i managed my friend lord its bad to be mentioning namesbut lord everybodyknowswhodidnt i bring him through cleverly when there was that rascally attempt to seize the family plate i had notice and what did i do but broke open a partition between that lords house and my lodgings which i had taken next door and so when the sheriffs officers were searching below on the ground floor i just shoved the plate easy through to my bedchamber at a moments warning and then bid the gentlemen walk in for they couldnt set a foot in my paradise the devils so they stood looking at it through the wall and cursing me and i holding both my sides with laughter at their fallen faces sir terence and lord clonbrony laughed in concert this is a good story said miss nugent smiling but surely sir terence such things are never done in real life done ay are they and i could tell you a hundred better strokes my dear miss nugent grace cried lady clonbrony do pray have the goodness to seal and send these notes for really whispered she as her niece came to the tablei cawnt stee i cawnt bear that mans vice his accent grows horrider and horrider her ladyship rose and left the room why then continued sir terence following up miss nugent to the table where she was sealing letters i must tell you how i sarved that same man on another occasion and got the victory too no general officer could talk of his victories or fight his battles oer again with more complacency than sir terence ofay recounted his civil exploits now ill tell miss nugent there was a footman in the family not an irishman but one of your powdered english scoundrels that ladies are so fond of having hanging to the backs of their carriages one fleming he was that turned spy and traitor and informer went privately and gave notice to the creditors where the plate was hid in the thickness of the chimney but if he did what happened why i had my counterspy an honest little irish boy in the creditors shop that i had secured with a little douceur of usquebaugh and he outwitted as was natural the english lying valet and gave us notice just in the nick and i got ready for their reception and miss nugent i only wish youd seen the excellent sport we had letting them follow the scent they got and when they were sure of their game what did they findha ha hadragged out after a world of labour a heavy box ofa load of brickbats not an item of my friends platethat was all snug in the coalhole where them dunces never thought of looking for it ha ha ha but come terry cried lord clonbrony ill pull down your pride how finely another time your job of the false ceiling answered in the hall ive heard that story and have been told how the sheriffs fellow thrust his bayonet up through your false plaster and down came tumbling the family plate hey terry that hit cost your friend lord everybodyknowswho more than your heads worth terry i ask your pardon my lord it never cost him a farthing when he paid l for the plate to redeem it well and did not i make up for that at the races of the creditors learned that my lords horse naboclish was to run atraces and as the sheriffs officer knew he dare not touch him on the raceground what does he do but he comes down early in the morning on the mailcoach and walks straight down to the livery stables he had an exact description of the stables and the stall and the horses bodyclothes i was there seeing the horse taken care of and knowing the cut of the fellows jib what does i do but whips the bodyclothes off naboclish and claps them upon a garrone that the priest would not ride in comes the bailiffgood morrow to you sir says i leading out of the stable my lords horse with an ould saddle and bridle on tim neal says i to the groom who was rubbing down the garrones heels mind your hits today and weel wet the plate tonight not so fast neither says the bailiffheres my writ for seizing the horse och says i you wouldnt be so cruel thats all my eye says he seizing the garrone while i mounted naboclish and rode him off deliberately to ha ha hathat was neat i grant you terry said lord clonbrony but what a dolt of a born ignoramus must that sheriffs fellow have been not to know naboclish when he saw him but stay my lordstay miss nugenti have more for you following her wherever she moved i did not let him off so even at the cant i bid and bid against them for the pretended naboclish till i left him on their hands for guineas ha ha hawas not that famous but said miss nugent i cannot believe you are in earnest sir terence surely this would be whatout with it my dear miss nugent i am afraid of offending you you cant my dear i defy yousay the word that came to the tongues end its always the best i was going to say swindling said the young lady colouring deeply oh you was going to say wrong then its not called swindling amongst gentlemen who know the worldits only jockeyingfine sportand very honourable to help a friend at a dead lift anything to get a friend out of a present pressing difficulty and when the present difficulty is over do your friends never think of the future the future leave the future to posterity said sir terence im counsel only for the present and when the evil comes its time enough to think of it i cant bring the guns of my wits to bear till the enemys alongside of me or within sight of me at the least and besides there never was a good commander yet by sea or land that would tell his little expedients beforehand or before the very day of battle it must be a sad thing said miss nugent sighing deeply to be reduced to live by little expedientsdaily expedients lord colambre struck his forehead but said nothing but if you are beating your brains about your own affairs my lord colambre my dear said sir terence theres an easy way of settling your family affairs at once and since you dont like little daily expedients miss nugent theres one great expedient and an expedient for life that will settle it all to your satisfactionand ours i hinted it delicately to you before but between friends delicacy is impertinent so i tell you in plain english youve nothing to do but go and propose yourself just as you stand to the heiress miss b that desires no better sir cried lord colambre stepping forward red with sudden anger miss nugent laid her hand upon his arm oh my lord sir terence ofay continued lord colambre in a moderated tone you are wrong to mention that young ladys name in such a manner why then i said only miss b and there are a whole hive of bees but ill engage shed thank me for what i suggested and think herself the queen bee if my expedient was adopted by you sir terence said his lordship smiling if my father thinks proper that you should manage his affairs and devise expedients for him i have nothing to say on that point but i must beg you will not trouble yourself to suggest expedients for me and that you will have the goodness to leave me to settle my own affairs sir terence made a low bow and was silent for five seconds then turning to lord clonbrony who looked much more abashed than he did by the wise one my good lord i believe there are some mennoblemen toothat dont know their friends from their enemies its my firm persuasion now that if i had served you as i served my friend i was talking of your son there would ten to one think i had done him an injury by saving the family plate i certainly should sir the family plate sir is not the first object in my mind replied lord colambre family honournay miss nugent i must speak continued his lordship perceiving by her countenance that she was alarmed never fear miss nugent dear said sir terence im as cool as a cucumber faith then my lord colambre i agree with you that family honours a mighty fine thing only troublesome to ones self and ones friends and expensive to keep up with all the other expenses and debts a gentleman has nowadays so i that am under no natural obligations to it by birth or otherwise have just stood by through life and asked myself before i would volunteer being bound to it what could this same family honour do for a man in this world and first and foremost i never remember to see family honour stand a man in much stead in a court of lawnever saw family honour stand against an execution or a custodiam or an injunction even tis a rare thing this same family honour and a very fine thing but i never knew it yet at a pinch pay for a pair of boots even added sir terence drawing up his own with much complacency at this moment sir terence was called out of the room by one who wanted to speak to him on particular business my dear father cried lord colambre do not follow him stay for one moment and hear your sonyour true friend miss nugent went out of the room that she might leave the father and son at liberty hear your natural friend for one moment cried lord colambre let me beseech you father not to have recourse to any of these paltry expedients but trust your son with the state of your affairs and we shall find some honourable means yes yes yes very true when youre of age colambre well talk of it but nothing can be done till then we shall get on we shall get through very well till then with terrys assistance and i must beg you will not say a word more against terryi cant bear iti cant hear iti cant do without him pray dont detain mei can say no moreexcept added he returning to his usual concluding sentence that there need at all events be none of this if people would but live upon their own estates and kill their own mutton he stole out of the room glad to escape however shabbily from present explanation and present pain there are persons without resource who in difficulties return always to the same point and usually to the same words while lord colambre was walking up and down the room much vexed and disappointed at finding that he could make no impression on his fathers mind nor obtain his confidence as to his family affairs lady clonbronys woman mrs petito knocked at the door with a message from her lady to beg if lord colambre was by himself he would go to her dressingroom as she wished to have a conference with him he obeyed her summons sit down my dear colambre and she began precisely with her old sentence with the fortune i brought your father and with my lords estate i cawnt understand the meaning of all these pecuniary difficulties and all that strange creature sir terence says is algebra to me who speak english and i am particularly sorry he was let in this morningbut hes such a brute that he does not think anything of forcing ones door and he tells my footman he does not mind not at home a pinch of snuff now what can you do with a man who could say that sort of thing you knowthe worlds at an end i wish my father had nothing to do with him maam as much as you can wish it said lord colambre but i have said all that a son can with propriety say and without effect what particularly provokes me against him continued lady clonbrony is what i have just heard from grace who was really hurt by it too for she is the warmest friend in the world i allude to the creatures indelicate way of touching upon a tender pint and mentioning an amiable young heiresss name my dear colambre i trust you have given me credit for my inviolable silence all this time upon the pint nearest my heart i am rejoiced to hear you was so warm when she was mentioned inadvertently by that brute and i trust you now see the advantages of the projected union in as strong and agreeable a pint of view as i do my own colambre and i should leave things to themselves and let you prolong the dees of courtship as you please only for what i now hear incidentally from my lord and the brute about pecuniary embarrassments and the necessity of something being done before next winter and indeed i think now in propriety the proposal cannot be delayed much longer for the world begins to talk of the thing as done and even mrs broadhurst i know had no doubt that if this contretemps about the poor berryls had not occurred your proposal would have been made before the end of last week our hero was not a man to make a proposal because mrs broadhurst expected it or to marry because the world said he was going to be married he steadily said that from the first moment the subject had been mentioned he had explained himself distinctly that the young ladys friends could not therefore be under any doubt as to his intentions that if they had voluntarily deceived themselves or exposed the lady in situations from which the world was led to make false conclusions he was not answerable he felt his conscience at easeentirely so as he was convinced that the young lady herself for whose merit talents independence and generosity of character he professed high respect esteem and admiration had no doubts either of the extent or the nature of his regard regard respect esteem admirationwhy my dearest colambre this is saying all i want satisfies me and i am sure would satisfy mrs broadhurst and miss broadhurst too no doubt it will maam but not if i aspired to the honour of miss broadhursts hand or professed myself her lover my dear you are mistaken miss broadhurst is too sensible a girl a vast deal to look for love and a dying lover and all that sort of stuff i am persuadedindeed i have it from good from the best authoritythat the young ladyyou know one must be delicate in these cases where a young lady of such fortune and no despicable family too is concerned therefore i cannot speak quite plainlybut i say i have it from the best authority that you would be preferred to any other suitor and in short that i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you cried lord colambre colouring a good deal but you must excuse me if i say that the only authority on which i could believe this is one from which i am morally certain i shall never hear it from miss broadhurst herself lord child if you would only ask her the question she would tell you it is truth i daresay but as i have no curiosity on the subject maam lord bless me i thought everybody had curiosity but still without curiosity i am sure it would gratify you when you did hear it and cant you just put the simple question impossible impossiblenow that is so very provoking when the thing is all but done well take your own time all i will ask of you then is to let things go on as they are goingsmoothly and pleasantly and ill not press you farther on the subject at present let things go on smoothly thats all i ask and say nothing i wish i could oblige you mother but i cannot do this since you tell me that the world and miss broadhursts friends have already misunderstood my intentions it becomes necessary in justice to the young lady and to myself that i should make all further doubt impossible i shall therefore put an end to it at once by leaving town tomorrow lady clonbrony breathless for a moment with surprise exclaimed bless me leave town tomorrow just at the beginning of the season impossiblei never saw such a precipitate rash young man but stay only a few weeks colambre the physicians advise buxton for my rheumatism and you shall take us to buxton early in the seasonyou cannot refuse me that why if miss broadhurst was a dragon you could not be in a greater hurry to run away from her what are you afraid of of doing what is wrongthe only thing i trust of which i shall ever be afraid lady clonbrony tried persuasion and argumentsuch argument as she could usebut all in vainlord colambre was firm in his resolution at last she came to tears and her son in much agitation said i cannot bear this mother i would do anything you ask that i could do with honour but this is impossible why impossible i will take all blame upon myself and you are sure that miss broadhurst does not misunderstand you and you esteem her and admire her and all that and all i ask is that youll go on as you are and see more of her and how do you know but you may fall in love with her as you call it tomorrow because madam since you press me so far my affections are engaged to another person do not look so dreadfully shocked my dear motheri have told you truly that i think myself too young much too young yet to marry in the circumstances in which i know my family are it is probable that i shall not for some years be able to marry as i wish you may depend upon it that i shall not take any step i shall not even declare my attachment to the object of my affection without your knowledge and far from being inclined to follow headlong my own passionsstrong as they arebe assured that the honour of my family your happiness my mother my fathers are my first objects i shall never think of my own till these are secured of the conclusion of this speech lady clonbrony heard only the sound of the words from the moment her son had pronounced that his affections were engaged she had been running over in her head every probable and improbable person she could think of at last suddenly starting up she opened one of the foldingdoors into the next apartment and called gracegrace nugentput down your pencil grace this minute and come here miss nugent obeyed with her usual alacrity and the moment she entered the room lady clonbrony fixing her eyes full upon her said theres your cousin colambre tells me his affections are engaged yes to miss broadhurst no doubt said miss nugent smiling with a simplicity and openness of countenance which assured lady clonbrony that all was safe in that quarter a suspicion which had darted into her mind was dispelled no doubt ay do you hear that no doubt colambregrace you see has no doubt nobody has any doubt but yourself colambre and are your affections engaged and not to miss broadhurst said miss nugent approaching lord colambre there now you see how you surprise and disappoint everybody colambre i am sorry that miss nugent should be disappointed said lord colambre but because i am disappointed pray do not call me miss nugent or turn away from me as if you were displeased it must then be some cambridgeshire lady said lady clonbrony i am sure i am very sorry he ever went to cambridgeoxford i advised one of the miss berryls i presume who have nothing ill have nothing more to do with those berrylsthere was the reason of the sons vast intimacy grace you may give up all thoughts of sir arthur i have no thoughts to give up maam said miss nugent smiling miss broadhurst continued she going on eagerly with what she was saying to lord colambremiss broadhurst is my friend a friend i love and admire but you will allow that i strictly kept my promise never to praise her to you till you should begin to praise her to me now recollect last night you did praise her to me so justly that i thought you liked her i confess so that it is natural i should feel a little disappointed now you know the whole of my mind i have no intention to encroach on your confidence therefore there is no occasion to look so embarrassed i give you my word i will never speak to you again upon the subject said she holding out her hand to him provided you will never again call me miss nugent am i not your own cousin gracedo not be displeased with her you are my own dear cousin grace and nothing can be farther from my mind than any thought of being displeased with her especially just at this moment when i am going away probably for a considerable time awaywhenwhere tomorrow morning for ireland ireland of all places cried lady clonbrony what upon earth puts it into your head to go to ireland you do very well to go out of the way of falling in love ridiculously since that is the reason of your going but what put ireland into your head child i will not presume to ask my mother what put ireland out of her head said lord colambre smiling but she will recollect that it is my native country that was your fathers fault not mine said lady clonbrony for i wished to have been confined in england but he would have it to say that his son and heir was born at clonbrony castleand there was a great argument between him and my uncle and something about the prince of wales and caernarvon castle was thrown in and that turned the scale much against my will for it was my wish that my son should be an englishman bornlike myself but after all i dont see that having the misfortune to be born in a country should tie one to it in any sort of way and i should have hoped your english edication colambre would have given you too liberal idears for thatso i reelly dont see why you should go to ireland merely because its your native country not merely because it is my native country but i wish to go thitheri desire to become acquainted with itbecause it is the country in which my fathers property lies and from which we draw our subsistence subsistence lord bless me what a word fitter for a pauper than a noblemansubsistence then if you are going to look after your fathers property i hope you will make the agents do their duty and send us remittances and pray how long do you mean to stay till i am of age madam if you have no objection i will spend the ensuing months in travelling in ireland and i will return here by the time i am of age unless you and my father should before that time be in ireland not the least chance of that if i can prevent it i promise you said lady clonbrony lord colambre and miss nugent sighed and i am sure i shall take it very unkindly of you colambre if you go and turn out a partisan for ireland after all like grace nugent a partisan noi hope not a partisan but a friend said miss nugent nonsense childi hate to hear people women especially and young ladies particularly talk of being friends to this country or that country what can they know about countries better think of being friends to themselves and friends to their friends i was wrong said miss nugent to call myself a friend to ireland i meant to say that ireland had been a friend to me that i found irish friends when i had no other an irish home when i had no other that my earliest and happiest years under your kind care had been spent there and that i can never forget that my dear aunti hope you do not wish that i should heaven forbid my sweet grace said lady clonbrony touched by her voice and mannerheaven forbid i dont wish you to do or be anything but what you are for i am convinced theres nothing i could ask you would not do for me and i can tell you theres few things you could ask love i would not do for you a wish was instantly expressed in the eyes of her niece lady clonbrony though not usually quick at interpreting the wishes of others understood and answered before she ventured to make her request in words ask anything but that grace return to clonbrony while i am able to live in london that i never can or will do for you or anybody looking at her son in all the pride of obstinacy so there is an end of the matter go you where you please colambre and i shall stay where i pleasei suppose as your mother i have a right to say this much her son with the utmost respect assured her that he had no design to infringe upon her undoubted liberty of judging for herself that he had never interfered except so far as to tell her circumstances of her affairs with which she seemed to be totally unacquainted and of which it might be dangerous to her to continue in ignorance dont talk to me about affairs cried she drawing her hand away from her son talk to my lord or my lords agents since you are going to ireland about businessi know nothing about business but this i know i shall stay in england and be in london every season as long as i can afford it and when i cannot afford to live here i hope i shall not live anywhere thats my notion of life and thats my determination once for all for if none of the rest of the clonbrony family have any i thank heaven i have some spirit saying this with her most stately manner she walked out of the room lord colambre instantly followed her for after the resolution and the promise he had made he did not dare to trust himself at this moment with miss nugent there was to be a concert this night at lady clonbronys at which mrs and miss broadhurst were of course expected that they might not be quite unprepared for the event of her sons going to ireland lady clonbrony wrote a note to mrs broadhurst begging her to come half an hour earlier than the time mentioned in the cards that she might talk over something particular that had just occurred what passed at this cabinet council as it seems to have had no immediate influence on affairs we need not record suffice it to observe that a great deal was said and nothing done miss broadhurst however was not a young lady who could be easily deceived even where her passions were concerned the moment her mother told her of lord colambres intended departure she saw the whole truth she had a strong mindwas capable of drawing aside at once the curtain of selfdelusion and looking steadily at the skeleton of truthshe had a generous perhaps because a strong mind for surrounded as she had been from her childhood by every means of selfindulgence which wealth and flattery could bestow she had discovered early what few persons in her situation discover till late in life that selfish gratifications may render us incapable of other happiness but can never of themselves make us happy despising flatterers she had determined to make herself friends to make them in the only possible wayby deserving them her father made his immense fortune by the power and habit of constant bold and just calculation the power and habit which she had learned from him she applied on a far larger scale with him it was confined to speculations for the acquisition of money with her it extended to the attainment of happiness he was calculating and mercenary she was estimative and generous miss nugent was dressing for the concert or rather was sitting halfdressed before her glass reflecting when miss broadhurst came into her room miss nugent immediately sent her maid out of the room grace said miss broadhurst looking at grace with an air of open deliberate composure you and i are thinking of the same thingof the same person yes of lord colambre said miss nugent ingenuously and sorrowfully then i can put your mind at ease at once my dear friend by assuring you that i shall think of him no more that i have thought of him i do not denyi have thought that if notwithstanding the difference in our ages and other differences he had preferred me i should have preferred him to any person who has ever yet addressed me on our first acquaintance i clearly saw that he was not disposed to pay court to my fortune and i had also then coolness of judgment sufficient to perceive that it was not probable he should fall in love with my person but i was too proud in my humility too strong in my honesty too brave too ignorant in short i knew nothing of the matter we are all of us more or less subject to the delusions of vanity or hope or loveieven iwho thought myself so clearsighted did not know how with one flutter of his wings cupid can set the whole atmosphere in motion change the proportions size colour value of every object lead us into a mirage and leave us in a dismal desert my dearest friend said miss nugent in a tone of true sympathy but none but a coward or a fool would sit down in the desert and weep instead of trying to make his way back before the storm rises obliterates the track and overwhelms everything poetry apart my dear grace you may be assured that i shall think no more of lord colambre i believe you are right but i am sorry very sorry it must be so oh spare me your sorrow my sorrow is for lord colambre said miss nugent where will he find such a wifenot in miss berryl i am surepretty as she is a mere fine lady is it possible that lord colambre lord colambre should prefer such a girllord colambre miss broadhurst looked at her friend as she spoke and saw truth in her eyes saw that she had no suspicion that she was herself the person beloved tell me grace are you sorry that lord colambre is going away no i am glad i was sorry when i first heard it but now i am glad very glad it may save him from a marriage unworthy of him restore him to himself and reserve him forthe only woman i ever saw who is suited to him who is equal to him who would value and love him as he deserves to be valued and loved stop my dear if you mean me i am not and i never can be that woman therefore as you are my friend and wish my happiness as i sincerely believe you do never i conjure you present such an idea before my mind againit is out of my mind i hope for ever it is important to me that you should know and believe this at least i will preserve my friends now let this subject never be mentioned or alluded to again between us my dear we have subjects enough of conversation we need not have recourse to pernicious sentimental gossipings there is a great difference between wanting a confidante and treating a friend with confidence my confidence you possess all that ought all that is to be known of my mind you know andnow i will leave you in peace to dress for the concert oh dont go you dont interrupt me i shall be dressed in a few minutes stay with me and you may be assured that neither now nor at any other time shall i ever speak to you on the subject you desire me to avoid i entirely agree with you about confidantes and sentimental gossipings i love you for not loving them a thundering knock at the door announced the arrival of company think no more of love but as much as you please of friendshipdress yourself as fast as you can said miss broadhurst dress dress is the order of the day order of the day and order of the night and all for people i dont care for in the least said grace so life passes dear me miss nugent cried petito lady clonbronys woman coming in with a face of alarm not dressed yet my lady is gone down and mrs broadhurst and my lady pocockes come and the honourable mrs trembleham and signor the italian singing gentleman has been walking up and down the apartments there by himself disconsolate this halfhour and i wondering all the time nobody rang for mebut my lady dressed lord knows how without anybody oh merciful miss nugent if you could stand still for one single particle of a second so then i thought of stepping in to miss nugent for the young ladies are talking so fast says i to myself at the door they will never know how time goes unless i give em a hint but now my lady is below theres no need to be sure to be nervous so we may take the thing quietly without being in a flustrum dear ladies is not this now a very sudden motion of our young lords for irelandlud a mercy miss nugent im sure your motions is sudden enough and your dress behind is all im sure i cant tell howoh never mind said the young lady escaping from her it will do very well thank you petito it will do very well never mind repeated petito muttering to herself as she looked after the ladies whilst they ran downstairs i cant abide to dress any young lady who says never mind and it will do very well that and her never talking to one confidantially or trusting one with the least bit of her secrets is the thing i cant put up with from miss nugent and miss broadhurst holding the pins to me as much as to say do your business petito and dont talknow thats so impertinent as if one wasnt the same flesh and blood and had not as good a right to talk of everything and hear of everything as themselves and mrs broadhurst too cabinetcouncilling with my lady and pursing up her city mouth when i come in and turning off the discourse to snuff forsooth as if i was an ignoramus to think they closeted themselves to talk of snuff now i think a lady of qualitys woman has as good a right to be trusted with her ladys secrets as with her jewels and if my lady clonbrony was a real lady of quality shed know that and consider the one as much my paraphernalia as the other so i shall tell my lady tonight as i always do when she vexes me that i never lived in an irish family before and dont know the ways of itthen shell tell me she was born in hoxfordshirethen i shall say with my saucy look oh was you my ladyi always forget that you was an englishwoman then maybe shell say forgetyou forget yourself strangely petito then i shall say with a great deal of dignity if your ladyship thinks so my lady id better go and id desire no better than that she would take me at my word for my lady dashforts is a much better place im told and shes dying to have me i know and having formed this resolution petito concluded her apparently interminable soliloquy and went with my lords gentleman into the antechamber to hear the concert and give her judgment on everything as she peeped in through the vista of heads into the apollo saloonfor tonight the alhambra was transformed into the apollo saloonshe saw that whilst the company rank behind rank in close semicircles had crowded round the performers to hear a favourite singer miss broadhurst and lord colambre were standing in the outer semicircle talking to one another earnestly now would petito have given up her reversionary chance of the three nearly new gowns she expected from lady clonbrony in case she stayed or in case she went the reversionary chance of any dress of lady dashforts except her scarlet velvet merely to hear what miss broadhurst and lord colambre were saying alas she could only see their lips move and of what they were talking whether of music or love and whether the match was to be on or off she could only conjecture but the diplomatic style having now descended to waitingmaids mrs petito talked to her friends in the antechamber with as mysterious and consequential an air and tone as a charge daffaires or as the lady of a charge daffaires could have assumed she spoke of her private belief of the impression left upon her mind and her confidantial reasons for thinking as she did of her having had it from the fountains head and of her fear of any committal of her authorities notwithstanding all these authorities lord colambre left london next day and pursued his way to ireland determined that he would see and judge of that country for himself and decide whether his mothers dislike to residing there was founded on caprice or reasonable causes in the meantime it was reported in london that his lordship was gone to ireland to make out the title to some estate which would be necessary for his marriage settlement with the great heiress miss broadhurst whether mrs petito or sir terence ofay had the greater share in raising and spreading this report it would be difficult to determine but it is certain however or by whomsoever raised it was most useful to lord clonbrony by keeping his creditors quiet chapter vi the tide did not permit the packet to reach the pigeonhouse and the impatient lord colambre stepped into a boat and was rowed across the bay of dublin it was a fine summer morning the sun shone bright on the wicklow mountains he admired he exulted in the beauty of the prospect and all the early associations of his childhood and the patriotic hopes of his riper years swelled his heart as he approached the shores of his native land but scarcely had he touched his mother earth when the whole course of his ideas was changed and if his heart swelled it swelled no more with pleasurable sensations for instantly he found himself surrounded and attacked by a swarm of beggars and harpies with strange figures and stranger tones some craving his charity some snatching away his luggage and at the same time bidding him never trouble himself and never fear a scramble in the boat and on shore for bags and parcels began and an amphibious fight betwixt men who had one foot on sea and one on land was seen and long and loud the battle of trunks and portmanteaus raged the vanquished departed clinching their empty hands at their opponents and swearing inextinguishable hatred while the smiling victors stood at ease each grasping his bootybag basket parcel or portmanteau and your honour where will these gowhere will we carry em all to for your honour was now the question without waiting for an answer most of the goods were carried at the discretion of the porters to the customhouse where to his lordships astonishment after this scene of confusion he found that he had lost nothing but his patience all his goods were safe and a few tinpennies made his officious porters happy men and boys blessings were showered upon his honour and he was left in peace at an excellent hotel in street dublin he rested refreshed himself recovered his goodhumour and walked into the coffeehouse where he found several officersenglish irish and scotch one english officer a very gentlemanlike sensiblelooking man of middle age was sitting reading a little pamphlet when lord colambre entered he looked up from time to time and in a few minutes rose and joined the conversation it turned upon the beauties and defects of the city of dublin sir james brooke for that was the name of the gentleman showed one of his brother officers the book which he had been reading observing that in his opinion it contained one of the best views of dublin which he had ever seen evidently drawn by the hand of a master though in a slight playful and ironical style it was an intercepted letter from china the conversation extended from dublin to various parts of ireland with all which sir james brooke showed that he was well acquainted observing that this conversation was particularly interesting to lord colambre and quickly perceiving that he was speaking to one not ignorant of books sir james spoke of different representations and misrepresentations of ireland in answer to lord colambres inquiries he named the works which had afforded him most satisfaction and with discriminative not superficial celerity touched on all ancient and modern authors from spenser and davies to young and beaufort lord colambre became anxious to cultivate the acquaintance of a gentleman who appeared so able and willing to afford him information sir james brooke on his part was flattered by this eagerness of attention and pleased by our heros manners and conversation so that to their mutual satisfaction they spent much of their time together whilst they were at this hotel and meeting frequently in society in dublin their acquaintance every day increased and grew into intimacyan intimacy which was highly advantageous to lord colambres views of obtaining a just idea of the state of manners in ireland sir james brooke had at different periods been quartered in various parts of the countryhad resided long enough in each to become familiar with the people and had varied his residence sufficiently to form comparisons between different counties their habits and characteristics hence he had it in his power to direct the attention of our young observer at once to the points most worthy of his examination and to save him from the common error of travellersthe deducing general conclusions from a few particular cases or arguing from exceptions as if they were rules lord colambre from his family connexions had of course immediate introduction into the best society in dublin or rather into all the good society of dublin in dublin there is positively good company and positively bad but not as in london many degrees of comparison not innumerable luminaries of the polite world moving in different orbits of fashion but all the bright planets of note and name move and revolve in the same narrow limits lord colambre did not find that either his fathers or his mothers representations of society in dublin resembled the reality which he now beheld lady clonbrony had in terms of detestation described dublin such as it appeared to her soon after the union lord clonbrony had painted it with convivial enthusiasm such as he saw it long and long before the union when first he drank claret at the fashionable clubs this picture unchanged in his memory and unchangeable by his imagination had remained and ever would remain the same the hospitality of which the father boasted the son found in all its warmth but meliorated and refined less convivial more social the fashion of hospitality had improved to make the stranger eat or drink to excess to set before him old wine and old plate was no longer the sum of good breeding the guest now escaped the pomp of grand entertainments was allowed to enjoy ease and conversation and to taste some of that feast of reason and that flow of soul so often talked of and so seldom enjoyed lord colambre found a spirit of improvement a desire for knowledge and a taste for science and literature in most companies particularly among gentlemen belonging to the irish bar nor did he in dublin society see any of that confusion of ranks or predominance of vulgarity of which his mother had complained lady clonbrony had assured him that the last time she had been at the drawingroom at the castle a lady whom she afterwards found to be a grocers wife had turned angrily when her ladyship had accidentally trodden on her train and had exclaimed with a strong brogue ill thank you maam for the rest of my tail sir james brooke to whom lord colambre without giving up his authority mentioned the fact declared that he had no doubt the thing had happened precisely as it was stated but that this was one of the extraordinary cases which ought not to pass into a general rulethat it was a slight instance of that influence of temporary causes from which no conclusions as to national manners should be drawn i happened continued sir james to be quartered in dublin soon after the union took place and i remember the great but transient change that appeared from the removal of both houses of parliament most of the nobility and many of the principal families among the irish commoners either hurried in high hopes to london or retired disgusted and in despair to their houses in the country immediately in dublin commerce rose into the vacated seats of rank wealth rose into the place of birth new faces and new equipages appeared people who had never been heard of before started into notice pushed themselves forward not scrupling to elbow their way even at the castle and they were presented to my lordlieutenant and to my ladylieutenant for their excellencies for the time being might have played their viceregal parts to empty benches had they not admitted such persons for the moment to fill their court those of former times of hereditary pretensions and highbred minds and manners were scandalised at all this and they complained with justice that the whole tone of society was altered that the decorum elegance polish and charm of society was gone and i among the rest said sir james felt and deplored their change but now it is all over we may acknowledge that perhaps even those things which we felt most disagreeable at the time were productive of eventual benefit formerly a few families had set the fashion from time immemorial everything had in dublin been submitted to their hereditary authority and conversation though it had been rendered polite by their example was at the same time limited within narrow bounds young people educated upon a more enlarged plan in time grew up and no authority or fashion forbidding it necessarily rose to their just place and enjoyed their due influence in society the want of manners joined to the want of knowledge in the new set created universal disgust they were compelled some by ridicule some by bankruptcies to fall back into their former places from which they could never more emerge in the meantime some of the irish nobility and gentry who had been living at an unusual expense in londonan expense beyond their incomeswere glad to return home to refit and they brought with them a new stock of ideas and some taste for science and literature which within these latter years have become fashionable indeed indispensable in london that part of the irish aristocracy who immediately upon the first incursions of the vulgarians had fled in despair to their fastnesses in the country hearing of the improvements which had gradually taken place in society and assured of the final expulsion of the barbarians ventured from their retreats and returned to their posts in town so that now concluded sir james you find a society in dublin composed of a most agreeable and salutary mixture of birth and education gentility and knowledge manner and matter and you see pervading the whole new life and energy new talent new ambition a desire and a determination to improve and be improveda perception that higher distinction can now be obtained in almost all company by genius and merit than by airs and dress so much for the higher order now among the class of tradesmen and shopkeepers you may amuse yourself my lord with marking the difference between them and persons of the same rank in london lord colambre had several commissions to execute for his english friends and he made it his amusement in every shop to observe the manners and habits of the people he remarked that there are in dublin two classes of tradespeople one who go into business with intent to make it their occupation for life and as a slow but sure means of providing for themselves and their families another class who take up trade merely as a temporary resource to which they condescend for a few years trusting that they shall in that time make a fortune retire and commence or recommence gentlemen the irish regular men of business are like all other men of businesspunctual frugal careful and so forth with the addition of more intelligence invention and enterprise than are usually found in englishmen of the same rank but the dublin tradesmen pro tempore are a class by themselves they begin without capital buy stock upon credit in hopes of making large profits and in the same hopes sell upon credit now if the credit they can obtain is longer than that which they are forced to give they go on and prosper if not they break turn bankrupts and sometimes as bankrupts thrive by such men of course every short cut to fortune is followed whilst every habit which requires time to prove its advantage is disregarded nor with such views can a character for punctuality have its just value in the head of a man who intends to be a tradesman today and a gentleman tomorrow the ideas of the honesty and the duties of a tradesman and of the honour and the accomplishments of a gentleman are oddly jumbled together and the characteristics of both are lost in the compound he will oblige you but he will not obey you he will do you a favour but he will not do you justice he will do anything to serve you but the particular thing you order he neglects he asks your pardon for he would not for all the goods in his warehouse disoblige you not for the sake of your custom but he has a particular regard for your family economy in the eyes of such a tradesman is if not a mean vice at least a shabby virtue which he is too polite to suspect his customers of and particularly proud to prove himself superior to many london tradesmen after making their thousands and their tens of thousands feel pride in still continuing to live like plain men of business but from the moment a dublin tradesman of this style has made a few hundreds he sets up his gig and then his head is in his carriage and not in his business and when he has made a few thousands he buys or builds a countryhouseand then and thenceforward his head heart and soul are in his countryhouse and only his body in the shop with his customers whilst he is making money his wife or rather his lady is spending twice as much out of town as he makes in it at the word countryhouse let no one figure to himself a snug little box like that in which a warm london citizen after long years of toil indulges himself one day out of seven in reposeenjoying from his gazabo the smell of the dust and the view of passing coaches on the london road no these hibernian villas are on a much more magnificent scale some of them formerly belonged to irish members of parliament who are at a distance from their countryseats after the union these were bought by citizens and tradesmen who spoiled by the mixture of their own fancies what had originally been designed by men of good taste some time after lord colambres arrival in dublin he had an opportunity of seeing one of these villas which belonged to mrs raffarty a grocers lady and sister to one of lord clonbronys agents mr nicholas garraghty lord colambre was surprised to find that his fathers agent resided in dublin he had been used to see agents or stewards as they are called in england live in the country and usually on the estate of which they have the management mr nicholas garraghty however had a handsome house in a fashionable part of dublin lord colambre called several times to see him but he was out of town receiving rents for some other gentlemen as he was agent for more than one property though our hero had not the honour of seeing mr garraghty he had the pleasure of finding mrs raffarty one day at her brothers house just as his lordship came to the door she was going on her jauntingcar to her villa called tusculum situate near bray she spoke much of the beauties of the vicinity of dublin found his lordship was going with sir james brooke and a party of gentlemen to see the county of wicklow and his lordship and party were entreated to do her the honour of taking in his way a little collation at tusculum our hero was glad to have an opportunity of seeing more of a species of fine lady with which he was unacquainted the invitation was verbally made and verbally accepted but the lady afterwards thought it necessary to send a written invitation in due form and the note she sent directed to the most right honourable the lord viscount colambre on opening it he perceived that it could not have been intended for him it ran as follows my dear juliana oleary i have got a promise from colambre that he will be with us at tusculum on friday the th in his way from the county of wicklow for the collation i mentioned and expect a large party of officers so pray come early with your house or as many as the jauntingcar can bring and pray my dear be elegant you need not let it transpire to mrs og but make my apologies to miss og if she says anything and tell her im quite concerned i cant ask her for that day because tell her im so crowded and am to have none that day but real qualityyours ever and ever anastasia raffarty psand i hope to make the gentlemen stop the night with me so will not have beds excuse haste and compliments etc tusculum sunday after a charming tour in the county of wicklow where the beauty of the natural scenery and the taste with which those natural beauties had been cultivated far surpassed the sanguine expectations lord colambre had formed his lordship and his companions arrived at tusculum where he found mrs raffarty and miss juliana oleary very elegant with a large party of the ladies and gentlemen of bray assembled in a drawingroom fine with bad pictures and gaudy gilding the windows were all shut and the company were playing cards with all their might this was the fashion of the neighbourhood in compliment to lord colambre and the officers the ladies left the cardtables and mrs raffarty observing that his lordship seemed partial to walking took him out as she said to do the honours of nature and art his lordship was much amused by the mixture which was now exhibited to him of taste and incongruity ingenuity and absurdity genius and blunder by the contrast between the finery and vulgarity the affectation and ignorance of the lady of the villa we should be obliged to stop too long at tusculum were we to attempt to detail all the odd circumstances of this visit but we may record an example or two which may give a sufficient idea of the whole in the first place before they left the drawingroom miss juliana oleary pointed out to his lordships attention a picture over the drawingroom chimneypiece is not it a fine piece my lord said she naming the price mrs raffarty had lately paid for it at an auctionit has a right to be a fine piece indeed for it cost a fine price nevertheless this fine piece was a vile daub and our hero could only avoid the sin of flattery or the danger of offending the lady by protesting that he had no judgment in pictures indeed i dont pretend to be a connoisseur or conoscenti myself but im told the style is undeniably modern and was not i lucky juliana not to let that medona be knocked down to me i was just going to bid when i heard such smart bidding but fortunately the auctioneer let out that it was done by a very old mastera hundred years old oh your most obedient thinks iif thats the case its not for my money so i bought this in lieu of the smokedried thing and had it a bargain in architecture mrs rafferty had as good a taste and as much skill as in painting there had been a handsome portico in front of the house but this interfering with the ladys desire to have a veranda which she said could not be dispensed with she had raised the whole portico to the second story where it stood or seemed to stand upon a tarpaulin roof but mrs raffarty explained that the pillars though they looked so properly substantial were really hollow and as light as feathers and were supported with cramps without disobliging the front wall of the house at all to signify before she showed the company any farther she said she must premise to his lordship that she had been originally stinted in room for her improvements so that she could not follow her genius liberally she had been reduced to have some things on a confined scale and occasionally to consult her pocketcompass but she prided herself upon having put as much into a light pattern as could well be that had been her whole ambition study and problem for she was determined to have at least the honour of having a little taste of everything at tusculum so she led the way to a little conservatory and a little pinery and a little grapery and a little aviary and a little pheasantry and a little dairy for show and a little cottage for ditto with a grotto full of shells and a little hermitage full of earwigs and a little ruin full of lookingglass to enlarge and multiply the effect of the gothic but you could only put your head in because it was just fresh painted and though there had been a fire ordered in the ruin all night it had only smoked in all mrs raffartys buildings whether ancient or modern there was a studied crookedness yes she said she hated everything straight it was so formal and unpicturesque uniformity and conformity she observed had their day but now thank the stars of the present day irregularity and deformity bear the bell and have the majority as they proceeded and walked through the grounds from which mrs raffarty though she had done her best could not take that which nature had given she pointed out to my lord a happy moving termination consisting of a chinese bridge with a fisherman leaning over the rails on a sudden the fisherman was seen to tumble over the bridge into the water the gentlemen ran to extricate the poor fellow while they heard mrs raffarty bawling to his lordship to beg he would never mind and not trouble himself when they arrived at the bridge they saw the man hanging from part of the bridge and apparently struggling in the water but when they attempted to pull him up they found it was only a stuffed figure which had been pulled into the stream by a real fish which had seized hold of the bait mrs raffarty vexed by the fishermans fall and by the laughter it occasioned did not recover herself sufficiently to be happily ridiculous during the remainder of the walk nor till dinner was announced when she apologised for having changed the collation at first intended into a dinner which she hoped would be found no bad substitute and which she flattered herself might prevail on my lord and the gentlemen to sleep as there was no moon the dinner had two great faultsprofusion and pretension there was in fact ten times more on the table than was necessary and the entertainment was far above the circumstances of the person by whom it was given for instance the dish of fish at the head of the table had been brought across the island from sligo and had cost five guineas as the lady of the house failed not to make known but after all things were not of a piece there was a disparity between the entertainment and the attendants there was no proportion or fitness of thingsa painful endeavour at what could not be attained and a toiling in vain to conceal and repair deficiencies and blunders had the mistress of the house been quiet had she as mrs broadhurst would say but let things alone let things take their course all would have passed off with wellbred people but she was incessantly apologising and fussing and fretting inwardly and outwardly and directing and calling to her servantsstriving to make a butler who was deaf a boy who was harebrained do the business of five accomplished footmen of parts and figure the mistress of the house called for plates clean plateshot plates but none did come when she did call for them mrs raffarty called larry larry my lords plate therejames bread to captain bowlesjames port wine to the majorjames james kenny james and panting james toiled after her in vain at length one course was fairly got through and after a torturing halfhour the second course appeared and james kenny was intent upon one thing and larry upon another so that the winesauce for the hare was spilt by their collision but what was worse there seemed little chance that the whole of this second course should ever be placed altogether rightly upon the table mrs raffarty cleared her throat and nodded and pointed and sighed and set larry after kenny and kenny after larry for what one did the other undid and at last the ladys anger kindled and she spoke kenny james kenny set the seacale at this corner and put down the grass crosscorners and match your macaroni yonder with them puddens setogh james the pyramid in the middle cant ye the pyramid in changing places was overturned then it was that the mistress of the feast falling back in her seat and lifting up her hands and eyes in despair ejaculated oh james james the pyramid was raised by the assistance of the military engineers and stood trembling again on its base but the ladys temper could not be so easily restored to its equilibrium the comedy of errors which this days visit exhibited amused all the spectators but lord colambre after he had smiled sometimes sighedsimilar foibles and follies in persons of different rank fortune and manner appear to common observers so unlike that they laugh without scruples of conscience in one case at what in another ought to touch themselves most nearly it was the same desire to appear what they were not the same vain ambition to vie with superior rank and fortune or fashion which actuated lady clonbrony and mrs raffarty and whilst this ridiculous grocers wife made herself the sport of some of her guests lord colambre sighed from the reflection that what she was to them his mother was to persons in a higher rank of fashionhe sighed still more deeply when he considered that in whatever station or with whatever fortune extravagance that is the living beyond our income must lead to distress and meanness and end in shame and ruin in the morning as they were riding away from tusculum and talking over their visit the officers laughed heartily and rallying lord colambre upon his seriousness accused him of having fallen in love with mrs raffarty or with the elegant miss juliana our hero who wished never to be nice overmuch or serious out of season laughed with those that laughed and endeavoured to catch the spirit of the jest but sir james brooke who now was well acquainted with his countenance and who knew something of the history of his family understood his real feelings and sympathising in them endeavoured to give the conversation a new turn look there bowles said he as they were just riding into the town of bray look at the barouche standing at that green door at the farthest end of the town is not that lady dashforts barouche it looks like what she sported in dublin last year said bowles but you dont think shed give us the same two seasons besides she is not in ireland is she i did not hear of her intending to come over again i beg your pardon said another officer she will come again to so good a market to marry her other daughter i hear she said or swore that she will marry the young widow lady isabel to an irish nobleman whatever she says she swears and whatever she swears shell do replied bowles have a care my lord colambre if she sets her heart upon you for lady isabel she has you nothing can save you heart she has none so there youre safe my lord said the other officer but if lady isabel sets her eye upon you no basilisks is surer but if lady dashfort had landed i am sure we should have heard of it for she makes noise enough wherever she goes especially in dublin where all she said and did was echoed and magnified till one could hear of nothing else i dont think she has landed i hope to heaven they may never land again in ireland cried sir james brooke one worthless woman especially one worthless englishwoman of rank does incalculable mischief in a country like this which looks up to the sister country for fashion for my own part as a warm friend to ireland i would rather see all the toads and serpents and venomous reptiles that st patrick carried off in his bag come back to this island than these two dashers why they would bite half the women and girls in the kingdom with the rage for mischief before half the husbands and fathers could turn their heads about and once bit theres no cure in nature or art no horses to this barouche cried captain bowlespray sir whose carriage is this said the captain to a servant who was standing beside it my lady dashfort sir it belongs to answered the servant in rather a surly english tone and turning to a boy who was lounging at the doorpat bid them bring out the horses for my ladies is in a hurry to get home captain bowles stopped to make his servant alter the girths of his horse and to satisfy his curiosity and the whole party halted captain bowles beckoned to the landlord of the inn who was standing at his door so lady dashfort is here againthis is her barouche is not it yes sir she isit is and has she sold her fine horses oh no sirthis is not her carriage at allshe is not here that is she is here in ireland but down in the county of wicklow on a visit and this is not her own carriage at allthat is to say not that which she has with herself driving but only just the cast barouche like as she keeps for the ladys maids for the ladys maids that is good that is new faith sir james do you hear that indeed then and its true and not a word of a lie said the honest landlord and this minute weve got a directory of five of them abigails sitting within in our house as fine ladies as great dashers too every bit as their principals and kicking up as much dust on the road every grainthink of them now the likes of them that must have four horses and would not stir a foot with one lessas the gentlemans gentleman there was telling and boasting to me about now when the barouche was ordered for them there at the ladys house where lady dashfort is on a visitthey said they would not get in till theyd get four horses and their ladies backed them and so the four horses was got and they just drove out here to see the points of view for fashions sake like their betters and up with their glasses like their ladies and then out with their watches and isnt it time to lunch so there they have been lunching within on what they brought with them for nothing in our house could they touch of course they brought themselves a picknick lunch with madeira and champagne to wash it down why gentlemen what do you think but a set of them as they were bragging to me turned out of a boardinghouse at cheltenham last year because they had not peachpies to their lunchbut here they come shawls and veils and allstreamers flying but mum is my cuecaptain are these girths to your fancy now said the landlord aloud then as he stooped to alter a buckle he said in a voice meant to be heard only by captain bowles if theres a tongue male or female in the three kingdoms its in that foremost woman mrs petito mrs petito repeated lord colambre as the name caught his ear and approaching the barouche in which the five abigails were now seated he saw the identical mrs petito who when he left london had been in his mothers service she recognised his lordship with very gracious intimacy and before he had time to ask any questions she answered all she conceived he was going to ask and with a volubility which justified the landlords eulogium of her tongue yes my lord i left my lady clonbrony some time backthe day after you left town and both her ladyship and miss nugent was charmingly and would have sent their loves to your lordship im sure if theyd any notion i should have met you my lord so soon and i was very sorry to part with them but the fact was my lord said mrs petito laying a detaining hand upon lord colambres whip one end of which he unwittingly trusted within her reachi and my lady had a little difference which the best friends you know sometimes have so my lady clonbrony was so condescending to give me up to my lady dashfortand i knew no more than the child unborn that her ladyship had it in contemplation to cross the seas but to oblige my lady and as colonel heathcock with his regiment of militia was coming for purtection in the packet at the same time and we to have the governmentyacht i waived my objections to ireland and indeed though i was greatly frighted at first having heard all weve heard you know my lord from lady clonbrony of there being no living in ireland and expecting to see no trees nor accommodation nor anything but bogs all along yet i declare i was very agreeably surprised for as far as ive seen at dublin and in the vicinity the accommodations and everything of that nature now is vastly putupable withmy lord said sir james brooke we shall be late lord colambre shortly withdrawing his whip from mrs petito turned his horse away she stretching over the back of the barouche as he rode off bawled to him my lord were at stephens green when were at dublin but as he did not choose to hear she raised her voice to its highest pitch adding and where are you my lord to be foundas i have a parcel of miss nugents for you lord colambre instantly turned back and gave his direction cleverly done faith said the major i did not hear her say when lady dashfort is to be in town said captain bowles what bowles have you a mind to lose more of your guineas to lady dashfort and to be jockied out of another horse by lady isabel oh confound itno ill keep out of the way of thati have had enough said captain bowles it is my lord colambres turn now you hear that lady dashfort would be very proud to see him his lordship is in for it and with such an auxiliary as mrs petito lady dashfort has him for lady isabel as sure as he has a heart or hand my compliments to the ladies but my heart is engaged said lord colambre and my hand shall go with my heart or not at all engaged engaged to a very amiable charming woman no doubt said sir james brooke i have an excellent opinion of your taste and if you can return the compliment to my judgment take my advice dont trust to your hearts being engaged much less plead that engagement for it would be lady dashforts sport and lady isabels joy to make you break your engagement and break your mistresss heart the fairer the more amiable the more beloved the greater the triumph the greater the delight in giving pain all the time love would be out of the question neither mother nor daughter would care if you were hanged or as lady dashfort would herself have expressed it if you were dd with such women i should think a mans heart could be in no great danger said lord colambre there you might be mistaken my lord theres a way to every mans heart which no man in his own case is aware of but which every woman knows right well and none better than these ladiesby his vanity true said captain bowles i am not so vain as to think myself without vanity said lord colambre but love i should imagine is a stronger passion than vanity you should imagine stay till you are tried my lord excuse me said captain bowles laughing lord colambre felt the good sense of this and determined to have nothing to do with these dangerous ladies indeed though he had talked he had scarcely yet thought of them for his imagination was intent upon that packet from miss nugent which mrs petito said she had for him he heard nothing of it or of her for some days he sent his servant every day to stephens green to inquire if lady dashfort had returned to town her ladyship at last returned but mrs petito could not deliver the parcel to any hand but lord colambres own and she would not stir out because her lady was indisposed no longer able to restrain his impatience lord colambre went himselfknocked at lady dashforts doorinquired for mrs petitowas shown into her parlour the parcel was delivered to him but to his utter disappointment it was a parcel for not from miss nugent it contained merely an odd volume of some book of miss nugents which mrs petito said she had put up along with her things in a mistake and she thought it her duty to return it by the next opportunity of a safe conveyance whilst lord colambre to comfort himself for his disappointment was fixing his eyes upon miss nugents name written by her own hand in the first leaf of the book the door opened and the figure of an interestinglooking woman in deep mourning appearedappeared for one moment and retired only my lord colambre about a parcel i was bringing for him from england my ladymy lady isabel my lord said mrs petito whilst mrs petito was saying this the entrance and retreat had been made and made with such dignity grace and modesty with such innocence dovelike eyes had been raised upon him fixed and withdrawn with such a gracious bend the lady isabel had bowed to him as she retired with such a smile and with so soft a voice had repeated lord colambre that his lordship though well aware that all this was mere acting could not help saying to himself as he left the house it is a pity it is only acting there is certainly something very engaging in this woman it is a pity she is an actress and so young a much younger woman than i expected a widow before most women are wives so young surely she cannot be such a fiend as they described her to be a few nights afterwards lord colambre was with some of his acquaintance at the theatre when lady isabel and her mother came into the box where seats had been reserved for them and where their appearance instantly made that sensation which is usually created by the entrance of persons of the first notoriety in the fashionable world lord colambre was not a man to be dazzled by fashion or to mistake notoriety for deference paid to merit and for the admiration commanded by beauty or talents lady dashforts coarse person loud voice daring manners and indelicate wit disgusted him almost past endurance he saw sir james brooke in the box opposite to him and twice determined to go round to him his lordship had crossed the benches and once his hand was upon the lock of the door but attracted as much by the daughter as repelled by the mother he could move no farther the mothers masculine boldness heightened by contrast the charms of the daughters soft sentimentality the lady isabel seemed to shrink from the indelicacy of her mothers manners and seemed peculiarly distressed by the strange efforts lady dashfort made from time to time to drag her forward and to fix upon her the attention of gentlemen colonel heathcock who as mrs petito had informed lord colambre had come over with his regiment to ireland was beckoned into their box by lady dashfort by her squeezed into a seat next to lady isabel but lady isabel seemed to feel sovereign contempt properly repressed by politeness for what in a low whisper to a female friend on the other side of her she called the selfsufficient inanity of this sad coxcomb other coxcombs of a more vivacious style who stationed themselves round her mother or to whom her mother stretched from box to box to talk seemed to engage no more of lady isabels attention than just what she was compelled to give by lady dashforts repeated calls of isabel isabel colonel g isabel lord d bowing to you belie belie sir harry b isabel child with your eyes on the stage did you never see a play before novice major pwaiting to catch your eye this quarter of an hour and now her eyes gone down to her playbill sir harry do take it from her were eyes so radiant only made to read lady isabel appeared to suffer so exquisitely and so naturally from this persecution that lord colambre said to himself if this be acting it is the best acting i ever saw if this be art it deserves to be nature and with this sentiment he did himself the honour of handing lady isabel to her carriage this night and with this sentiment he awoke next morning and by the time he had dressed and breakfasted he determined that it was impossible all that he had seen could be acting no woman no young woman could have such art sir james brooke had been unwarrantably severe he would go and tell him so but sir james brooke this day received orders for his regiment to march to quarters in a distant part of ireland his head was full of arms and ammunition and knapsacks and billets and routes and there was no possibility even in the present chivalrous disposition of our hero to enter upon the defence of the lady isabel indeed in the regret he felt for the approaching and unexpected departure of his friend lord colambre forgot the fair lady but just when sir james had his foot in the stirrup he stopped by the bye my dear lord i saw you at the play last night you seemed to be much interested dont think me impertinent if i remind you of our conversation when we were riding home from tusculum and if i warn you said he mounting his horse to beware of counterfeitsfor such are abroad reining in his impatient steed sir james turned again and added deeds not words is my motto remember we can judge better by the conduct of people towards others than by their manner towards ourselves chapter vii our hero was quite convinced of the good sense of his friends last remark that it is safer to judge of people by their conduct to others than by their manners towards ourselves but as yet he felt scarcely any interest on the subject of lady dashfort or lady isabels characters however he inquired and listened to all the evidence he could obtain respecting this mother and daughter he heard terrible reports of the mischief they had done in families the extravagance into which they had led men the imprudence to say no worse into which they had betrayed women matches broken off reputations ruined husbands alienated from their wives and wives made jealous of their husbands but in some of these stories he discovered exaggeration so flagrant as to make him doubt the whole in others it could not be positively determined whether the mother or daughter had been the person most to blame lord colambre always followed the charitable rule of believing only half what the world says and here he thought it fair to believe which half he pleased he further observed that though all joined in abusing these ladies in their absence when present they seemed universally admired though everybody cried shame and shocking yet everybody visited them no parties so crowded as lady dashforts no party deemed pleasant or fashionable where lady dashfort or lady isabel was not the bonmots of the mother were everywhere repeated the dress and air of the daughter everywhere imitated yet lord colambre could not help being surprised at their popularity in dublin because independently of all moral objections there were causes of a different sort sufficient he thought to prevent lady dashfort from being liked by the irish indeed by any society she in general affected to be illbred and inattentive to the feelings and opinions of others careless whom she offended by her wit or by her decided tone there are some persons in so high a region of fashion that they imagine themselves above the thunder of vulgar censure lady dashfort felt herself in this exalted situation and fancied she might hear the innocuous thunder roll below her rank was so high that none could dare to call her vulgar what would have been gross in any one of meaner note in her was freedom or originality or lady dashforts way it was lady dashforts pleasure and pride to show her power in perverting the public taste she often said to those english companions with whom she was intimate now see what follies i can lead these fools into hear the nonsense i can make them repeat as wit upon some occasion one of her friends ventured to fear that something she had said was too strong too strong was it well i like to be strongwoe be to the weak on another occasion she was told that certain visitors had seen her ladyship yawning yawn did iglad of itthe yawn sent them away or i should have snoredrude was i they wont complain to say i was rude to them would be to say that i did not think it worth my while to be otherwise barbarians are not we the civilised english come to teach them manners and fashions whoever does not conform and swear allegiance too we shall keep out of the english pale lady dashfort forced her way and she set the fashion fashion which converts the ugliest dress into what is beautiful and charming governs the public mode in morals and in manners and thus when great talents and high rank combine they can debase or elevate the public taste with lord colambre she played more artfully she drew him out in defence of his beloved country and gave him opportunities of appearing to advantage this he could not help feeling especially when the lady isabel was present lady dashfort had dealt long enough with human nature to know that to make any man pleased with her she should begin by making him pleased with himself insensibly the antipathy that lord colambre had originally felt to lady dashfort wore off her faults he began to think were assumed he pardoned her defiance of good breeding when he observed that she could when she chose it be most engagingly polite it was not that she did not know what was right but that she did not think it always for her interest to practise it the party opposed to lady dashfort affirmed that her wit depended merely on unexpectedness a characteristic which may be applied to any impropriety of speech manner or conduct in some of her ladyships repartees however lord colambre now acknowledged there was more than unexpectedness there was real wit but it was of a sort utterly unfit for a woman and he was sorry that lady isabel should hear it in short exceptionable as it was altogether lady dashforts conversation had become entertaining to him and though he could never esteem or feel in the least interested about her he began to allow that she could be agreeable ay i knew how it would be said she when some of her friends told her this he began by detesting me and did i not tell you that if i thought it worth my while to make him like me he must sooner or later i delight in seeing people begin with me as they do with olives making all manner of horrid faces and silly protestations that they will never touch an olive again as long as they live but after a little time these very folk grow so desperately fond of olives that there is no dessert without them isabel child you are in the sweet linebut sweets cloy you never heard of anybody living on marmalade did yelady isabel answered by a sweet smileto do you justice you play lydia languish vastly well pursued the mother but lydia by herself would soon tire somebody must keep up the spirit and bustle and carry on the plot of the piece and i am that somebodyas you shall see is not that our heros voice which i hear on the stairs it was lord colambre his lordship had by this time become a constant visitor at lady dashforts not that he had forgotten or that he meant to disregard his friend sir james brookes parting words he promised himself faithfully that if anything should occur to give him reason to suspect designs such as those to which the warning pointed he would be on his guard and would prove his generalship by an able retreat but to imagine attacks where none were attempted to suspect ambuscades in the open country would be ridiculous and cowardly no thought our hero heaven forfend i should be such a coxcomb as to fancy every woman who speaks to me has designs upon my precious heart or on my more precious estate as he walked from his hotel to lady dashforts house ingeniously wrong he came to this conclusion just as he ascended the stairs and just as her ladyship had settled her future plan of operations after talking over the nothings of the day and after having given two or three cuts at the society of dublin with two or three compliments to individuals who she knew were favourites with his lordship she suddenly turned to him my lord i think you told me or my own sagacity discovered that you want to see something of ireland and that you dont intend like most travellers to turn round see nothing and go home content lord colambre assured her ladyship that she had judged him rightly for that nothing would content him but seeing all that was possible to be seen of his native country it was for this special purpose he came to ireland ahwellvery good purposecant be better but now how to accomplish it you know the portuguese proverb says you go to hell for the good things you intend to do and to heaven for those you do now let us see what you will do dublin i suppose youve seen enough of by this time through and throughround and round this makes me first giddy and then sick let me show you the countrynot the face of it but the body of itthe people not castle this or newtown that but their inhabitants i know them i have the key or the picklock to their minds an irishman is as different an animal on his guard and off his guard as a miss in school from a miss out of school a fine country for game ill show you and if you are a good marksman you may have plenty of shots at folly as it flies lord colambre smiled as to isabel pursued her ladyship i shall put her in charge of heathcock who is going with us she wont thank me for that but you will nay no fibs man you know i know as who does not that has seen the world that though a pretty woman is a mighty pretty thing yet she is confoundedly in ones way when anything else is to be seen heardor understood every objection anticipated and removed and so far a prospect held out of attaining all the information he desired with more than all the amusement he could have expected lord colambre seemed much tempted to accept the invitation but he hesitated because as he said her ladyship might be going to pay visits where he was not acquainted bless you dont let that be a stumblingblock in the way of your tender conscience i am going to killpatrickstown where youll be as welcome as light you know them they know you at least you shall have a proper letter of invitation from my lord and my lady killpatrick and all that and as to the rest you know a young man is always welcome everywhere a young nobleman kindly welcomei wont say such a young man and such a young nobleman for that might put you to pour bows or your blushesbut nobilitas by itself nobility is enough in all parties in all families where there are girls and of course balls as there are always at killpatrickstown dont be alarmed you shall not be forced to dance or asked to marry ill be your security you shall be at full liberty and it is a house where you can do just what you will indeed i go to no others these killpatricks are the best creatures in the world they think nothing good or grand enough for me if id let them they would lay down cloth of gold over their bogs for me to walk upongoodhearted beings added lady dashfort marking a cloud gathering on lord colambres countenance i laugh at them because i love them i could not love anything i might not laugh atyour lordship excepted so youll comethats settled and so it was settled our hero went to killpatrickstown everything here sumptuous and unfinished you see said lady dashfort to lord colambre the day after their arrival all begun as if the projectors thought they had the command of the mines of peru and ended as if the possessors had not sixpence des arrangemens provisatoires temporary expedients in plain english makeshifts luxuries enough for an english prince of the blood comforts not enough for an english woman and you may be sure that great repairs and alterations have gone on to fit this house for our reception and for our english eyespoor peopleenglish visitors in this point of view are horribly expensive to the irish did you ever hear that in the last century or in the century before the last to put my story far enough back so that it shall not touch anybody living when a certain english nobleman lord blank a sent to let his irish friend lord blank b know that he and all his train were coming over to pay him a visit the irish nobleman blank b knowing the deplorable condition of his castle sat down fairly to calculate whether it would cost him most to put the building in good and sufficient repair fit to receive these english visitors or to burn it to the ground he found the balance to be in favour of burning which was wisely accomplished next day perhaps killpatrick would have done well to follow this example resolve me which is worst to be burnt out of house and home or to be eaten out of house and home in this house above and below stairs including first and second table housekeepers room ladys maids room butlers room and gentlemans one hundred and four people sit down to dinner every day as petito informs me beside kitchen boys and what they call charwomen who never sit down but who do not eat or waste the less for that and retainers and friends friends to the fifth and sixth generation who must get their bit and their sup for sure its only biddy they say continued lady dashfort imitating their irish brogue find sure tis nothing at all out of all his honour my lord has how could he feel it feel it become sensible of it know it long life to him hes not that way not a couple in all ireland and thats saying a great dale looks less after their own nor is more offhandeder or openhearteder or greater openhousekeepers nor than my lord and my lady killpatrick now theres encouragement for a lord and a lady to ruin themselves lady dashfort imitated the irish brogue in perfection boasted that she was mistress of fourteen different brogues and had brogues for all occasions by her mixture of mimickry sarcasm exaggeration and truth she succeeded continually in making lord colambre laugh at everything at which she wished to make him laugh at every thing but not every body whenever she became personal he became serious or at least endeavoured to become serious and if he could not instantly resume the command of his risible muscles he reproached himself it is shameful to laugh at these people indeed lady dashfort in their own housethese hospitable people who are entertaining us entertaining us true and if we are entertained how can we help laughing all expostulation was thus turned off by a jest as it was her pride to make lord colambre laugh in spite of his better feelings and principles this he saw and this seemed to him to be her sole object but there he was mistaken offhanded as she pretended to be none dealt more in the impromptu fait a loisir and mentally shortsighted as she affected to be none had more longanimity for their own interest it was her settled purpose to make the irish and ireland ridiculous and contemptible to lord colambre to disgust him with his native country to make him abandon the wish of residing on his own estate to confirm him an absentee was her object previously to her ultimate plan of marrying him to her daughter her daughter was poor she would therefore be glad to get an irish peer for her but would be very sorry she said to see isabel banished to ireland and the young widow declared she could never bring herself to be buried alive in clonbrony castle in addition to these considerations lady dashfort received certain hints from mrs petito which worked all to the same point why yes my lady i heard a great deal about all that when i was at lady clonbronys said petito one day as she was attending at her ladys toilette and encouraged to begin chattering and i own i was originally under the universal error that my lord colambre was to be married to the great heiress miss broadhurst but i have been converted and reformed on that score and am at present quite in another way and style of thinking petito paused in hopes that her lady would ask what was her present way of thinking but lady dashfort certain that she would tell her without being asked did not take the trouble to speak particularly as she did not choose to appear violently interested on the subjectmy present way of thinking resumed petito is in consequence of my having with my own eyes and ears witnessed and overheard his lordships behaviour and words the morning he was coming away from lunnun for ireland when he was morally certain nobody was up nor overhearing nor overseeing him there did i notice him my lady stopping in the antechamber ejaculating over one of miss nugents gloves which he had picked up limerick said he quite loud to himself for it was a limerick glove my ladylimerickdear ireland she loves you as well as i door words to that effect and then a sigh and downstairs and off so thinks i now the cats out of the bag and i wouldnt give much myself for miss broadhursts chance of that young lord with all her bank stock scrip and omnum now i see how the land lies and im sorry for it for shes no fortin and shes so proud she never said a hint to me of the matter but my lord colambre is a sweet gentleman and petito dont run on so you must not meddle with what you dont understand the miss killpatricks to be sure are sweet girls particularly the youngesther ladyships toilette was finished and she left petito to go down to my lady killpatricks woman to tell as a very great secret the schemes that were in contemplation among the higher powers in favour of the youngest of the miss killpatricks so ireland is at the bottom of his heart is it repeated lady dashfort to herself it shall not be long so from this time forward not a day scarcely an hour passed but her ladyship did or said something to depreciate the country or its inhabitants in our heros estimation with treacherous ability she knew and followed all the arts of misrepresentation all those injurious arts which his friend sir james brooke had with such honest indignation reprobated she knew how not only to seize the ridiculous points to make the most respectable people ridiculous but she knew how to select the worst instances the worst exceptions and to produce them as examples as precedents from which to condemn whole classes and establish general false conclusions respecting a nation in the neighbourhood of killpatrickstown lady dashfort said there were several squireens or little squires a race of men who have succeeded to the buckeens described by young and crumpe squireens are persons who with good long leases or valuable farms possess incomes from three to eight hundred a year who keep a pack of hounds take out a commission of the peace sometimes before they can spell as her ladyship said and almost always before they know anything of law or justice busy and loud about small matters jobbers at assizes combining with one another and trying upon every occasion public or private to push themselves forward to the annoyance of their superiors and the terror of those below them in the usual course of things these men are not often to be found in the society of gentry except perhaps among those gentlemen or noblemen who like to see hangerson at their tables or who find it for their convenience to have underling magistrates to protect their favourites or to propose and carry jobs for them on grand juries at election times however these persons rise into sudden importance with all who have views upon the county lady dashfort hinted to lord killpatrick that her private letters from england spoke of an approaching dissolution of parliament she knew that upon this hint a round of invitations would be sent to the squireens and she was morally certain that they would be more disagreeable to lord colambre and give him a worse idea of the country than any other people who could be produced day after day some of these personages made their appearance and lady dashfort took care to draw them out upon the subjects on which she knew that they would show the most selfsufficient ignorance and the most illiberal spirit this succeeded beyond her most sanguine expectations lord colambre how i pity you for being compelled to these permanent sittings after dinner said lady isabel to him one night when he came late to the ladies from the diningroom lord killpatrick insisted upon my staying to help him to push about that neverending stillbeginning electioneering bottle said lord colambre oh if that were all if these gentlemen would only drinkbut their conversation i dont wonder my mother dreads returning to clonbrony castle if my father must have such company as this but surely it cannot be necessary oh indispensable positively indispensable cried lady dashfort no living in ireland without it you know in every country in the world you must live with the people of the country or be torn to pieces for my part i should prefer being torn to pieces lady dashfort and lady isabel knew how to take advantage of the contrast between their own conversation and that of the persons by whom lord colambre was so justly disgusted they happily relieved his fatigue with wit satire poetry and sentiment so that he every day became more exclusively fond of their company for lady killpatrick and the miss killpatricks were mere commonplace people in the mornings he rode or walked with lady dashfort and lady isabel lady dashfort by way of fulfilling her promise of showing him the people used frequently to take him into the cabins and talk to their inhabitants lord and lady killpatrick who had lived always for the fashionable world had taken little pains to improve the condition of their tenants the few attempts they had made were injudicious they had built ornamented picturesque cottages within view of their demesne and favourite followers of the family people with half a centurys habit of indolence and dirt were promoted to these fine dwellings the consequences were such as lady dashfort delighted to point out everything let to go to ruin for the want of a moments care or pulled to pieces for the sake of the most trifling surreptitious profit the people most assisted always appearing proportionally wretched and discontented no one could with more ease and more knowledge of her ground than lady dashfort do the dishonour of a country in every cabin that she entered by the first glance of her eye at the head kerchiefed in no comely guise or by the drawndown corners of the mouth or by the bit of a broken pipe which in ireland never characterises stout labour or by the first sound of the voice the drawling accent on your honour or my lady she could distinguish the proper objects of her charitable designs that is to say those of the old uneducated race whom no one can help because they will never help themselves to these she constantly addressed herself making them give in all their despairing tones a history of their complaints and grievances then asking them questions aptly contrived to expose their habits of selfcontradiction their servility and flattery one moment and their litigious and encroaching spirit the next thus giving lord colambre the most unfavourable idea of the disposition and character of the lower class of the irish people lady isabel the while standing by with the most amiable air of pity with expressions of the finest moral sensibility softening all her mother said finding ever some excuse for the poor creatures and following with angelic sweetness to heal the wounds her mother inflicted when lady dashfort thought she had sufficiently worked upon lord colambres mind to weaken his enthusiasm for his native country and when lady isabel had by the appearance of every virtue added to a delicate preference if not partiality for our hero ingratiated herself into his good opinion and obtained an interest in his mind the wily mother ventured an attack of a more decisive nature and so contrived it was that if it failed it should appear to have been made without design to injure and in total ignorance one day lady dashfort who in fact was not proud of her family though she pretended to be so had herself prevailed on though with much difficulty by lady killpatrick to do the very thing she wanted to do to show her genealogy which had been beautifully blazoned and which was to be produced as evidence in the lawsuit that brought her to ireland lord colambre stood politely looking on and listening while her ladyship explained the splendid intermarriages of her family pointing to each medallion that was filled gloriously with noble and even with royal names till at last she stopped short and covering one medallion with her finger she said pass over that dear lady killpatrick you are not to see that lord colambrethats a little blot in our scutcheon you know isabel we never talk of that prudent match of greatuncle johns what could he expect by marrying into that family where you know all the men were not sans peur and none of the women sans reproche oh mamma cried lady isabel not one exception not one isabel persisted lady dashfort there was lady and the other sister that married the man with the long nose and the daughter again of whom they contrived to make an honest woman by getting her married in time to a blueribband and who contrived to get herself into doctors commons the very next year well dear mamma that is enough and too much oh pray dont go on cried lady isabel who had appeared very much distressed during her mothers speech you dont know what you are saying indeed maam you dont very likely child but that compliment i can return to you on the spot and with interest for you seem to me at this instant not to know either what you are saying or what you are doing come come explain oh no maampray say so no more i will explain myself another time nay there you are wrong isabel in point of goodbreeding anything is better than hints and mystery since i have been so unlucky as to touch upon the subject better go through with it and with all the boldness of innocence ask the question are you my lord colambre or are you not related or connected with any of the st omars not that i know of said lord colambre but i really am so bad a genealogist that i cannot answer positively then i must put the substance of my question into a new form have you or have you not a cousin of the name of nugent miss nugentgrace nugentyes said lord colambre with as much firmness of voice as he could command and with as little change of countenance as possible but as the question came upon him so unexpectedly it was not in his power to answer with an air of absolute indifference and composure and her mother was said lady dashfort my aunt by marriage her maiden name was reynolds i think but she died when i was quite a child i know very little about her i never saw her in my life but i am certain she was a reynolds oh my dear lord continued lady dashfort i am perfectly aware that she did take and bear the name of reynolds but that was not her maiden nameher maiden name was but perhaps it is a family secret that has been kept for some good reason from you and from the poor girl herself the maiden name was st omar depend upon it nay i would not have told this to you my lord if i could have conceived that it would affect you so violently pursued lady dashfort in a tone of raillery you see you are no worse off than we are we have an intermarriage with the st omars i did not think you would be so much shocked at a discovery which proves that our family and yours have some little connexion lord colambre endeavoured to answer and mechanically said something about happy to have the honour lady dashfort truly happy to see that her blow had hit the mark so well turned from his lordship without seeming to observe how seriously he was affected and lady isabel sighed and looked with compassion on lord colambre and then reproachfully at her mother but lord colambre heeded not her looks and heard not of her sighs he heard nothing saw nothing though his eyes were intently fixed on the genealogy on which lady dashfort was still descanting to lady killpatrick he took the first opportunity he could of quitting the room and went out to take a solitary walk there he is departed but not in peace to reflect upon what has been said whispered lady dashfort to her daughter i hope it will do him a vast deal of good none of the women sans reproche nonewithout one exception said lord colambre to himself and grace nugents mother a st omaris it possible lady dashfort seems certain she could not assert a positive falsehoodno motive she does not know that miss nugent is the person to whom i am attached she spoke at random and i have heard it first from a strangernot from my mother why was it kept secret from me now i understand the reason why my mother evidently never wished that i should think of miss nugentwhy she always spoke so vehemently against the marriages of relations of cousins why not tell me the truth it would have had the strongest effect had she known my mind lord colambre had the greatest dread of marrying any woman whose mother had conducted herself ill his reason his prejudices his pride his delicacy and even his limited experience were all against it all his hopes his plans of future happiness were shaken to their very foundation he felt as if he had received a blow that stunned his mind and from which he could not recover his faculties the whole of that day he was like one in a dream at night the painful idea continually recurred to him and whenever he was falling asleep the sound of lady dashforts voice returned upon his ear saying the words what could he expect when he married one of the st omars none of the women sans reproche in the morning he rose early and the first thing he did was to write a letter to his mother requesting unless there was some important reason for her declining to answer the question that she would immediately relieve his mind from a great uneasiness he altered the word four times but at last left it uneasiness he stated what he had heard and besought his mother to tell him the whole truth without reserve chapter viii one morning lady dashfort had formed an ingenious scheme for leaving lady isabel and lord colambre teteatete but the sudden entrance of heathcock disconcerted her intentions he came to beg lady dashforts interest with count ohalloran for permission to hunt and shoot on his groundsnot for myself pon honour but for two officers who are quartered at the next town here who will indubitably hang or drown themselves if they are debarred from sporting who is this count ohalloran said lord colambre miss white lady killpatricks companion said he was a great oddity lady dashfort that he was singular and the clergyman of the parish who was at breakfast declared that he was a man of uncommon knowledge merit and politeness all i know of him said heathcock is that he is a great sportsman with a long queue a goldlaced hat and long skirts to a laced waistcoat lord colambre expressed a wish to see this extraordinary personage and lady dashfort to cover her former design and perhaps thinking absence might be as effectual as too much propinquity immediately offered to call upon the officers in their way and carry them with heathcock and lord colambre to halloran castle lady isabel retired with much mortification but with becoming grace and captain benson and captain williamson were taken to the counts captain benson who was a famous whip took his seat on the box of the barouche and the rest of the party had the pleasure of her ladyships conversation for three or four miles of her ladyships conversationfor lord colambres thoughts were far distant captain williamson had not anything to say and heathcock nothing but eh relly nowpon honour they arrived at halloran castlea fine old building part of it in ruins and part repaired with great judgment and taste when the carriage stopped a respectablelooking manservant appeared on the steps at the open halldoor count ohalloran was out ahunting but his servant said that he would be at home immediately if lady dashfort and the gentlemen would be pleased to walk in on one side of the lofty and spacious hall stood the skeleton of an elk on the other side the perfect skeleton of a moosedeer which as the servant said his master had made out with great care from the different bones of many of this curious species of deer found in the lakes in the neighbourhood the brace of officers witnessed their wonder with sundry strange oaths and exclamationseh pon honourrelly now said heathcock and too genteel to wonder at or admire anything in the creation dragged out his watch with some difficulty saying i wonder now whether they are likely to think of giving us anything to eat in this place and turning his back upon the moosedeer he straight walked out again upon the steps called to his groom and began to make some inquiry about his led horse lord colambre surveyed the prodigious skeletons with rational curiosity and with that sense of awe and admiration by which a superior mind is always struck on beholding any of the great works of providence come my dear lord said lady dashfort with our sublime sensations we are keeping my old friend mr alick brady this venerable person waiting to show us into the receptionroom the servant bowed respectfullymore respectfully than servants of modern date my lady the receptionroom has been lately paintedthe smell of paint may be disagreeable with your leave i will take the liberty of showing you into my masters study he opened the door went in before her and stood holding up his finger as if making a signal of silence to some one within her ladyship entered and found herself in the midst of an odd assembly an eagle a goat a dog an otter several gold and silver fish in a glass globe and a white mouse in a cage the eagle quick of eye but quiet of demeanour was perched upon his stand the otter lay under the table perfectly harmless the angora goat a beautiful and remarkably little creature of its kind with long curling silky hair was walking about the room with the air of a beauty and a favourite the dog a tall irish greyhoundone of the few of that fine race which is now almost extincthad been given to count ohalloran by an irish nobleman a relation of lady dashforts this dog who had formerly known her ladyship looked at her with ears erect recognised her and went to meet her the moment she entered the servant answered for the peaceable behaviour of all the rest of the company of animals and retired lady dashfort began to feed the eagle from a silver plate on his stand lord colambre examined the inscription on his collar the other men stood in amaze heathcock who came in last astonished out of his constant eh relly now the moment he put himself in at the door exclaimed zounds whats all this live lumber and he stumbled over the goat who was at that moment crossing the way the colonels spur caught in the goats curly beard the colonel shook his foot and entangled the spur worse and worse the goat struggled and butted the colonel skated forward on the polished oak floor balancing himself with outstretched arms the indignant eagle screamed and passing by perched on heathcocks shoulders too wellbred to have recourse to the terrors of his beak he scrupled not to scream and flap his wings about the colonels ears lady dashfort the while threw herself back in her chair laughing and begging heathcocks pardon oh take care of the dog my dear colonel cried she for this kind of dog seizes his enemy by the back and shakes him to death the officers holding their sides laughed and beggedno pardon while lord colambre the only person who was not absolutely incapacitated tried to disentangle the spur and to liberate the colonel from the goat and the goat from the colonel an attempt in which he at last succeeded at the expense of a considerable portion of the goats beard the eagle however still kept his place and yet mindful of the wrongs of his insulted friend the goat had stretched his wings to give another buffet count ohalloran entered and the bird quitting his prey flew down to greet his master the count was a fine old militarylooking gentleman fresh from the chace his hunting accoutrements hanging carelessly about him he advanced unembarrassed to the lady and received his other guests with a mixture of military ease and gentlemanlike dignity without adverting to the awkward and ridiculous situation in which he had found poor heathcock he apologised in general for his troublesome favourites for one of them said he patting the head of the dog which lay quiet at lady dashforts feet i see i have no need to apologise he is where he ought to be poor fellow he has never lost his taste for the good company to which he was early accustomed as to the rest said he turning to lady dashfort a mouse a bird and a fish are you know tribute from earth air and water for my conqueror but from no barbarous scythian said lord colambre smiling the count looked at lord colambre as at a person worthy his attention but his first care was to keep the peace between his loving subjects and his foreign visitors it was difficult to dislodge the old settlers to make room for the newcomers but he adjusted these things with admirable facility and with a masters hand and masters eye compelled each favourite to retreat into the back settlements with becoming attention he stroked and kept quiet old victory his eagle who eyed colonel heathcock still as if he did not like him and whom the colonel eyed as if he wished his neck fairly wrung off the little goat had nestled himself close up to his liberator lord colambre and lay perfectly quiet with his eyes closed going very wisely to sleep and submitting philosophically to the loss of one half of his beard conversation now commenced and was carried on by count ohalloran with much ability and spirit and with such quickness of discrimination and delicacy of taste as quite surprised and delighted our hero to the lady the counts attention was first directed he listened to her as she spoke bending with an air of deference and devotion she made her request for permission for major benson and captain williamson to hunt and shoot in his grounds this was instantly granted her ladyships requests were to him commands the count said his gamekeeper should be instructed to give the gentlemen her friends every liberty and all possible assistance then turning to the officers he said he had just heard that several regiments of english militia had lately landed in ireland that one regiment was arrived at killpatrickstown he rejoiced in the advantages ireland and he hoped he might be permitted to add england would probably derive from the exchange of the militia of both countries habits would be improved ideas enlarged the two countries have the same interest and from the inhabitants discovering more of each others good qualities and interchanging little good offices in common life their esteem and affection for each other would increase and rest upon the firm basis of mutual utility to all this major benson and captain williamson made no reply the major looks so like a stuffed man of straw whispered lady dashfort to lord colambre and the captain so like the knave of clubs putting forth one manly leg count ohalloran now turned the conversation to field sports and then the captain and major opened at once pray now sir said the major you foxhunt in this country i suppose and now do you manage the thing here as we do over night you know before the hunt when the fox is out stopping up the earths of the cover we mean to draw and all the rest for four miles round next morning we assemble at the covers side and the huntsman throws in the hounds the gossip here is no small part of the entertainment but as soon as we hear the hounds give tongue the favourite hounds interposed williamson the favourite hounds to be sure continued benson there is a dead silence till pug is well out of cover and the whole pack well in then cheer the hounds with tallyho till your lungs crack away he goes in gallant style and the whole field is hard up till pug takes a stiff country then they who havent pluck lag see no more of him and with a fine blazing scent there are but few of us in at the death well we are fairly in at the death i hope said lady dashfort i was thrown out sadly at one time in the chace lord colambre with the counts permission took up a book in which the counts pencil lay pasley on the military policy of great britain it was marked with many notes of admiration and with hands pointing to remarkable passages that is a book that leaves a strong impression on the mind said the count lord colambre read one of the marked passages beginning with all that distinguishes a soldier in outward appearance from a citizen is so trifling but at this instant our heros attention was distracted by seeing in a blackletter book this title of a chapter burialplace of the nugents pray now sir said captain williamson if i dont interrupt you as you are such a famous foxhunter maybe you may be a fisherman too and now in ireland do you mr a smart pinch on his elbow from his major who stood behind him stopped the captain short as he pronounced the word mr like all awkward people he turned directly to ask by his looks what was the matter the major took advantage of his discomfiture and stepping before him determined to have the fishing to himself and went on with count ohalloran i presume you understand fishing too as well as hunting the count bowed i do not presume to say that sir but pray count in this country do you arm your hook this ways give me leave taking the whip from williamsons reluctant hand this ways laying the outermost part of your feather this fashion next to your hook and the point next to your shank this wise and that wise and then sircount you take the hackle of a cocks neck a plovers toppings better said williamson and work your gold and silver thread pursued benson up to your wings and when your heads made you fasten all but you never showed how your heads made interrupted williamson the gentleman knows how a heads made any man can make a head i suppose so sir you fasten all youll never get your head fast on that way while the world stands cried williamson fast enough for all purposes ill bet you a rump and dozen captain and then sircount you divide your wings with a needle a pins point will do said williamson the count to reconcile matters produced from an indian cabinet which he had opened for the ladys inspection a little basket containing a variety of artificial flies of curious construction which as he spread them on the table made williamson and bensons eyes almost sparkle with delight there was the dunfly for the month of march and the stonefly much in vogue for april and the ruddyfly of red wool black silk and red capons feathers lord colambre whose head was in the burialplace of the nugents wished them all at the bottom of the sea and the greenfly and the moorishfly cried benson snatching them up with transport and chief the sadyellowfly in which the fish delight in june the sadyellowfly made with the buzzards wings bound with black braked hemp and the shellfly for the middle of july made of greenish wool wrapped about with the herle of a peacocks tail famous for creating excellent sport all these and more were spread upon the table before the sportsmens wondering eyes capital flies capital faith cried williamson treasures faith real treasures by g cried benson eh pon honour relly now were the first words which heathcock had uttered since his battle with the goat my dear heathcock are you alive still said lady dashfort i had really forgotten your existence so had count ohalloran but he did not say so your ladyship has the advantage of me there said heathcock stretching himself i wish i could forget my existence for in my mind existence is a horrible bore i thought you was a sportsman said williamson well sir and a fisherman well sir why look you there sir pointing to the flies and tell a body lifes a bore one cant always fish or shoot i apprehend sir said heathcock not alwaysbut sometimes said williamson laughing for i suspect shrewdly youve forgot some of your sporting in bond street eh pon honour relly now said the colonel retreating again to his safe entrenchment of affectation from which he never could venture without imminent danger pon honour cried lady dashfort i can swear for heathcock that i have eaten excellent hares and ducks of his shooting which to my knowledge added she in a loud whisper he bought in the market emptum aprum said lord colambre to the count without danger of being understood by those whom it concerned the count smiled a second time but politely turning the attention of the company from the unfortunate colonel by addressing himself to the laughing sportsmen gentlemen you seem to value these said he sweeping the artificial flies from the table into the little basket from which they had been taken would you do me the honour to accept of them they are all of my own making and consequently of irish manufacture then ringing the bell he asked lady dashforts permission to have the basket put into her carriage benson and williamson followed the servant to prevent them from being tossed into the boot heathcock stood still in the middle of the room taking snuff count ohalloran turned from him to lord colambre who had just got happily to the burialplace of the nugents when lady dashfort coming between them and spying the title of the chapter exclaimed what have you thereantiquities my delightbut i never look at engravings when i can see realities lord colambre was then compelled to follow as she led the way into the hall where the count took down golden ornaments and brassheaded spears and jointed horns of curious workmanship that had been found on his estate and he told of spermaceti wrapped in carpets and he showed small urns enclosing ashes and from among these urns he selected one which he put into the hands of lord colambre telling him that it had been lately found in an old abbeyground in his neighbourhood which had been the burialplace of some of the nugent family i was just looking at the account of it in the book which you saw open on my tableand as you seem to take an interest in that family my lord perhaps said the count you may think this urn worth your acceptance lord colambre said it would be highly valuable to himas the nugents were his near relations lady dashfort little expected this blow she however carried him off to the moosedeer and from moosedeer to roundtowers to various architectural antiquities and to the real and fabulous history of ireland on all which the count spoke with learning and enthusiasm but now to colonel heathcocks great joy and relief a handsome collation appeared in the diningroom of which ulick opened the foldingdoors count you have made an excellent house of your castle said lady dashfort it will be when it is finished said the count i am afraid added he smiling i live like many other irish gentlemen who never are but always to be blest with a good house i began on too large a scale and can never hope to live to finish it pon honour heres a good thing which i hope we shall live to finish said heathcock sitting down before the collation and heartily did he eat of grouse pie and of irish ortolans which as lady dashfort observed afforded him indemnity for the past and security for the future eh relly now your irish ortolans are famous good eating said heathcock worth being quartered in ireland faith to taste em said benson the count recommended to lady dashfort some of that delicate sweetmeat the irish plum bless me sircount cried williamson its by far the best thing of the kind i ever tasted in all my life where could you get this in dublin at my dear mrs godeys where only in his majestys dominions it is to be had said the count the whole dish vanished in a few seconds pon honour i do believe this is the thing the queens so fond of said heathcock then heartily did he drink of the counts excellent hungarian wines and by the common bond of sympathy between those who have no other tastes but eating and drinking the colonel the major and the captain were now all the best companions possible for one another whilst they prolonged the rich repast lady dashfort and lord colambre went to the window to admire the prospect lady dashfort asked the count the name of some distant hill ah said the count that hill was once covered with fine wood but it was all cut down two years ago who could have been so cruel said her ladyship i forget the present proprietors name said the count but he is one of those who according to the clause of distress in their leases lead drive and carry away but never enter their lands one of those enemies to irelandthese cruel absentees lady dashfort looked through her glass at the mountain lord colambre sighed and endeavouring to pass it off with a smile said frankly to the count you are not aware i am sure count that you are speaking to the son of an irish absentee familynay do not be shocked my dear sir i tell you only because i thought it fair to do so but let me assure you that nothing you could say on that subject could hurt me personally because i feel that i am not that i never can be an enemy to ireland an absentee voluntarily i never yet have been and as to the future i declare i declare you know nothing of the future interrupted lady dashfort in a halfperemptory halfplayful toneyou know nothing make no rash vows and you will break none the undaunted assurance of lady dashforts genius for intrigue gave her an air of frank imprudence which prevented lord colambre from suspecting that more was meant than met the ear the count and he took leave of one another with mutual regard and lady dashfort rejoiced to have got our hero out of halloran castle chapter ix lord colambre had waited with great impatience for an answer to the letter of inquiry which he had written about miss nugents mother a letter from lady clonbrony arrived he opened it with the greatest eagernesspassed over rheumatism warm weatherwarm bathbuxton ballsmiss broadhurstyour friend sir arthur berryl very assiduous the name of grace nugent he found at last and read as follows her mothers maiden name was st omar and there was a faux pas certainly she was i am told for it was before my time educated at a convent abroad and there was an affair with a captain reynolds a young officer which her friends were obliged to hush up she brought an infant to england with her and took the name of reynoldsbut none of that family would acknowledge her and she lived in great obscurity till your uncle nugent saw fell in love with her and knowing her whole history married her he adopted the child gave her his name and after some years the whole story was forgotten nothing could be more disadvantageous to grace than to have it revived this is the reason we kept it secret lord colambre tore the letter to bits from the perturbation which lady dashfort saw in his countenance she guessed the nature of the letter which he had been reading and for the arrival of which he had been so impatient it has worked said she to herself pour le coup philippe je te tiens lord colambre appeared this day more sensible than he had ever yet seemed to the charms of the fair isabel many a tennisball and many a heart is caught at the rebound said lady dashfort isabel now is your time and so it wasor so perhaps it would have been but for a circumstance which her ladyship with all her genius for intrigue had never taken into her consideration count ohalloran came to return the visit which had been paid to him and in the course of conversation he spoke of the officers who had been introduced to him and told lady dashfort that he had heard a report which shocked him muchhe hoped it could not be truethat one of these officers had introduced his mistress as his wife to lady oranmore who lived in the neighbourhood this officer it was said had let lady oranmore send her carriage for this woman and that she had dined at oranmore with her ladyship and her daughters fact but i cannot believe it i cannot believe it to be possible that any gentleman that any officer could do such a thing said the count and is this all exclaimed lady dashfort is this all the terrible affair my good count which has brought your face to this prodigious length the count looked at lady dashfort with astonishment such a look of virtuous indignation continued she did i never behold on or off the stage forgive me for laughing count but believe me comedy goes through the world better than tragedy and take it all in all does rather less mischief as to the thing in question i know nothing about it i dare say it is not true but now suppose it wasit is only a silly quiz of a raw young officer upon a prudish old dowager i know nothing about it for my part but after all what irreparable mischief has been done laugh at the thing and then it is a jesta bad one perhaps but still only a jestand theres an end of it but take it seriously and there is no knowing where it might endin half a dozen duels maybe of that madam said the count lady oranmores prudence and presence of mind have prevented all danger her ladyship would not understand the insult she said or she acted as if she said je ne veux rien voir rien ecouter rien savoir lady oranmore is one of the most respectable count i beg your pardon interrupted lady dashfort but i must tell you that your favourite lady oranmore has behaved very ill to me purposely omitted to invite isabel to her ball offended and insulted meher praises therefore cannot be the most agreeable subject of conversation you can choose for my amusement and as to the rest you who have such variety and so much politeness will i am sure have the goodness to indulge my caprice in this instance i shall obey your ladyship and be silent whatever pleasure it might give me to speak on that subject said the count and i trust lady dashfort will reward me by the assurance that however playfully she may have just now spoken she seriously disapproves and is shocked oh shocked shocked to death if that will satisfy you my dear count the count obviously was not satisfied he had civil as well as military courage and his sense of right and wrong could stand against the raillery and ridicule of a fine lady the conversation ended lady dashfort thought it would have no further consequences and she did not regret the loss of a man like count ohalloran who lived retired in his castle and who could not have any influence upon the opinion of the fashionable world however upon turning from the count to lord colambre who she thought had been occupied with lady isabel and to whom she imagined all this dispute was uninteresting she perceived by his countenance that she had made a great mistake still she trusted that her power over lord colambre was sufficient easily to efface whatever unfavourable impression this conversation had made upon his mind he had no personal interest in the affair and she had generally found that people are easily satisfied about any wrong or insult public or private in which they have no immediate concern but all the charms of her conversation were now tried in vain to reclaim him from the reverie into which he had fallen his friend sir james brookes parting advice occurred to our hero his eyes began to open to lady dashforts character and he was from this moment freed from her power lady isabel however had taken no part in all thisshe was blameless and independently of her mother and in pretended opposition of sentiment she might have continued to retain the influence she had gained over lord colambre but that a slight accident revealed to him her real disposition it happened on the evening of this day that lady isabel came into the library with one of the young ladies of the house talking very eagerly without perceiving lord colambre who was sitting in one of the recesses reading my dear creature you are quite mistaken said lady isabel he was never a favourite of mine i always detested him i only flirted with him to plague his wife oh that wife my dear elizabeth i do hate cried she clasping her hands and expressing hatred with all her soul and with all her strength i detest that lady de cresey to such a degree that to purchase the pleasure of making her feel the pangs of jealousy for one hour look i would this moment lay down this finger and let it be cut off the face the whole figure of lady isabel at this moment appeared to lord colambre suddenly metamorphosed instead of the soft gentle amiable female all sweet charity and tender sympathy formed to love and to be loved he beheld one possessed and convulsed by an evil spirither beauty if beauty it could be called the beauty of a fiend some ejaculation which he unconsciously uttered made lady isabel start she saw himsaw the expression of his countenance and knew that all was over lord colambre to the utter astonishment and disappointment of lady dashfort and to the still greater mortification of lady isabel announced this night that it was necessary he should immediately pursue his tour in ireland we pass over all the castles in the air which the young ladies of the family had built and which now fell to the ground we pass all the civil speeches of lord and lady killpatrick all the vehement remonstrances of lady dashfort and the vain sighs of lady isabel to the last moment lady dashfort said he will not go but he went and when he was gone lady dashfort exclaimed that man has escaped from me and after a pause turning to her daughter she in the most taunting and contemptuous terms reproached her as the cause of this failure concluding by a declaration that she must in future manage her own affairs and had best settle her mind to marry heathcock since every one else was too wise to think of her lady isabel of course retorted but we leave this amiable mother and daughter to recriminate in appropriate terms and we follow our hero rejoiced that he has been disentangled from their snares those who have never been in similar peril will wonder much that he did not escape sooner those who have ever been in like danger will wonder more that he escaped at all those who are best acquainted with the heart or imagination of man will be most ready to acknowledge that the combined charms of wit beauty and flattery may for a time suspend the action of right reason in the mind of the greatest philosopher or operate against the resolutions of the greatest of heroes lord colambre pursued his way to castle halloran desirous before he quitted this part of the country to take leave of the count who had shown him much civility and for whose honourable conduct and generous character he had conceived a high esteem which no little peculiarities of antiquated dress or manner could diminish indeed the oldfashioned politeness of what was formerly called a wellbred gentleman pleased him better than the indolent or insolent selfishness of modern men of the ton perhaps notwithstanding our heros determination to turn his mind from everything connected with the idea of miss nugent some latent curiosity about the burialplace of the nugents might have operated to make him call upon the count in this hope he was disappointed for a cross miller to whom the abbeyground was set on which the burialplace was found had taken it into his head to refuse admittance and none could enter his ground count ohalloran was much pleased by lord colambres visit the very day of lord colambres arrival at halloran castle the count was going to oranmore he was dressed and his carriage was waiting therefore lord colambre begged that he might not detain him and the count requested his lordship to accompany him let me have the honour of introducing you my lord to a family with whom i am persuaded you will be pleased by whom you will be appreciated and at whose house you will have an opportunity of seeing the best manner of living of the irish nobility lord colambre accepted the invitation and was introduced at oranmore the dignified appearance and respectable character of lady oranmore the charming unaffected manners of her daughters the air of domestic happiness and comfort in her family the becoming magnificence free from ostentation in her whole establishment the respect and affection with which she was treated by all who approached her delighted and touched lord colambre the more perhaps because he had heard this family so unjustly abused and because he saw lady oranmore and her daughter in immediate contrast to lady dashfort and lady isabel a little circumstance which occurred during this visit increased his interest for the family when lady de creseys little boys came in after dinner one of them was playing with a seal which had just been torn from a letter the child showed it to lord colambre and asked him to read the motto the motto was deeds not wordshis friend sir james brookes motto and his arms lord colambre eagerly inquired if this family was acquainted with sir james and he soon perceived that they were not only acquainted with him but that they were particularly interested about him lady oranmores second daughter lady harriet appeared particularly pleased by the manner in which lord colambre spoke of sir james and the child who had now established himself on his lordships knee turned round and whispered in his ear twas aunt harriet gave me the seal sir james is to be married to aunt harriet and then he will be my uncle some of the principal gentry of this part of the country happened to dine at oranmore one of the days lord colambre was there he was surprised at the discovery that there were so many agreeable wellinformed and wellbred people of whom while he was at killpatrickstown he had seen nothing he now discerned how far he had been deceived by lady dashfort both the count and lord and lady oranmore who were warmly attached to their country exhorted him to make himself amends for the time he had lost by seeing with his own eyes and judging with his own understanding of the country and its own inhabitants during the remainder of the time he was to stay in ireland the higher classes in most countries they observed were generally similar but in the lower class he would find many characteristic differences when he first came to ireland he had been very eager to go and see his fathers estate and to judge of the conduct of his agents and the condition of his tenantry but this eagerness had subsided and the design had almost faded from his mind whilst under the influence of lady dashforts misrepresentations a mistake relative to some remittance from his banker in dublin obliged him to delay his journey a few days and during that time lord and lady oranmore showed him the neat cottages the wellattended schools in their neighbourhood they showed him not only what could be done but what had been done by the influence of great proprietors residing on their own estates and encouraging the people by judicious kindness he saw he acknowledged the truth of this but it did not come home to his feelings now as it would have done a little while ago his views and plans were altered he looked forward to the idea of marrying and settling in ireland and then everything in the country was interesting to him but since he had forbidden himself to think of a union with miss nugent his mind had lost its object and its spring he was not sufficiently calm to think of the public good his thoughts were absorbed by his private concern he knew and repeated to himself that he ought to visit his own and his fathers estates and to see the condition of his tenantry he desired to fulfil his duties but they ceased to appear to him easy and pleasurable for hope and love no longer brightened his prospects that he might see and hear more than he could as heirapparent to the estate he sent his servant to dublin to wait for him there he travelled incognito wrapped himself in a shabby greatcoat and took the name of evans he arrived at a village or as it was called a town which bore the name of colambre he was agreeably surprised by the air of neatness and finish in the houses and in the street which had a nicelyswept paved footway he slept at a small but excellent innexcellent perhaps because it was small and proportioned to the situation and business of the place good supper good bed good attendance nothing out of repair no things pressed into services for what they were never intended by nature or art none of what are vulgarly called makeshifts no chambermaid slipshod or waiter smelling of whisky but all tight and right and everybody doing their own business and doing it as if it was their everyday occupation not as if it was done by particular desire for first or last time this season the landlord came in at supper to inquire whether anything was wanted lord colambre took this opportunity of entering into conversation with him and asked him to whom the town belonged and who were the proprietors of the neighbouring estates the town belongs to an absentee lordone lord clonbrony who lives always beyond the seas in london and never seen the town since it was a town to call a town and does the land in the neighbourhood belong to this lord clonbrony it does sir hes a great proprietor but knows nothing of his property nor of us never set foot among us to my knowledge since i was as high as the table he might as well be a west india planter and we negroes for anything he knows to the contraryhas no more care nor thought about us than if he were in jamaica or the other world shame for himbut theres too many to keep him in countenance lord colambre asked him what wine he could have and then inquired who managed the estate for this absentee mr burke sir and i dont know why god was so kind to give so good an agent to an absentee like lord clonbrony except it was for the sake of us who is under him and knows the blessing and is thankful for the same very good cutlets said lord colambre i am happy to hear it sir they have a right to be good for mrs burke sent her own cook to teach my wife to dress cutlets so the agent is a good agent is he he is thanks be to heaven and thats what few can boast especially when the landlords living over the seas we have the luck to have got a good agent over us in mr burke who is a right bred gentleman a snug little property of his own honestly made with the good will and good wishes and respect of all does he live in the neighbourhood just convanient convenient near at the end of the town in the house on the hill as you passed sir to the left with the trees about it all of his planting finely grown toofor theres a blessing on all he does and he has done a dealtheres salad sir if you are partial to it very fine lettuce mrs burke sent us the plants herself excellent salad so this mr burke has done a great deal has he in what way in every way sirsure was not it he that had improved and fostered and made the town of colambreno thanks to the proprietor nor to the young man whose name it bears neither have you any porter pray sir we have sir as good i hope as youd drink in london for its the same you get there i understand from cork and i have some of my own brewing which they say you could not tell the difference between it and cork qualityif youd be pleased to try harry the corkscrew the porter of his own brewing was pronounced to be extremely good and the landlord observed it was mr burke encouraged him to learn to brew and lent him his own brewer for a time to teach him your mr burke i find is apropos to porter apropos to salad apropos to cutlets apropos to everything said lord colambre smiling he seems to be a nonpareil of an agent i suppose you are a great favourite of his and you do what you please with him oh no sir i could not say that mr burke does not have favourites anyway but according to my deserts i trust i stand well enough with him for in truth he is a right good agent lord colambre still pressed for particulars he was an englishman and a stranger he said and did not exactly know what was meant in ireland by a good agent why he is the man that will encourage the improving tenant and show no favour or affection but justice which comes even to all and does best for all at the long run and residing always in the country like mr burke and understanding country business and going about continually among the tenantry he knows when to press for the rent and when to leave the money to lay out upon the land and according as they would want it can give a tenant a help or a check properly then no dutywork called for no presents nor glovemoney nor sealingmoney even taken or offered no underhand hints about proposals when land would be out of lease but a considerable preference if desarved to the old tenant and if not a fair advertisement and the best offer and tenant accepted no screwing of the land to the highest penny just to please the head landlord for the minute and ruin him at the end by the tenants racking the land and running off with the years rent nor no bargains to his own relations or friends did mr burke ever give or grant but all fair between landlord and tenant and thats the thing that will last and thats what i call the good agent lord colambre poured out a glass of wine and begged the innkeeper to drink the good agents health in which he was heartily pledged i thank your honourmr burkes health and long may he live over and amongst us he saved me from drink and ruin when i was once inclined to it and made a man of me and all my family the particulars we cannot stay to detail this grateful man however took pleasure in sounding the praises of his benefactor and in raising him in the opinion of the traveller as youve time and are curious about such things sir perhaps youd walk up to the school that mrs burke has for the poor children and look at the markethouse and see how clean he takes a pride to keep the town and any house in the town from the priest to the parsons that youd go into will give you the same character as i do of mr burke from the brogue to the boot all speak the same of him and can say no other god for ever bless and keep him over us upon making further inquiries everything the innkeeper had said was confirmed by different inhabitants of the village lord colambre conversed with the shopkeepers with the cottagers and without making any alarming inquiries he obtained all the information he wanted he went to the village schoola pretty cheerful house with a neat garden and a playgreen met mrs burke introduced himself to her as a traveller the school was shown to him it was just what it ought to beneither too much nor too little had been attempted there was neither too much interference nor too little attention nothing for exhibition care to teach well without any vain attempt to teach in a wonderfully short time all that experience proves to be useful in both dr bells and mr lancasters modes of teaching mrs burke had adopted leaving it to graceless zealots to fight about the rest that no attempts at proselytism had been made and that no illiberal distinctions had been made in this school lord colambre was convinced in the best manner possible by seeing the children of protestants and catholics sitting on the same benches learning from the same books and speaking to one another with the same cordial familiarity mrs burke was an unaffected sensible woman free from all party prejudices and without ostentation desirous and capable of doing good lord colambre was much pleased with her and very glad that she invited him to dinner mr burke did not come in till late for he had been detained portioning out some meadows which were of great consequence to the inhabitants of the town he brought home to dine with him the clergyman and the priest of the parish both of whom he had taken successful pains to accommodate with the land which suited their respective convenience the good terms on which they seemed to be with each other and with him appeared to lord colambre to do honour to mr burke all the favourable accounts his lordship had received of this gentleman were confirmed by what he saw and heard after the clergyman and priest had taken leave upon lord colambres expressing some surprise mixed with satisfaction at seeing the harmony which subsisted between them mr burke assured him that this was the same in many parts of ireland he observed that as the suspicion of illwill never fails to produce it so he had often found that taking it for granted that no illwill exists has the most conciliating effect he said to please opposite parties he used no arts but he tried to make all his neighbours live comfortably together by making them acquainted with each others good qualities by giving them opportunities of meeting sociably and from time to time of doing each other little services and good offices fortunately he had so much to do he said that he had no time for controversy he was a plain man made it a rule not to meddle with speculative points and to avoid all irritating discussions he was not to rule the country but to live in it and make others live as happily as he could having nothing to conceal in his character opinions or circumstances mr burke was perfectly open and unreserved in his manner and conversation freely answered all the travellers inquiries and took pains to show him everything he desired to see lord colambre said he had thoughts of settling in ireland and declared with truth that he had not seen any part of the country he should like better to live in than this neighbourhood he went over most of the estate with mr burke and had ample opportunities of convincing himself that this gentleman was indeed as the innkeeper had described him a right good gentleman and a right good agent he paid mr burke some just compliments on the state of the tenantry and the neat and flourishing appearance of the town of colambre what pleasure it will give the proprietor when he sees all you have done said lord colambre oh sir dont speak of itthat breaks my heart he never has shown the least interest in anything i have done he is quite dissatisfied with me because i have not ruined his tenantry by forcing them to pay more than the land is worth because i have not squeezed money from them by fining down rents andbut all this as an englishman sir must be unintelligible to you the end of the matter is that attached as i am to this place and the people about me and as i hope the tenantry are to mei fear i shall be obliged to give up the agency give up the agency how soyou must not cried lord colambre and for the moment he forgot himself but mr burke took this only for an expression of goodwill i must i am afraid continued he my employer lord clonbrony is displeased with mecontinual calls for money come upon me from england and complaints of my slow remittances perhaps lord clonbrony is in embarrassed circumstances said lord colambre i never speak of my employers affairs sir replied mr burke now for the first time assuming an air of reserve i beg pardon siri seem to have asked an indiscreet question mrs burke was silent lest my reserve should give you a false impression i will add sir resumed mr burke that i really am not acquainted with the state of his lordships affairs in general i know only what belongs to the estate under my own management the principal part of his lordships property the clonbrony estate is under another agent mr garraghty garraghty repeated lord colambre what sort of a person is he but i may take it for granted that it cannot fall to the lot of one and the same absentee to have two such agents as mr burke mr burke bowed and seemed pleased by the compliment which he knew he deservedbut not a word did he say of mr garraghty and lord colambre afraid of betraying himself by some other indiscreet question changed the conversation that very night the post brought a letter to mr burke from lord clonbrony which mr burke gave to his wife as soon as he had read it saying see the reward of all my services mrs burke glanced her eye over the letter and being extremely fond of her husband and sensible of his deserving far different treatment burst into indignant exclamations see the reward of all your services indeedwhat an unreasonable ungrateful manso this is the thanks for all you have done for lord clonbrony he does not know what i have done my dear he never has seen what i have done more shame for him he never i suppose looks over his accounts or understands them more shame for him he listens to foolish reports or misrepresentations perhaps he is at a distance and cannot find out the truth more shame for him take it quietly my dear we have the comfort of a good conscience the agency may be taken from me by this lord but the sense of having done my duty no lord or man upon earth can give or take away such a letter said mrs burke taking it up again not even the civility to write with his own handonly his signature to the scrawllooks as if it was written by a drunken man does not it mr evans said she showing the letter to lord colambre who immediately recognised the writing of sir terence ofay it does not look like the hand of a gentleman indeed said lord colambre it has lord clonbronys own signature let it be what it will said mr burke looking closely at it lord clonbronys own writing the signature is i am clear of that lord clonbronys son was clear of it also but he took care not to give any opinion on that point oh pray read it sir read it said mrs burke pleased by his tone of indignation read it pray a gentleman may write a bad hand but no gentleman could write such a letter as that to mr burkepray read it sir you who have seen something of what mr burke has done for the town of colambre and what he has made of the tenantry and the estate of lord clonbrony lord colambre read and was convinced that his father had never written or read the letter but had signed it trusting to sir terence ofays having expressed his sentiments properly sir as i have no further occasion for your services you will take notice that i hereby request you will forthwith hand over on or before the st of november next your accounts with the balance due of the hanginggale which i understand is more than ought to be at this season to nicholas ogarraghty esq college green dublin who in future will act as agent and shall get by post immediately a power of attorney for the same entitling him to receive and manage the colambre as well as the clonbrony estate for sir your obedient humble servant clonbrony grosvenor square though misrepresentation caprice or interest might have induced lord clonbrony to desire to change his agent yet lord colambre knew that his father never could have announced his wishes in such a style and as he returned the letter to mrs burke he repeated he was convinced that it was impossible that any nobleman could have written such a letter that it must have been written by some inferior person and that his lordship had signed it without reading it my dear im sorry you showed that letter to mr evans said mr burke i dont like to expose lord clonbrony he is a wellmeaning gentleman misled by ignorant or designing people at all events it is not for us to expose him he has exposed himself said mrs burke and the world should know it he was very kind to me when i was a young man said mr burke we must not forget that now because we are angry my love why no my love to be sure we should not but who could have recollected it just at this minute but yourselfand now sir turning to lord colambre you see what kind of a man this is now is it not difficult for me to bear patiently to see him illtreated not only difficult but impossible i should think madam said lord colambre i know even i who am a stranger cannot help feeling for both of you as you must see i do and half the world who dont know him continued mrs burke when they hear that lord clonbronys agency is taken from him will think perhaps that he is to blame no madam said lord colambre that you need not fear mr burke may safely trust to his character from what i have within these two days seen and heard i am convinced that such is the respect he has deserved and acquired that no blame can touch him sir i thank you said mrs burke the tears coming into her eyes you can judgeyou do him justice but there are so many who dont know him and who will decide without knowing any of the facts that my dear happens about everything to everybody said mr burke but we must have patience time sets all judgments right sooner or later but the sooner the better said mrs burke mr evans i hope you will be so kind if ever you hear this business talked of mr evans lives in wales my dear but he is travelling through ireland my dear and he said he should return to dublin and you know there he certainly will hear it talked of and i hope he will do me the favour to state what he has seen and knows to be the truth be assured that i will do mr burke justiceas far as it is in my power said lord colambre restraining himself much that he might not say more than became his assumed character he took leave of this worthy family that night and early the next morning departed ah thought he as he drove away from this wellregulated and flourishing place how happy i might be settled here with such a wife asher of whom i must think no more he pursued his way to clonbrony his fathers other estate which was at a considerable distance from colambre he was resolved to know what kind of agent mr nicholas garraghty might be who was to supersede mr burke and by power of attorney to be immediately entitled to receive and manage the colambre as well as the clonbrony estate chapter x towards the evening of the second days journey the driver of lord colambres hackney chaise stopped and jumping off the wooden bar on which he had been seated exclaimed were come to the bad step now the bad roads beginning upon us please your honour bad road that is very uncommon in this country i never saw such fine roads as you have in ireland thats true and god bless your honour thats sensible of that same for its not what all the foreign quality i drive have the manners to notice god bless your honour i heard youre a welshman but whether or no i am sure you are a gentleman anyway welsh or other notwithstanding the shabby greatcoat the shrewd postillion perceived by our heros language that he was a gentleman after much dragging at the horses heads and pushing and lifting the carriage was got over what the postillion said was the worst part of the bad step but as the road was not yet to say good he continued walking beside the carriage its only bad just hereabouts and that by accident said he on account of there being no jantleman resident in it nor near but only a bit of an underagent a great little rogue who gets his own turn out of the roads and of everything else in life i larry brady that am telling your honour have a good right to know for myself and my father and my brother pat brady the wheelwright had once a farm under him but was ruined horse and foot all along with him and cast out and my brother forced to fly the country and is now working in some coachmakers yard in london banished he isand here am i forced to be what i amand now that im reduced to drive a hack the agents a curse to me still with these bad roads killing my horses and wheels and a shame to the country which i think more ofbad luck to him i know your brother he lives with mr mordicai in long acre in london oh god bless you for that they came at this time within view of a range of about fourandtwenty men and boys sitting astride on fourandtwenty heaps of broken stones on each side of the road they were all armed with hammers with which they began to pound with great diligence and noise as soon as they saw the carriage the chaise passed between these batteries the stones flying on all sides how are you jemhow are you phil said larry but hold your hand cant ye while i stop and get the stones out of the horses feet so youre making up the rent are you for st dennis whoosh said one of the pounders coming close to the postillion and pointing his thumb back towards the chaise who have you in it oh you need not scruple hes a very honest man hes only a man from north wales one mr evans an innocent jantleman thats sent over to travel up and down the country to find is there any copper mines in it how do you know larry because i know very well from one that was tould and i seen him tax the man of the kings head with a copper halfcrown at first sight which was only lead to look at youd think to them that was not skilful in copper so lend me a knife till i cut a linchpin out of the hedge for this one wont go far whilst larry was making the linchpin all scruple being removed his question about st dennis and the rent was answered ay its the rint sure enough were pounding out for him for he sent the driver round lastnightwaseight days to warn us old nick would be down amonday to take a sweep among us and theres only six clear days saturday night before the assizes sure so we must see and get it finished anyway to clear the presentment again the swearing day for he and paddy hart is the overseers themselves and paddy is to swear to it st dennis is it then youve one great comfort and securitythat he wont be particular about the swearing for since ever he had his head on his shoulders an oath never stuck in st denniss throat more than in his own brother old nicks his head upon his shoulders repeated lord colambre pray did you ever hear that st denniss head was off his shoulders it never was plase your honour to my knowledge did you never among your saints hear of st dennis carrying his head in his hand said colambre the rael saint said the postillion suddenly changing his tone and looking shocked oh dont be talking that way of the saints plase your honour then of what st dennis were you talking just nowwhom do you mean by st dennis and whom do you call old nick old nick answered the postillion coming close to the side of the carriage and whisperingold nick plase your honour is our nickname for one nicholas garraghty esq of college green dublin and st dennis is his brother dennis who is old nicks brother in all things and would fain be a saint only he is a sinner he lives just by here in the country underagent to lord clonbrony as old nick is upperagentits only a joke among the people that are not fond of them at all lord clonbrony himself is a very good jantleman if he was not an absentee resident in london leaving us and everything to the likes of them lord colambre listened with all possible composure and attention but the postillion having now made his linchpin of wood and fixed himself he mounted his bar and drove on saying to lord colambre as he looked at the roadmakers poor cratures they couldnt keep their cattle out of pound or themselves out of jail but by making this road is roadmaking then a very profitable businesshave roadmakers higher wages than other men in this part of the country it is and it is notthey have and they have notplase your honour i dont understand you no becaase youre an englishmanthat is a welshmani beg your honours pardon but ill tell you how that is and ill go slow over these broken stones for i cant go fast it is where theres no jantleman over these underagents as here they do as they plase and when they have set the land they get rasonable from the head landlords to poor cratures at a rackrent that they cant live and pay the rent they say who says them underagents that have no conscience at all not allbut some like dennis says says he ill get you a road to make up the rent that is plase your honour the agent gets them a presentment for so many perches of road from the grand jury at twice the price that would make the road and tenants are by this means as they take the road by contract at the price given by the county able to pay all they get by the job over and above potatoes and salt back again to the agent for the arrear on the land do i make your honour sensible do i make you understand you make me much more sensible than i ever was before said lord colambre but is not this cheating the county well and suppose replied larry is not it all for my good and yours too plase your honour said larry looking very shrewdly my good said lord colambre startled what have i to do with it havent you to do with the roads as well as me when youre travelling upon them plase your honour and sure theyd never be got made at all if they werent made this ways and its the best way in the wide world and the finest roads we have and when the rael jantlemens resident in the country theres no jobbing can be because theyre then the leading men on the grand jury and these journeymen jantlemen are then kept in order and alls right lord colambre was much surprised at larrys knowledge of the manner in which county business is managed as well as by his shrewd good sense he did not know that this is not uncommon in his rank of life in ireland whilst larry was speaking lord colambre was looking from side to side at the desolation of the prospect so this is lord clonbronys estate is it ay all you see and as far and farther than you can see my lord clonbrony wrote and ordered plantations here time back and enough was paid to labourers for ditching and planting and what nextwhy what did the underagent do but let the goats in through gaps left o purpose to bark the trees and then the trees was all banished and next the cattle was let in trespassing and winked at till the land was all poached and then the land was waste and cried down and st dennis wrote up to dublin to old nick and he over to the landlord how none would take it or bid anything at all for it so then it fell to him a cheap bargain oh the tricks of them who knows em if i dont presently lord colambres attention was roused again by seeing a man running as if for his life across a bog near the roadside he leaped over the ditch and was upon the road in an instant he seemed startled at first at the sight of the carriage but looking at the postillion larry nodded and he smiled and said alls safe pray my good friend may i ask what that is you have on your shoulder said lord colambre plase your honour it is only a private still which ive just caught out yonder in the bog and im carrying it in with all speed to the gauger to make a discovery that the jantleman may benefit by the reward i expect hell make me a compliment get up behind and ill give you a lift said the postillion thank you kindlybut better my legs said the man and turning down a lane off he ran again as fast as possible expect hell make me a compliment repeated lord colambre to make a discovery ay plase your honour for the law is said larry that if an unlawful still that is a still without license for whisky is found half the benefit of the fine thats put upon the parish goes to him that made the discovery thats what that man is after for hes an informer i should not have thought from what i see of you said lord colambre smiling that you larry would have offered an informer a lift oh plase your honour said larry smiling archly would not i give the laws a lift when in my power scarcely had he uttered these words and scarcely was the informer out of sight when across the same bog and over the ditch came another man a half kind of gentleman with a red silk handkerchief about his neck and a silverhandled whip in his hand did you see any man pass the road friend said he to the postillion oh who would i see or why would i tell replied larry in a sulky tone came come be smart said the man with the silver whip offering to put half a crown into the postillions hand point me which way he took ill have none a your silver dont touch me with it said larry but if youll take my advice youll strike across back and follow the fields out to killogenesawee the exciseman set out again immediately in an opposite direction to that which the man who carried the still had taken lord colambre now perceived that the pretended informer had been running off to conceal a still of his own the gauger plase your honour said larry looking back at lord colambre the gauger is a stillhunting and you put him on a wrong scent said lord colambre sure i told him no lie i only said if youll take my advice and why was he such a fool as to take my advice when i wouldnt take his fee so this is the way larry you give a lift to the laws if the laws would give a lift to me plase your honour maybe id do as much by them but its only these revenue laws i mean for i never to my knowledge broke another commandment but its what no honest poor man among his neighbours would scruple to takea glass of potsheen a glass of what in the name of heaven said lord colambre potsheen plase your honourbecaase its the little whisky thats made in the private still or pot and sheen becaase its a fond word for whatsoever wed like and for what we have little of and would make much of after taking the glass of it no man could go and inform to ruin the cratures for they all shelter on that estate under favour of them that go shares and make rent of embut id never inform again em and after all if the truth was known and my lord clonbrony should be informed against and presented for its his neglect is the bottom of the nuisance i find all the blame is thrown upon this poor lord clonbrony said lord colambre becaase he is absent said larry it would not be so was he prisint but your honour was talking to me about the laws your honours a stranger in this country and astray about them things sure why would i mind the laws about whisky more than the quality or the judge on the bench what do you mean why was not i prisint in the courthouse myself when the jidge on the bench judging a still and across the court came in one with a sly jug of potsheen for the jidge himself who prefarred it when the right thing to claret and when i seen that by the laws a man might talk himself dumb to me after again potsheen or in favour of the revenue or revenueofficers and there they may go on with their gaugers and their surveyors and their supervisors and their watchingofficers and their coursingofficers setting em one after another or one over the head of another or what way they willwe can baffle and laugh at em didnt i know next door to our inn last year ten watchingofficers set upon one distiller and he was too cunning for them and it will always be so while ever the people think it no sin no till then not all their dockets and permits signify a rush or a turf and the gauging rod even who fears it they may spare that rod for it will never mend the child how much longer larrys dissertation on the distillery laws would have continued had not his ideas been interrupted we cannot guess but he saw he was coming to a town and he gathered up the reins and plied the whip ambitious to make a figure in the eyes of its inhabitants this town consisted of one row of miserable huts sunk beneath the side of the road the mud walls crooked in every direction some of them opening in wide cracks or zigzag fissures from top to bottom as if there had just been an earthquakeall the roofs sunk in various placesthatch off or overgrown with grassno chimneys the smoke making its way through a hole in the roof or rising in clouds from the top of the open doordunghills before the doors and green standing puddlessqualid children with scarcely rags to cover them gazing at the carriage nugents town said the postillion once a snug place when my lady clonbrony was at home to whitewash it and the like as they drove by some men and women put their heads through the smoke out of the cabins pale women with long black or yellow locksmen with countenances and figures bereft of hope and energy wretched wretched people said lord colambre then its not their fault neither said larry for my own uncles one of them and as thriving and hard a working man as could be in all ireland he was afore he was tramped under foot and his heart broke i was at his funeral this time last year and for it may the agents own heart if he has any burn lord colambre interrupted this denunciation by touching larrys shoulder and asking some question which as larry did not distinctly comprehend he pulled up the reins and the various noises of the vehicle stopped suddenly i did not hear well plase your honour what are those people pointing to a man and woman curious figures who had come out of a cabin the door of which the woman who came out last locked and carefully hiding the key in the thatch turned her back upon the man and they walked away in different directions the woman bending under a huge bundle on her back covered by a yellow petticoat turned over her shoulders from the top of this bundle the head of an infant appeared a little boy almost naked followed her with a kettle and two girls one of whom could but just walk held her hand and clung to her ragged petticoat forming altogether a complete group of beggars the woman stopped and looked back after the man the man was a spanishlooking figure with gray hair a wallet hung at the end of a stick over one shoulder a reapinghook in the other hand he walked off stoutly without ever casting a look behind him a kind harvest to you john dolan cried the postillion and success to ye winny with the quality theres a luckpenny for the child to begin with added he throwing the child a penny your honour theyre only poor cratures going up the country to beg while the man goes over to reap the harvest in england nor this would not be neither if the lord was in it to give em employ that man now was a good and a willing slave in his day i mind him working with myself in the shrubberies at clonbrony castle when i was a boybut ill not be detaining your honour now the roads better the postillion drove on at a good rate for some time till he came to a piece of the road freshly covered with broken stones where he was obliged again to go slowly they overtook a string of cars on which were piled up high beds tables chairs trunks boxes bandboxes how are you finnucan youve fine loading therefrom dublin are you from bray and what news great news and bad for old nick or some belonging to him thanks be to heaven for myself hates him whats happened him his sisters husband thats failed the great grocer that was the man that had the wife that owd owned the fine house near bray that they got that time the parliament flitted and that i seen in her carriage flamingwell its all out theyre all done up tut is that all then theyll thrive and set up again grander than ever ill engage have not they old nick for an attorney at their back a good warrant oh trust him for that he wont go security nor pay a farthing for his shister nor wouldnt was she his father i heard him telling her so which i could not have done in his place at that time and she crying as if her heart would break and i standing by in the parlour the neger neger quasi negro meo periculo niggard and did he speak that way and you by ay did he and said mrs raffarty says he its all your own fault youre an extravagant fool and ever was and i wash my hands of you that was the word he spoke and she answered and said and maynt i send the beds and blankets said she and what i can by the cars out of the way of the creditors to clonbrony castle and wont you let me hide there from the shame till the bustles overyou may do that says he for what i care but remember says he that ive the first claim to them goods and thats all he would grant so they are coming down all o mondaythem are her bandboxes and all to settle it and faith it was a pity of her to hear her sobbing and to see her own brother speak and look so hard and she a lady sure shes not a lady born no more than himself said larry but thats no excuse for him his hearts as hard as that stone said larry and my own people knew that long ago and now his own know it and what right have we to complain since hes as bad to his own flesh and blood as to us with this consolation and with a god speed you given to the carman larry was driving off but the carman called to him and pointed to a house at the corner of which on a high pole was swinging an iron sign of three horseshoes set in a crooked frame and at the window hung an empty bottle proclaiming whisky within well i dont care if i do said larry for ive no other comfort left me in life now i beg your honours pardon sir for a minute added he throwing the reins into the carriage to lord colambre as he leaped down all remonstrance and power of lungs to reclaim him vain he darted into the whiskyhouse with the carmanreappeared before lord colambre could accomplish getting out remounted his seat and taking the reins i thank your honour said he and ill bring you into clonbrony before its pitchdark yet though its nightfall and thats four good miles but a spur in the head is worth two in the heel larry to demonstrate the truth of his favourite axiom drove off at such a furious rate over great stones left in the middle of the road by carmen who had been driving in the gudgeons of their axletrees to hinder them from lacing opening perhaps from lacher to loosen that lord colambre thought life and limb in imminent danger and feeling that at all events the jolting and bumping was past endurance he had recourse to larrys shoulder and shook and pulled and called to him to go slower but in vain at last the wheel struck full against a heap of stones at a turn of the road the wooden linchpin came off and the chaise was overset lord colambre was a little bruised but glad to escape without fractured bones i beg your honours pardon said larry completely sobered im as glad as the best pair of boots ever i see to see your honour nothing the worse for it it was the linchpin and them barrows of loose stones that ought to be fined anyway if there was any justice in the country the pole is broke how are we to get on said lord colambre murder murderand no smith nearer than clonbrony nor rope even its a folly to talk we cant get to clonbrony nor stir a step backward or forward the night what then do you mean to leave me all night in the middle of the road cried lord colambre quite exasperated is it me please your honour i would not use any jantleman so ill barring i could do no other replied the postillion coolly then leaping across the ditch or as he called it the gripe of the ditch he scrambled up and while he was scrambling said if your honour will lend me your hand till i pull you up the back of the ditch the horses will stand while we go ill find you as pretty a lodging for the night with a widow of a brother of my shisters husband that was as ever you slept in your life for old nick or st dennis has not found em out yet and your honour will be no compare snugger than the inn at clonbrony which has no roof the devil a stick but where will i get your honours hand for its coming on so dark i cant see rightly there youre up now safe yonder candles the house go and ask whether they can give us a nights lodging is it ask when i see the lightsure theyd be proud to give the traveller all the beds in the house let alone one take care of the potato furrows thats all and follow me straight ill go on to meet the dog who knows me and might be strange to your honour kindly welcome were the first words lord colambre heard when he approached the cottage and kindly welcome was in the sound of the voice and in the countenance of the old woman who came out shading her rushcandle from the wind and holding it so as to light the path when he entered the cottage he saw a cheerful fire and a neat pretty young woman making it blaze she curtsied put her spinningwheel out of the way set a stool by the fire for the stranger and repeating in a very low tone of voice kindly welcome retired put down some eggs dear theres plenty in the bowl said the old woman calling to her ill do the bacon was not we lucky to be upthe boys gone to bed but waken him said she turning to the postillion and hell help you with the chay and put your horses in the bier for the night no larry chose to go on to clonbrony with the horses that he might get the chaise mended betimes for his honour the table was set clean trenchers hot potatoes milk eggs bacon and kindly welcome to all set the salt dear and the butter love wheres your head grace dear grace repeated lord colambre looking up and to apologise for his involuntary exclamation he added is grace a common name in ireland i cant say plase your honour but it was give her by lady clonbrony from a niece of her own that was her fostersister god bless her and a very kind lady she was to us and to all when she was living in it but those times are gone past said the old woman with a sigh the young woman sighed too and sitting down by the fire began to count the notches in a little bit of stick which she held in her hand and after she had counted them sighed again but dont be sighing grace now said the old woman sighs is bad sauce for the travellers supper and we wont be troubling him with more added she turning to lord colambre with a smile is your egg done to your liking perfectly thank you then i wish it was a chicken for your sake which it should have been and roast too had we time i wish i could see you eat another egg no more thank you my good lady i never ate a better supper nor received a more hospitable welcome oh the welcome is all we have to offer may i ask what that is said lord colambre looking at the notched stick which the young woman held in her hand and on which her eyes were still fixed its a tally plase your honour oh youre a foreignerits the way the labourers do keep the account of the days work with the overseer the bailiff a notch for every day the bailiff makes on his stick and the labourer the like on his stick to tally and when we come to make up the account its by the notches we go and theres been a mistake and is a dispute here between our boy and the overseer and she was counting the boys tally thats in bed tired for in troth hes overworked would you want anything more from me mother said the girl rising and turning her head away no child get away for your hearts full she went instantly is the boy her brother said lord colambre no hes her bachelor said the old woman lowering her voice her bachelor that is her sweetheart for she is not my daughter though you heard her call me mother the boys my son but i am afeard they must give it up for theyre too poor and the times is hard and the agents harder than the times theres two of them the under and the upper and they grind the substance of one between them and then blow one away like chaff but well not be talking of that to spoil your honours nights rest the rooms ready and heres the rushlight she showed him into a very small but neat room what a comfortablelooking bed said lord colambre ah these red check curtains said she letting them down these have lasted well they were give me by a good friend now far away over the seasmy lady clonbrony and made by the prettiest hands ever you see her nieces miss grace nugents and she a little child that time sweet love all gone the old woman wiped a tear from her eye and lord colambre did what he could to appear indifferent she set down the candle and left the room lord colambre went to bed but he lay awake revolving sweet and bitter thoughts chapter xi the kettle was on the fire teathings set everything prepared for her guest by the hospitable hostess who thinking the gentleman would take tea to his breakfast had sent off a gossoon by the first light to clonbrony for an ounce of tea a quarter of sugar and a loaf of white bread and there was on the little table good cream milk butter eggsall the promise of an excellent breakfast it was a fresh morning and there was a pleasant fire on the hearth neatly swept up the old woman was sitting in her chimney corner behind a little skreen of whitewashed wall built out into the room for the purpose of keeping those who sat at the fire from the blast of the door there was a loophole in this wall to let the light in just at the height of a persons head who was sitting near the chimney the rays of the morning sun now came through it shining across the face of the old woman as she sat knitting lord colambre thought he had seldom seen a more agreeable countenance intelligent eyes benevolent smile a natural expression of cheerfulness subdued by age and misfortune a goodmorrow to you kindly sir and i hope you got the night wella fine day for us this sunday morning my grace is gone to early prayers so your honour will be content with an old woman to make your breakfast oh let me put in plenty or it will never be good and if your honour takes stirabout an old hand will engage to make that to your liking anyway for by great happiness we have what will just answer for you of the nicest meal the miller made my grace a compliment of last time she went to the mill lord colambre observed that this miller had good taste and his lordship paid some compliment to graces beauty which the old woman received with a smile but turned off the conversation then said she looking out of the window is not that there a nice little garden the boy dug for her and me at his breakfast and dinner hours ah hes a good boy and a good warrant to work and the good son desarves the good wife and its he that will make the good husband and with my goodwill he and no other shall get her and with her goodwill the same and i bid em keep up their heart and hope the best for theres no use in fearing the worst till it comes lord colambre wished very much to know the worst if you would not think a stranger impertinent for asking said he and if it would not be painful to you to explain oh impertinent your honour its very kindand sure nones a stranger to ones heart that feels for one and for myself i can talk of my troubles without thinking of them so ill tell you allif the worst comes to the worstall that is is that we must quit and give up this little snug place and house and farm and all to the agentwhich would be hard on us and me a widow when my husband did all that is done to the land and if your honour was a judge you could see if you stepped out there has been a deal done and built the house and allbut it plased heaven to take him well he was too good for this world and im satisfiedim not saying a word again thati trust we shall meet in heaven and be happy surely and meantime heres my boy that will make me as happy as ever widow was on earthif the agent will let him and i cant think the agent though they that know him best call him old nick would be so wicked to take from us that which he never gave us the good lord himself granted us the lase the lifes dropped and the years is out but we had a promise of renewal in writing from the landlord god bless him if he was not away hed be a good gentleman and wed be happy and safe but if you have a promise in writing of a renewal surely you are safe whether your landlord is absent or present ah no i that makes a great differ when theres no eye or hand over the agent i would not wish to speak or think ill of him or any man but was he an angel he could not know to do the tenantry justice the way he is living always in dublin and coming down to the country only the receiving days to make a sweep among us and gather up the rents in a hurry and he in such haste back to towncan just stay to count over our money and give the receipts happy for us if we get that samebut cant expect he should have time to see or hear us or mind our improvements any more than listen to our complaints oh theres great excuse for the gentleman if that was any comfort for us added she smiling but if he does not live amongst you himself has not he some underagent who lives in the country said lord colambre he has so and he should know your concerns does he mind them he should knowhe should know better but as to minding our concerns your honour knows continued she smiling again every one in this world must mind their own concerns and it would be a good world if it was even so theres a great deal in all things that dont appear at first sight mr dennis wanted grace for a wife for his bailiff but she would not have him and mr dennis was very sweet to her himselfbut grace is rather high with him as proper and he has a grudge again us ever since yet indeed there added she after another pause as you say i think we are safe for we have that memorandum in writing with a pencil given under his own hand on the back of the lase to me by the same token when my good lord had his foot on the step of the coach going away and ill never forget the smile of her that got that good turn done for me miss grace and just when she was going to england and london and young as she was to have the thought to stop and turn to the likes of me oh then if you could see her and know her as i did that was the comforting angel upon earthlook and voice and heart and all oh that she was here present this minutebut did you scald yourself said the widow to lord colambre sure you must have scalded yourself for you poured the kettle straight over your hand and it boilingo deear to think of so young a gentlemans hand shaking so like my own luckily to prevent her pursuing her observations from the hand to the face which might have betrayed more than lord colambre wished she should know her own grace came in at this instant there its for you safe mother dearthe lase said grace throwing a packet into her lap the old woman lifted up her hands to heaven with the lease between themthanks be to heaven grace passed on and sunk down on the first seat she could reach her face flushed and looking much fatigued she loosened the strings of her bonnet and cloakthen im tired but recollecting herself she rose and curtsied to the gentleman what tired ye dear why after prayers we had to gofor the agent was not at prayers nor at home for us when we calledwe had to go all the way up to the castle and there by great good luck we found mr nick garraghty himself come from dublin and the lase in his hands and he sealed it up that way and handed it to me very civil i never saw him so goodthough he offered me a glass of spirits which was not manners to a decent young woman in a morningas brian noticed after brian would not take any either nor never does we met mr dennis and the driver coming home and he says the rent must be paid tomorrow or instead of renewing hell seize and sell all mother dear i would have dropped with the walk but for brians armits a wonder dear what makes you so weak that used to be so strongbut if we can sell the cow for anything at all to mr dennis since his eye is set upon her better let him have her mother dear and that and my yarn which mrs garraghty says shell allow me for will make up the rentand brian need not talk of america but it must be in golden guineas the agent will take the rent no other way and you wont get a guinea for less than five shillings well even so its easy selling my new gown to one that covets it and that will give me in exchange the price of the gold or suppose that would not do add this cloakits handsome and i know a friend would be glad to take it and id part it as ready as look at itanything at all sure rather than that he should be forced to talk of emigrating or oh worse again listing for the bountyto save us from the cant or the jail by going to the hospital or his grave maybeoh mother oh child this is what makes you weak fretting dont be that way sure heres the lase and thats good comfort and the soldiers will be gone out of clonbrony tomorrow and then thats off your mind and as to america its only talki wont let him hes dutiful and would sooner sell my dresser and down to my bed dear than see you sell anything of yours love promise me you wont why didnt brian come home all the way with you grace he would have seen me home said grace only that he went up a piece of the mountain for some stones or ore for the gentlemanfor he had the manners to think of him this morning though shame for me i had not when i come in or i would not have told you all this and he himself by see there he is mother brian came in very hot out of breath with his hat full of stones good morrow to your honour i was in bed last night and sorry they did not call me up to be of sarvice larry was telling us this morning your honours from wales and looking for mines in ireland and i heard talk that there was one on our mountainmaybe youd be curous to see and so i brought the best i could but im no judge nor i neither thought lord colambre but he thanked the young man and determined to avail himself of larrys misconception or false report examined the stones very gravely and said this promises well lapis caliminaris schist plumpudding stone rhomboidal crystal blend garrawachy and all the strange names he could think of jumbling them together at a venture the laseis it cried the young man with joy sparkling in his eyes as his mother held up the packet then alls safe and hes an honest man and shame on me that could suspect he meant us wrong lend me the papers he cracked the seals and taking off the coverits the lase sure enough shame on mebut stay wheres the memorandum its there sure said his mother where my lords pencil writ it i dont readgrace dear look the young man put it into her hands and stood without power to utter a syllable its not here its goneno sign of it gracious heaven that cant be said the old woman putting on her spectacles let me seei remember the very spot its taken awayits rubbed clean outoh wasnt i fool but who could have thought hed be the villain the young man seemed neither to see nor hear but to be absorbed in thought grace with her eyes fixed upon him grew as pale as deathhell gohes gone shes gone cried lord colambre and the mother just caught her in her arms as she was falling the chaise is ready plase your honour said larry coming into the room death whats here airshes coming to said the young mantake a drop of water my own grace young man i promise you cried lord colambre speaking in the tone of a master striking the young mans shoulder who was kneeling at graces feet but recollecting and restraining himself he added in a quiet voicei promise you i shall never forget the hospitality i have received in this house and i am sorry to be obliged to leave you in distress these words uttered with difficulty he hurried out of the house and into his carriage go back to them said he to the postillion go back and ask whether if i should stay a day or two longer in this country they would let me return at night and lodge with them and here man stay take this putting money into his hands for the good woman of the house the postillion went in and returned she wont at alli knew she would not well i am obliged to her for the nights lodging she did give me i have no right to expect more what is itsure she bid me tell youand welcome to the lodging for said she he is a kindhearted gentleman but heres the money its that i was telling you she would not have at all thank you now my good friend larry drive me to clonbrony and do not say another word for im not in a talking humour larry nodded mounted and drove to clonbrony clonbrony was now a melancholy scene the houses which had been built in a better style of architecture than usual were in a ruinous condition the dashing was off the walls no glass in the windows and many of the roofs without slates for the stillness of the place lord colambre in some measure accounted by considering that it was sunday therefore of course all the shops were shut up and all the people at prayers he alighted at the inn which completely answered larrys representation of it nobody to be seen but a drunken waiter who as well as he could articulate informed lord colambre that his mistress was in her bed since thursdaywasaweek the hostler at the washwomans and the cook at second prayers lord colambre walked to the church but the church gate was locked and brokena calf two pigs and an ass in the churchyard and several boys with more of skin apparent than clothes were playing at hustlecap upon a tombstone which upon nearer observation he saw was the monument of his own family one of the boys came to the gate and told lord colambre there was no use in going into the church becaase there was no church there nor had not been this twelvemonth becaase there was no curate and the parson was away always since the lord was at homethat is was not at homehe nor the family lord colambre returned to the inn where after waiting a considerable time he gave up the pointhe could not get any dinnerand in the evening he walked out again into the town he found several alehouses however open which were full of people all of them as busy and as noisy as possible he observed that the interest was created by an advertisement of several farms on the clonbrony estate to be set by nicholas garraghty esq he could not help smiling at his being witness incognito to various schemes for outwitting the agents and defrauding the landlord but on a sudden the scene was changed a boy ran in crying out that st dennis was riding down the hill into the town and if you would not have the license said the boy take care of yourself if you wouldnt have the licence lord colambre perceived by what followed meant if you have not a licence brannagan immediately snatched an untasted glass of whisky from a customers lips who cried murder gave it and the bottle he held in his hand to his wife who swallowed the spirits and ran away with the bottle and glass into some back hole whilst the bystanders laughed saying well thought of peggy clear out all of you at the back door for the love of heaven if you wouldnt be the ruin of me said the man of the house setting a ladder to a corner of the shop phil hoist me up the keg to the loft added he running up the ladder and one of yees step up street and give rose mgivney notice for shes selling too the keg was hoisted up the ladder removed the shop cleared of all the customers the shutters shut the door barred the counter cleaned lift your stones sir if you plase said the wife as she rubbed the counter and say nothing of what you seen at all but that youre a stranger and a traveller seeking a lodging if youre questioned or waiting to see mr dennis theres no smell of whisky in it now is there sir lord colambre could not flatter her so far as to say thishe could only hope no one would perceive it oh and if he would the smell of whisky was nothing as the wife affirmed for it was everywhere in nature and no proof again any one good or bad now st dennis may come when he will or old nick himself so she tied up a blue handkerchief over her head and had the toothache very bad lord colambre turned to look for the man of the house hes safe in bed said the wife in bed when whilst you turned your head while i was tying the handkerchief over my face within the room look he is snug and there he was in bed certainly and his clothes on the chest a knock a loud knock at the door st dennis himselfstay till i unbar the door said the woman and making a great difficulty she let him in groaning and saying we was all done up for the night plase your honour and myself with the toothache very badand the lodger thats going to take an egg only before hed go into his bed my mans in it and asleep long ago with a magisterial air though with a look of blank disappointment mr dennis garraghty walked on looked into the room saw the good man of the house asleep heard him snore and then returning asked lord colambre who he was and what brought him there our hero said he was from england and a traveller and now bolder grown as a geologist he talked of his specimens and his hopes of finding a mine in the neighbouring mountains then adopting as well as he could the servile tone and abject manner in which he found mr dennis was to be addressed he hoped he might get encouragement from the gentleman at the head of the estate to bore is itwell dont bore me about it i cant give you any answer now my good friend im engaged out he strutted stick to him up the town if you have a mind to get your answer whispered the woman lord colambre followed for he wished to see the end of this scene well sir what are you following and sticking to me like my shadow for said mr dennis turning suddenly upon lord colambre his lordship bowed low waiting for my answer sir when you are at leisure or may i call upon you tomorrow you seem to be a civil kind of fellow but as to boring i dont knowif you undertake it at your own expense i dare say there may be minerals in the ground well you may call at the castle tomorrow and when my brother has done with the tenantry ill speak to him for you and well consult together and see what we think its too late tonight in ireland nobody speaks to a gentleman about business after dinneryour servant sir anybody can show you the way to the castle in the morning and pushing by his lordship he called to a man on the other side of the street who had obviously been waiting for him he went under a gateway with this man and gave him a bag of guineas he then called for his horse which was brought to him by a man whom colambre had heard declaring that he would bid for the land that was advertised whilst another who had the same intentions most respectfully held st denniss stirrup whilst he mounted without thanking either of these men st dennis clapped spurs to his steed and rode away no thanks indeed were deserved for the moment he was out of hearing both cursed him after the manner of their country bad luck go with you thenand may you break your neck before you get home if it was not for the lase im to get and thats paid for lord colambre followed the crowd into a publichouse where a new scene presented itself to his view the man to whom st dennis gave the bag of gold was now selling this very gold to the tenants who were to pay their rent next day at the castle the agent would take nothing but gold the same guineas were bought and sold several times over to the great profit of the agent and loss of the poor tenants for as the rents were paid the guineas were resold to another set and the remittances made through bankers to the landlord who as the poor man who explained the transaction to lord colambre expressed it gained nothing by the business bad or good but the illwill of the tenantry the higgling for the price of the gold the time lost in disputing about the goodness of the notes among some poor tenants who could not read or write and who were at the mercy of the man with the bag in his hand the vexation the useless harassing of all who were obliged to submit ultimatelylord colambre saw and all this time he endured the smell of tobacco and whisky and of the sound of various brogues the din of men wrangling brawling threatening whining drawling cajoling cursing and every variety of wretchedness and is this my fathers town of clonbrony thought lord colambre is this irelandno it is not ireland let me not like most of those who forsake their native country traduce it let me not even to my own mind commit the injustice of taking a speck for the whole what i have just seen is the picture only of that to which an irish estate and irish tenantry may be degraded in the absence of those whose duty and interest it is to reside in ireland to uphold justice by example and authority but who neglecting this duty commit power to bad hands and bad heartsabandon their tenantry to oppression and their property to ruin it was now fine moonlight and lord colambre met with a boy who said he could show him a short way across the fields to the widow oneills cottage chapter xii all were asleep at the cottage when lord colambre arrived except the widow who was sitting up waiting for him and who had brought her dog into the house that he might not fly at him or bark at his return she had a roast chicken ready for her guest and it wasbut this she never told him the only chicken she had left all the others had been sent with the dutyfowl as a present to the underagents lady while he was eating his supper which he ate with the better appetite as he had had no dinner the good woman took down from the shelf a pocketbook which she gave him is not that your book said she my boy brian found it after you in the potato furrow where you dropped it thank you said lord colambre there are bank notes in it which i could not afford to lose are there said she he never opened itnor i then in answer to his inquiries about grace and the young man the widow answered they are all in heart now i thank ye kindly sir for asking theyll sleep easy tonight anyway and im in great spirits for them and myselffor alls smooth now after we parted you brian saw mr dennis himself about the lase and memorandum which he never denied but knew nothing about but be that as it may says he youre improving tenants and im confident my brother will consider ye so what youll do is youll give up the possession tomorrow to myself that will call for it by cockcrow just for forms sake and then go up to the castle with the new lase ready drawn in your hand and if alls paid off clear of the rent and all thats due youll get the new lase signed ill promise you that upon the word and honour of a gentleman and theres no going beyond that you know sir so my boy came home as light as a feather and as gay as a lark to bring us the good news only he was afraid we might not make up the rent guineas and all and because he could not get paid for the work he done on account of the mistake in the overseers tally i sold the cow to a neighbourdogcheap but needs must as they say when old nick drives said the widow smiling well still it was but paper we got for the cow then that must be gold before the agent would take or touch it so i was laying out to sell the dresser and had taken the plates and cups and little things off it and my boy was lifting it out with andy the carpenter that was agreeing for it when in comes grace all rosy and out of breathits a wonder i minded her run out and not missed her mother says she heres the gold for you dont be stirring your dresserand wheres your gown and cloak grace says i but i beg your pardon sir maybe im tiring you lord colambre encouraged her to go on wheres your gown and cloak grace says igone says she the cloak was too warm and heavy and i dont doubt mother but it was that helped to make me faint this morning and as to the gown sure ive a very nice one here that you spun for me yourself mother and that i prize above all the gowns ever came out of a loom and that brian said become me to his fancy above any gown ever he see me wear and what could i wish for more now id a mind to scold her for going to sell the gown unknownst to me but i dont know how it was i couldnt scold her just then so kissed her and brian the same and that was what no man ever did before and she had a mind to be angry with him but could not nor ought not says i for hes as good as your husband now grace and no man can part yees now says i putting their hands together well i never saw her look so pretty nor there was not a happier boy that minute on gods earth than my son nor a happier mother than myself and i thanked god that had given them to me and down they both fell on their knees for my blessing little worth as it was and my hearts blessing they had and i laid my hands upon them its the priest you must get to do this for you tomorrow says i and brian just held up the ring to show me all was ready on his part but could not speak then theres no america any more said grace low to me and her heart was on her lips but the colour came and went and i was afeared shed have swooned again but not for sorrow so i carried her off well if she was not my ownbut she is not my own born so i may say itthere never was a better girl nor a more kindhearted nor generous never thinking anything she could do or give too much for them she loved and anything at all would do for herself the sweetest natured and tempered both and always was from this high the bond that held all together and joy of the house just like her namesake cried lord colambre plase your honour is not it late said lord colambre stretching himself and gaping ive walked a great way today the old woman lighted his rushlight showed him to his red check bed and wished him a very good night not without some slight sentiment of displeasure at his gaping thus at the panegyric on her darling grace before she left the room however her shortlived resentment vanished upon his saying that he hoped with her permission to be present at the wedding of the young couple early in the morning brian went to the priest to ask his reverence when it would be convenient to marry him and whilst he was gone mr dennis garraghty came to the cottage to receive the rent and possession the rent was ready in gold and counted into his hand no occasion for a receipt for a new lase is a receipt in full for everything very well sir said the widow i know nothing of law you know bestwhatever you directfor you are acting as a friend to us now my son got the attorney to draw the pair of new lases yesterday and here they are ready all to signing mr dennis said his brother must settle that part of the business and that they must carry them up to the castle but first give me the possession then as he instructed her she gave up the key of the door to him and a bit of the thatch of the house and he raked out the fire and said every living creature must go out its only form of law said he and must my lodger get up and turn out sir said she he must turn out to be surenot a living soul must be left in it or its no legal possession properly who is your lodger on lord colambres appearing mr dennis showed some surprise and said i thought you were lodging at brannagans are not you the man who spoke to me at his house about the gold mines no sir he never lodged at brannagans said the widow yes sir i am the person who spoke to you about the gold mines at brannagans but i did not like to lodge well no matter where you liked to lodge you must walk out of this lodging now if you please my good friend so mr dennis pushed his lordship out by the shoulders repeating as the widow turned back and looked with some surprise and alarm only for form sake only for form sake then locking the door took the key and put it into his pocket the widow held out her hand for it the forms gone through now sir is not it be plased to let us in again when the new lease is signed ill give you possession again but not till thenfor thats the law so make away with you to the castle and mind added he winking slily mind you take sealingmoney with you and something to buy gloves oh where will i find all that said the widow i have it mother dont fret said grace i have itthe price ofwhat i can want what i can do without so let us go off to the castle without delay brian will meet us on the road you know they set off for clonbrony castle lord colambre accompanying them brian met them on the road father tom is ready dear mother bring her in and hell marry us im not my own man till shes mine who knows what may happen who knows thats true said the widow better go to the castle first said grace and keep the priest waiting you cant use his reverence so said brian so she let him lead her into the priests house and she did not make any of the awkward draggings back or ridiculous scenes of grimace sometimes exhibited on these occasions but blushing rosy red yet with more selfpossession than could have been expected from her timid nature she gave her hand to the man she loved and listened with attentive devotion to the holy ceremony ah thought lord colambre whilst he congratulated the bride shall i ever be as happy as these poor people are at this moment he longed to make them some little present but all he could venture at this moment was to pay the priests dues the priest positively refused to take anything they are the best couple in my parish said he and ill take nothing sir from you a stranger and my guest now come what will im a match for it no trouble can touch me said brian oh dont be bragging said the widow whatever trouble god sends he has given one now will help to bear it and sure i may be thankful said grace such good hearts must be happyshall be happy said lord colambre oh youre very kind said the widow smiling and i wouldnt doubt you if you had the power i hope then the agent will give you encouragement about them mines that we may keep you among us i am determined to settle among you warmhearted generous people cried lord colambre whether the agent gives me encouragement or not added he it was a long walk to clonbrony castle the old woman as she said herself would not have been able for it but for a lift given to her by a friendly carman whom they met on the road with an empty car this carman was finnucan who dissipated lord colambres fears of meeting and being recognised by mrs raffarty for he in answer to the question of who is at the castle replied mrs raffarty will be in it afore night but shes on the road still theres none but old nick in it yet and hes more of a neger than ever for think that he would not pay me a farthing for the carriage of his shisters boxes and bandboxes down if youre going to have any dealings with him god grant ye a safe deliverance amen said the widow and her son and daughter lord colambres attention was now engaged by the view of the castle and park of clonbrony he had not seen it since he was six years old some faint reminiscence from his childhood made him feel or fancy that he knew the place it was a fine castle spacious park but all about it from the broken piers at the great entrance to the messy gravel and loose steps at the halldoor had an air of desertion and melancholy walks overgrown shrubberies wild plantations run up into bare poles fine trees cut down and lying on the gravel in lots to be sold a hill that had been covered with an oak wood in which in his childhood our hero used to play and which he called the black forest was gone nothing to be seen but the white stumps of the trees for it had been freshly cut down to make up the last remittancesand how it went when soldbut no matter said finnucan its all alikeits the back way into the yard ill take you i suppose and such a yard but its no matter repeated lord colambre to

out of his pen on the wilton carpet when he had finished signing his name to a paper on his knee you may wait long before you get to the speech of the great man said another who was working his way through numbers they continued pushing forward till they came within sight of mr nicholas garraghty seated in state and a worse countenance or a more perfect picture of an insolent petty tyrant in office lord colambre had never beheld we forbear all further detail of this levee its all the same as lord colambre repeated to himself on every fresh instance of roguery or oppression to which he was witness and having completely made up his mind on the subject he sat down quietly in the background waiting till it should come to the widows turn to be dealt with for he was now interested only to see how she would be treated the room gradually thinned mr dennis garraghty came in and sat down at the table to help his brother to count the heaps of gold oh mr dennis im glad to see you as kind as your promise meeting me here said the widow oneill walking up to him im sure youll speak a good word for me heres the laseswho will i offer this to said she holding the glovemoney and sealingmoneyfor

shall have law i saw the memorandum written before ever it went into your hands sir whatever became of it after and will swear to it too swear away my good friend much your swearing will avail in your

character take care how you go to that anyway sir cried brian grace put her hand before his mouth to stop him grace dear i must speak if i die for it sure its for my mother said the young man struggling forward while his mother held him back i must speak oh hes ruind i see it said grace putting her hand before her eyes and he wont mind me go on let him go on pray young woman said mr garraghty pale with anger and fear his lips quivering i shall be happy to take down his words write them and may all the world read it and welcome his mother and wife stopped his mouth by force write you dennis said mr garraghty giving the pen to his brother for his hand shook so he could not form a letter write the very words and at the top pointing after warning with malice prepense write thenmother gracelet me cried brian speaking in a smothered voice as their hands were over his mouth write then that if youd either of you a character like my mother you might defy the world and your word would be as good as your oath oath mind that dennis said mr garraghty oh sir sir wont you stop him cried grace turning suddenly to lord colambre oh dear dear if you havent lost your feeling for us cried the widow let him speak said lord colambre in a tone of authority let the voice of truth be heard truth cried st dennis and dropped the pen and who the devil are you sir said old nick lord colambre i protest exclaimed a female voice and mrs raffarty at this instant appeared at the open door lord colambre repeated all present in different tones my lord i beg pardon continued mrs raffarty advancing as if her legs were tied had i known you was down here i would not have presumed id better retire for i see youre busy youd best for youre mad sister said st dennis pushing her back and we are busy go to your room and keep quiet if you can first madam said lord colambre going between her and the door let me beg that you will consider yourself as at home in this house whilst any circumstances make it desirable to you the hospitality you showed me you cannot think that i now forget oh my lord youre too goodhow fewtoo kindkinder than my own and bursting into tears she escaped out of the room lord colambre returned to the party round the table who were in various attitudes of astonishment and with faces of fear horror hope joy doubt distress continued his lordship however incurred if not by vice will always find a refuge in this house i speak in my fathers name for i know i speak his sentiments but never more shall vice said he darting such a look at the brother agents as they felt to the backbonenever more shall vice shall fraud enter here he paused and there was a momentary silence there spoke the true thing and the rael gentleman my own hearts satisfied said brian folding his arms and standing erect then so is mine said grace taking breath with a deep sigh the widow advancing put on her spectacles and looking up close at lord colambres facethen its a wonder i didnt know the family likeness lord colambre now recollecting that he still wore the old greatcoat threw it off oh bless him then now id know him anywhere im willing to die now for well all be happy my lord since it is somy lord may i ask you said mr garraghty now sufficiently recovered to be able to articulate but scarcely to express his ideas if what your lordship hinted just now i hinted nothing sir i spoke plainly i beg pardon my lord said old nickrespecting vice was levelled at me because if it was my lord trying to stand erect let me tell your lordship if i could think it was if it did not hit you sir no matter at whom it was levelled and let me ask my lord if i may presume whether in what you suggested by the word fraud your lordship had any particular meaning said st dennis a very particular meaning sirfeel in your pocket for the key of this widows house and deliver it to her oh if thats all the meaning with all the pleasure in life i never meant to detain it longer than till the leases were signed said st dennis and im ready to sign the leases this minute said the brother do it sir this minute i have read them i will be answerable to my father oh as to that my lord i have power to sign for your father he signed the leases they were duly witnessed by lord colambre i deliver this as my act and deed said mr garraghtymy lord continued he you see at the first word from you and had i known sooner the interest you took in the family there would have been no difficulty for id make it a principle to oblige you my lord oblige me said lord colambre with disdain but when gentlemen and noblemen travel incognito and lodge in cabins added st dennis with a satanic smile glancing his eye on grace they have good reasons no doubt do not judge my heart by your own sir said lord colambre coolly no two things in nature can i trust be more different my purpose in travelling incognito has been fully answered i was determined to see and judge how my fathers estates were managed and i have seen compared and judged i have seen the difference between the clonbrony and the colambre property and i shall represent what i have seen to my father as to that my lord if we are to come to that but i trust your lordship will suffer me to explain these mattersgo about your business my good friends you have all you wantand my lord after dinner when you are cool i hope i shall be able to make you sensible that things have been represented to your lordship in a mistaken light and i flatter myself i shall convince you i have not only always acted the part of a friend to the family but am particularly willing to conciliate your lordships goodwill said he sweeping the rouleaus of gold into a bag any accommodation in my power at any time i want no accommodation sirwere i starving i would accept of none from you never can you conciliate my goodwill for you can never deserve it if that be the case my lord i must conduct myself accordingly but its fair to warn you before you make any representation to my lord clonbrony that if he should think of changing his agent there are accounts to be settled between usthat may be a consideration no sir no considerationmy father never shall be the slave of such a paltry consideration oh very well my lord you know best if you choose to make an assumpsit im sure i shall not object to the security your lordship will be of age soon i knowim sure im satisfiedbut added he with a malicious smile i rather apprehend you dont know what you undertake i only premise that the balance of accounts between us is not what can properly be called a paltry consideration on that point perhaps sir you and i may differ very well my lord you will follow your own principles if it suits your convenience whether it does or not sir i shall abide by my principles dennis the letters to the postwhen do you go to england my lord immediately sir said lord colambre his lordship saw new leases from his father to mr dennis garraghty lying on the table unsigned immediately repeated messrs nicholas and dennis with an air of dismay nicholas got up looked out of the window and whispered something to his brother who instantly left the room lord colambre saw the postchaise at the door which had brought mrs raffarty to the castle and larry standing beside it his lordship instantly threw up the sash and holding between his finger and thumb a sixshilling piece cried larry my friend let me have the horses you shall have emyour honour said larry mr dennis garraghty appeared below speaking in a magisterial tone larry my brother must have the horses he cant plase your honourtheyre engaged half a crown a crownhalf a guinea said mr dennis garraghty raising his voice as he increased his proffered bribe to each offer larry replied you cant plase your honour theyre engagedand looking up to the window at lord colambre he said as soon as they have eaten their oats you shall have em no other horses were to be had the agent was in consternation lord colambre ordered that larry should have some dinner and whilst the postillion was eating and the horses finishing their oats his lordship wrote the following letter to his father which to prevent all possibility of accident he determined to put with his own hand into the postoffice at clonbrony as he passed through the town my dear father i hope to be with you in a few days lest anything should detain me on the road i write this to make an earnest request to you that you will not sign any papers or transact any farther business with messrs nicholas or dennis garraghty before you see your affectionate son colambre the horses came out larry sent word he was ready and lord colambre having first eaten a slice of his own venison ran down to the carriage followed by the thanks and blessings of the widow her son and daughter who could hardly make their way after him to the chaisedoor so great was the crowd which had gathered on the report of his lordships arrival long life to your honour long life to your lordship echoed on all sides just come and going are you goodbye to you all good people then goodbye is the only word we wouldnt wish to hear from your honour for the sake both of landlord and tenant i must leave you now my good friends but i hope to return to you at some future time god bless you and speed ye and a safe journey to your honourand a happy return to us and soon cried a multitude of voices lord colambre stopped at the chaisedoor and beckoned to the widow oneill before whom others had pressed an opening was made for her instantly there that was the very way his father stood with his feet on the steps and miss nugent was in it lord colambre forgot what he was going to saywith some difficulty recollected this pocketbook said he which your son restored to mei intend it for your daughterdont keep it as your son kept it for me without opening it let what is withinside added he as he got into the carriage replace the cloak and gown and let all things necessary for a bride be bought for the bride that has all things to borrow has surely mickle to doshut the door and drive on blessings be wid you cried the widow and god give you grace chapter xiii larry drove off at full gallop and kept on at a good rate till he got out of the great gate and beyond the sight of the crowd then pulling up he turned to lord colambreplase your honour i did not know nor guess ye was my lord when i let you have the horses did not know who you was from adam ill take my affidavit theres no occasion said lord colambre i hope you dont repent letting me have the horses now you do know who i am oh not at all sure im as glad as the best horse i ever crossed that your honour is my lordbut i was only telling your honour that you might not be looking upon me as a timeserver i do not look upon you as a timeserver larry but keep on that time may serve me in two words he explained his cause of haste and no sooner explained than understood larry thundered away through the town of clonbrony bending over his horses plying the whip and lending his very soul at every lash with much difficulty lord colambre stopped him at the end of the town at the postoffice the post was gone outgone a quarter of an hour maybe well overtake the mail said larry and as he spoke he slid down from his seat and darted into the publichouse reappearing in a few moments with a copper of ale and a horn in his hand he and another man held open the horses mouths and poured the ale through the horn down their throats now theyll go with spirit and with the hope of overtaking the mail larry made them go for life or death as he said but in vain at the next stage at his own inndoor larry roared for fresh horses till he got them harnessed them with his own hands holding the sixshilling piece which lord colambre had given him in his mouth all the while for he could not take time to put it into his pocket speed ye i wish i was driving you all the way then said he the other postillion was not yet ready then your honour sees said he putting his head into the carriage consarning of them garraghtiesold nick and st dennisthe best part that is the worst part of what i told you proved true and im glad of it that is im sorry for itbut glad your honour knows it in time so heaven prosper you and may all the saints barring st dennis have charge of you and all belonging to you till we see you here againand when will it be i cannot say when i shall return to you myself but i will do my best to send your landlord to you soon in the meantime my good fellow keep away from the sign of the horseshoea man of your sense to drink and make an idiot and a brute of yourself trueand it was only when i had lost hope i took to itbut now bring me the book one of yees out of the landladys parlourby the virtue of this book and by all the books that ever was shut and opened i wont touch a drop of spirits good or bad till i see your honour again or some of the family this time twelvemonththat long ill live on hopebut mind if you disappoint me i dont swear but ill take to the whisky for comfort all the rest of my days but dont be staying here wasting your time advising me bartley take the reins cant ye cried he giving them to the fresh postillion and keep on for your life for theres thousands of pounds depending on the raceso off off bartley with speed of light bartley did his best and such was the excellence of the roads that notwithstanding the rate at which our hero travelled he arrived safely in dublin and just in time to put his letter into the postoffice and to sail in that nights packet the wind was fair when lord colambre went on board but before they got out of the bay it changed they made no way all night in the course of the next day they had the mortification to see another packet from dublin sail past them and when they landed at holyhead were told the packet which had left ireland twelve hours after them had been in an hour before them the passengers had taken their places in the coach and engaged what horses could be had lord colambre was afraid that mr garraghty was one of them a person exactly answering his description had taken four horses and set out half an hour before in great haste for london luckily just as those who had taken their places in the mail were getting into the coach lord colambre saw among them a gentleman with whom he had been acquainted in dublin a barrister who was come over during the long vacation to make a tour of pleasure in england when lord colambre explained the reason he had for being in haste to reach london he had the goodnature to give up to him his place in the coach lord colambre travelled all night and delayed not one moment till he reached his fathers house in london my father at home yes my lord in his own roomthe agent from ireland with him on particular businessdesired not to be interruptedbut ill go and tell him my lord you are come lord colambre ran past the servant as he spokemade his way into the roomfound his father sir terence ofay and mr garraghtyleases open on the table before them a candle lighted sir terence sealing garraghty emptying a bag of guineas on the table and lord clonbrony actually with a pen in his hand ready to sign as the door opened garraghty started back so that half the contents of his bag rolled upon the floor stop my dear father i conjure you cried lord colambre springing forward and kneeling to his father at the same moment snatching the pen from his hand colambre god bless you my dear boy at all events but how came you hereand what do you mean said his father burn it cried sir terence pinching the sealingwax for i burnt myself with the pleasure of the surprise garraghty without saying a word was picking up the guineas that were scattered upon the floor how fortunate i am cried lord colambre to have arrived just in time to tell you my dear father before you put your signature to these papers before you conclude this bargain all i know all i have seen of that man nick garraghty honest old nick do you know him my lord said sir terence too well sir mr garraghty what have you done to offend my son i did not expect this said lord clonbrony upon my conscience my lord nothing to my knowledge said mr garraghty picking up the guineas but showed him every civility even so far as offering to accommodate him with cash without security and where will you find the other agent in ireland or anywhere else will do that to my knowledge i never did anything by word or deed to offend my lord colambre nor could not for i never saw him but for ten minutes in my days and then he was in such a foaming passionbegging his lordships pardonowing to the misrepresentations he met with of me i presume from a parcel of blackguards that he went amongst incognito he would not let me or my brother dennis say a word to set him right but exposed me before all the tenantry and then threw himself into a hack and drove off here to stop the signing of these leases i perceive but i trust concluded he putting the replenished moneybag down with a heavy sound on the table opposite to lord clonbronyi trust my lord clonbrony will do me justice thats all i have to say i comprehend the force of your last argument fully sir said lord colambre may i ask how many guineas there are in the bag i dont ask whether they are my fathers or not they are to be your lordships fathers sir if he thinks proper replied garraghty how many i dont know that i can justly positively sayfive hundred suppose and they would be my fathers if he signed those leasesi understand that perfectly and understand that my father would lose three times that sum by the bargainmy dear father you startbut it is true is not this the rent sir at which you were going to let mr garraghty have the land placing a paper before lord clonbrony it isthe very thing and here sir written with my own hand are copies of the proposals i saw from responsible respectable tenants offered and refusedis it so or is it not mr garraghtydeny it if you can mr garraghty grew pale his lips quivered he stammered and after a shocking convulsion of face could at last articulateonly that there was a great difference between tenant and tenant his lordship must be sensible especially for so large a rentas great a difference as between agent and agent i am sensibleespecially for so large a property said lord colambre with cool contempt you find sir i am well informed with regard to this transaction you will find also that i am equally well informed with respect to every part of your conduct towards my father and his tenantry if in relating to him what i have seen and heard i should make any mistakes you are here and i am glad you are to set me right and to do yourself justice oh as to that i should not presume to contradict anything your lordship asserts from your own authority where would be the use i leave it all to your lordship but as it is not particularly agreeable to stay to hear ones self abusedsir terence ill thank you to hand me my hatand if youll have the goodness my lord clonbrony to look over finally the accounts before morning ill call at your leisure to settle the balance as you find convenient as to the leases im quite indifferent so saying he took up his moneybag well youll call again in the morning mr garraghty said sir terence and by that time i hope we shall understand this misunderstanding better sir terence pulled lord clonbronys sleeve dont let him go with the moneyits much wanted let him go said lord colambre money can be had by honourable means wheughhe talks as if he had the bank of england at his command as every young man does said sir terence lord colambre deigned no reply lord clonbrony walked undecidedly between his agent and his sonlooked at sir terence and said nothing mr garraghty departed lord clonbrony called after him from the head of the stairs i shall be at home and at leisure in the morning sir terence ran downstairs after him lord colambre waited quietly for their return fifteen hundred guineas at a stroke of a goosequillthat was a neat hit narrowly missed of honest nicks said lord clonbrony too bad too bad faithi am much very much obliged to you colambre for that hint by tomorrow morning we shall have him in another tune and he must double the bag or quit said sir terence treble it if you please terry sure three times fives fifteenfifteen hundred down or he does not get my signature to those leases for his brother nor get the agency of the colambre estatecolambre what more have you to tell of him for since he is making out his accounts against me it is no harm to have a per contra against him that may ease my balance very fair very fair said sir terence my lord trust me for remembering all the charges against himevery item and when he cant clear himself if i dont make him buy a good character dear enough why say im a fool and dont know the value of character good or bad if you know the value of character sir terence said lord colambre you know that it is not to be bought or sold then turning from sir terence to his father he gave a full and true account of all he had seen in his progress through his irish estates and drew a faithful picture both of the bad and good agent lord clonbrony who had benevolent feelings and was fond of his tenantry was touched and when his son ceased speaking repeated several times rascal rascal how dare he use my tenants sothe oneills in particularrascal bad heartill have no more to do with him but suddenly recollecting himself he turned to sir terence and added thats sooner said than doneill tell you honestly colambre your friend mr burke may be the best man in the worldbut he is the worst man to apply to for a remittance or a loan in a hurry he always tells me he cant distress the tenantsand he never at coming into the agency even said sir terence advanced a good round sum to the landlord by way of security for his good behaviour now honest nick did that much for us at coming in and at going out is he not to be repaid said lord colambre thats the devil said lord clonbrony thats the very reason i cant conveniently turn him out i will make it convenient to you sir if you will permit me said lord colambre in a few days i shall be of age and will join with you in raising whatever sum you want to free you from this man allow me to look over his account and whatever the honest balance may be let him have it my dear boy said lord clonbrony youre a generous fellow fine irish heartglad youre my son but theres more much more that you dont know added he looking at sir terence who cleared his throat and lord clonbrony who was on the point of opening all his affairs to his son stopped short colambre said he we will not say anything more of this at present for nothing effectual can be done till you are of age and then we shall see all about it lord colambre perfectly understood what his father meant and what was meant by the clearing of sir terences throat lord clonbrony wanted his son to join him in opening the estate to pay his debts and sir terence feared that if lord colambre were abruptly told the whole sum total of the debts he would never be persuaded to join in selling or mortgaging so much of his patrimony as would be necessary for their payment sir terence thought that the young man ignorant probably of business and unsuspicious of the state of his fathers affairs might be brought by proper management to any measures they desired lord clonbrony wavered between the temptation to throw himself upon the generosity of his son and the immediate convenience of borrowing a sum of money from his agent to relieve his present embarrassments nothing can be settled repeated he till colambre is of age so it does not signify talking of it why so sir said lord colambre though my act in law may not be valid till i am of age my promise as a man of honour is binding now and i trust would be as satisfactory to my father as any legal deed whatever undoubtedly my dear boy but but what said lord colambre following his fathers eye which turned to sir terence ofay as if asking his permission to explain as my fathers friend sir you ought permit me to say at this moment to use your influence to prevail upon him to throw aside all reserve with a son whose warmest wish is to serve him and to see him at ease and happy generous dear boy cried lord clonbrony terence i cant stand it but how shall i bring myself to name the amount of the debts at some time or other i must know it said lord colambre i cannot be better prepared at any moment than the present never more disposed to give my assistance to relieve all difficulties blindfold i cannot be led to any purpose sir said he looking at sir terence the attempt would be degrading and futile blindfolded i will not bebut with my eyes open i will see and go straight and prompt as heart can go to my fathers interest without a look or thought to my own by st patrick the spirit of a prince and an irish prince spoke there cried sir terence and if id fifty hearts youd have all in your hand this minute at your service and warm blindfold you after that the man that would attempt it desarves to be shot and id have no sincerer pleasure in life than shooting him this moment was he my best friend but its not clonbrony or your father my lord would act that way no more than sir terence ofaytheres the schedule of the debts drawing a paper from his bosom and ill swear to the lot and not a man on earth could do that but myself lord colambre opened the paper his father turned aside covering his face with both his hands tut man said sir terence i know him now better than you he will stand youll find the shock of that regiment of figureshe is steel to the backbone and proof spirit i thank you my dear father said lord colambre for trusting me thus at once with a view of the truth at first sight it is i acknowledge worse than i expected but i make no doubt that when you allow me to examine mr garraghtys accounts and mr mordicais claims we shall be able to reduce this alarming total considerably my dear father you think we learn nothing but latin and greek at cambridge but you are mistaken the devil a pound nor a penny said sir terence for you have to deal with a jew and old nick and im not a match for them i dont know who is and i have no hope of getting any abatement ive looked over the accounts till im sick nevertheless you will observe that fifteen hundred guineas have been saved to my father at one stroke by his not signing those leases saved to you my lord not your father if you plase said sir terence for now im upon the square with you i must be straight as an arrow and deal with you as the son and friend of my friend before i was considering you only as the son and heir which is quite another thing you know accordingly acting for your father here i was making the best bargain against you i could honestly now i tell you i knew the value of the lands well enough we were as sharp as garraghty and he knew it we were to have had the difference from him partly in cash and partly in balance of accountsyou comprehendand you only would have been the loser and never would have known it maybe till after we all were dead and buried and then you might have set aside garraghtys lease easy and no harm done to any but a rogue that desarved it and in the meantime an accommodation to my honest friend my lord your father here but as fate would have it you upset all by your progress incognito through them estates well its best as it is and i am better pleased to be as we are trusting all to a generous sons own heart now put the poor father out of pain and tell us what youll do my dear in one word then said lord colambre i will upon two conditions either join my father in levying fines to enable him to sell or mortgage whatever portion of his estate is necessary for the payment of these debts or i will in whatever other mode he can point out as more agreeable or more advantageous to him join in giving security to his creditors dear noble fellow cried sir terence none but an irishman could do it lord clonbrony melted to tears could not articulate but held his arms open to embrace his son but you have not heard my conditions yet said lord colambre oh confound the conditions cried sir terence what conditions could he ask that i could refuse at this minute said lord clonbrony nor iwas it my hearts blood and were i to be hanged for it cried sir terence and what are the conditions that mr garraghty shall be dismissed from the agency and welcome and glad to get rid of himthe rogue the tyrant said lord clonbrony and to be beforehand with you in your next wish put mr burke into his place ill write the letter for you to sign my lord this minute cried terry with all the pleasure in life no its my lord colambre should do that in all justice but whats your next condition i hope its no worse said lord clonbrony that you and my mother should cease to be absentees oh murder said sir terence maybe thats not so easy for there are two words to that bargain lord clonbrony declared that for his own part he was ready to return to ireland next morning and to promise to reside on his estate all the rest of his days that there was nothing he desired more provided lady clonbrony would consent to it but that he could not promise for her that she was as obstinate as a mule on that point that he had often tried but that there was no moving her and that in short he could not promise on her part but it was on this condition lord colambre said he must insist without this condition was granted he would not engage to do anything well we must only see how it will be when she comes to town she will come up from buxton the day youre of age to sign some papers said lord clonbrony but added he with a very dejected look and voice if alls to depend on my lady clonbronys consenting to return to ireland im as far from all hope of being at ease as ever upon my conscience were all at sea again said sir terence lord colambre was silent but in his silence there was such an air of firmness that both lord clonbrony and sir terence were convinced entreaties would on this point be fruitlesslord clonbrony sighed deeply but when its ruin or safety and her husband and all belonging to her at stake the woman cant persist in being a mule said sir terence of whom are you talking said lord colambre of whom oh i beg your lordships pardoni thought i was talking to my lord but in other words as you are her son im persuaded her ladyship your mother will prove herself a reasonable womanwhen she sees she cant help it so my lord clonbrony cheer up a great deal may be done by the fear of mordicai and an execution especially now the prior creditor since theres no reserve between you and i now my lord colambre said sir terence i must tell you all and how we shambled on those months while you were in ireland first mordicai went to law to prove i was in a conspiracy with your father pretending to be prior creditor to keep him off and out of his own which after a world of swearing and lawlaw always takes time to do justice thats one comfortthe villain proved at last to be true enough and so cast us and i was forced to be paid off last week so theres no prior creditor or any shield of pretence that way then his execution was coming down upon us and nothing to stay it till i thought of a monthly annuity to mordicai in the shape of a wager so the morning after he cast us i went to him mr mordicai says i you must be plased to see a man youve beaten so handsomely and though im sore both for myself and my friend yet you see i can laugh still though an execution is no laughing matter and im sinsible youve one in petto in your sleeve for my friend lord clonbrony but ill lay you a wager of a hundred guineas in paper that a marriage of his son with a certain heiress before next ladyday will set all to rights and pay you with a compliment too good heavens sir terence surely you said no such thing i didbut what was it but a wager which is nothing but a dream and when lost as i am as sinsible as you are that it must be why what is it after all but a bonus in a gentlemanlike form to mordicai which i grant you is more than he deserves for staying the execution till you be of age and even for my lady clonbronys sake though i know she hates me like poison rather than have her disturbed by an execution id pay the hundred guineas this minute out of my own pocket if i had em in it a thundering knock at the door was heard at this moment never heed it let em thunder said sir terence whoever it is they wont get in for my lord bid them let none in for their life its necessary for us to be very particular about the streetdoor now and i advise a double chain for it and to have the footmen well tutored to look before they run to a double rap for a double rap might be a double trap my lady and miss nugent my lord said a footman throwing open the door my mother miss nugent cried lord colambre springing eagerly forward colambre here said his mother but its all too late now and no matter where you are lady clonbrony coldly suffered her son to embrace her and he without considering the coldness of her manner scarcely hearing and not at all understanding the words she said fixed his eyes on his cousin who with a countenance all radiant with affectionate joy held out her hand to him dear cousin colambre what an unexpected pleasure he seized the hand but as he was going to kiss it the recollection of st omar crossed his mind he checked himself and said something about joy and pleasure but his countenance expressed neither and miss nugent much surprised by the coldness of his manner withdrew her hand and turning away left the room grace darling called lord clonbrony whither so fast before youve given me a word or a kiss she came back and hastily kissed her uncle who folded her in his arms why must i let you go and what makes you so pale my dear child i am a littlea little tired i will be with you again soon her uncle let her go your famous buxton baths dont seem to have agreed with her by all i can see said lord clonbrony my lord the buxton baths are no way to blame but i know what is to blame and who is to blame said lady clonbrony in a tone of displeasure fixing her eyes upon her son yes you may well look confounded colambre but it is too late nowyou should have known your own mind in time i see you have heard it thenbut i am sure i dont know how for it was only decided the day i left buxton the news could hardly travel faster than i did pray how did you hear it hear what maam said lord colambre why that miss broadhurst is going to be married oh is that all maam said our hero much relieved all now lord colambre you reelly are too much for my patience but i flatter myself you will feel when i tell you that it is your friend sir arthur berryl as i always prophesied who has carried off the prize from you but for the fear of displeasing my dear mother i should say that i do feel sincere pleasure in this marriagei always wished it my friend sir arthur from the first moment trusted me with the secret of his attachment he knew that he had my warm good wishes for his success he knew that i thought most highly of the young lady but that i never thought of her as a wife for myself and why did not you that is the very thing i complain of said lady clonbrony but it is all over now you may set your heart at ease for they are to be married on thursday and poor mrs broadhurst is ready to break her heart for she was set upon a coronet for her daughter and you ungrateful as you are you dont know how she wished you to be the happy man but only conceive after all that had passed miss broadhurst had the assurance to expect i would let my niece be her bridesmaid oh i flatly refused that is i told grace it could not be and that there might be no affront to mrs broadhurst who did not deserve it i pretended grace had never mentioned it but ordered my carriage and left buxton directly grace was hurt for she is very warm in her friendships i am sorry to hurt grace but reelly i could not let her be bridesmaidand that if you must know is what vexed her and made the tears come in her eyes i supposeand im sorry for it but one must keep up ones dignity a little after all miss broadhurst was only a citizenand reelly now a very odd girl never did anything like anybody else settled her marriage at last in the oddest way grace can you tell the particulars i own i am tired of the subject and tired of my journey my lord i shall take leave to dine in my own room today continued her ladyship as she quitted the room i hope her ladyship did not notice me said sir terence ofay coming from behind a windowcurtain why terry what did you hide for said lord clonbrony hide i didnt hide nor wouldnt from any man living let alone any woman leaving any woman out of the question hide no but i just stood looking out of the window behind this curtain that my poor lady clonbrony might not be discomfited and shocked by the sight of one whom she cant abide the very minute she come home oh ive some considerationit would have put her out of humour worse with both of you too and for that theres no need as far as i see so ill take myself off to my coffeehouse to dine and maybe you may get her down and into spirits again but for your lives dont touch upon ireland the night nor till she has fairly got the better of the marriage apropostheres my wager to mordicai gone at a slap its i that ought to be scolding you my lord colambre but i trust you will do as well yet not in point of purse maybe but im not one of those that think that moneys everythingthough i grant you in this world theres nothing to be had without itlove exceptedwhich most people dont believe inbut not iin particular cases so i leave you with my blessing and ive a notion at this time that is better than my companyyour most devoted the goodnatured sir terence would not be persuaded by lord clonbrony to stay nodding at lord colambre as he went out of the room he said ive an eye in going to your hearts ease too when i played myself i never liked standersby sir terence was not deficient in penetration but he never could help boasting of his discoveries lord colambre was grateful for his judicious departure and followed his equally judicious advice not to touch upon ireland this night lady clonbrony was full of buxton and he was glad to be relieved from the necessity of talking and he indulged himself in considering what might be passing in miss nugents mind she now appeared in remarkably good spirits for her aunt had given her a hint that she thought her out of humour because she had not been permitted to be miss broadhursts bridesmaid and she was determined to exert herself to dispel this notion this it was now easy for her to do because she had by this time in her own imagination found a plausible excuse for that coldness in lord colambres reception of her by which she had at first been hurt she had settled it that he had taken it for granted she was of his mothers sentiments respecting miss broadhursts marriage and that this idea and perhaps the apprehension of her reproaches had caused his embarrassmentshe knew that she could easily set this misunderstanding right accordingly when lady clonbrony had talked herself to sleep about buxton and was taking her afternoons nap as it was her custom to do when she had neither cards nor company to keep her awake miss nugent began to explain her own sentiments and to give lord colambre as her aunt had desired an account of the manner in which miss broadhursts marriage had been settled in the first place said she let me assure you that i rejoice in this marriage i think your friend sir arthur berryl is every way deserving of my friend miss broadhurst and this from me said she smiling is no slight eulogium i have marked the rise and progress of their attachment and it has been founded on the perception of such excellent qualities on each side that i have no fear for its permanence sir arthur berryls honourable conduct in paying his fathers debts and his generosity to his mother and sisters whose fortunes were left entirely dependent upon him first pleased my friend it was like what she would have done herself and likein short it is what few young men as she said of the present day would do then his refraining from all personal expenses his going without equipage and without horses that he might do what he felt to be right whilst it exposed him continually to the ridicule of fashionable young men or to the charge of avarice made a very different impression on miss broadhursts mind her esteem and admiration were excited by these proofs of strength of character and of just and good principles if you go on you will make me envious and jealous of my friend said lord colambre you jealousoh it is too late nowbesides you cannot be jealous for you never loved i never loved miss broadhurst i acknowledge there was the advantage sir arthur berryl had over youhe loved and my friend saw it she was clearsighted said lord colambre she was clearsighted repeated miss nugent but if you mean that she was vain and apt to fancy people in love with her i can assure you that you are mistaken never was woman young or old more clearsighted to the views of those by whom she was addressed no flattery no fashion could blind her judgment she knew how to choose a friend well i am sure said lord colambre and a friend for life too i am sure you will allow and she had such numbers such strange variety of admirers as might have puzzled the choice and turned the brain of any inferior person such a succession of lovers as she has had this summer ever since you went to irelandthey appeared and vanished like figures in a magiclantern she had three noble admirersrank in three different forms offered themselves first came in hobbling rank and gout next rank and gaming then rank very high rank over head and ears in debt all of these were rejected and as they moved off i thought mrs broadhurst would have broken her heart next came fashion with his head heart and soul in his cravathe quickly made his bow or rather his nod and walked off taking a pinch of snuff then came a man of gallantry but whispered miss nugent there was a mistress in the wood and my friend could have nothing to do with that gentleman now if she liked the man interrupted lord clonbrony and i suppose she did for all women but yourself grace like men of gallantry miss broadhurst was a goose for refusing him on account of the mistress because she might have been bought up and settled with a few thousand pounds be that as it may said miss nugent my friend did not like and would not accept of the man of gallantry so he retired and comforted himself with a copy of verses then came a man of witbut still it was wit without worth and presently came worth without wit she preferred wit and worth united which she fortunately at last found lord colambre in your friend sir arthur berryl grace my girl said her uncle im glad to see youve got up your spirits again though you were not to be bridesmaid well i hope youll be bride soonim sure you ought to beand you should think of rewarding that poor mr salisbury who plagues me to death whenever he can catch hold of me about you he must have our definitive at last you know grace a silence ensued which neither miss nugent nor lord colambre seemed willing or able to break very good company faith you threeone of ye asleep and the other two saying nothing to keep one awake colambre have you no dublin news grace have you no buxton scandal what was it lady clonbrony told us youd tell us about the oddness of miss broadhursts settling her marriage tell me that for i love to hear odd things perhaps you will not think it odd said she one eveningbut i should begin by telling you that three of her admirers beside sir arthur berryl had followed her to buxton and had been paying their court to her all the time we were there and at last grew impatient for her decision ay for her definitive said lord clonbrony miss nugent was put out again but resumed so one evening just before the dancing began the gentlemen were all standing round miss broadhurst one of them said i wish miss broadhurst would decidethat whoever she dances with tonight should be her partner for life what a happy man he would be but how can i decide said miss broadhurst i wish i had a friend to plead for me said one of the suitors looking at me have you no friend of your own said miss broadhurst plenty of friends said the gentleman plentythen you must be a very happy man replied miss broadhurst come said she laughing i will dance with that man who can convince methat he has near relations excepted one true friend in the world that man who has made the best friend i dare say will make the best husband at that moment continued miss nugent i was certain who would be her choice the gentlemen all declared at first that they had abundance of excellent friends the best friends in the world but when miss broadhurst crossexamined them as to what their friends had done for them or what they were willing to do modern friendship dwindled into a ridiculously small compass i cannot give you the particulars of the crossexamination though it was conducted with great spirit and humour by miss broadhurst but i can tell you the resultthat sir arthur berryl by incontrovertible facts and eloquence warm from the heart convinced everybody present that he had the best friend in the world and miss broadhurst as he finished speaking gave him her hand and he led her off in triumphso you see lord colambre you were at last the cause of my friends marriage she turned to lord colambre as she spoke these words with such an affectionate smile and such an expression of open inmost tenderness in her whole countenance that our hero could hardly resist the impulse of his passioncould hardly restrain himself from falling at her feet that instant and declaring his love but st omar st omarit must not be i must be gone said lord clonbrony pulling out his watch it is time to go to my club and poor terry will wonder what has become of me lord colambre instantly offered to accompany his father much to lord clonbronys and more to miss nugents surprise what said she to herself after so long an absence leave meleave his mother with whom he always used to stayon purpose to avoid me what can i have done to displease him it is clear it was not about miss broadhursts marriage he was offended for he looked pleased and like himself whilst i was talking of that but the moment afterwards what a constrained unintelligible expression of countenance and leaves me to go to a club which he detests as the gentlemen shut the door on leaving the room lady clonbrony wakened and starting up exclaimed whats the matter are they gone is colambre gone yes maam with my uncle very odd very odd of him to go and leave me he always used to stay with mewhat did he say about me nothing maam well then i have nothing to say about him or about anything indeed for im excessively tired and stupidalone in londons as bad as anywhere else ring the bell and well go to bed directlyif you have no objection grace grace made no objection lady clonbrony went to bed and to sleep in ten minutes miss nugent went to bed but she lay awake considering what could be the cause of her cousin colambres hard unkindness and of his altered eye she was openness itself and she determined that the first moment she could speak to him alone she would at once ask for an explanation with this resolution she rose in the morning and went down to the breakfastroom in hopes of meeting him as it had formerly been his custom to be early and she expected to find him reading in his usual place chapter xiv nolord colambre was not in his accustomed place reading in the breakfastroom nor did he make his appearance till both his father and mother had been some time at breakfast good morning to you my lord colambre said his mother in a reproachful tone the moment he entered i am much obliged to you for your company last night good morning to you colambre said his father in a more jocose tone of reproach i am obliged to you for your good company last night good morning to you lord colambre said miss nugent and though she endeavoured to throw all reproach from her looks and to let none be heard in her voice yet there was a slight tremulous motion in that voice which struck our hero to the heart i thank you maam for missing me said he addressing himself to his mother i stayed away but half an hour i accompanied my father to st jamess street and when i returned i found that every one had retired to rest oh was that the case said lady clonbrony i own i thought it very unlike you to leave me in that sort of way and lest you should be jealous of that halfhour when he was accompanying me said lord clonbrony i must remark that though i had his body with me i had none of his mind that he left at home with you ladies or with some fair one across the water for the deuce of two words did he bestow upon me with all his pretence of accompanying me lord colambre seems to have a fair chance of a pleasant breakfast said miss nugent smiling reproaches on all sides i have heard none on your side grace said lord clonbrony and thats the reason i suppose he wisely takes his seat beside you but come we will not badger you any more my dear boy we have given him as fine a complexion amongst us as if he had been out hunting these three hours have not we grace when colambre has been a season or two more in lonon hell not be so easily put out of countenance said lady clonbrony you dont see young men of fashion here blushing about nothing no nor about anything my dear said lord clonbrony but thats no proof they do nothing they ought to blush for what they do theres no occasion for ladies to inquire said lady clonbrony but this i know that its a great disadvantage to a young man of a certain rank to blush for no people who live in a certain set ever do and it is the most opposite thing possible to a certain air which i own i think colambre wants and now that he has done travelling in ireland which is no use in pint of giving a gentleman a travelled air or anything of that sort i hope he will put himself under my conduct for next winters campaign in town lord clonbrony looked as if he did not know how to look and after drumming on the table for some seconds said colambre i told you how it would be thats a fatal hard condition of yours not a hard condition i hope my dear father said lord colambre hard it must be since it cant be fulfilled or wont be fulfilled which comes to the same thing replied lord clonbrony sighing i am persuaded sir that it will be fulfilled said lord colambre i am persuaded that when my mother hears the truth and the whole truthwhen she finds that your happiness and the happiness of her whole family depend upon her yielding her taste on one subject oh i see now what you are about cried lady clonbrony you are coming round with your persuasions and prefaces to ask me to give up lonon and go back with you to ireland my lord you may save yourselves the trouble all of you for no earthly persuasions shall make me do it i will never give up my taste on that pint my happiness has a right to be as much considered as your fathers colambre or anybodys and in one word i wont do it cried she rising angrily from the breakfasttable there did not i tell you how it would be cried lord clonbrony my mother has not heard me yet said lord colambre laying his hand upon his mothers arm as she attempted to pass hear me madam for your own sake you do not know what will happen this very daythis very hour perhapsif you do not listen to me and what will happen said lady clonbrony stopping short ay indeed she little knows said lord clonbrony whats hanging over her head hanging over my head said lady clonbrony looking up nonsense what an execution madam said lord colambre gracious me an execution said lady clonbrony sitting down again but i heard you talk of an execution months ago my lord before my son went to ireland and it blew over i heard no more of it if wont blow over now said lord clonbrony youll hear more of it now sir terence ofay it was you may remember that settled it then well and cant he settle it now send for him since he understands these cases and i will ask him to dinner myself for your sake and be very civil to him my lord all your civility either for my sake or your own will not signify a straw my dear in this caseanything that poor terry could do hed do and welcome without it but he can do nothing nothingthats very extraordinary but im clear no one dare to bring a real execution against us in earnest and you are only trying to frighten me to your purpose like a child but it shant do very well my dear youll seetoo late a knock at the house door who is itwhat is it cried lord clonbrony growing very pale lord colambre changed colour too and ran downstairs dont let em let anybody in for your life colambre under any pretence cried lord clonbrony calling from the head of the stairs then running to the window by all thats good its mordicai himself and the people with him lean your head on me my dear aunt said miss nugent lady clonbrony leant back trembling and ready to faint but hes walking off now the rascal could not get insafe for the present cried lord clonbrony rubbing his hands and repeating safe for the present safe for the present repeated lord colambre coming again into the room safe for the present hour he could not get in i supposeoh i warned all the servants well said lord clonbrony and so did terry ay theres the rascal mordicai walking off at the end of the street i know his walk a mile off gad i can breathe again i am glad hes gone but he will come back and always lie in wait and some time or other when were off our guard unawares hell slide in slide in oh horrid cried lady clonbrony sitting up and wiping away the water which miss nugent had sprinkled on her face were you much alarmed said lord colambre with a voice of tenderness looking at his mother first but his eyes fixing on miss nugent shockingly said lady clonbrony i never thought it would reelly come to this it will really come to much more my dear said lord clonbrony that you may depend upon unless you prevent it lord what can i doi know nothing of business how should i lord clonbrony but i know theres colambrei was always told that when he was of age everything should be settled and why cant he settle it when hes upon the spot and upon one condition i will cried lord colambre at what loss to myself my dear mother i need not mention then i will mention it cried lord clonbrony at the loss it will be of nearly half the estate he would have had if we had not spent it loss oh i am excessively sorry my sons to be at such a lossit must not be it cannot be otherwise said lord clonbrony nor it cant be this way either my lady clonbrony unless you comply with his condition and consent to return to ireland i cannoti will not replied lady clonbrony is this your condition colambrei take it exceedingly ill of you i think it very unkind and unhandsome and ungenerous and undutiful of you colambre you my son she poured forth a torrent of reproaches then came to entreaties and tears but our hero prepared for this had steeled his mind and he stood resolved not to indulge his own feelings or to yield to caprice or persuasion but to do that which he knew was best for the happiness of hundreds of tenants who depended upon thembest for both his father and his mothers ultimate happiness and respectability its all in vain cried lord clonbrony i have no resource but one and i must condescend now to go to him this minute for mordicai will be back and seize alli must sign and leave all to garraghty well sign sign my lord and settle with garraghtycolambre ive heard all the complaints you brought over against that man my lord spent half the night telling them to me but all agents are bad i suppose at any rate i cant help itsign sign my lord he has moneyyes do go and settle with him my lord lord colambre and miss nugent at one and the same moment stopped lord clonbrony as he was quitting the room and then approached lady clonbrony with supplicating looks but she turned her head to the other side and as if putting away their entreaties made a repelling motion with both her hands and exclaimed no grace nugentno colambrenono colambre ill never hear of leaving lonontheres no living out of lononi cant i wont live out of lonon i say her son saw that the londonomania was now stronger than ever upon her but resolved to make one desperate appeal to her natural feelings which though smothered he could not believe were wholly extinguished he caught her repelling hands and pressing them with respectful tenderness to his lips oh my dear mother you once loved your son said he loved him better than anything in this world if one spark of affection for him remains hear him now and forgive him if he pass the boundsbounds he never passed before of filial duty mother in compliance with your wishes my father left irelandleft his home his duties his friends his natural connexions and for many years he has lived in england and you have spent many seasons in london yes in the very best companyin the very first circles said lady clonbrony cold as the highbred english are said to be in general to strangers yes replied lord colambre the very best company if you mean the most fashionable have accepted of our entertainments we have forced our way into their frozen circles we have been permitted to breathe in these elevated regions of fashion we have it to say that the duke of this and my lady that are of our acquaintance we may say more we may boast that we have vied with those whom we could never equal and at what expense have we done all this for a single season the last winter i will go no farther at the expense of a great part of your timber the growth of a centuryswallowed in the entertainments of one winter in london our hills to be bare for another half century to come but let the trees go i think more of your tenantsof those left under the tyranny of a bad agent at the expense of every comfort every hope they enjoyedtenants who were thriving and prosperous who used to smile upon you and to bless you both in one cottage i have seen here lord clonbrony unable to restrain his emotion hurried out of the room then i am sure it is not my fault said lady clonbrony for i brought my lord a large fortune and i am confident i have not after all spent more any season in the best company than he has among a set of low people in his muddling discreditable way and how has he been reduced to this said lord colambre did he not formerly live with gentlemen his equals in his own country his contemporaries men of the first station and character whom i met in dublin spoke of him in a manner that gratified the heart of his son he was respectable and respected at his own home but when he was forced away from that home deprived of his objects his occupations induced him to live in london or at wateringplaces where he could find no employments that were suitable to himset down late in life in the midst of strangers to him cold and reservedhimself too proud to bend to those who disdained him as an irishmanis he not more to be pitied than blamed foryes i his son must say the wordthe degradation which has ensued and do not the feelings which have this moment forced him to leave the room show that he is capableoh mother cried lord colambre throwing himself at lady clonbronys feet restore my father to himself should such feelings be wastedno give them again to expand in benevolent in kind useful actions give him again to his tenantry his duties his country his home return to that home yourself dear mother leave all the nonsense of high lifescorn the impertinence of these dictators of fashion by whom in return for all the pains we take to imitate to court themin return for the sacrifice of health fortune peace of mind they bestow sarcasm contempt ridicule and mimickry oh

the remembrance of your kindness still blessing you for favours long since conferred ever praying to see you once more believe me for i speak of what i knowyour son has heard these prayers has felt these blessings here at my heart felt and still feel them when i was not known to be your son in the cottage of the widow oneill oh did you see the widow oneill and does she remember me said lady clonbrony remember you and you miss nugent i have slept in the bedi would tell you more but i cannot well i never should have thought they would have remembered me so longpoor people said lady

see you once more among your natural friends beloved respected happy oh return let us return home cried miss nugent with a voice of great emotion return let us return home my beloved aunt speak to us say that you grant our request she kneeled beside lord colambre as she spoke is it possible to resist that voicethat look thought lord colambre if anybody knew said lady clonbrony if anybody could conceive how i detest the sight the thoughts of that old yellow damask furniture in the drawingroom at clonbrony castle good heavens cried lord colambre starting up and looking at his mother in stupefied astonishment is that what you are thinking of maam the yellow damask furniture said her niece smiling oh if thats all that shall never offend your eyes again aunt my painted velvet chairs are finished and trust the furnishing that room to me the legacy lately left me cannot be better applied you shall see how beautifully it will be furnished oh if i had money i should like to do it myself but it would take an immensity to new furnish clonbrony castle properly the furniture in this house said miss nugent looking round would do a great deal towards it i declare cried lady clonbrony that never struck me before grace i protestand what would not suit one might sell or exchange hereand it would be a great amusement to meand i should like to set the fashion of something better in that country and i declare now i should like to see those poor people and that widow oneill i do assure you i think i was happier at home only that one gets i dont know how a notion ones nobody out of lonon but after all theres many drawbacks in lononand many people are very impertinent ill allowand if theres a woman in the world i hate it is mrs darevilleand if i was leaving lonon i should not regret lady langdale neitherand lady st james is as cold as a stone colambre may well say frozen circlesthese sort of people are really very cold and have i do believe no hearts i dont verily think there is one of them would regret me morehey let me see dublinthe winter merrion squarenew furnishedand the summerclonbrony castle lord colambre and miss nugent waited in silence till her mind should have worked itself clear one great obstacle had been removed and now that the yellow damask had been taken out of her imagination they no longer despaired lord clonbrony put his head into the room what hopesany if not let me go he saw the doubting expression of lady clonbronys countenancehope in the face of his son and niece my dear dear lady clonbrony make us all happy by one word said he kissing her you never kissed me so since we left ireland before said lady clonbrony well since it must be so let us go said she did i ever see such joy said lord clonbrony clasping his hands i never expected such joy in my lifei must go and tell poor terry and off he ran and now since we are to go said lady clonbrony pray let us go immediately before the thing gets wind else i shall have mrs dareville and lady langdale and lady st james and all the world coming to condole with me just to satisfy their own curiosity and then miss pratt who hears everything that everybody says and more than they say will come and tell me how it is reported everywhere that we are ruined oh i never could bear to stay and hear all this ill tell you what ill doyou are to be of age the day after tomorrow colambrevery well there are some papers for me to signi must stay to put my name to them and that done that minute ill leave you and lord clonbrony to settle all the rest and ill get into my carriage with grace and go down to buxton again where you can come for me and take me up when youre all ready to go to irelandand we shall be so far on our way colambre what do you say to this thatif you like it madam said he giving one hasty glance at miss nugent and withdrawing his eyes it is the best possible arrangement so thought grace that is the best possible arrangement which takes us away if i like it said lady clonbrony to be sure i do or i should not propose it what is colambre thinking of i know grace at all events what you and i must think ofof having the furniture packed up and settling whats to go and whats to be exchanged and all that now my dear go and write a note directly to mr soho and bid him come himself immediately and well go and make out a catalogue this instant of what furniture i will have packed so with her head full of furniture lady clonbrony retired i go to my business colambre and i leave you to settle yours in peace in peacenever was our heros mind less at peace than at this moment the more his heart felt that it was painful the more his reason told him it was necessary that he should part from grace nugent to his union with her there was an obstacle which his prudence told him ought to be insurmountable yet he felt that during the few days he had been with her the few hours he had been near her he had with his utmost power over himself scarcely been master of his passion or capable of concealing it from its object it could not have been done but for her perfect simplicity and innocence but how could this be supposed on his part how could he venture to live with this charming girl how could he settle at home what resource his mind turned towards the army he thought that abroad and in active life he should lose all the painful recollections and drive from his heart all the resentments which could now be only a source of unavailing regret but his motherhis mother who had now yielded her own taste to his entreaties for the good of her familyshe expected him to return and live with her in ireland though not actually promised or specified he knew that she took it for granted that it was upon this hope this faith she consented he knew that she would be shocked at the bare idea of his going into the army there was one chanceour hero tried at this moment to think it the best possible chancethat miss nugent might marry mr salisbury and settle in england on this idea he relied as the only means of extricating him from difficulties it was necessary to turn his thoughts immediately to business to execute his promises to his father two great objects were now to be accomplishedthe payment of his fathers debts and the settlement of the irish agents accounts and in transacting this complicated business he derived considerable assistance from sir terence ofay and from sir arthur berryls solicitor mr edwards whilst acting for sir arthur on a former occasion lord colambre had gained the entire confidence of this solicitor who was a man of the first eminence mr edwards took the papers and lord clonbronys titledeeds home with him saying that he would give an answer the next morning he then waited upon lord colambre and informed him that he had just received a letter from sir arthur berryl who with the consent and desire of his lady requested that whatever money might be required by lord clonbrony should be immediately supplied on their account without waiting till lord colambre should be of age as the ready money might be of same convenience to him in accelerating the journey to ireland which sir arthur and lady berryl knew was his lordships object sir terence ofay now supplied mr edwards with accurate information as to the demands that were made upon lord clonbrony and of the respective characters of the creditors mr edwards undertook to settle with the fair claimants sir terence with the rogues so that by the advancement of ready money from the berryls and by the detection of false and exaggerated charges which sir terence made among the inferior class the debts were reduced nearly to one half of their former amount mordicai who had been foiled in his vile attempt to become sole creditor had however a demand of more than seven thousand pounds upon lord clonbrony which he had raised to this enormous sum in six or seven years by means well known to himself he stood the foremost in the list not from the greatness of the sum but from the danger of his adding to it the expenses of law sir terence undertook to pay the whole with five thousand pounds lord clonbrony thought it impossible the solicitor thought it improvident because he knew that upon a trial a much greater abatement would be allowed but lord colambre was determined from the present embarrassments of his own situation to leave nothing undone that could be accomplished immediately sir terence pleased with his commission immediately went to mordicai well sir terence said mordicai i hope you are come to pay me my hundred guineas for miss broadhurst is married well mister mordicai what then the ides of march are come but not gone stay if you plase mister mordicai till ladyday when it becomes due in the meantime i have a handful or rather an armful of banknotes for you from my lord colambre humph said mordicai hows that hell not be of age these three days dont matter for that he has sent me to look over your account and to hope that you will make some small abatement in the total harkee sir terence you think yourself very clever in things of this sort but youve mistaken your man i have an execution for the whole and ill be dd if all your cunning shall make me take up with part be easy mister mordicaiyou shant make me break your bones nor make me drop one actionable word against your high character for i know your clerk there with that long goosequill behind his ear would be ready evidence again me but i beg to know in one word whether you will take five thousand down and give lord clonbrony a discharge no mr terence nor six thousand nine hundred and ninetynine pounds my demand is l odd shillings if you have that money pay it if not i know how to get it and along with it complete revenge for all the insults i have received from that greenhorn his son paddy brady cried sir terence do you hear that remember that word revengemind i call you to witness what sir will you raise a rebellion among my workmen no mr mordicai no rebellion and i hope you wont cut the boys ears off for listening to a little of the brogueso listen my good lad now mr mordicai i offer you here before little goosequill l ready pennytake it or leave it take your money and leave your revenge or take your revenge and lose your money sir terence i value neither your threats nor your cunning good morning to you good morning to you mr mordicaibut not kindly mr edwards the solicitor has been at the office to take off the execution so now you may have law to your hearts content and it was only to plase the young lord that the ould one consented to my carrying this bundle to youshowing the banknotes mr edwards employed cried mordicai why how the devil did lord clonbrony get into such hands as his the execution taken off well sir go to law i am ready for you jack latitat is a match for your sober solicitor good morning again to you mr mordicai were fairly out of your clutches and we have enough to do with our money well sir terence i must allow you have a very wheedling wayhere mr thompson make out a receipt for lord clonbrony i never go to law with an old customer if i can help it this business settled mr soho was next to be dealt with he came at lady clonbronys summons and was taking directions with the utmost sang froid for packing up and sending off the very furniture for which he was not paid lord colambre called him into his fathers study and producing his bill he began to point out various articles which were charged at prices that were obviously extravagant why really my lord they are abundantly extravagant if i charged vulgar prices i should be only a vulgar tradesman i however am not a broker nor a jew of the article superintendence which is only l i cannot abate a dolt on the rest of the bill if you mean to offer ready i mean without any negotiation to abate thirty per cent and i hope that is a fair and gentlemanly offer mr soho there is your money my lord colambre i would give the contents of three such bills to be sure of such noblemanly conduct as yours lady clonbronys furniture shall be safely packed without costing her a farthing with the help of mr edwards the solicitor every other claim was soon settled and lord clonbrony for the first time since he left ireland found himself out of debt and out of danger old nicks account could not be settled in london lord colambre had detected numerous false charges and sundry impositions the land which had been purposely let to run wild so far from yielding any rent was made a source of constant expense as remaining still unset this was a large tract for which st dennis had at length offered a small rent upon a fair calculation of the profits of the ground and from other items in the account nicholas garraghty esq appeared at last to be not the creditor but the debtor to lord clonbrony he was dismissed with disgrace which perhaps he might not have felt if it had not been accompanied by pecuniary loss and followed by the fear of losing his other agencies and by the dread of immediate bankruptcy mr burke was appointed agent in his stead to the clonbrony as well as the colambre estate his appointment was announced to him by the following letter to mrs burke at colambre dear madam the traveller whom you so hospitably received some months ago was lord colambrehe now writes to you in his proper person he promised you that he would as far as it might be in his power do justice to mr burkes conduct and character by representing what he had done for lord clonbrony in the town of colambre and in the whole management of the tenantry and property under his care happily for my father my dear madam he is now as fully convinced as you could wish him to be of mr burkes merits and he begs me to express his sense of the obligations he is under to him and to you he entreats that you will pardon the impropriety of a letter which as i assured you the moment i saw it he never wrote or read this will he says cure him for life of putting his signature to any paper without reading it he hopes that you will forget that such a letter was ever received and that you will use your influence with mr burke to induce him to continue to our family his regard and valuable services lord clonbrony encloses a power of attorney enabling mr burke to act in future for him if mr burke will do him that favour in managing the clonbrony as well as the colambre estate lord clonbrony will be in ireland in the course of next month and intends to have the pleasure of soon paying his respects in person to mr burke at colambrei am dear madam your obliged guest and faithful servant colambre grosvenor square london lord colambre was so continually occupied with business during the two days previous to his coming of age every morning at his solicitors chambers every evening in his fathers study that miss nugent never saw him but at breakfast or dinner and though she watched for it most anxiously never could find an opportunity of speaking to him alone or of asking an explanation of the change and inconsistencies of his manner at last she began to think that in the midst of so much business of importance by which he seemed harassed she should do wrong to torment him by speaking of any small disquietude that concerned only herself she determined to suppress her doubts to keep her feelings to herself and to endeavour by constant kindness to regain that place in his affections which she imagined that she had lost everything will go right again thought she and we shall all be happy when he returns with us to irelandto that dear home which he loves as well as i do the day lord colambre was of age the first thing he did was to sign a bond for five thousand pounds miss nugents fortune which had been lent to his father who was her guardian this sir i believe said he giving it to his father as soon as signedthis i believe is the first debt you would wish to have secured well thought of my dear boy igod bless youthat has weighed more upon my conscience and heart than all the rest though i never said anything about it i used whenever i met mr salisbury to wish myself fairly down at the centre of the earth not that he ever thought of fortune im sure for he often told me and i believed him he would rather have miss nugent without a penny if he could get her than the first fortune in the empire but im glad she will not go to him penniless for all that and by my fault especially there theres my name to itdo witness it terry but colambre you must give it to heryou must take it to grace excuse me sir it is no gift of mineit is a debt of yours i beg you will take the bond to her yourself my dear father my dear son you must not always have your own way and hide everything good you do or give me the honour of it i wont be the jay in borrowed feathers i have borrowed enough in my life and ive done with borrowing now thanks to you colambreso come along with me for ill be hanged if ever i give this joint bond to miss nugent without you along with me leave lady clonbrony here to sign these papers terry will witness them properly and you come along with me and pray my lord said her ladyship order the carriage to the door for as soon as you have my signature i hope youll let me off to buxton oh certainlythe carriage is orderedeverything ready my dear and pray tell grace to be ready added lady clonbrony thats not necessary for she is always ready said lord clonbrony come colambre added he taking his son under the arm and carrying him up to miss nugents dressingroom they knocked and were admitted ready said lord clonbrony ay always readyso i said heres colambre my darling continued he has secured your fortune to you to my hearts content but he would not condescend to come up to tell you so till i made him heres the bond put your hand to it colambre you were ready enough to do that when it cost you something and now all i have to ask of you is to persuade her to marry out of hand that i may see her happy before i die now my hearts at ease i can meet mr salisbury with a safe conscience one kiss my little grace if anybody can persuade you im sure its that man thats now leaning against the mantelpiece its colambres will or your hearts not made like mineso i leave you and out of the room walked he leaving his poor son in as awkward embarrassing and painful a situation as could well be conceived half a dozen indistinct ideas crossed his mind quick conflicting feelings made his heart beat and stop and how it would have ended if he had been left to himself whether he would have stood or fallen have spoken or have continued silent can never now be known for all was decided without the action of his will he was awakened from his trance by these simple words from miss nugent im much obliged to you cousin colambremore obliged to you for your kindness in thinking of me first in the midst of all your other business than by your securing my fortune friendshipand your friendshipis worth more to me than fortune may i believe that is secured believe it oh grace can you doubt it i will not it would make me too unhappy i will not you need not that is enoughi am satisfiedi ask no farther explanation you are truth itselfone word from you is security sufficient we are friends for life said she taking his hand between both of hers are not we we areand therefore sit down cousin grace and let me claim the privilege of friendship and speak to you of him who aspires to be more than your friend for life mr mr salisbury said miss nugent i saw him yesterday we had a very long conversation i believe he understands my sentiments perfectly and that he no longer thinks of being more to me than a friend for life you have refused him yes i have a high opinion of mr salisburys understanding a great esteem for his character i like his manners and conversation but i do not love him and therefore you know i could not marry him but my dear miss nugent with a high opinion a great esteem and liking his manners and conversation in such a wellregulated mind as yours can there be a better foundation for love it is an excellent foundation said she but i never went any farther than the foundation and indeed i never wished to proceed any farther lord colambre scarcely dared to ask why but after some pause he said i dont wish to intrude upon your confidence you cannot intrude upon my confidence i am ready to give it to you entirely frankly i hesitated only because another person was concerned do you remember at my aunts gala a lady who danced with mr salisbury not in the least a lady with whom you and mr salisbury were talking just before supper in the turkish tent not in the least as we went down to supper you told me you had had a delightful conversation with herthat you thought her a charming woman a charming womani have not the slightest recollection of her and you told me that she and mr salisbury had been praising me a lenvie lune et lautre oh i recollect her now perfectly said lord colambre but what of her she is the woman who i hope will be mrs salisbury ever since i have been acquainted with them both i have seen that they were suited to each other and fancy indeed i am almost sure that she could love him tenderly love himand i know i could not but my own sentiments you may be sure are all i ever told mr salisbury but of your own sentiments you may not be sure said lord colambre and i see no reason why you should give him up from false generosity generosity interrupted miss nugent you totally misunderstand me there is no generosity nothing for me to give up in the case i did not refuse mr salisbury from generosity but because i did not love him perhaps my seeing this at first prevented me from thinking of him as a lover but from whatever cause i certainly never felt love for mr salisbury nor any of that pity which is said to lead to love perhaps added she smiling because i was aware that he would be so much better off after i refused himso much happier with one suited to him in age talents fortune and lovewhat bliss did he but know his bliss were his did he but know his bliss repeated lord colambre but is not he the best judge of his own bliss and am not i the best judge of mine said miss nugent i go no farther you are and i have no right to go farther yet this much permit me to say my dear grace that it would give me sincere pleasure that is real satisfaction to see you happilyestablished thank you my dear lord colambre but you spoke that like a man of seventy at least with the most solemn gravity of demeanour i meant to be serious not solemn said lord colambre endeavouring to change his tone there now said she in a playful tone you have seriously accomplished the task my good uncle set you so i will report well of you to him and certify that you did all that in you lay to exhort me to marry that you have even assured me that it would give you sincere pleasure that is real satisfaction to see me happily established oh grace if you knew how much i felt when i said that you would spare this raillery i will be seriousi am most seriously convinced of the sincerity of your affection for me i know my happiness is your object in all you have said and i thank you from my heart for the interest you take about me but really and truly i do not wish to marry this is not a mere commonplace speech but i have not yet seen any man i could love i like you cousin colambre better than mr salisburyi would rather live with you than with him you know that is a certain proof that i am not likely to be in love with him i am happy as i am especially now we are all going to dear ireland home to live together you cannot conceive with what pleasure i look forward to that lord colambre was not vain but love quickly sees love where it exists or foresees the probability the possibility of its existence he saw that miss nugent might love him tenderly passionately but that duty habit the prepossession that it was impossible she could marry her cousin colambrea prepossession instilled into her by his motherhad absolutely prevented her from ever yet thinking of him as a lover he saw the hazard for her he felt the danger for himself never had she appeared to him so attractive as at this moment when he felt the hope that he could obtain return of love but st omarwhy why is she a st omarillegitimateno st omar sans reproche my wife she cannot bei will not engage her affections swift as thoughts in moments of strong feeling pass in the mind without being put into words our hero thought all this and determined cost what it would to act honourably you spoke of my returning to ireland my dear grace i have not yet told you my plans plans are not you returning with us said she precipitately are not you going to irelandhomewith us noi am going to serve a campaign or two abroad i think every young man in these times good heavens what does this mean what can you mean cried she fixing her eyes upon his as if she would read his very soul why what reasonoh tell me the truth and at once his change of colourhis hand that trembled and withdrew from hersthe expression of his eyes as they met hersrevealed the truth to her at once as it flashed across her mind she started back her face grew crimson and in the same instant pale as death yesyou see you feel the truth now said lord colambre you see you feel that i love youpassionately oh let me not hear it said she i must notought not never till this moment did such a thought cross my mindi thought it impossibleoh make me think so still i willit is impossible that we can ever be united i always thought so said she taking breath with a deep sigh then why not live as we have lived i cannoti cannot answer for myselfi will not run the risk and therefore i must quit youknowing as i do that there is an invincible obstacle to our union of what nature i cannot explain i beg you not to inquire you need not beg iti shall not inquirei have no curiositynone said she in a passive dejected tone that is not what i am thinking of in the least i know there are invincible obstacles i wish it to be so but if invincible you who have so much sense honour and virtue i hope my dear cousin that i have honour and virtue but there are temptations to which no wise no good man will expose himself innocent creature you do not know the power of love i rejoice that you have always thought it impossiblethink so stillit will save you fromall i must endure think of me but as your cousin your friendgive your heart to some happier man as your friend your true friend i conjure you give your heart to some more fortunate man marry if you can feel lovemarry and be happy honour virtue yes i have both and i will not forfeit them yes i will merit your esteem and my ownby actions not words and i give you the strongest proof by tearing myself from you at this moment farewell the carriage at the door miss nugent and my lady calling for you said her maid heres your key maam and heres your gloves my dear maam the carriage at the door miss nugent said lady clonbronys woman coming eagerly with parcels in her hand as miss nugent passed her and ran downstairs and i dont know where i laid my ladys numbrella for my lifedo your anne no indeedbut i know heres my own young ladys watch that she has left bless me i never knew her to forget anything on a journey before then she is going to be married as sure as my names le maistre and to my lord colambre for he has been here this hour

cameit was turned into the youngest of the killpatricks and now here hes in miss nugents dressingroom to the last moment now in my opinion that am not censorious this does not look so pretty but according to my verdict he is only making a fool of miss nugent like the rest and his lordship seems too like what you might call a male cocket or a masculine jilt no more like a masculine jilt than yourself mrs le maistre cried anne taking fire and my young lady is not a lady to be made a fool of i promise you nor is my lord likely to make a fool of any woman bless us all thats no great praise for any young nobleman miss anne mrs le maistre mrs le maistre are you above cried a footman from the bottom of the stairs my ladys calling for you very well very well said sharp mrs le maistre very well and if she ismanners sircome up for one cant you and dont stand bawling at the bottom of the stairs as if one had no ears to be saved im coming as fast as i conveniently can mrs le maistre stood

afeard im late said mrs le maistre as she passed lord colambre who was standing motionless in the hall i beg a thousand pardons but i was hunting high and low for my ladys numbrella lord colambre did not hear or heed her his eyes were fixed and they never moved lord clonbrony was at the open carriagedoor kneeling on the step and receiving lady clonbronys more last words for mr soho the two waitingmaids stood together on the steps look at our young lord how he stands whispered mrs le maistre to anne the image of despair and she the picture of deathi dont know what to think nor i but dont stare if you can help it said anne get in get in mrs le maistre added she as lord clonbrony now rose from the step and made way for them ay in with youin with you mrs le maistre said lord clonbrony goodbye to you anne and take care of your young mistress at buxton let me see her blooming when we meet again i dont half like her looks and i never thought buxton agreed with her buxton never did

happy go on the carriage drove on i do believe colambres ill i never saw a man look so ill in my lifedid you graceas he did the minute we drove on he should take advice ive a mind cried lady clonbrony laying her hand on the cord to stop the coachmanive a mind to turn about tell him so and ask what is the matter with him better not said miss nugent he will write to you and tell youif anything is the

you so am i said mr salisbury i hope to be there before your ladyship will you honour me with any commandsof course i will see that everything is ready for your reception her ladyship had not any commands mr salisbury drove on rapidly lady clonbronys ideas had now taken the salisbury channel you didnt know that mr salisbury was going to buxton to meet you did you grace said lady clonbrony no indeed i did not said miss nugent and i am very sorry for it young ladies as mrs broadhurst says never know or at least never tell what they are sorry or glad for replied lady clonbrony at all events grace my love it has brought the fine bloom back to your cheeks and i own i am satisfied chapter xv gone for ever gone from me said lord colambre to himself as the carriage drove away never shall i see her morenever will i see her more till she is married lord colambre went to his own room locked the door and was relieved in some degree by the sense of privacy by the feeling that he could now indulge his reflections undisturbed he had consolationhe had done what was honourablehe had transgressed no duty abandoned no principlehe had not injured the happiness of any human beinghe had not to gratify himself hazarded the peace of the woman he lovedhe had not sought to win her heart of her innocent her warm susceptible heart he might perhaps have robbed herhe knew itbut he had left it untouched he hoped entire in her own power to bless with it hereafter some man worthy of her in the hope that she might be happy lord colambre felt relief and in the consciousness that he had made his parents happy he rejoiced but as soon as his mind turned that way for consolation came the bitter concomitant reflection that his mother must be disappointed in her hopes of his accompanying her home and of his living with her in ireland she would be miserable when she should hear that he was going abroad into the armyand yet it must be soand he must write and tell her so the sooner this difficulty is off my mind the sooner this painful letter is written the better thought he it must be donei will do it immediately he snatched up his pen and began a letter my dear mothermiss nugent he was interrupted by a knock at his door a gentleman below my lord said a servant who wishes to see you i cannot see any gentleman did you say i was at home no my lord i said you was not at home for i thought you would not choose to be at home and your own man was not in the way for me to askso i denied you but the gentleman would not be denied he said i must come and see if you was at home so as he spoke as if he was a gentleman not used to be denied i thought it might be somebody of consequence and i showed him into the front drawingroom i think he said he was sure youd be at home for a friend from ireland a friend from ireland why did not you tell me that sooner said lord colambre rising and running downstairs sir james brooke i daresay no not sir james brooke but one he was almost as glad to seecount ohalloran my dear count the greater pleasure for being unexpected i came to london but yesterday said the count but i could not be here a day without doing myself the honour of paying my respects to lord colambre you do me not only honour but pleasure my dear count people when they like one another always find each other out and contrive to meet even in london you are too polite to ask what brought such a superannuated militaire as i am said the count from his retirement into this gay world again a relation of mine who is one of our ministry knew that i had some maps and plans and charts which might be serviceable in an expedition they are planning i might have trusted my charts across the channel without coming myself to convoy them you will say but my relation fanciedyoung relations you know if they are good for anything are apt to overvalue the heads of old relationsfancied that mine was worth bringing all the way from halloran castle to london to consult with teteatete so you know when this was signified to me by a letter from the secretary in office private most confidential what could i do but do myself the honour to obey for though honours voice cannot provoke the silent dust yet flattery soothes the dull cold ear of agebut enough and too much of myself said the count tell me my dear lord something of yourself i do not think england seems to agree with you so well as ireland for excuse me in point of health you dont look like the same man i saw some weeks ago my mind has been ill at ease of late said lord colambre ay theres the thing the body pays for the mindbut those who have feeling minds pain and pleasure altogether computed have the advantage or at least they think so for they would not change with those who have them not were they to gain by the bargain the most robust body that the most selfish coxcomb or the heaviest dunce extant ever boasted for instance would you now my lord at this moment change altogether with major benson or captain williamson or even our friend eh really now pon honourwould youim glad to see you smile i thank you for making me smile for i assure you i want it i wishif you would not think me encroaching upon your politeness and kindness in honouring me with this visityou see continued he opening the doors of the back drawingroom and pointing to large packagesyou see we are all preparing for a march my mother has left town half an hour agomy father engaged to dine abroadonly i at homeand in this state of confusion could i even venture to ask count ohalloran to stay and dine with me without being able to offer him irish ortolans or irish plumsin short will you let me rob you of two or three hours of your time i am anxious to have your opinion on a subject of some importance to me and on one where you are peculiarly qualified to judge and decide for me my dear lord frankly i have nothing half so good or so agreeable to do with my time command my hours i have already told you how much it flatters me to be consulted by the most helpless clerk in office how much more about the private concerns of an enlightened youngfriend will lord colambre permit me to say i hope so for though the length of our acquaintance might not justify the word yet regard and intimacy are not always in proportion to the time people have known each other but to their mutual perception of certain attaching qualities a certain similarity and suitableness of character the good count seeing that lord colambre was in much distress of mind did all he could to soothe him by kindness far from making any difficulty about giving up a few hours of his time he seemed to have no other object in london and no purpose in life but to attend to our hero to put him at ease and to give him time to recover and arrange his thoughts the count talked of indifferent subjects i think i heard you mention the name of sir james brooke yes i expected to have seen him when the servant first mentioned a friend from ireland because sir james had told me that as soon as he could get leave of absence he would come to england he is come is now at his estate is huntingdonshire doing what do you think i will give you a leading hint recollect the seal which the little de cresey put into your hands the day you dined at oranmore faithful to his motto deeds not words he is this instant i believe at deeds titledeeds making out marriage settlements getting ready to put his seal to the happy articles happy man i give him joy said lord colambre happy man going to be married to such a womandaughter of such a mother daughter of such a mother that is indeed a great addition and a great security to his happiness said the count such a family to marry into good from generation to generation illustrious by character as well as by genealogy all the sons brave and all the daughters chastelord colambre with difficulty repressed his feelingsif i could choose i would rather that a woman i loved were of such a family than that she had for her dower the mines of peru so would i cried lord colambre i am glad to hear you say so my lord and with such energy so few young men of the present day look to what i call good connexion in marrying a man does not to be sure marry his wifes mother and yet a prudent man when he begins to think of the daughter would look sharp at the mother ay and back to the grandmother too and along the whole female line of ancestry truemost truehe ought he must and i have a notion said the count smiling your lordships practice has been conformable to your theory imine said lord colambre starling and looking at the count with surprise i beg your pardon said the count i did not intend to surprise your confidence but you forget that i was present and saw the impression which was made on your mind by a mothers want of a proper sense of delicacy and proprietylady dashfort oh lady dashfort she was quite out of my head and lady isabeli hope she is quite out of your heart she never was in it said lord colambre only laid siege to it said the count well i am glad your heart did not surrender at discretion or rather without discretion then i may tell you without fear or preface that the lady isabel who talks of refinement delicacy sense is going to stoop at once and marryheathcock lord colambre was not surprised but concerned and disgusted as he always felt even when he did not care for the individual from hearing anything which tended to lower the female sex in public estimation as to myself said he i cannot say i have had an escape for i dont think i ever was in much danger it is difficult to measure danger when it is overpast danger like past pain is soon forgotten said the old general at all events i rejoice in your present safety but is she really going to be married to heathcock said lord colambre positively they all came over in the same packet with me and they are all in town now buying jewels and equipages and horses heathcock you know is as good as another man a peu pres for all those purposes his father is dead and left him a large estate que voulez vous as the french valet said to me on the occasion cest que monsieur est un homme de bien il a des biens a ce quon dit lord colambre could not help smiling how they got heathcock to fall in love is what puzzles me said his lordship i should as soon have thought of an oysters falling in love as that being i own i should have sooner thought replied the count of his falling in love with an oyster and so would you if you had seen him as i did devouring oysters on shipboard say can the lovely heroine hope to viebr with a fat turtle or a venson piebr but that is not our affair let the lady isabel look to it dinner was announced and no farther conversation of any consequence passed between the count and lord colambre till the cloth was removed and the servants had withdrawn then our hero opened on the subject which was heavy at his heart my dear countto go back to the burial place of the nugents where my head was lost the first time i had the pleasure of seeing youyou know or possibly said he smiling you do not know that i have a cousin of the name of nugent you told me replied the count that you had near relations of that name but i do not recollect that you mentioned any one in particular i never named miss nugent to you no it is not easy to me to talk of her and impossible to me to describe her if you had come one halfhour sooner this morning you would have seen her i know she is exactly suited to your excellent taste but it is not at first sight she pleases most she gains upon the affections attaches the heart and unfolds upon the judgment in temper manners and good sense in every quality a man can or should desire in a wife i never saw her equal yet there is an obstacle an invincible obstacle the nature of which i cannot explain to you that forbids me to think of her as a wife she lives with my father and mother they are returning to ireland i wished earnestly wished on many accounts to have accompanied them chiefly on my mothers but it cannot be the first thing a man must do is to act honourably and that he may do so he must keep out of the way of a temptation which he believes to be above his strength i will never see miss nugent again till she is married i must either stay in england or go abroad i have a mind to serve a campaign or two if i could get a commission in a regiment going to spain but i understand so many are eager to go at this moment that it is very difficult to get a commission in such a regiment it is difficult said the count but added he after thinking for a moment i have it i can get the thing done for you and directly major benson in consequence of that affair you know about his mistress is forced to quit the regiment when the lieutenantcolonel came to quarters and the rest of the officers heard the fact they would not keep company with benson and would not mess with him i know he wants to sell out and that regiment is to be ordered immediately to spain i will have the thing done for you if you request it first give me your advice count ohalloran you are well acquainted with the military profession with military life would you advise mei wont speak of myself because we judge better by general views than by particular caseswould you advise a young man at present to go into the army the count was silent for a few minutes and then replied since you seriously ask my opinion my lord i must lay aside my own prepossessions and endeavour to speak with impartiality to go into the army in these days my lord is in my sober opinion the most absurd and base or the wisest and noblest thing a young man can do to enter into the army with the hope of escaping from the application necessary to acquire knowledge letters and sciencei run no risk my lord in saying this to youto go into the army with the hope of escaping from knowledge letters science and morality to wear a red coat and an epaulette to be called captain to figure at a ball to lounge away time in country sports at country quarters was never even in times of peace creditable but it is now absurd and base submitting to a certain portion of ennui and contempt this mode of life for an officer was formerly practicablebut now cannot be submitted to without utter irremediable disgrace officers are now in general men of education and information want of knowledge sense manners must consequently be immediately detected ridiculed and despised in a military man of this we have not long since seen lamentable examples in the raw officers who have lately disgraced themselves in my neighbourhood in irelandthat major benson and captain williamson but i will not advert to such insignificant individuals such are rare exceptionsi leave them out of the questioni reason on general principles the life of an officer is not now a life of parade of coxcombical or of profligate idlenessbut of active service of continual hardship and danger all the descriptions which we see in ancient history of a soldiers lifedescriptions which in times of peace appeared like romanceare now realised military exploits fill every days newspapers every days conversation a martial spirit is now essential to the liberty and the existence of our own country in the present state of things the military must be the most honourable profession because the most useful every movement of an army is followed wherever it goes by the public hopes and fears every officer must now feel besides this sense of collective importance a belief that his only dependence must be on his own merit and thus his ambition his enthusiasm are raised and when once this noble ardour is kindled in the breast it excites to exertion and supports under endurance but i forget myself said the count checking his enthusiasm i promised to speak soberly if i have said too much your own good sense my lord will correct me and your goodnature will forgive the prolixity of an old man touched upon his favourite subjectthe passion of his youth lord colambre of course assured the count that he was not tired indeed the enthusiasm with which this old officer spoke of his profession and the high point of view in which he placed it increased our heros desire to serve a campaign abroad good sense politeness and experience of the world preserved count ohalloran from that foible with which old officers are commonly reproached of talking continually of their own military exploits though retired from the world he had contrived by reading the best books and corresponding with persons of good information to keep up with the current of modern affairs and he seldom spoke of those in which he had been formerly engaged he rather too studiously avoided speaking of himself and this fear of egotism diminished the peculiar interest he might have inspired it disappointed curiosity and deprived those with whom he conversed of many entertaining and instructive anecdotes however he sometimes made exceptions to his general rule in favour of persons who peculiarly pleased him and lord colambre was of this number he this evening for the first time spoke to his lordship of the years he had spent in the austrian service told him anecdotes of the emperor spoke of many distinguished public characters whom he had known abroad of those officers who had been his friends and companions among others he mentioned with particular regard a young english officer who had been at the same time with him in the austrian service a gentleman of the name of reynolds the name struck lord colambre it was the name of the officer who had been the cause of the disgrace of miss st omarof miss nugents mother but there are so many reynoldses he eagerly asked the agethe character of this officer he was a gallant youth said the count but too adventuroustoo rash he fell after distinguishing himself in a glorious manner in his twentieth yeardied in my arms married or unmarried cried lord colambre marriedhe had been privately married less than a year before his death to a very young english lady who had been educated at a convent in vienna he was heir to a considerable property i believe and the young lady had little fortune and the affair was kept secret from the fear of offending his friends or for some other reasoni do not recollect the particulars did he acknowledge his marriage said lord colambre never till he was dyingthen he confided his secret to me do you recollect the name of the young lady he married yesmiss st omar st omar repeated lord colambre with an expression of lively joy in his countenance but are you certain my dear count that she was really married legally married to mr reynolds her marriage has been denied by all his friends and relationshers have never been able to establish ither daughter ismy dear count were you present at the marriage no said the count i was not present at the marriage i never saw the lady nor do i know anything of the affair except that mr reynolds when he was dying assured me that he was privately married to a miss st omar who was then boarding at a convent in vienna the young man expressed great regret at leaving her totally unprovided for but said that he trusted his father would acknowledge her and that her friends would be reconciled to her he was not of age he said to make a will but i think he told me that his child who at that time was not born would even if it should be a girl inherit a considerable property with this i cannot however charge my memory positively but he put a packet into my hands which he told me contained a certificate of his marriage and i think he said a letter to his father this he requested that i would transmit to england by some safe hand immediately after his death i went to the english ambassador who was then leaving vienna and delivered the packet into his hands he promised to have it safely delivered i was obliged to go the next day with the troops to a distant part of the country when i returned i inquired at the convent what had become of miss st omari should say mrs reynolds and i was told that she had removed from the convent to private lodgings in the town some time previous to the birth of her child the abbess seemed much scandalised by the whole transaction and i remember i relieved her mind by assuring her that there had been a regular marriage for poor young reynoldss sake i made farther inquiries about the widow intending of course to act as a friend if she was in any difficulty or distress but i found on inquiry at her lodgings that her brother had come from england for her and had carried her and her infant away the active scenes continued the count in which i was immediately afterwards engaged drove the whole affair from my mind now that your questions have recalled them i feel certain of the facts i have mentioned and i am ready to establish them by my testimony lord colambre thanked him with an eagerness that showed how much he was interested in the event it was clear he said either that the packet left with the ambassador had not been delivered or that the father of mr reynolds had suppressed the certificate of the marriage as it had never been acknowledged by him or by any of the family lord colambre now frankly told the count why he was so anxious about this affair and count ohalloran with all the warmth of youth and with all the ardent generosity characteristic of his country entered into his feelings declaring that he would never rest till he had established the truth unfortunately said the count the ambassador who took the packet in charge is dead i am afraid we shall have difficulty but he must have had some secretary said lord colambre who was his secretarywe can apply to him his secretary is now charge daffaires in viennawe cannot get at him into whose hands have that ambassadors papers fallenwho is his executor said lord colambre his executornow you have it cried the count his executor is the very man who will do your businessyour friend sir james brooke is the executor all papers of course are in his hands or he can have access to any that are in the hands of the family the family seat is within a few miles of sir james brookes in huntingdonshire where as i told you before he now is ill go to him immediatelyset out in the mail this night just in time cried lord colambre pulling out his watch with one hand and ringing the bell with the other run and take a place for me in the mail for huntingdon go directly said lord colambre to the servant and take two places if you please sir said the count my lord i will accompany you but this lord colambre would not permit as it would be unnecessary to fatigue the good old general and a letter from him to sir james brooke would do all that the count could effect by his presence the search for the papers would be made by sir james and if the packet could be recovered or if any memorandum or mode of ascertaining that it had actually been delivered to old reynolds could be discovered lord colambre said he would then call upon the count for his assistance and trouble him to identify the packet or to go with him to mr reynolds to make farther inquiries and to certify at all events the young mans dying acknowledgment of his marriage and of his child the place in the mail just in time was taken lord colambre sent a servant in search of his father with a note explaining the necessity of his sudden departure all the business which remained to be done in town he knew lord clonbrony could accomplish without his assistance then he wrote a few lines to his mother on the very sheet of paper on which a few hours before he had sorrowfully and slowly begun my dear mother miss nugent he now joyfully and rapidly went onmy dear mother and miss nugent i hope to be with you on wednesday sennight but if unforeseen circumstances should delay me i will certainly write to you againdear mother believe me your obliged and grateful son colambre the count in the meantime wrote a letter for him to sir james brooke describing the packet which he had given to the ambassador and relating all the circumstances that could lead to its recovery lord colambre almost before the wax was hard seized possession of the letter the count seeming almost as eager to hurry him off as he was to set out he thanked the count with few words but with strong feeling joy and love returned in full tide upon our heros soul all the military ideas which but an hour before filled his imagination were put to flight spain vanished and green ireland reappeared just as they shook hands at parting the good old general with a smile said to him i believe i had better not stir in the matter of bensons commission till i hear more from you my harangue in favour of the military profession will i fancy prove like most other harangues en pure perte chapter xvi in what words of polite circumlocution or of cautious diplomacy shall we say or hint that the deceased ambassadors papers were found in shameful disorder his excellencys executor sir james brooke however was indefatigable in his researches he and lord colambre spent two whole days in looking over portfolios of letters and memorials and manifestoes and bundles of paper of the most heterogeneous sorts some of them without any docket or direction to lead to a knowledge of their contents others written upon in such a manner as to give an erroneous notion of their nature so that it was necessary to untie every paper separately at last when they had opened as they thought every paper and wearied and in despair were just on the point of giving up the search lord colambre spied a bundle of old newspapers at the bottom of a trunk they are only old vienna gazettes i looked at them said sir james lord colambre upon this assurance was going to throw them into the trunk again but observing that the bundle had not been untied he opened it and withinside of the newspapers he found a rough copy of the ambassadors journal and with it the packet directed to ralph reynolds sen esq old court suffolk per favour of his excellency earl a note on the cover signed ohalloran stating when received by him and the date of the day when delivered to the ambassadorseals unbroken our hero was in such a transport of joy at the sight of this packet and his friend sir james brooke so full of his congratulations that they forgot to curse the ambassadors carelessness which had been the cause of so much evil the next thing to be done was to deliver the packet to ralph reynolds old court suffolk but when lord colambre arrived at old court suffolk he found all the gates locked and no admittance to be had at last an old woman came out of the porters lodge who said mr reynolds was not there and she could not say where he was after our hero had opened her heart by the present of half a guinea she explained that she could not justly say where he was because that he never let anybody of his own people know where he was any day he had several different houses and places in different parts and faroff counties and other shires as she heard and by times he was at one and by times at another the names of two of the places toddrington and little wrestham she knew but there were others to which she could give no direction he had houses in odd parts of london too that he let and sometimes when the lodgers time was out he would go and be never heard of for a month maybe in one of them in short there was no telling or saying where he was or would be one day of the week by where he had been the last when lord colambre expressed some surprise that an old gentleman as he conceived mr ralph reynolds to be should change places so frequently the old woman answered that though her master was a deal on the wrong side of seventy and though to look at him youd think he was glued to his chair and would fall to pieces if he should stir out of it yet was as alert and thought no more of going about than if he was as young as the gentleman who was now speaking to her it was old mr reynoldss delight to come down and surprise his people at his different places and see that they were keeping all tight what sort of a man is heis he a miser said lord colambre he is a miser and he is not a miser said the woman now hed think as much of the waste of a penny as another man would of a hundred pounds and yet he would give a hundred pounds easier than another would give a penny when hes in the humour but his humour is very odd and theres no knowing where to have him hes grossgrained and more positiverlike than a mule and his deafness made him worse in this because he never heard what nobody said but would say on his own wayhe was very odd but not crackedno he was as clearheaded when he took a thing the right way as any man could be and as clever and could talk as well as any member of parliamentand goodnatured and kindhearted where he would take a fancybut then maybe it would be to a dog he was remarkable fond of dogs or a cat or a rat even that he would take a fancy and think more of em than he would of a christian but poor gentleman theres great allowance said she to be made for him that lost his son and heirthat would have been heir to all and a fine youth that he doted upon but continued the old woman in whose mind the transitions from great to little from serious to trivial were ludicrously abrupt that was no reason why the old gentleman should scold me last time he was here as he did for as long as ever he could stand over me only because i killed a mouse who was eating my cheese and before night he beat a boy for stealing a piece of that same cheese and he would never when down here let me set a mousetrap well my good woman interrupted lord colambre who was little interested in this affair of the mousetrap and nowise curious to learn more of mr reynoldss domestic economy ill not trouble you any farther if you can be so good as to tell me the road to toddrington or to little wickham i think you call it little wickham repeated the woman laughing bless you sir where do you come fromits little wrestham surely everybody knows near lantry and keep the pike till you come to the turn at rotherford and then you strike off into the byroad to the left and then again turn at the ford to the right but if you are going to toddrington you dont go the road to market which is at the first turn to the left and the crosscountry road where theres no quarter and toddrington liesbut for wrestham you take the road to market it was some time before our hero could persuade the old woman to stick to little wrestham or to toddrington and not to mix the directions for the different roads togetherhe took patience for his impatience only confused his director the more in process of time he made out and wrote down the various turns that he was to follow to reach little wrestham but no human power could get her from little wrestham to toddrington though she knew the road perfectly well but she had for the seventeen last years been used to go the other road and all the carriers went that way and passed the door and that was all she could certify little wrestham after turning to the left and right as often as his directory required our hero happily reached but unhappily he found no mr reynolds there only a steward who gave nearly the same account of his master as had been given by the old woman and could not guess even where the gentleman might now be toddrington was as likely as any placebut he could not say perseverance against fortune to toddrington our hero proceeded through crosscountry roadssuch roadsvery different from the irish roads waggon ruts into which the carriage wheels sunk nearly to the naveand from time to time sloughs of despond through which it seemed impossible to drag walk wade or swim and all the time with a sulky postillion oh how unlike my larry thought lord colambre at length in a very narrow lane going up a hill said to be two miles of ascent they overtook a heavy laden waggon and they were obliged to go step by step behind it whilst enjoying the gentlemans impatience much and the postillions sulkiness more the waggoner in his embroidered frock walked in state with his long sceptre in his hand the postillion muttered curses not loud but deep deep or loud no purpose would they have answered the waggoners temper was proof against curse in or out of the english language and from their snails pace neither dickens nor devil nor any postillion in england could make him put his horses lord colambre jumped out of the chaise and walking beside him began to talk to him and spoke of his horses their bells their trappings the beauty and strength of the thillhorsethe value of the whole team which his lordship happening to guess right within ten pounds and showing moreover some skill about roadmaking and waggonwheels and being fortunately of the waggoners own opinion in the great question about conical and cylindrical rims he was pleased with the young chap of a gentleman and in spite of the chuffiness of his appearance and churlishness of his speech this waggoners bosom being made of penetrating stuff he determined to let the gentleman pass accordingly when halfway up the hill and the head of the forehorse came near an open gate the waggoner without saying one word or turning his head touched the horse with his long whipand the horse turned in at the gate and then came dobbinjeho and strange calls and sounds which all the other horses of the team obeyed and the waggon turned into the farmyard now master while i turn you may pass the covering of the waggon caught in the hedge as the waggon turned in and as the sacking was drawn back some of the packages were disturbeda cheese was just rolling off on the side next lord colambre he stopped it from falling the direction caught his quick eyeto ralph reynolds esqtoddrington scratched out red lion square london written in another hand below now i have found him and surely i know that hand said lord colambre to himself looking more closely at the direction the original direction was certainly in a handwriting well known to him it was lady dashforts that there cheese that youre looking at so curously said the waggoner has been a great traveller for it came all the way down from lonon and now its going all the way up again back on account of not finding the gentleman at home and the man that booked it told me as how it came from foreign parts lord colambre took down the direction tossed the honest waggoner a guinea wished him goodnight passed and went on as soon as he could he turned into the london roadat the first town got a place in the mailreached londonsaw his fatherwent directly to his friend count ohalloran who was delighted when he beheld the packet lord colambre was extremely eager to go immediately to old reynolds fatigued as he was for he had travelled night and day and had scarcely allowed himself mind or body one moments repose heroes must sleep and lovers too or they soon will cease to be heroes or lovers said the count rest rest perturbed spirit this night and tomorrow morning well finish the adventure in red lion square or i will accompany you when and where you will if necessary to earths remotest bounds the next morning lord colambre went to breakfast with the count the count who was not in love was not up for our hero was half an hour earlier than the time appointed the old servant ulick who had attended his master to england was very glad to see lord colambre again and showing him into the breakfast parlour could not help saying in defence of his masters punctuality your clocks i suppose my lord are half an hour faster than ours my master will be ready to the moment the count soon appearedbreakfast was soon over and the carriage at the door for the count sympathised in his young friends impatience as they were setting out the counts large irish dog pushed out of the house door to follow them and his master would have forbidden him but lord colambre begged that he might be permitted to accompany them for his lordship recollected the old womans having mentioned that mr reynolds was fond of dogs they arrived in red lion square found the house of mr reynolds and contrary to the counts prognostics found the old gentleman up and they saw him in his red nightcap at his parlour window after some minutes running backwards and forwards of a boy in the passage and two or three peeps taken over the blinds by the old gentleman they were admitted the boy could not master their names so they were obliged reciprocally to announce themselvescount ohalloran and lord colambre the names seemed to make no impression on the old gentleman but he deliberately looked at the count and his lordship as if studying what rather than who they were in spite of the red nightcap and a flowered dressinggown mr reynolds looked like a gentleman an odd gentlemanbut still a gentleman as count ohalloran came into the room and as his large dog attempted to follow the counts voice expressed say shall i let him in or shut the door oh let him in by all means sir if you please i am fond of dogs and a finer one i never saw pray gentlemen be seated said hea portion of the complacency inspired by the sight of the dog diffusing itself over his manner towards the master of so fine an animal and even extending to the masters companion though in an inferior degree whilst mr reynolds stroked the dog the count told him that the dog was of a curious breed now almost extinctthe irish greyhound of which only one nobleman in ireland it is said has now a few of the species remaining in his possessionnow lie down hannibal said the count mr reynolds we have taken the liberty though strangers of waiting upon you i beg your pardon sir interrupted mr reynolds but did i understand you rightly that a few of the same species are still to be had from one nobleman in ireland pray what is his name said he taking out his pencil the count wrote the name for him but observed that he had asserted only that a few of these dogs remained in the possession of that nobleman he could not answer for it that they were to be had oh i have ways and means said old reynolds and rapping his snuffbox and talking as it was his custom loud to himself lady dashfort knows all those irish lords she shall get one for meay ay count ohalloran replied as if the words had been addressed to him lady dashfort is in england i know it sir she is in london said mr reynolds hastily what do you know of her i know sir that she is not likely to return to ireland and that i am and so is my young friend here and if the thing can be accomplished we will get it done for you lord colambre joined in this promise and added that if the dog could be obtained he would undertake to have him safely sent over to england sirgentlemen im much obliged that is when you have done the thing i shall be much obliged but maybe you are only making me civil speeches of that sir said the count smiling with much temper your own sagacity and knowledge of the world must enable you to judge for my own part i can only say cried lord colambre that i am not in the habit of being reproached with saying one thing and meaning another hot i see said old reynolds nodding as he looked at lord colambre cool added he nodding at the count but a time for everything i was hot onceboth answers good for their ages this speech lord colombre and the count tacitly agreed to consider as another apart which they were not to hear or seem to hear the count began again on the business of their visit as he saw that lord colambre was boiling with impatience and feared that he should boil over and spoil all the count commenced with mr reynolds your name sounds to me like the name of a friend for i had once a friend of that name i had once the pleasure and a very great pleasure it was to me to be intimately acquainted abroad on the continent with a very amiable and gallant youthyour son take care sir said the old man starting up from his chair and instantly sinking down againtake care dont mention him to meunless you would strike me dead on the spot the convulsed motions of his fingers and face worked for some moments whilst the count and lord colambre much shocked and alarmed stood in silence the convulsed motions ceased and the old man unbuttoned his waistcoat as if to relieve some sense of expression uncovered his gray hairs and after leaning back to rest himself with his eyes fixed and in reverie for a few moments he sat upright again in his chair and exclaimed as he looked round sondid not somebody say that word who is so cruel to say that word before me nobody has ever spoken of him to mebut once since his death do you know sir said he fixing his eyes on count ohalloran and laying his cold hand on him do you know where he was buried i ask you sir do you remember how he died too well too well cried the count so much affected as to be scarcely able to pronounce the words he died in my arms i buried him myself impossible cried mr reynolds why do you say so sir said he studying the counts face with a sort of bewildered earnestness impossible his body was sent over to me in a lead coffin and i saw it and i was askedand i answered in the family vault but the shock is over said he and gentlemen if the business of your visit relates to that subject i trust i am now sufficiently composed to attend to you indeed i ought to be prepared for i had reason for years to expect the stroke and yet when it came it seemed suddenit stunned meput an end to all my worldly prospectsleft me childless without a single descendant or relation near enough to be dear to me i am an insulated being no sir you are not an insulated being said lord colambre you have a near relation who will who must be dear to you who will make you amends for all you have lost all you have sufferedwho will bring peace and joy to your heart you have a granddaughter no sir i have no granddaughter said old reynolds his face and whole form becoming rigid with the expression of obstinacy rather have no descendant than be forced to acknowledge an illegitimate child my lord i entreat as a friendi command you to be patient said the count who saw lord colambres indignation suddenly rise so then this is the purpose of your visit continued old reynolds and you come from my enemies from the st omars and you are in a league with them continued old reynolds and all this time it is of my eldest son you have been talking yes sir replied the count of captain reynolds who fell in battle in the austrian service about nineteen years agoa more gallant and amiable youth never lived pleasure revived through the dull look of obstinacy in the fathers eyes he was as you say sir a gallant an amiable youth once and he was my pride and i loved him too once but did not you know i had another no sir we did notwe are you may perceive totally ignorant of your family and of your affairs we have no connexion whatever or knowledge of any of the st omars i detest the sound of the name cried lord colambre oh good goodwell well i beg your pardon gentlemen a thousand timesi am a hasty very hasty old man but i have been harassed persecuted hunted by wretches who got a scent of my gold often in my rage i longed to throw my treasurebags to my pursuers and bid them leave me to die in peace you have feelings i see both of you gentlemen excuse me and bear with my temper bear with you much enforced the best tempers will emit a hasty spark said the count looking at lord colambre who was now cool again and who with a countenance full of compassion sat with his eyes fixed upon the poorno not the poor but the unhappy old man yes i had another son continued mr reynolds and on him all my affections concentrated when i lost my eldest and for him i desired to preserve the estate which his mother brought into my family since you know nothing of my affairs let me explain to you that estate was so settled that it would have gone to the child even the daughter of my eldest son if there had been a legitimate child but i knew there was no marriage and i held out firm to my opinion if there was a marriage said i show me the marriage certificate and i will acknowledge the marriage and acknowledge the child but they could not and i knew they could not and i kept the estate for my darling boy cried the old gentleman with the exultation of successful positiveness again appearing strong in his physiognomy but suddenly changing and relaxing his countenance fell and he added but now i have no darling boy what use allall must go to the heiratlaw or i must will it to a strangera lady of quality who has just found out she is my relationgod knows howim no genealogistand sends me irish cheese and iceland moss for my breakfast and her waitinggentlewoman to nambypamby me oh im sick of it allsee through itwish i was blindwish i had a hidingplace where flatterers could not find mepursued chasedmust change my lodgings again tomorrowwill willi beg your pardon gentlemen again you were going to tell me sir something more of my eldest son and how i was led away from the subject i dont know but i meant only to have assured you that his memory was dear to me till i was so tormented about that unfortunate affair of his pretended marriage that at length i hated to hear him named but the heiratlaw at last will triumph over me no my good sir not if you triumph over yourself and do justice cried lord colambre if you listen to the truth which my friend will tell you and if you will read and believe the confirmation of it under your sons own hand in this packet his own hand indeed his seal unbroken but howwhen wherewhy was it kept so long and how came it into your hands count ohalloran told mr reynolds that the packet had been given to him by captain reynolds on his deathbed related the dying acknowledgment which captain reynolds had made of his marriage and gave an account of the delivery of the packet to the ambassador who had promised to transmit it faithfully lord colambre told the manner in which it had been mislaid and at last recovered from among the deceased ambassadors papers the father still gazed at the direction and reexamined the seals my sons handwritingmy sons seals but where is the certificate of the marriage repeated he if it is withinside of this packet i have done great in but i am convinced it never was a marriage yet i wish now it could be provedonly in that case i have for years done great wont you open the packet sir said lord colambre mr reynolds looked up at him with a look that said i dont clearly know what interest you have in all this but unable to speak and his hands trembling so that he could scarcely break the seals he tore off the cover laid the papers before him sat down and took breath lord colambre however impatient had now too much humanity to hurry the old gentleman he only ran for the spectacles which he espied on the chimneypiece rubbed them bright and held them ready mr reynolds stretched his hand out for them put them on and the first paper he opened was the certificate of the marriage he read it aloud and putting it down said now i acknowledge the marriage i always said if there is a marriage there must be a certificate and you see now there is a certificate i acknowledge the marriage and now cried lord colambre i am happy positively happy acknowledge your granddaughter siracknowledge miss nugent acknowledge who sir acknowledge miss reynoldsyour granddaughter i ask no moredo what you will with your fortune oh now i understandi begin to understand this young gentleman is in lovebut where is my granddaughterhow shall i know she is my granddaughter i have not heard of her since she was an infanti forgot her existencei have done her great injustice she knows nothing of it sir said lord colambre who now entered into a full explanation of miss nugents history and of her connexion with his family and of his own attachment to her concluding the whole by assuring mr reynolds that his granddaughter had every virtue under heaven and as to your fortune sir i know that she will as i do say no matter what she will say interrupted old reynolds where is she when i see her i shall hear what she says tell me where she is let me see her i long to see whether there is any likeness to her poor father where is she let me see her immediately she is one hundred and sixty miles off sir at buxton well my lord and what is a hundred and sixty miles i suppose you think i cant stir from my chair but you are mistaken i think nothing of a journey of a hundred and sixty milesim ready to set off tomorrowthis instant lord colambre said that he was sure miss reynolds would obey her grandfathers slightest summons as it was her duty to do and would be with him as soon as possible if this would be more agreeable to him i will write to her instantly said his lordship if you will commission me no my lord i do not commissioni will goi think nothing i say of a journey of a hundred and sixty milesill goand set out tomorrow morning lord colambre and the count perfectly satisfied with the result of their visit now thought it best to leave old reynolds at liberty to rest himself after so many strong and varied feelings they paid their parting compliments settled the time for the next days journey and were just going to quit the room when lord colambre heard in the passage a wellknown voice the voice of mrs petito oh no my compliments and my lady dashforts best compliments and i will call again no no cried old reynolds pulling his bell ill have no calling againill be hanged if i do let her in now and ill see herjack let in that woman now or never the ladys gone sir out of the street door after her thennow or never tell her sir she was in a hackney coach old reynolds jumped up and went to the window himself and seeing the hackney coachman just turning beckoned at the window and mrs petito was set down again and ushered in by jack who announced her as the lady sir the only lady he had seen in that house my dear mr reynolds im so obliged to you for letting me in cried mrs petito adjusting her shawl in the passage and speaking in a voice and manner well mimicked after her betters you are so very good and kind and i am so much obliged to you you are not obliged to me and i am neither good nor kind said old reynolds you strange man said mrs petito advancing graceful in shawl drapery but she stopped short my lord colambre and count ohalloran as i hope to be saved i did not know mrs petito was an acquaintance of yours gentlemen said mr reynolds smiling shrewdly count ohalloran was too polite to deny his acquaintance with a lady who challenged it by thus naming him but he had not the slightest recollection of her though it seems he had met her on the stairs when he visited lady dashfort at killpatrickstown lord colambre was indeed undeniably an old aquaintance and as soon as she had recovered from her first natural start and vulgar exclamation she with very easy familiarity hoped my lady clonbrony and my lord and miss nugent and all her friends in the family were well and said she did not know whether she was to congratulate his lordship or not upon miss broadhurst my lady berryls marriage but she should soon have to hope for his lordships congratulations for another marriage in her present familylady isabel to colonel heathcock who has come in for a large portion and they are buying the wedding clothessights of clothesand the dimonds this day and lady dashfort and my lady isabel sent me especially sir to you mr reynolds and to tell you sir before anybody else and to hope the cheese come safe up again at last and to ask whether the iceland moss agrees with your chocolate and is palatable its the most diluent thing upon the universal earth and the most tonic and fashionablethe dutches of torcaster takes it always for breakfast and lady st james too is quite a convert and i hear the duke of vtakes it too and the devil may take it too for anything that i care said old reynolds oh my dear dear sir you are so refractory a patient i am no patient at all maam and have no patience either i am as well as you are or my lady dashfort either and hope god willing long to continue so mrs petito smiled aside at lord colambre to mark her perception of the mans strangeness then in a cajoling voice addressing herself to the old gentleman long long i hope to continue so if heaven grants my daily and nightly prayers and my lady dashforts also so mr reynolds if the ladies prayers are of any avail you ought to be purely and i suppose ladies prayers have the precedency in efficacy but it was not of prayers and deathbed affairs i came commissioned to treatnot of burials which heaven above forbid but of weddings my diplomacy was to speak and to premise my lady dashfort would have come herself in her carriage but is hurried out of her senses and my lady isabel could not in proper modesty so they sent me as their double to hope you my dear mr reynolds who is one of the family relations will honour the wedding with your presence it would be no honour and they know that as well as i do said the intractable mr reynolds it will be no advantage either but that they do not know as well as i do mrs petito to save you and your lady all trouble about me in future please to let my lady dashfort know that i have just received and read the certificate of my son captain reynoldss marriage with miss st omar i have acknowledged the marriage better late than never and tomorrow morning god willing shall set out with this young nobleman for buxton where i hope to see and intend publicly to acknowledge my granddaughterprovided she will acknowledge me crimini exclaimed mrs petito what new turns are here well sir i shall tell my lady of the metamorphoses that have taken place though by what magic as i have not the honour to deal in the black art i cant guess but since it seems annoying and inopportune i shall take my finale and shall thus have a verbal ppcas you are leaving town it seems for buxton so early in the morning my lord colambre if i see rightly into a millstone as i hope and believe i do on the present occasion i have to congratulate your lordship havent i upon something like a succession or a windfall in this denewment and i beg youll make my humble respects acceptable to the cidevant miss grace nugent that was and i wont derrogate her by any other name in the interregnum as i am persuaded it will only be a temporary name scarce worth assuming except for the honour of the public adoption and that will im confident be soon exchanged for a viscounts title or i have no sagacity nor sympathy i hope i dont pray dont let me put you to the blush my lord lord colambre would not have let her if he could have helped it count ohalloran your most obedient i had the honour of meeting you at killpatrickstown said mrs petito backing to the door and twitching her shawl she stumbled nearly fell down over the large dogcaught by the door and recovered herself hannibal rose and shook his ears poor fellow you are of my acquaintance too she would have stroked his head but hannibal walked off indignant and so did she thus ended certain hopes for mrs petito had conceived that her diplomacy might be turned to account that in her character of an ambassadress as lady dashforts double by the aid of iceland moss in chocolate flattery properly administered that by bearing with all her dear mr reynoldss oddnesses and roughneses she might in timethat is to say before he made a new will become his dear mrs petito or for stranger things have happened and do happen every day his dear mrs reynolds mrs petito however was good at a retreat and she flattered herself that at least nothing of this underplot had appeared and at all events she secured by her services in this embassy the longlookedfor object of her ambition lady dashforts scarlet velvet gownnot yet a thread the worse for the wear one cordial look at this comforted her for the loss of her expected octogenaire and she proceeded to discomfit her lady by repeating the message with which strange old mr reynolds had charged her so ended all lady dashforts hopes of his fortune since the death of his youngest son she had been indefatigable in her attentions and sanguine in her hopes the disappointment affected both her interest and her pride as an intrigante it was necessary however to keep her feelings to herself for if heathcock should hear anything of the matter before the articles were signed he might be offso she put him and lady isabel into her coach directlydrove to grays to make sure at all events of the jewels in the meantime count ohalloran and lord colambre delighted with the result of their visit took leave of mr reynolds after having arranged the journey and appointed the hour for setting off the next day lord colambre proposed to call upon mr reynolds in the evening and introduce his father lord clonbrony but mr reynolds said no no im not ceremonious i have given you proofs enough of that i think in the short time weve been already acquainted time enough to introduce your father to me when we are in a carriage going our journey then we can talk and get acquainted but merely to come this evening in a hurry and say lord clonbrony mr reynoldsmr reynolds lord clonbrony and then bob our two heads at one another and scrape one foot back and awaywheres the use of that nonsense at my time of life or at any time of life no no we have enough to do without that i daresaygood morning to you count ohalloran i thank you heartily from the first moment i saw you i liked you lucky too that you brought your dog with you twas hannibal made me first let you in i saw him over the top of the blindhannibal my good fellow im more obliged to you than you can guess so are we all said lord colambre hannibal was well patted and then they parted in returning home they met sir james brooke i told you said sir james i should be in london almost as soon as you have you found old reynolds just come from him how does your business prosper i hope as well as mine a history of all that had passed up to the present moment was given and hearty congratulations received where are you going now sir jamescannot you come with us said lord colambre and the count impossible replied sir jamesbut perhaps you can come with meim going to grays to give some old family diamonds either to be new set or exchanged count ohalloran i know you are a judge of these things pray come and give me your opinion better consult your bride elect said the count no she knows little of the matterand cares less replied sir james not so this bride elect or i mistake her much said the count as they passed by the window and saw lady isabel who with lady dashfort had been holding consultation deep with the jeweller and heathcock playing personnage muet lady dashfort who had always as old reynolds expressed it her head upon her shoulderspresence of mind where her interests were concernedran to the door before the count and lord colambre could enter giving a hand to eachas if they had all parted the best friends in the world how do how dogive you joy give me joy and all that but mind not a word said she laying her finger upon her lipsnot a word before heathcock of old reynolds or of the best part of the old foolhis fortune the gentlemen bowed in sign of submission to her ladyships commands and comprehended that she feared heathcock might be off if the best part of his bride her fortune or her expectations were lowered in value or in prospect how low is she reduced whispered lord colambre when such a husband is thought a prizeand to be secured by a manoeuvre he sighed spare that generous sigh said sir james brooke it is wasted lady isabel as they approached turned from a mirror at which she was trying on a diamond crescent her face clouded at sight of count ohalloran and lord colambre and grew dark as hatred when she saw sir james brooke she walked away to the farther end of the shop and asked one of the shopmen the price of a diamond necklace which lay upon the counter the man said he really did not know it belonged to lady oranmore it had just been new set for one of her ladyships daughters who is going to be married to sir james brookeone of the gentlemen my lady who are just come in then calling to his master he asked him the price of the necklace he named the value which was considerable i really thought lady oranmore and her daughters were vastly too philosophical to think of diamonds said lady isabel to her mother with a sort of sentimental sneer in her voice and countenance but it is some comfort to me to find in these patternwomen philosophy and love do not so wholly engross the heart that they feel every vanity in fondness lost twould be difficult in some cases thought many present pon honour dimonds are cursed expensive things i know said heathcock but be that as it may whispered he to the lady though loud enough to be heard by others ive laid a damned round wager that no womans diamonds married this winter under a countess in lonon shall eclipse lady isabel heathcocksand mr gray heres to be judge lady isabel paid for this promise one of her sweetest smiles with one of those smiles which she had formerly bestowed upon lord colambre and which he had once fancied expressed so much sensibilitysuch discriminative and delicate application our hero felt so much contempt that he never wasted another sigh of pity for her degradation lady dashfort came up to him as he was standing alone and whilst the count and sir james were settling about the diamonds my lord colambre said she in a low voice i know your thoughts and i could moralise as well as you if i did not prefer laughingyou are right enough and so am i and so is isabel we are all right for look here women have not always the liberty of choice and therefore they cant be expected to have always the power of refusal the mother satisfied with her convenient optimism got into her carriage with her daughter her daughters diamonds and her precious soninlaw her daughters companion for life the more i see said count ohalloran to lord colambre as they left the shop the more i find reason to congratulate you upon your escape my dear lord i owe it not to my own wit or wisdom said lord colambre but much to love and much to friendship added he turning to sir james brooke here was the friend who early warned me against the sirens voice who before i knew lady isabel told me what i have since found to be true that two passions alternately govern her fatebr her business is love but her pleasure is hatebr that is dreadfully severe sir james said count ohalloran but i am afraid it is just i am sure it is just or i would not have said it replied sir james brooke for the foibles of the sex i hope i have as much indulgence as any man and for the errors of passion as much pity but i cannot repress the indignation the abhorrence i feel against women cold and vain who use their wit and their charms only to make others miserable lord colambre recollected at this moment lady isabels look and voice when she declared that she would let her little finger be cut off to purchase the pleasure of inflicting on lady de cresey for one hour the torture of jealousy perhaps continued sir james brooke now that i am going to marry into an irish family i may feel with peculiar energy disapprobation of this mother and daughter on another account but you lord colambre will do me the justice to recollect that before i had any personal interest in the country i expressed as a general friend to ireland antipathy to those who return the hospitality they received from a warmhearted people by publicly setting the example of elegant sentimental hypocrisy or daring disregard of decorum by privately endeavouring to destroy the domestic peace of families on which at last public as well as private virtue and happiness depend i do rejoice my dear lord colambre to hear you say that i had any share in saving you from the siren and now i will never speak of these ladies more i am sorry you cannot stay in town to seebut why should i be sorrywe shall meet again i trust and i shall introduce you and you i hope will introduce me to a very different charmer farewellyou have my warm good wishes wherever you go sir james turned off quickly to the street in which lady oranmore lived and lord colambre had not time to tell him that he knew and admired his intended bride count ohalloran promised to do this for him and now said the good count i am to take leave of you and i assure you i do it with so much reluctance that nothing less than positive engagements to stay in town would prevent me from setting off with you tomorrow but i shall be soon very soon at liberty to return to ireland and clonbrony castle if you will give me leave i will see before i see halloran castle lord colambre joyfully thanked his friend for this promise nay it is to indulge myself i long to see you happylong to behold the choice of such a heart as yours pray do not steal a march upon melet me know in time i will leave everythingeven the siege offor your wedding but i trust i shall be in time assuredly you will my dear count if ever that wedding if repeated the count if repeated lord colambre obstacles which when we last parted appeared to me invincible prevented my having ever even attempted to make an impression on the heart of the woman i love and if you knew her count as well as i do you would know that her love could not unsought be won of that i cannot doubt or she would not be your choice but when her love is sought we have every reason to hope said the count smiling that it may because it ought to be won by tried honour and affection i only require to be left in hope well i leave you hope said lord colambre miss nugentmiss reynolds i should say has been in the habit of considering a union with me as impossible my mother early instilled this idea into her mind miss nugent thought that duty forbad her to think of me she told me so i have seen it in all her conduct and manners the barriers of habit the ideas of duty cannot ought not to be thrown down or suddenly changed in a wellregulated female mind and you i am sure know enough of the best female hearts to be aware that time well well let this dear good charmer take her own time provided theres none given to affectation or prudery or coquetry and from all these of course she must be free and of course i must be content adieu au revoir chapter xvii as lord colambre was returning home he was overtaken by sir terence ofay well my lord cried sir terence out of breath you have led me a pretty dance all over the town heres a letter somewhere down in my safe pocket for you which has cost me trouble enough phoo where is it nowits from miss nugent said he holding up the letter the direction to grosvenor square london had been scratched out and it had been redirected by sir terence to the lord viscount colambre at sir james brookes bart brookwood huntingdonshire or elsewhere with speed but the more haste the worse speed for away it went to brookwood huntingdonshire where i knew if anywhere you was to be found but as fate and the post would have it there the letter went coursing after you while you were running round and back and forwards and everywhere i understand to toddrington and wrestham and where not through all them english places where theres no crosspost so i took it for granted that it found its way to the deadletter office or was sticking up across a pane in the dd postmasters window at huntingdon for the whole town to see and it a loveletter and some puppy to claim it under false pretence and you all the time without it and it might breed a coolness betwixt you and miss nugent but my dear sir terence give me the letter now you have me oh my dear lord if you knew what a race i have had missing you here by five minutes and there by five secondsbut i have you at last and you have itand im paid this minute for all i liquidated of my substance by the pleasure i have in seeing you crack the seal and read it but take care you dont tumble over the orange womanorange barrows are a great nuisance when ones studying a letter in the streets of london or the metropolis but never heed stick to my arm and ill guide you like a blind man safe through the thick of them miss nugents letter which lord colambre read in spite of the jostling of passengers and the incessant talking of sir terence was as follows let me not be the cause of banishing you from your home and your country where you would do so much good and make so many happy let me not be the cause of your breaking your promise to your mother of your disappointing my dear aunt so cruelly who has complied with all our wishes and who sacrifices to oblige us her favourite tastes how could she ever be happy in irelandhow could clonbrony castle be a home to her without her son if you take away all she had of amusement and pleasure as it is called are not you bound to give her in their stead that domestic happiness which she can enjoy only with you and by your means if instead of living with her you go into the army she will be in daily nightly anxiety and alarm about you and her son will instead of being a comfort be a source of torment to her i will hope that you will do now as you have always hitherto done on every occasion where i have seen you act what is right and just and kind come here on the day you promised my aunt you would before that time i shall be in cambridgeshire with my friend lady berryl she is so good as to come to buxton for mei shall remain with her instead of returning to ireland i have explained my reasons to my dear auntcould i have any concealment from her to whom from my earliest childhood i owe everything that kindness and affection could give she is satisfiedshe consents to my living henceforward with lady berryl let me have the pleasure of seeing by your conduct that you approve of mineyour affectionate cousin and friend grace nugent this letter as may be imagined by those who like him are capable of feeling honourable and generous conduct gave our hero exquisite pleasure poor goodnatured sir terence ofay enjoyed his lordships delight and forgot himself so completely that he never even inquired whether lord colambre had thought of an affair on which he had spoken to him some time before and which materially concerned sir terences interest the next morning when the carriage was at the door and sir terence was just taking leave of his friend lord clonbrony and actually in tears wishing them all manner of happiness though he said there was none left now in london or the wide world even for himlord colambre went up to him and said sir terence you have never inquired whether i have done your business oh my dear im not thinking of that nowtime enough by the posti can write after you but my thoughts wont turn for me to business now no matter your business is done replied lord colambre then i wonder how you could think of it with all you had upon your mind and heart when anythings upon my heart good morning to my head its not worth a lemon goodbye to you and thank you kindly and all happiness attend you goodbye to you sir terence ofay said lord clonbrony and since its so ordered i must live without you oh youll live better without me my lord i am not a good liver i know nor the best of all companions for a nobleman young or old and now youll be rich and not put to your shifts and your wits what would i have to do for yousir terence ofay you know was only the poor noblemans friend and youll never want to call upon him again thanks to your jewel your pittsdimond of a son there so we part here and depend upon it youre better without methats all my comfort or my heart would break the carriage is waiting this long time and this young lovers itching to be off god bless you boththats my last word they called in red lion square punctual to the moment on old mr reynolds but his windowshutters were shut he had been seized in the night with a violent fit of the gout which as he said held him fast by the leg but here said he giving lord colambre a letter heres what will do your business without me take this written acknowledgment i have penned for you and give my granddaughter her fathers letter to readit would touch a heart of stonetouched minewish i could drag the mother back out of her grave to do her justiceall one now you see at last im not a suspicious rascal however for i dont suspect you of palming a false granddaughter upon me will you said lord colambre give your granddaughter leave to come up to town to you sir you would satisfy yourself at least as to what resemblance she may bear to her father miss reynolds will come instantly and she will nurse you no no i wont have her come if she comes i wont see hershant begin by nursing menot selfish as soon as i get rid of this gout i shall be my own man and young again and ill soon be after you across the sea that shant stop me ill come towhats the name of your place in ireland and see what likeness i can find to her poor father in this granddaughter of mine that you puffed so finely yesterday and let me see whether she will wheedle me as finely as mrs petito would dont get ready your marriage settlements do you hear till you have seen my will which i shall sign atwhats the name of your place write it down there theres pen and ink and leave me for the twinge is coming and i shall roar will you permit me sir to leave my own servant with you to take care of you i can answer for his attention and fidelity let me see his face and ill tell you lord colambres servant was summoned yes i like his face god bless youleave me lord colambre gave his servant a charge to bear with mr reynoldss rough manner and temper and to pay the poor old gentleman every possible attention then our hero proceeded with his father on his journey and on this journey nothing happened worthy of note on his first perusal of the letter from grace lord colambre had feared that she would have left buxton with lady berryl before he could reach it but upon recollection he hoped that the few lines he had written addressed to his mother and miss nugent with the assurance that he should be with them on wednesday would be sufficient to show her that some great change had happened and consequently sufficient to prevent her from quitting her aunt till she could know whether such a separation would be necessary he argued wisely more wisely than grace had reasoned for notwithstanding this note she would have left buxton before his arrival but for lady berryls strength of mind and positive determination not to set out with her till lord colambre should arrive to explain in the interval poor grace was indeed in an anxious state of suspense and her uncertainty whether she was doing right or wrong by staying to see lord colambre tormented her most my dear you cannot help yourself be quiet said lady berryl i will take the whole upon my conscience and i hope my conscience may never have anything worse to answer for grace was the first person who from her window saw lord colambre the instant the carriage drove to the door she ran to her friend lady berryls apartmenthe is comenow take me away not yet my sweet friend lie down upon this sofa if you please and keep yourself tranquil whilst i go and see what you ought to do and depend upon me for a true friend in whose mind as in your own duty is the first object i depend on you entirely said grace sinking down on the sofa and you see i obey you many thanks to you for lying down when you cant stand lady berryl went to lady clonbronys apartment she was met by sir arthur come my love come quicklord colambre is arrived i know it and does he go to ireland speak instantly that i may tell grace nugent you can tell her nothing yet my love for we know nothing lord colambre will not say a word till you come but i know by his countenance that he has good and extraordinary news they passed rapidly along the passage to lady clonbronys room oh my dear dear lady berryl come or i shall die with impatience cried lady clonbrony in a voice and manner between laughing and crying there now you have congratulated are very happy and very glad and all thatnow for mercys sake sit down lord clonbrony for heavens sake sit downbeside me hereor anywhere now colambre begin and tell us all at once but as nothing is so tedious as a twicetold tale lord colambres narrative need not here be repeated he began with count ohallorans visit immediately after lady clonbrony had left london and went through the history of the discovery that captain reynolds was the husband of miss st omar and the father of grace the dying acknowledgment of his marriage the packet delivered by count ohalloran to the careless ambassadorhow recovered by the assistance of his executor sir james brooke the travels from wrestham to toddrington and thence to red lion square the interview with old reynolds and its final result all was related as succinctly as the impatient curiosity of lord colambres auditors could desire oh wonder upon wonder and joy upon joy cried lady clonbrony so my darling grace is as legitimate as i am and an heiress after all where is she where is she in your room lady berryloh colambre why wouldnt you let her be bylady berryl do you know he would not let me send for her though she was the person of all others most concerned for that very reason maam and that lord colambre was quite right i am sure you must be sensible when you recollect that grace has no idea that she is not the daughter of mr nugent she has no suspicion that the breath of blame ever lighted upon her mother this part of the story cannot be announced to her with too much caution and indeed her mind has been so much harassed and agitated and she is at present so far from strong that great delicacy true very true lady berryl interrupted lady clonbrony and ill be as delicate as you please about it afterwards but in the first and foremost place i must tell her the best part of the storythat shes an heiress madam never killed anybody so darting through all opposition lady clonbrony made her way into the room where grace was lyingyes get up get up my own grace and be surprisedwell you mayyou are an heiress after all am i my dear aunt said grace true as im lady clonbronyand a very great heiressand no more colambres cousin than lady berryl here so now begin and love him as fast as you pleasei give my consentand here he is lady clonbrony turned to her son who just appeared at the door oh mother what have you done what have i done cried lady clonbrony following her sons eyeslord bless megrace fainted deadlady berryl oh what have i done my dear lady berryl what shall we do there her colours coming again said lord clonbrony come away my dear lady clonbrony for the present and so will ithough i long to talk to the darling girl myself but she is not equal to it yet when grace came to herself she first saw lady berryl leaning over her and raising herself a little she said what has happenedi dont know yeti dont know whether i am happy or not then seeing lord colambre she sat quite upright you received my letter cousin i hopedo you go to ireland with my aunt yes and with you i hope my beloved friend said colambre you once assured me that i had such a share of your esteem and affection that the idea of my accompanying you to ireland was not disagreeable to you you flattered me that i formed part of your agreeable associations with home yessit down by me wont you my dear lady berrylbut then i considered you as my cousin lord colambre and i thought you felt the same towards me but now but now my charming grace said lord colambre kneeling beside her and taking her hand no invincible obstacle opposes my passionno invincible obstacle did i say let me hope that i may say no obstacle but what depends on the change in the nature of your sentiments you heard my mothers consent you saw her joy i scarcely knew what i heard or saw said grace blushing deeply or what i now see and hear but of this i feel secure before i comprehend the mystery before you explain to me the causes of yourchange of conduct that you have never been actuated by caprice but governed by wise and honourable motives as to my going to ireland or remaining with lady berryl she has heard all the circumstancesshe is my friend and yoursa better friend cannot be to her i appealshe will decide for me what i ought to do she promised to take me from hence instantly if i ought to go i did and i would do so without hesitation if any duty or any prudence required it but after having heard all the circumstances i can only tell you that i willingly resign the pleasure of your company but tell her my dear lady berryl said lord colambre excellent friend as you areexplain to her you can better than any of us all that is to be known let her know my whole conduct and then let her decide for herself and i shall submit to her decision it is difficult my dear grace to restrain the expression of love of passion such as i feel but i have some power over myselfyou know itand this i can promise you that your affections shall be free as airthat no wishes of friends no interference nothing but your own unbiassed choice will i allow if my life depended upon it to operate in my favour be assured my dearest grace added he smiling as he retired you shall have time to know whether you are happy or not the moment he had left the room she threw herself into the arms of her friend and her heart oppressed with various feelings was relieved by tearsa species of relief to which she was not habituated i am happy said she but what was the invincible obstaclewhat was the meaning of my aunts wordsand what was the cause of her joy explain all this to me my dear friend for i am still as if i were in a dream with all the delicacy which lady clonbrony deemed superfluous lady berryl explained nothing could surpass the astonishment of grace on first learning that mr nugent was not her father when she was told of the stigma that had been cast on her birth the suspicions the disgrace to which her mother had been subjected for so many yearsthat mother whom she had so loved and respected who had with such care instilled into the mind of her daughter the principles of virtue and religion that mother whom grace had always seen the example of every virtue she taught on whom her daughter never suspected that the touch of blame the breath of scandal could restgrace could express her sensations only by repeating in tones of astonishment pathos indignationmy mothermy mothermy mother for some time she was incapable of attending to any other idea or of feeling any other sensations when her mind was able to admit the thought her friend soothed her by recalling the expressions of lord colambres lovethe struggle by which he had been agitated when he fancied a union with her opposed by an invincible obstacle grace sighed and acknowledged that in prudence it ought to have been an invincible obstacleshe admired the firmness of his decision the honour with which he had acted towards her one moment she exclaimed then if i had been the daughter of a mother who had conducted herself ill he never would have trusted me the next moment she recollected with pleasure the joy she had just seen in his eyesthe affection the passion that spoke in every word and look then dwelt upon the sober certainty that all obstacles were removed and no duty opposes my loving him and my aunt wishes it my kind aunt and i may think of himyou my best friend would not assure me of this if you were not certain of the truthoh how can i thank you for all your kindness and for that best of all kindness sympathy you see your calmness your strength of mind supports and tranquillises me i would rather have heard all i have just learnt from you than from any other person living i could not have borne it from any one else no one else knows my mind so perfectlyyet my aunt is very goodand my dear uncle should not i go to himbut he is not my uncle she is not my aunt i cannot bring myself to think that they are not my relations and that i am nothing to them you may be everything to them my dear grace said lady berryl whenever you please you may be their daughter grace blushed and smiled and sighed and was consoled but then she recollected her new relation mr reynolds her grandfather whom she had never seen who had for years disowned hertreated her mother with injustice she could scarcely think of him with complaisancy yet when his age his sufferings his desolate state were represented she pitied him and faithful to her strong sense of duty would have gone instantly to offer him every assistance and attention in her power lady berryl assured her that mr reynolds had positively forbidden her going to him and that he had assured lord colambre he would not see her if she went to him after such rapid and varied emotions poor grace desired repose and her friend took care that it should be secured to her for the remainder of the day in the meantime lord clonbrony had kindly and judiciously employed his lady in a discussion about certain velvet furniture which grace had painted for the drawingroom at clonbrony castle in lady clonbronys mind as in some bad paintings there was no keeping all objects great and small were upon the same level the moment her son entered the room her ladyship exclaimed everything pleasant at once heres your father tells me graces velvet furnitures all packed really sohos the best man in the world of his kind and the cleverestand so after all my dear colambre as i always hoped and prophesied at last you will marry an heiress and terry said lord clonbrony will win his wager from mordicai terry repeated lady clonbrony that odious terryi hope my lord that he is not to be one of my comforts in ireland no my dear mother he is much better provided for than we could have expected one of my fathers first objects was to prevent him from being any encumbrance to you we consulted him as to the means of making him happy and the knight acknowledged that he had long been casting a sheeps eye at a little snug place that will soon be open in his native countrythe chair of assistant barrister at the sessions assistant barrister said my father but my dear terry you have all your life been evading the laws and very frequently breaking the peace do you think this has qualified you peculiarly for being a guardian of the laws sir terence replied yes sure set a thief to catch a thief is no bad maxim and did not mr colquhoun the scotchman get himself made a great justice by his making all the world as wise as himself about thieves of all sorts by land and by water and in the air too where he detected the mudlarksand is not barrington chiefjustice of botany bay my father now began to be seriously alarmed lest sir terence should insist upon his using his interest to make him an assistant barrister he was not aware that five years practice at the bar was a necessary accomplishment for this office when fortunately for all parties my good friend count ohalloran helped us out of the difficulty by starting an idea full of practical justice a literary friend of the counts had been for some time promised a lucrative situation under government but unfortunately he was a man of so much merit and ability that they could not find employment for him at home and they gave him a commission i should rather say a contract abroad for supplying the army with hungarian horses now the gentleman had not the slightest skill in horseflesh and as sir terence is a complete jockey the count observed that he would be the best possible deputy for his literary friend we warranted him to be a thoroughgoing friend and i do think the coalition will be well for both parties the count has settled it all and i left sir terence comfortably provided for out of your way my dear mother and as happy as he could be when parting from my father lord colambre was assiduous in engaging his mothers attention upon any subject which could for the present draw her thoughts away from her young friend but at every pause in the conversation her ladyship repeated so grace is an heiress after allso after all they know they are not cousins well i prefer grace a thousand times over to any other heiress in england no obstacle no objection they have my consent i always prophesied colambre would marry an heiress but why not marry directly her ardour and impatience to hurry things forward seemed now likely to retard the accomplishment of her own wishes and lord clonbrony who understood rather more of the passion of love than his lady ever had felt or understood saw the agony into which she threw her son and felt for his darling grace with a degree of delicacy and address of which few would have supposed lord clonbrony capable his lordship cooperated with his son in endeavours to keep lady clonbrony quiet and to suppress the hourly thanksgivings of graces turning out an heiress on one point however she vowed she would not be overruledshe would have a splendid wedding at clonbrony castle such as should become an heir and heiress and the wedding she hoped would be immediately on their return to ireland she should announce the thing to her friends directly on her arrival at clonbrony castle my dear said lord clonbrony we must wait in the first place the pleasure of old mr reynoldss fit of the gout why thats true because of his will said her ladyship but a wills soon made is not it that cant be much delay and then there must be settlements said lord clonbrony they take time lovers like all the rest of mankind must submit to the laws delay in the meantime my dear as these buxton baths agree with you so well and as grace does not seem to be over and above strong for travelling a long journey and as there are many curious and beautiful scenes of nature here in derbyshirematlock and the wonders of the peak and so onwhich the young people would be glad to see together and may not have another opportunity soonwhy not rest ourselves a little for another reason too continued his lordship bringing together as many arguments as he couldfor he had often found that though lady clonbrony was a match for any single argument her understanding could be easily overpowered by a number of whatever sortbesides my dear heres sir arthur and lady berryl come to buxton on purpose to meet us and we owe them some compliment and something more than compliment i think so i dont see why we should be in a hurry to leave them or quit buxtona few weeks sooner or later cant signifyand clonbrony castle will be getting all the while into better order for us burke is gone down there and if we stay here quietly there will be time for the velvet furniture to get there before us and to be unpacked and up in the drawingroom thats true my lord said lady clonbrony and there is a great deal of reason in all you sayso i second that motion as colambre i see subscribes to it they stayed some time in derbyshire and every day lord clonbrony proposed some pleasant excursion and contrived that the young people should be left to themselves as mrs broadhurst used so strenuously to advise the recollection of whose authoritative maxims fortunately still operated upon lady clonbrony to the great ease and advantage of the lovers happy as a lover a friend a son happy in the consciousness of having restored a father to respectability and persuaded a mother to quit the feverish joys of fashion for the pleasures of domestic life happy in the hope of winning the whole heart of the woman he loved and whose esteem he knew he possessed and deserved happy in developing every day every hour fresh charm in his destined bridewe leave our hero returning to his native country and we leave him with the reasonable expectation that he will support through life the promise of his early character that his patriotic views will extend with his power to carry wishes into action that his attachment to his warmhearted countrymen will still increase upon further acquaintance and that he will long diffuse happiness through the wide circle which is peculiarly subject to the influence and example of a great resident irish proprietor letter from larry to his brother pat brady at mr mordicais coachmaker london my dear brother yours of the th inclosing the five pound note for my father came safe to hand monday last

it when youve time old nicks gone and st dennis along with him to the place he come frompraise be to god the ould lord has found him out in his tricks and i helped him to that through the young lord that i driv as i informed you in my last when he was a welchman which was the best turn ever i did though i did not know it no more than adam that time so ould nicks turned out of the agency clean and clear and the day after it was known there was surprising great joy through the whole country not surprising either but just what you might knowing him rasonably expect he that is old nick and st dennis would have been burnt that nighti mane in effigy through the town of clonbrony but that the new man mr burke come down that day too soon to stop it and said it was not becoming to trample on the fallen or something that way that put an end to it and though it was a great disappointment to many and to me in particular i could not but like the jantleman the better for it anyhow they say he is a very good jantleman and as unlike old nick or the saint as can be and takes no duty fowl nor glove nor sealingmoney nor asks duty work nor duty turf well when i was disappointed of the effigy i comforted myself by making a bonfire of old nicks big rick of duty turf which by great luck was out in the road away from all dwellinghouse or thatch or yards to take fire so no danger in life or objection and such another blaze i wished youd seed itand all the men women and children in the town and country far and near gathered round it shouting and dancing like madand it was light as day quite across the bog as far as bartley finnigans house and i heard after they seen it from all parts of the three counties and they thought it was st johns eve in a mistakeor couldnt make out what it was but all took it in good part for a good sign and were in great joy as for st dennis and ould nick an attorney had his foot upon em with an habere a latitat and three executions hanging over em and theres the end of rogues and a great example in the country andno more about it for i cant be wasting more ink upon them that dont desarve it at my hands when i want it for them that do you shall see

its i driv em well and we all got to the great gate of the park before sunset and as fine an evening as ever you see with the sun shining on the tops of the trees as the ladies noticed the leaves changed but not dropped though so late in the season i believe the leaves knew what they were about and kept on on purpose to welcome them and the birds were singing and i stopped whistling that they might hear them but sorrow bit could they hear when they got to the park gate for there was such a crowd and such a shout as you never seeand they had the horses off every carriage entirely and drewem home with blessings through the park and god bless em when they got out they didnt go shut themselves up in the great drawingroom but went straight out to the tirrass to satisfy the eyes and hearts that followed them my lady laning on my young lord and miss grace nugent that was the beautifullest angel that ever you set eyes on with the finest complexion and sweetest of smiles laning upon the ould lords arm who had his hat off bowing to all and noticing the old tenants as he passed by name oh there was great gladness and tears in the midst for joy i could scarce keep from myself after a turn or two upon the tirrass my lord colambre quit his mothers arm for a minute and he come to the edge of the slope and looked down and through all the crowd for some one is it the widow oneill my lord says i shes yonder with the spectacles on her nose betwixt her son and daughter as usual then my lord beckoned and they did not know which of the tree would stir and then he gave tree beckons with his own finger and they all tree came fast enough to the bottom of the slope forenent my lord and he went down and helped the widow up oh hes the true jantleman and brought em all tree up on the tirrass to my lady and miss nugent and i was up close after that i might hear which wasnt manners but i couldnt help it so what he said i dont well know for i could not get near enough after all but i saw my lady smile very kind and take the widow oneill by the hand and then my lord colambre troduced grace to miss nugent and there was the word namesake and something about a check curtains but whatever it was they was all greatly pleased then my lord colambre turned and looked for brian who had fell back and took him with some commendation to my lord his father and my lord the master said which i didnt know till after that they should have their house and farm at the ould rent and at the surprise the widow dropped down dead and there was a cry as for ten berrings be quite says i shes only kilt for joy and i went and lift her up for her son had no more strength that minute than the child new born and grace trembled like a leaf as white as the sheet but not long for the mother came to and was as well as ever when i brought some water which miss nugent handed to her with her own hand that was always pretty and good said the widow laying her hand upon miss nugent and kind and good to me and mine that minute there was music from below the blind harper oneill with his harp that struck up gracey nugent and that finished and my lord colambre smiling with the tears standing in his eyes too and the ould lord quite wiping his i ran to the tirrass brink to bid oneill play it again but as i run i thought i heard a voice call larry who calls larry says i my lord colambre calls you larry says all at once and four takes me by the shoulders and spins me round theres my young lord calling you larryrun for your life so i run back for my life and walked respectful with my hat in my hand when i got near put on your hat my father desires it says my lord colambre the ould lord made a sign to that purpose but was too full to speak wheres your father continues my young lord hes very ould my lord says i i didnt ask you how ould he was says he but where is hehes behind the crowd below on account of his infirmities he couldnt walk so fast as the rest my lord says i but his heart is with you if not his body i must have his body too so bring him bodily before us and this shall be your warrant for so doing said my lord joking for he knows the natur of us paddy and how we love a joke in our hearts as well as if he had lived all his life in ireland and by the same token will for that rason do what he pleases with us and more maybe than a man twice as good that never would smile on us but im telling you of my father ive a warrant for you father says i and must have you bodily before the justice and my lord chiefjustice so he changed colour a bit at first but he saw me smile and ive done no sin said he and larry you may lead me now as you led me all my life and up the slope he went with me as light as fifteen and when we got up my lord clonbrony said i am sorry an old tenant and a good old tenant as i hear you were should have been turned out of your farm dont fret its no great matter my lord said my father i shall be soon out of the way but if you would be so kind to speak a word for my boy here and that i could afford while the life is in me bring my other boy back out of banishment then says my lord clonbrony ill give you and your sons three lives or
