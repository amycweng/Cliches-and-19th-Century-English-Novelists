tales and novels volume viii of x patronage concluded comic dramas leonora and letters by maria edgeworth in ten volumes with engravings on steel patronage chapter xxxvi no less an event than alfreds marriage no event calling less imperatively upon her feelings could have recovered lady janes sympathy for caroline but alfred percy who had been the restorer of her fortune her friend in adversity what pain it would give him to find her at the moment when he might expect her congratulations quarrelling with his sisterthat sister too who had left her home where she was so happy and hungerford castle where she was adored on purpose to tend lady jane in sickness and obscurity without being put exactly into these words or perhaps into any words thoughts such as these with feelings of gratitude and affection revived for caroline in lady janes mind the moment she heard of alfreds intended marriage good young manexcellent friendwell tell me all about it my dear it was the first time that her ladyship had said my dear to caroline since the day of the fatal refusal caroline was touched by this word of reconciliationand the tears it brought into her eyes completely overcame lady jane who hastily wiped her own so my dear carolinewhere were we tell me about your brothers marriagewhen is it to behow has it been brought aboutthe last i heard of the leicesters was the good deans deathi remember pitying them very muchwere they not left in straitened circumstances too will alfred have any fortune with miss leicestertell me every thingread me his letters to go back to dr leicesters death for some months his preferments were kept in abeyance many were named or thought of as likely to succeed him the deanery was in the gift of the crown and as it was imagined that the vicarage was also at the disposal of government applications had poured in on all sides for friends and friends friends to the remotest link of the supporters of ministrybutto use their own elegant phrasethe hands of government were tied it seems that in consequence of some parliamentary interest formerly given opportunely and in consideration of certain arrangements in his diocese to serve persons whom ministers were obliged to oblige a promise had long ago been given to bishop clay that his recommendation to the deanery should be accepted on the next vacancy the bishop who had promised the living to his sisters husband now presented it to mr buckhurst falconer with the important addition of dr leicesters deanery to become a dean was once the height of buckhursts ambition that for which in a moment of elation he prayed scarcely hoping that his wishes would ever be fulfilled yet now that his wish was accomplished and that he had attained this height of his ambition was he happy nofar from it farther than ever how could he be happydissatisfied with his conduct and detesting his wife in the very act of selling himself to this beldam he abhorred his own meanness but he did not know how much reason he should have to repent till the deed was done it was done in a hurry with all the precipitation of a man who hates himself for what he feels forced to do unused to bargain and sale in any way in marriage never having thought of it before buckhurst did not take all precautions necessary to make his sacrifice answer his own purpose he could not conceive the avaricious temper and habits of his lady till he was hers past redemption whatever accession of income he obtained from his marriage he lived up to immediately his establishment his expenses surpassed his revenue his wife would not pay or advance a shilling beyond her stipulated quota to their domestic expenses he could not hear the parsimonious manner in which she would have had him live or the shabby style in which she received his friends he was more profuse in proportion as she was more niggardly and whilst she scolded and grudged every penny she paid he ran in debt magnanimously for hundreds when the living and deanery came into his possession the second years fruits had been eaten beforehand money he must have and money his wife would not givebut a litigious agent suggested to him a plan for raising it by demanding a considerable sum from the executors of the late dr leicester for what is called dilapidation the parsonagehouse seemed to be in good repair but to make out charges of dilapidation was not difficult to those who understood the businessand fifteen hundred pounds was the charge presently made out against the executors of the late incumbent it was invidious it was odious for the new vicar in the face of his parishioners of all those who loved and respected his predecessor to begin by making such a demandespecially as it was well known that the late dean had not saved any of the income of his preferment but had disposed of it amongst his parishioners as a steward for the poor he had left his family in narrow circumstances they were proud of his virtues and not ashamed of the consequences with dignity and ease they retrenched their expenses and after having lived as became the family of a dignitary of the church on quitting the parsonage the widow and her niece retired to a small habitation suited to their altered circumstances and lived with respectable and respected economy the charge brought against them by the new dean was an unexpected blow it was an extortion to which mrs leicester would not submitcould not without injury to her niece from whose fortune the sum claimed if yielded must be deducted alfred percy from the first moment of their distress from the time of good dr leicesters death had been assiduous in his attentions to mrs leicester and by the most affectionate letters and whenever he could get away from london by his visits to her and to his sophia had proved the warmth and constancy of his attachment some months had now passedhe urged his suit and besought sophia no longer to delay his happiness mrs leicester wished that her niece should now give herself a protector and friend who might console her for the uncle she had lost it was at this period the dilapidation charge was made mrs leicester laid the whole statement before alfred declaring that for his sake as well as for her nieces she was resolute to defend herself against injustice alfred could scarcely bring himself to believe that buckhurst falconer had acted in the manner represented with a rapacity harshness and cruelty so opposite to his natural disposition faults alfred well knew that buckhurst had but they were all he thought of quite a different sort from those of which he now stood accused what was to be done alfred was extremely averse from going to law with a man who was his relation for whom he had early felt and still retained a considerable regard yet he could not stand by and see the woman he loved defrauded of nearly half the small fortune she possessed on the other hand he was employed as a professional man and called upon to act he determined however before he should as a last resource expose the truth and maintain the right in a court of justice previously to try every means of conciliation in his power to all his letters the new dean answered evasively and unsatisfactorily by referring him to his attorney into whose hands he said he had put the business and he knew and wished to hear nothing more about it the attorney solicitor sharpe was impracticablealfred resolved to see the dean himself and this after much difficulty he at length effected he found the dean and his lady teteatete their raised voices suddenly stopped short as he entered the dean gave an angry look at his servant as alfred came into the room your servants said alfred told me that you were not at home but i told them that i knew the dean would be at home to an old friend you are very goodsaid buckhurstyou do me a great deal of honour said the dean two different manners appeared in the same person one naturalbelonging to his former the other assumed proper as he thought for his present self or rather for his present situation wont you be seated i hope all our friends mrs buckhurst or as she was called mrs dean falconer made divers motions with a very ugly chin and stood as if she thought there ought to be an introduction the dean knew it but being ashamed to introduce her determined against it alfred stood in suspension waiting their mutual pleasure wont you sit down sir repeated the dean down plumped mrs falconer directly and taking out her spectacles as if to shame her husband by heightening the contrast of youth and age deliberately put them on then drawing her table nearer settled herself to her work alfred who saw it to be necessary determined to use his best address to conciliate the lady mr dean you have never yet done me the honour to introduce me to mrs falconer i thoughti thought we had met beforesincemrs falconer mr alfred percy the lady took off her spectacles smiled and adjusted herself evidently with an intention to be more agreeable alfred sat down by her worktable directed his conversation to her and soon talked or rather induced her to talk herself into fine humour presently she retired to dress for dinner and hoped mr alfred percy had no intention of running awayshe had a wellaired bed to offer him the dean though he cordially hated his lady was glad for his own sake to be relieved from her fits of crossness and was pleased by alfreds paying attention to her as this was a sort of respect to himself and what he seldom met with from those young men who had been his companions before his marriagethey usually treated his lady with a neglect or ridicule which reflected certainly upon her husband alfred never yet had touched upon his business and buckhurst began to think this was merely a friendly visit upon alfreds observing some alteration which had been lately made in the room in which they were sitting the dean took him to see other improvements in the house in pointing out these and all the conveniences and elegancies about the parsonage buckhurst totally forgot the dilapidation suit and every thing he showed and said tended unawares to prove that the house was in the most perfect repair and best condition possible gradually whatever solemnity and beneficed pomp there had at first appeared in the deans manner wore off or was laid aside and except his being somewhat more corpulent and rubicund than in early years he appeared like the original buckhurst his gaiety of heart indeed was gone but some sparkles of his former spirits remained here said he showing alfred into his study here as our good friend mr blank said when he showed us his study here is where i read all day longquite snugand nobodys a bit the wiser for it the dean seated himself in his comfortable armchair try that chair alfred excellent for sleeping in at ones ease to rest the cushion and soft dean invite ah said alfred often have i sat in this room with my excellent friend dr leicester the new deans countenance suddenly changed but endeavouring to pass it off with a jest he said ay poor good old leicester he sleeps for everthats one comfortto meif not to you but perceiving that alfred continued to look serious the dean added some more proper reflections in a tone of ecclesiastical sentiment and with a sigh of decorumthen rose for he smelt that the dilapidation suit was coming would not you like mr percy to wash your hands before dinner i thank you mr dean i must detain you a moment to speak to you on business black as erebus grew the face of the deanhe had no resource but to listen for he knew it would come after dinner if it did not come now and it was as well to have it alone in the study where nobody might be a bit the wiser when alfred had stated the whole of what he had to say which he did in as few and strong words as possible appealing to the justice and feelings of buckhurstto the fears which the dean must have of being exposed and ultimately defeated in a court of justicemrs leicester concluded he is determined to maintain the suit and has employed me to carry it on for her i should very little have expected said the dean that mr alfred percy would have been employed in such a way against me still less should i have expected that i could be called upon in such a way against you replied alfred no one can feel it more than i do the object of my present visit is to try whether some accommodation may not be made which will relieve us both from the necessity of going to law and may prevent me from being driven to the performance of this most painful professional duty duty professional duty repeated buckhurst as if i did not understand all those cloakwords and know how easy it is to put them on and off at pleasure to some it may be but not to me said alfred calmly anger started into buckhursts countenance but conscious how inefficacious it would be and how completely he had laid himself open the dean answered you are the best judge sir but i trustthough i dont pretend to understand the honour of lawyersi trust as a gentleman you will not take advantage against me in this suit of any thing my openness has shown you about the parsonage you trust rightly mr dean replied alfred in his turn with a look not of anger but of proud indignation you trust rightly mr dean and as i should have expected that one who has had opportunities of knowing me so well ought to trust thats a clear answer said buckhurst but how could i tellso much jockeying goes on in every professionhow could i tell that a lawyer would be more conscientious than another man but now you assure me of iti take it upon your word and believe it in your case about the accommodationaccommodation means money does not itfrankly i have not a shilling but mrs falconer is all accommodation try what you can do with herand by the way you began i should hope you would do a great deal added he laughing alfred would not undertake to speak to his lady unless the dean would in the first instance make some sacrifice he represented that he was not asking for money but for a relinquishment of a claim which he apprehended not to be justly due and the only use i shall ever make of what you have shown me here is to press upon your feelings as i do at this moment the conviction of the injustice of that claim which i am persuaded your lawyers only instigated and that you will abandon buckhurst begged him not to be persuaded of any such thing the instigation of an attorney he laughing said was not in law counted the instigation of the devilat law no man talked of feelings in matters of property judges did not understand them whatever figure they might make with a jury in criminal caseswith an eloquent advocates hand on his breast alfred let buckhurst go on with his vain wit and gay rhetoric till he had nothing more to say knowing that he was hiding consciousness of unhandsome conduct sticking firmly to his point alfred showed that his client though gentle was resolved and that unless buckhurst yielded law must take its coursethat though he should never give any hint the premises must be inspected and disgrace and defeat must follow forced to be serious fretted and hurried for the halfhour bell before dinner had now rung and the deans stomach began to know canonical hours he exclaimed the upshot of the whole business is that mr alfred percy is in love i understand with miss sophia leicester and this fifteen hundred pounds which he pushes me to the bare wall to relinquish is eventually as part of her fortune to become his would it not have been as fair to have stated this at once nobecause it would not have been the truth noyou wont deny that you are in love with miss leicester i am as much in love as man can be with miss leicester but her fortune is nothing to me for i shall never touch it never touch it does the auntthe widowthe cunning widow refuse consent far from it the aunt is all the aunt of miss leicester should beall the widow of dr leicester ought to be but her circumstances are not what they ought to be and by the liberality of a friend who lends me a house rent free and by the resources of my profession i am better able than mrs leicester is to spare fifteen hundred pounds therefore in the recovery of this money i have no personal interest at present i shall never receive it from her noble noblejust what i could have done myselfonce what a contrast buckhurst laid his head down upon his arms flat on the table and remained for some moments silentthen starting upright ill never claim a penny from herill give it all up to you i will if i sell my band for it by jove oh what has your father to answer for who forced you into the church thought alfred my dear buckhurst said he my dear dean call me buckhurst if you love me i do love you it is impossible to help it in spite of all my faultssay it outsay it outin spite of your conscience added buckhurst trying to laugh not in spite of my conscience but in favour of yours said alfred against whose better dictates you have been compelled all your life to act i have so but thats over what remains to be done at present i am in real distress for five hundred pounds apropos to your being engaged in this dilapidation suit you can speak to mrs falconer about it tell her i have given up the thing and see what she will do alfred promised he would speak to mrs falconer and alfred when you see your sister caroline tell her that i am not in one sense such a wretchquite as she thinks me but tell her that i am yet a greater wretchinfinitely more miserable than she i hope can conceivebeyond redemptionbeyond endurance miserable he turned away hastily in an agony of mind alfred shut the door and escaped scarcely able to bear his own emotion when they met at dinner mrs dean falconer was an altered personher unseemly morning costume and wellworn shawl being cast aside she appeared in bloomcoloured gossamer gauze and primrose ribbons a wouldbe young lady nothing of that curmudgeon look or old fairy cast of face and figure to which he had that morning been introduced but in their place smiles and all the false brilliancy which rouge can give to the eyes proclaimed a determination to be charming the dean was silent and scarcely ate any thing though the dinner was excellent for his lady was skilled in the culinary department and in favour of alfred had made a more hospitable display than she usually condescended to make for her husbands friends there were no other guests except a young lady companion to mrs falconer alfred was as agreeable and entertaining as circumstances permitted and mrs buckhurst falconer as soon as she got out of the diningroom even before she reached the drawingroom pronounced him to be a most polite and accomplished young man very different indeed from the common run or the usual style of mr dean falconers dashing bachelor beaux who in her opinion were little better than brute bears at coffee when the gentlemen joined the ladies in the drawingroom as alfred was standing beside mrs falconer meditating how and when to speak of the object of his visit she cleared the ground by choosing the topic of conversation which at last fairly drove her husband out of the room she judiciously maliciously or accidentally began to talk of the proposal which she had heard a near relation of hers had not long since made to a near relation of mr alfred percysmr clay of clayhall her nephew had proposed for mr alfreds sister miss caroline percy she was really sorry the match was not to take place for she had heard a very high character of the young lady in every way and her nephew was rich enough to do without fortunenot but what that would be very acceptable to all menespecially young men who are now mostly all for money instead of all for loveexcept in the case of very first rate extraordinary beauty which therefore making a woman a prey just as much one as the other might be deemed a misfortune as great though hardly quite mrs buckhurst said as she had found a great fortune in her own particular case the involution of meaning in these sentences rendering it not easy to be comprehended the dean stood it pretty well only stirring his coffee and observing that it was cold but when his lady went on to a string of interrogatories about miss caroline percyon the colour of her eyes and hairsize of her mouth and noserequiring in short a complete fulllength portrait of the young lady poor buckhurst set down his cup and pleading business in his study left the field open to alfred nearsighted glasses do you never use them mr percy said mrs dean falconer as she thought alfreds eyes fixed upon her spectacles which lay on the table nohe never used them he thanked her he was rather farsighted than shortsighted she internally commended his politeness in not taking them up to verify her assertion and put them into her pocket to avoid all future danger he saw it was a favourable moment and entered at once into his businessbeginning by observing that the dean was much out of spirits the moment money was touched upon the curmudgeon look returned upon the lady and for some time alfred had great difficulty in making himself heard she poured forth such complaints against the extravagance of the dean with lists of the debts she had paid the sums she had given and the vow she had made never to go beyond the weekly allowance she had at the last settlement agreed to give her husband alfred pleaded strongly the expense of law and the certainty in his opinion of ultimate defeat with the being obliged to pay all the costs which would fall upon the dean the dean was willing to withdraw his claimhe had promised to do so in the most handsome manner and therefore alfred said he felt particularly anxious that he should not be distressed for five hundred pounds a sum for which he knew mr falconer was immediately pressed he appealed to mrs falconers generosity he had been desired by the dean to speak to her on the subject otherwise he should not have presumedand it was as a professional man and a near relation that he now took the liberty this was the first transaction he had ever had with her and he hoped he should leave the vicarage impressed with a sense of her generosity and enabled to do her justice in the opinion of those who did not know her that was very little to her she bluntly saidshe acted only up to her own notionsshe lived only for herself and for her husband love alfred percy said he was assured was superior to money in her opinion and after all my dear madam you set me the example of frankness and permit me to speak to you without reserve what can you who have no reason you say to be pleased with either of your nephews do better with your money than spend it while you live and for yourself in securing happiness in the gratitude and affection of a husband who generous himself will be peculiarly touched and attached by generosity the words love generosity generous sounded upon the ladys ear and she was unwilling to lose that high opinion which she imagined alfred entertained of her sentiments and character besides she was conscious that he was in fact nearer the truth than all the world would have believed avaricious in trifles and parsimonious in those everyday habits which brand the reputation immediately with the fault of avarice this woman was one of those misers who can be generous by fits and starts and who have been known to give hundreds of pounds but never without reluctance would part with a shilling she presented the dean her husband with an order on her banker for the money he wanted and alfred had the pleasure of leaving his unhappy friend better at least than he found him he rejoiced in having compromised this business so successfully and in thus having prevented the litigation illwill and disgraceful circumstances which without his interference must have ensued the gratitude of mrs leicester and her niece was delightful the aunt urged him to accept what he had been the means of saving as part of her nieces fortune but this he absolutely refused and satisfied mrs leicesters delicacy by explaining that he could not if he would now yield to her entreaties as he had actually obtained the money from poor buckhursts generous repentance upon the express faith that he had no private interest in the accommodation you would not said alfred bring me under the act against raising money upon false pretences what alfred lost in money he gained in love his sophias eyes beamed upon him with delight the day was fixed for their marriage and at alfreds suggestion mrs leicester consented painful as it was in some respects to her feelings that they should be married by the dean in the parish church alfred brought his bride to town and as soon as they were established in their own house or rather in that house which mr gresham insisted upon their calling their own lady jane granville was the first person to offer her congratulationsalfred begged his sister caroline from lady jane as he had already obtained his fathers and mothers consent lady jane was really fond of carolines company and had forgiven her as well as she could yet her ladyship had no longer a hope of being of use to her and felt that even if any other offer were to occurand none such as had been made could ever more be expectedit would lead only to fresh disappointment and altercation therefore she with the less reluctance relinquished caroline altogether carolines new sister had been from the time they were first acquainted her friend and she rejoiced in seeing all her hopes for her brothers happiness accomplished by this marriage his sophia had those habits of independent occupation which are essential to the wife of a professional man and which enable her to spend cheerfully many hours alone or at least without the company of her husband on his return home every evening he was sure to find a smiling wife a sympathizing friend a cheerful firesideshe had musical talentsher husband was fond of music and she did not lay aside the accomplishments which had charmed the lover but made use of them to please him whom she had chosen as her companion for life her voice her harp her utmost skill were ready at any moment and she found far more delight in devoting her talents to him than she had ever felt in exhibiting them to admiring auditors this was the domestic use of accomplishments to which caroline had always been accustomed so that joining in her new sisters occupations and endeavours to make alfreds evenings pass pleasantly she felt at once as much at home as if she had been in the country for the mind is its own place and domestic happiness may be naturalized in a capital city at her brothers house caroline had an opportunity of seeing a society that was new to her that of the professional men of the first eminence both in law and medicine the men of science and of literature with whom alfred and erasmus had been for years assiduously cultivating acquaintance they were now happy to meet at alfreds house for they liked and esteemed him and they found his wife and sister sensible wellinformed women to whom their conversation was of real amusement and instruction and who in return knew how to enliven their leisure hours by female sprightliness and elegance caroline now saw the literary and scientific world to the best advantage not the amateurs or the mere show people but those who really excelling and feeling their own superiority had too much pride and too little time to waste upon idle flattery or what to them were stupid uninteresting parties those who refused to go to lady spilsburys or to lady angelica headinghams or who were seen there perhaps once or twice in a season as a great favour and honour would call three or four evenings every week at alfreds the first news the first hints of discoveries inventions and literary projects she heard from time to time discussed those men of talent whom she had heard were to be seen at conversaziones or of whom she had had a glimpse in fine society now appeared in a new point of view and to the best advantage without those pretensions and rivalships with which they sometimes are afflicted in public or those affectations and singularities which they often are supposed to assume to obtain notoriety among persons inferior to them in intellect and superior in fashion instead of playing as they sometimes did a false game to amuse the multitude they were obliged now to exert their real skill and play fair with one another sir james harrington tells us that in his days the courtiers who played at divers games in public had a way of exciting the admiration and amazement of the commoner sort of spectators by producing heaps of golden counters and seeming to stake immense sums when all the time they had previously agreed among one another that each guinea should stand for a shilling or each hundred guineas for one so that in fact two modes of calculation were used for the initiated and uninitiated and this exoteric practice goes on continually to this hour among literary performers in the intellectual as well as among courtiers in the fashionable world besides the pleasure of studying celebrated characters and persons of eminent merit at their ease and at her own caroline had now opportunities of seeing most of those objects of rational curiosity which with lady jane granville had been prohibited as mauvais ton with men of sense she found it was not mauvais ton to use her eyes for the purposes of instruction or entertainment with mrs alfred percy she saw every thing in the best manner in the company of wellinformed guides who were able to point out what was essential to be observed ready to explain and to illustrate to procure for them all those privileges and advantages as spectators which common gazers are denied but which liberal and enlightened men are ever not only ready to allow but eager to procure for intelligent unassuming females among the gentlemen of learning talents and eminence in alfreds own profession whom caroline had the honour of seeing at her brothers were mr friend the friend of his early years at the bar and that great luminary who in a higher orbit had cheered and guided him in his ascent the chief justice was in a station and of an age where praise can be conferred without impropriety and without hurting the feelings of delicacy or pride he knew how to praisea difficult art but he excelled in it as caroline once in speaking of him said common compliments compared to praise from him are as common coin compared to a medal struck and appropriated for the occasion about this time mr temple came to tell alfred that a ship had been actually ordered to be in readiness to carry him on his intended embassy that mr shaw had recovered that cunningham falconer had no more excuses or pretences for delay despatches the last lord oldborough said he should ever receive from him as envoy had now arrived and temple was to have set out immediately but that the whole embassy had been delayed because lord oldborough had received a letter from count altenberg giving an account of alarming revolutionary symptoms which had appeared in the capital and in the provinces in the dominions of his sovereign lord oldborough had shown mr temple what related to public affairs but had not put the whole letter into his hands all that he could judge from what he read was that the counts mind was most seriously occupied with the dangerous state of public affairs in his country i should have thought added mr temple that the whole of this communication was entirely of a political nature but that in the last page which lord oldborough put into my hand the catchwords at the bottom were countess christina alfred observed that without the aid of rosamonds imagination to supply something more nothing could be made of this however it was a satisfaction to have had direct news of count altenberg the next day mr temple came for alfred lord oldborough desired to see him whatever his business may be i am sure it is important and interesting said mr temple by this time i ought to be well acquainted with lord oldboroughi know the signs of his suppressed emotion and i have seldom seen him put such force upon himself to appear calm and to do the business of the day before he should yield his mind to what pressed on his secret thoughts chapter xxxvii when alfred arrived lord oldborough was engaged with some gentlemen from the city about a loan by the length of time which the negotiators stayed they tried alfreds patience but the minister sat with immoveable composure till they knew their own minds and till they departed then the loan at once dismissed from his thoughts he was ready for alfred you have married i think mr alfred percy since i saw you lasti congratulate you his lordship was not in the habit of noticing such common events alfred was surprised and obliged by the interest in his private affairs which this congratulation denoted i congratulate you sir because i understand you have married a woman of sense to marry a foolto form or to have any connexion with a fool continued his lordship his countenance changing remarkably as he spoke i conceive to be the greatest evil the greatest curse that can be inflicted on a man of sense he walked across the room with long firm indignant stridesthen stopping short he exclaimed lettres de cachetdangerous instruments in bad handsas what are notbut one good purpose they answeredthey put it in the power of the head of every noble house to disown and to deprive of the liberty to disgrace his family any member who should manifest the will to commit desperate crime or desperate folly alfred was by no means disposed to join in praise even of this use of a lettre de cachet but he did not think it a proper time to argue the point as he saw lord oldborough was under the influence of some strong passion he waited in silence till his lordship should explain himself farther his lordship unlocked a desk and produced a letter pray mr percymr alfred percyhave you heard any thing lately of the marchioness of twickenham no my lord alfred at this instant recollected the whisper which he had once heard at chapel and he added not of late my lord there said lord oldborough putting a letter into alfreds handsthere is the sum of what i have heard the letter was from the duke of greenwich informing lord oldborough that an unfortunate discovery had been made of an affair between the marchioness of twickenham and a certain captain bellamy which rendered an immediate separation necessary so thought alfred my brother godfrey had a fine escape of this fair lady i have seen her once since i received that letter and i never will see her again said lord oldborough thats pastall that concerns her is past and irremediable now as to the future and to what concerns myself i have been informedhow truly i cannot saythat some time ago a rumour a suspicion of this intrigue was whispered in what they call the fashionable world i believe that your lordship has been truly informed said alfred and he then mentioned the whisper he had heard at the chapel hafarther it has been asserted to me that a hint was given to the marquis of twickenham of the danger of suffering thatwhat is the mans namebellamy to be so near his wife and that the hint was disregarded the marquis did very weakly or very wickedly said alfred all wickedness is weakness sir you know but to our point i have been assured that the actual discovery of the intrigue was made to the marquis some months previously to the birth of his childand that he forbore to take any notice of this lest it might affect the legitimacy of that child after the birth of the infanta boysubsequent indiscretions on the part of the marchioness the marquis would make it appear gave rise to his first suspicions now sir these are the points of which as my friend and as a professional man i desire you to ascertain the truth if the facts are as i have thus heard i presume no divorce can be legally obtained certainly not my lord then i will direct you instantly to the proper channels for information whilst lord oldborough wrote directions alfred assured him he would fulfil his commission with all the discretion and celerity in his power the next step continued lord oldboroughfor on such a subject i wish to say all that is necessary at once that it may be banished from my mindyour next step supposing the facts to be ascertained is to go with this lettermy answer to the duke of greenwich see himand see the marquis in matters of consequence have nothing to do with secondary peopledeal with the principals show in the first place as a lawyer that their divorce is unattainablenext show the marquis that he destroys his son and heir by attempting it the duke i believe would be glad of a pretext for dissolving the political connexion between me and the greenwich family he fears me and he fears the world he dares not abandon me without a pretence for the dissolution of friendship he is a weak man and never dares to act without a pretext but show him that a divorce is not necessary for his purposea separation will do as wellor without it i am ready to break with him at council in the house of lords on a hundred political points and let him shield himself as he may from the reproach of desertion by leaving the blame of quarrel on my impracticability or on what he will i care notso that my family be saved from the ignominy of divorce as he sealed his letter lord oldborough went on in abrupt sentences i never counted on a weak mans friendshipi can do without his gracewoman woman the sameever since the beginning of the world then turning to alfred to deliver the letter into his hand your brother major percy siri think i recollecthe was better in the west indies i was just thinking so my lord said alfred yesbetter encounter the plague than a fool lord oldborough had never before distinctly adverted to his knowledge of his nieces partiality for godfrey but his lordship now added major percys honourable conduct is not unknown i trust honourable conduct never was and never will be lost upon methis to the duke of greenwichand this to the marquissince it was to be i rejoice that this captain bellamy is the gallanthad it been your brother sircould there have been any love in the casenot observe that i believe in love much less am i subject to the weakness of remorsebut a twinge might have seized my mindi might possibly have been told that the marchioness was married against her inclinationbut i am at ease on that pointmy judgment of her was rightyou will let me know in one word the result of your negotiation without entering into particularsdivorce or no divorce is all i wish to hear alfred did not know all the circumstances of the marchioness of twickenhams marriage nor the peremptory manner in which it had been insisted upon by her uncle otherwise he would have felt still greater surprise than that which he now felt at the stern unbending character of the man possessed as lord oldborough was by the opinion that he had at the time judged and acted in the best manner possible no afterevents could make him doubt the justice of his own decision or could at all shake him in his own estimation alfred soon brought his report in one wordno divorce my lord thats welli thank you sir his lordship made no farther inquiriesnot even whether there was to be a separation alfred was commissioned by the duke of greenwich to deliver a message which like the messages of the gods in homer he delivered verbatim and without comment his grace of greenwich trusts lord oldborough will believe that notwithstanding the unfortunate circumstances which dissolved in some degree the family connexion it was the farthest possible from his graces wish or thoughts to break with lord oldborough as long as private feelings and public principles could be rendered by any means compatible lord oldborough smiled in scornand alfred could scarcely command his countenance lord oldborough prepared to give his grace the opportunity which he knew he desired of differing with him on principle his lordship thought his favour and power were now sufficiently established to be able to do without the duke of greenwich and his pride prompted him to show this to his grace and to the world he carried it with a high hand for a short time but even whilst he felt most secure and when all seemed to bend and bow before his genius and his sway many circumstances and many persons were combining to work the downfall of his power one of the first slight circumstances which shook his favour was a speech he had made to some gentleman about the presentation of the deanery to buckhurst falconer it had been supposed by many who knew the court which commissioner falconer paid to lord oldborough that it was through his lordships interest that this preferment was given to the son but when some person taking this for granted spoke of it to his lordship he indignantly disclaimed all part in the transaction and it is said that he added sir i know what is due to private regard as a manand as a minister what must be yielded to parliamentary influence but i never could have advised the bestowing ecclesiastical benefice and dignity upon any one whose conduct was not his first recommendation this speech made in a moment of proud and perhaps unguarded indignation was repeated with additions suppressions variations and comments any thing will at court serve the purpose of those who wish to injure and it is inconceivable what mischief was done to the minister by this slight circumstance in the first place the nobleman high in office and the family connexions of the nobleman who had made the exchange of livings and given the promise of the deanery to bishop clay were offended beyond redemptionbecause they were in the wrong then all who had done or wished to do wrong in similar instances were displeased by reflection or by anticipation but lord oldborough chiefly was injured by misrepresentation in the quarter where it was of most consequence to him to preserve his influence it was construed by the highest authority into disrespect and an imperious desire to encroach on favour to control prerogative and to subdue the mind of his sovereign insidious arts had long been secretly employed to infuse these ideas and when once the jealousy of power was excited every trifle confirmed the suspicion which lord oldboroughs uncourtierlike character was little calculated to dispel his popularity now gave umbrage and it was hinted that he wished to make himself the independent minister of the people the affairs of the country prospered however under his administration there was trouble there was hazard in change it was argued that it was best to wait at least for some reverse of fortune in war or some symptom of domestic discontent before an attempt should be made to displace this minister formidable by his talents and by the awe his commanding character inspired the habit of confidence and deference for his genius and integrity remained and to him no difference for some time appeared in consequence of the secret decay of favour commissioner falconer timid anxious restless was disposed by circumstances and by nature or by second nature to the vigilance of a dependents life accustomed to watch and consult daily the barometer of court favour he soon felt the coming storm and the moment he saw prognostics of the change he trembled and considered how he should best provide for his own safety before the hour of danger arrived numerous libels against the minister appeared which lord oldborough never read but the commissioner with his best spectacles read them all for he well knew and believed what the sage selden saith that though some make slight of libels yet you may see by them how the wind sets after determining by the throwing up of these straws which way the wind set the commissioner began with all possible skill and dexterity to trim his boat but dexterous trimmer though he was and prescient of change he did yet not foresee from what quarter the storm would come count altenbergs letters had unveiled completely the envoy cunningham falconers treachery as far as it related to his intrigues abroad and other friends detected some of his manoeuvres with politicians at home to whom he had endeavoured to pay court by betraying confidence reposed in him respecting the tourville papers much of the mischief cunningham had done this great minister still operated unknown to his unsuspicious mind but sufficient was revealed to determine lord oldborough to dismiss him from all future hopes of his favour mr commissioner falconer he began one morning the moment the commissioner entered his cabinet mr commissioner falconer in a tone which instantly dispelled the smile at entrance from the commissioners countenance and in the same moment changed his whole configurature my confidence is withdrawn from your son mr cunningham falconerfor everand not without good reasonas you mayif you are not aware of it alreadysee by those papers lord oldborough turned away and asked his secretaries for his red box as he was going to council just as he left his cabinet he looked back and said mr falconer you should know if you be not already apprised of it that your son cunningham is on his road to denmark you should be aware that the journey is not made by my desire or by his majestys order or by any official authority consequently he is travelling to the court of denmark at his own expense or yoursunless he can prevail upon his grace of greenwich to defray his ambassadorial travelling charges or can afford to wait for them till a total change of administrationof which sir if i see any symptoms today in council added his lordship in the tone of bitter irony i will give you fair noticefor fair dealing is what i practise this said the minister left the commissioner to digest his speech as he might and repaired to council where he found every thing apparently as smooth as usual and where he was received by all especially by the highest with perfect consideration meantime commissioner falconer was wretched beyond expressionwretched in the certainty that his son that he himself had probably lost irrecoverably one excellent patron before they had secured even in case of change another this premature discovery of cunninghams intrigues totally disconcerted and overwhelmed him and in the bitterness of his heart he cursed the duplicity which he had taught and encouraged still more by example than by precept but cunninghams duplicity had more and closer folds than his own cunningham conceited of his diplomatic genius and fearful of the cautious timidity of his father did not trust that father with the knowledge of all he did or half of what he intended so that the commissioner who had thought himself at the bottom of every thing now found that he too had been cheated by his son with false confidences and was involved by him in the consequences of a scheme of which he had never been the adviser commissioner falconer knew too well by the experience of cumberland and others the fate of those who suffer themselves to be lured on by secondhand promises and who venture without being publicly acknowledged by their employers to undertake any diplomatic mission nor would cunningham whose natural disposition to distrust was greater than his fathers have sold himself to any political tempter without first signing and sealing the compact had he been in possession of his cool judgment and had he been in any other than the desperate circumstances in which he was placed his secret conscience whispered that his recall was in consequence of the detection of some of his intrigues and he dreaded to appear before the haughty irritated minister deceived also by news from england that lord oldboroughs dismission or resignation could not be distant cunningham had ventured upon this bold stroke for an embassy on lord oldboroughs return from council the commissioner finding from his secret informants that every thing had gone on smoothly and being overawed by the confident security of the minister began to doubt his former belief and in spite of all the symptoms of change was now inclined to think that none would take place the sorrow and contrition with which he next appeared before lord oldborough were therefore truly sincere and when he found himself alone once more with his lordship earnest was the vehemence with which he disclaimed his unworthy son and disavowed all knowledge of the transaction if i had seen cause to believe that you had any part in this transaction sir you would not be here at this moment therefore your protestations are superfluousnone would be accepted if any were necessary the very circumstance of the sons not having trusted the father completely saved the commissioner for this time from utter ruin he took breath and presentlyoh weak man doomed never to know how to deal with a strong characterfancying that his intercession might avail for his son and that the pride of lord oldborough might be appeased and might be suddenly wrought to forgiveness by that tone and posture of submission and supplication used only by the subject to offended majesty he actually threw himself at the feet of the minister my gracious lorda pardon for my son i beseech you sir cried lord oldborough endeavouring to stop him from kneelingthe commissioner sunk instantly on his knee never will the unhappy father rise till his son be restored to your favour my lord sir said lord oldborough i have no favour for those who have no sense of honour rise mr falconer and let not the father degrade himself for the sonunavailingly the accent and look were decisivethe commissioner rose instead of being gratified his patron seemed shocked if not disgusted far from being propitiated by this sacrifice of dignity it rendered him still more averse and no consolatory omen appearing the commissioner withdrew in silence repenting that he had abased himself after this some days and nights passed with him in all the horrors of indecisioncould the minister weather the storm or notshould mr falconer endeavour to reinstate himself with lord oldborough or secure in time favour with the duke of greenwichmrs falconer to whom her husbands groans in the middle of the night at last betrayed the sufferings of his mind drew from him the secret of his fears and meditations she advised strongly the going over decidedly and in time but secretly to the greenwich faction the commissioner knew that this could not be done secretly the attention of the minister was now awake to all his motions and the smallest movement towards his grace of greenwich must be observed and understood on the other hand to abide by a falling minister was folly especially when he had positively withdrawn his favour from cunningham who had the most to expect from his patronage between these opposite difficulties notwithstanding the urgent excitations of mrs falconer the poor commissioner could not bring himself to decide till the time for action was past another blow came upon him for which he was wholly unpreparedthere arrived from abroad accounts of the failure of a secret expedition and the general in his despatches named colonel john falconer as the officer to whose neglect of orders he principally attributed the disappointment it appeared that orders had been sent to have his regiment at a certain place at a given hour at the moment these orders came colonel john falconer was out on a shooting party without leave the troops of course on which the general had relied did not arrive in time and all his other combinations failed from this neglect of discipline and disobedience of orders colonel falconer was sent home to be tried by a courtmartial i pity you sir said lord oldborough as commissioner falconer white as ashes read in his presence these despatchesi pity you sir from my soul here is no fault of yoursthe fault is mine it was one of the few faults of this nature which lord oldborough had ever committed except in the instance of the falconer family none could name any whom his lordship had placed in situations for which they were inadequate or unfit of this single error he had not foreseen the consequences they were more important more injurious to him and to the public than he could have calculated or conceived it appeared now as if the falconer family were doomed to be his ruin that the public knew in general that john falconer had been promoted by ministerial favour lord oldborough was aware but he imagined that the peculiar circumstances of that affair were known only to himself and to commissioner falconers family to his astonishment he found at this critical moment that the whole transaction had reached the ear of majesty and that it was soon publicly known the commissioner with protestations and oaths declared that the secret had never by his means transpiredit had been divulged by the baseness of his son cunningham who betrayed it to the greenwich faction they skilled in all the arts of undermining a rival employed the means that were thus put into their power with great diligence and effect it was observed at the levee that the sovereign looked coldly upon the minister every courtier whispered that lord oldborough had been certainly much to blame disdainful of their opinions lord oldborough was sensibly affected by the altered eye of his sovereign what after all my servicesat the first change of fortune this sentiment swelled in his breast but his countenance was rigidly calm his demeanour towards the courtiers and towards his colleagues more than usually firm if not haughty after the levee he demanded a private audience alone with the king the habitual influence of this great ministers superior genius operated the cold manner was changed or rather it was changed involuntarily from one not used to the language of apology the frank avowal of a fault has a striking effect lord oldborough took upon himself the whole blame of the disaster that had ensued in consequence of his error an error frequent in other ministers in him almost unprecedented he was answered with a smile of royal raillery that the peculiar family circumstances which had determined his lordship so rapidly to promote that officer must to all fathers of families and heads of houses if not to statesmen and generals be a sufficient and home apology considering the peculiar talent which his sovereign possessed and in which he gloried that of knowing the connexions and domestic affairs not only of the nobility near his person but of private individuals remote from his court lord oldborough had little cause to be surprised that this secret transaction should be known to his majesty something of this his lordship with all due respect hinted in reply at the termination of this audience he was soothed by the condescending assurance that whilst the circumstances of the late unfortunate reverse naturally created regret and mortification no dissatisfaction with his ministerial conduct mixed with these feelings on the contrary he was assured that fear of the effect a disappointment might have on the mind of the public in diminishing confidence in his lordships efforts for the good of the country was the sentiment which had lowered the spirits and clouded the brow of majesty his lordship returned thanks for the gracious demonstration of these sentimentsand bowing respectfully withdrew in the faces and behaviour of the courtiers as in a glass he saw reflected the truth they all pretended to be in the utmost consternation and he heard of nothing but apprehensions for the effect on the public mind and fears for his lordships popularity his secretary mr temple heard indeed more of this than could reach his lordships ear directly for even now when they thought they foresaw his fall few had sufficient courage to hazard the tone of condolence with lord oldborough or to expose the face of hypocrisy to the severity of his penetrating eye in secret every means had been taken to propagate in the city the knowledge of all the circumstances that were unfavourable to the minister and to increase the dissatisfaction which any check in the success of our armies naturally produces the tide of popularity which had hitherto supported the minister suddenly ebbed and he fell in public opinion with astonishing rapidity for the moment all was forgotten but that he was the person who had promoted john falconer to be a colonel against whom the cry of the populace was raised with all the clamour of national indignation the greenwich faction knew how to take advantage of this disposition it happened to be some festival some holiday when the common people having nothing to do are more disposed than at any other time to intoxication and disorder the emissaries of designing partisans mixed with the populace and a mob gathered round the ministers carriage as he was returning home late one daythe same carriage and the same man whom but a few short weeks before this populace had drawn with loud huzzas and almost with tears of affection unmoved of mind as he had been when he heard their huzzas lord oldborough now listened to their execrations till from abuse they began to proceed to outrage stones were thrown at his carriage one of his servants narrowly escaped being struck lord oldborough was alonehe threw open his carriagedoor and sprang out on the step whose life is it you seek cried he in a voice which obtained instant silence lord oldboroughs lord oldborough stands before you take his life who daresa life spent in your service strike but strike openly you are englishmen not assassins then turning to his servants he added in a calm voice homeslowly not a man here will touch you keep your master in sight if i fall mark by what hand then stepping down into the midst of the people he crossed the street to the flagged pathway the crowd opening to make way for him he walked on with a deliberate firm step the mob moving along with him sometimes huzzaing sometimes uttering horrid execrations in horrid tones lord oldborough preserving absolute silence still walked on never turned his head or quickened his pace till he reached his own house then facing the mob as he stood waiting till the door should be opened the people struck with his intrepidity with one accord joined in a shout of applause the next instant and before the door was opened they cried hat offhat off lord oldboroughs hat never stirred a man took up a stone mark that man cried lord oldborough the door opened return to your homes my countrymen and bless god that you have not any of you to answer this night for murder then entering his house he took off his hat and gave it to one of his attendants his secretary temple had run down stairs to meet him inquiring what was the cause of the disturbance only said lord oldborough that i have served the people but never bent to them curse them they are not worth serving oh i thought theyd have taken my lords life that minute cried his faithful servant rodney the sight left my eyes i thought he was gone for ever thank god hes safe take off my lords coati cantfor the soul of me curse those ungrateful people do not curse them my good rodney said lord oldborough smiling poor people they are not ungrateful only mistaken those who mislead them are to blame the english are a fine people even an english mob you see is generous and just as far as it knows lord oldborough was sound asleep this night before any other individual in the house had finished talking of the dangers he had escaped the civil and military courage shown by the minister in the sudden attack upon his character and person were such as to raise him again at once to his former height in public esteem his enemies were obliged to affect admiration the greenwich party foiled in this attempt now disavowed it news of a victory effaced the memory of the late disappointment stocks roseaddresses for a change of ministry were quashedaddresses of thanks and congratulation poured inlord oldborough gave them to mr temple to answer and kept the strength of his attention fixed upon the great objects which were essential to the nation and the sovereign he served mr falconer saw that the storm had blown over the darkness was pastlord oldborough firm and superior stood bright in power and before him the commissioner bent more obsequious more anxious than ever anxious he might well beunhappy father the life perhaps of one of his sons his honour certainly at stakethe fortune of anotherhis existence ruined and what hopes of propitiating him who had so suffered by the favour he had already shown who had been betrayed by one of the family and disgraced by another the commissioners only hope was in the recollection of the words i pity you from my soul sir which burst from lord oldborough even at the moment when he had most reason to be enraged against colonel falconer following up this idea and working on the generous compassion of which but for this indication he should not have supposed the stern lord oldborough to be susceptible the commissioner appeared before him every day the image of a brokenhearted father in silence lord oldborough from time to time looked at him and by these looks more than by all the promises of all the great men who had ever spoken to him mr falconer was reassured and as he told mrs falconer who at this time was in dreadful anxiety he felt certain that lord oldborough would not punish him for the faults of his sonshe was satisfied that his place and his pension would not be taken from himand that at least in fortune they should not be utterly ruined in this security the commissioner showed rather more than his customary degree of strength of mind and more knowledge of lord oldboroughs character than he had upon most other occasions evinced things were in this state when one morning after the minister had given orders that no one should be admitted as he was dictating some public papers of consequence to mr temple the duke of greenwich was announced his grace sent in a note to signify that he waited upon lord oldborough by order of his majesty and that if this hour were not convenient he begged to have the hour named at which his grace could be admitted his grace was admitted instantly mr temple retiredfor it was evident this was to be a secret conference his grace of greenwich entered with the most important solemnityinfinitely more ceremonious than usual he was at last seated and after heavy and audible sighs still hesitated to open his business through the affected gloom and dejection of his countenance lord oldborough saw a malicious pleasure lurking whilst in a studied exordium he spoke of the infinite reluctance with which he had been compelled by his majestys express orders to wait upon his lordship on a business the most painful to his feelings as being a public colleagueas a near and dear connexionas a friend in long habits of intimacy with his lordship he had prayed his majesty to be excused but it was his majestys pleasure he had only now to beg his lordship to believe that it was with infinite concern c lord oldborough though suffering under this circumlocution never condescended to show any symptom of impatience but allowing his grace to run the changes on the words and forms of apology when these were exhausted his lordship simply said that his majestys pleasure of course precluded all necessity for apology his grace was vexed to find lord oldborough still unmovedhe was sure this tranquillity could not long endure he continued a sad business my lorda terrible discoveryi really can hardly bring myself to speak lord oldborough gave his grace no assistance my private regard he repeated a smile of contempt on lord oldboroughs countenance your lordships hitherto invulnerable public integrity a glance of indignation from lord oldborough hitherto invulnerableyour grace will explain let thesethese fatal noteslettersunfortunately got into the hands of a leading impracticable member of opposition and by him laidwould that i had been apprised or could have conceived it possible time enough to prevent that step but it was done before i had the slightest intimationlaid before his majesty lord oldborough calmly received the letters from his grace my own handwriting and private seal i perceive the duke sighedand whilst lord oldborough drew out opened and read the first letter in the parcel his grace went onthis affair has thrown us all into the greatest consternation it is to be brought before parliament immediatelyunless a resignation should take placewhich we should all deplore the impudence the inveteracy of that fellow is astonishingno silencing him we might hush up the affair if his majesty had not been apprised but where the interest of the service is concerned his majesty is warm his majesty cried lord oldborough his majesty could not i trust for a moment imagine these letters to be i mine but for the hand and seal which i understood your lordship to acknowledge i am persuaded his majesty could not have believed it believed my king did he believe it cried lord oldborough his agitation was for a moment excessive uncontrollable no that i will never credit till i have it from his own lips then commanding himself your grace will have the goodness to leave these letters with me till tomorrow his grace with infinite politeness and regret was under the necessity of refusing this request his orders were only to show the letters to his lordship and then to restore them to the hands of the member of opposition who had laid them before his majesty lord oldborough took off the cover of one of the letters on which was merely the address and seal the address was written also at the bottom of the letter enclosed therefore the cover could not be of the least importance the duke could not lord oldborough said refuse to leave this with him to this his grace agreedprotesting that he was far from wishing to make difficulties if there were any thing else he could doany thing his lordship would wish to have privately insinuated or publicly said his lordship with proud thanks assured the duke he did not wish to have any thing privately insinuated and whatever it was necessary to say or do publicly he should do himself or give orders to have done his lordship entered into no farther explanation the duke at last was obliged to take his leave earnestly hoping and trusting that this business would terminate to his lordships entire satisfaction no sooner was the duke gone than lord oldborough rang for his carriage immediatelyand mr temple instantly whilst his carriage was coming to the door in the shortest manner possible lord oldborough stated the facts to his secretary that letters had been forged in his lordships name promising to certain persons promotion in the armyand navygratificationand pensions some were addressed to persons who had actually obtained promotion shortly after the time of these letters others contained reproaches for having been illused even from the rapid glance lord oldborough had taken of these papers he had retained the names of several of the persons to whom they were addressedand the nature of the promotion obtained they were persons who could have had no claim upon an honest minister his lordship left a list of them with mr templealso the cover of the letter on which was a specimen of the forged writing and the private seal i am going to the king in my absence mr temple think for mei know you feel for me the object is to discover the authors of this forgery my lord may i consult with mr alfred percy yeswith no other person it was not lord oldboroughs day for doing business with the king he was latethe king was going out to ride his majesty received the minister as usual but notwithstanding the condescension of his majestys words and manner it was evident to lord oldboroughs penetration that there was a coldness and formality in the kings countenance i beg i may not detain your majestyi see i am late said lord oldborough is the business urgent my lord no sir for it concerns principally myself it can therefore wait your majestys leisure at any hour your majesty may appoint the king dismounted instantly this moment my lord i am at leisure for any business that concerns your lordship the king returned to the palacelord oldborough followed and all the spectators on foot and horseback were left full of curiosity notwithstanding the condescension of his majestys words and manner and the polite promptitude to attend to any business that concerned his lordship it was evident to lord oldboroughs penetration that there was an unusual coldness and formality in the kings countenance and deportment unlike the graciousness of his reception when satisfied and pleased as soon as the business of the day had been gone through lord oldborough said he must now beg his majestys attention on a subject which principally concerned himself the king looked as one prepared to hear but determined to say as little as possible lord oldborough placed himself so as to give the king the advantage of the light which he did not fear to have full on his own countenance sir certain letters signed with my name and sealed with my seal have i am informed been laid before your majesty your lordship has been rightly informed i trusti hope that your majesty at the firm assertion in the tone with which lord oldborough pronounced i trusthis majestys eye changedand moved away from lord oldboroughs when he with respectful interrogation of tone added i hope your majesty could not believe those letters to be mine frankly my lord said the king the assertions the insinuations of no man or set of men of any rank or weight in my dominions could by any imaginable means have induced me to conceive it possible that such letters had been written by your lordship not for one moment could my belief have been compelled by any evidence less strong than your lordships handwriting and seal i own i thought i knew your lordships seal and writing but i now see that i have been deceived and i rejoice to see it i thank your majesty i cannot feel surprise that a forgery and a counterfeit which at first view compelled my own belief of their being genuine should for a moment have deceived you sir but i own i had flattered myself that my sovereign knew my heart and character yet better than my seal and signature undoubtedly my lord and i should have hoped that if your majesty had perused those letters no assertions could have been necessary on my part to convince you sir that they could not be mine i have now only to rejoice that your majesty is undeceived and that i have not intruded unnecessarily with this explanation i am fully sensible sir of your goodness in having thus permitted me to make as early as possible this assertion of my innocence for the proofs of it and for the detection of the guilty i am preparing and i hope to make these as clear to you sir as your majestys assurance of the pleasure you feel in being undeceived is satisfactoryconsolatory to me concluded lord oldborough with a bow of profound yet proud respect my lord said the king i have no doubt that this affair will redound to your honour and terminate to your lordships entire satisfaction the very phrase used by the duke of greenwich as to myself your lordship can have no farther anxiety but i wish your lordships endeavours to detect and bring proofs home to the guilty may be promptly successfulfor the gratification of your own feelings and the satisfaction of the public mind before the matter should be brought forward in parliament his majesty bowed and as lord oldborough retired he added some gracious phrases expressive of the high esteem he felt for the minister and the interest he had always and should always take in whatever could contribute to his public and privatesatisfactionagain to an eye and ear less practised in courts than this ministers all that had been said would have been really satisfactory but lord oldborough discerned a secret embarrassment in the smile a constraint in the manner a care an effort to be gracious in the language a caution a rounding of the periods a recurrence to technical phrases of compliment and amity a want of the free fluent language of the heart language which as it flows whether from sovereign or subject leaves a trace that the art of courtier or of monarch cannot imitate in all attempts at such imitation there is a want of which vanity and even interest is not always sensible but which feeling perceives instantly lord oldborough felt itand twice during this audience he was on the point of offering his resignation and twice exerting strong power over himself he refrained he saw plainly that he was not where he had been in the kings confidence that his enemies had been at work and in some measure had succeeded that suspicions had been infused into the kings mind that his king had doubted him his majesty had confessedand lord oldborough discerned that there was no genuine joy at the moment his majesty was undeceived no real anxiety for his honour only the ostensible manifestation suitable to the occasionrepeatableor recordable still there was nothing of which he could complain every expression if written down or repeated must have appeared proper and gracious from the sovereign to his minister and for that minister to resign at such a moment from pride or pique would have been fatal to the dignity perhaps to the integrity of his character lord oldborough reasoned thus as he stood in the presence of the king and compelled himself during the whole audience and to the last parting moment to preserve an air and tone of calm respectful selfpossession chapter xxxviii during lord oldboroughs absence his faithful secretary had been active in his service mr temple went immediately to his friend alfred percy alfred had just returned fatigued from the courts and was resting himself in conversation with his wife and caroline i am sorry to disturb you alfred said mr temple but i must take you away from these ladies to consult you on particular business oh let the particular business wait till he has rested himself said mrs percy unless it be a matter of life and death life and death cried lady frances arlington running in at the open dooryes it is a matter of life and deathstay mr temple mr percy going the moment i come into the roomimpossible impossible it would be said mr temple in any other case but when a ladys in the case you know all other things give place cried lady frances so positively gentlemen i stop the way but mr temple to comfort youfor i never saw a man gallant or ungallant look so impatienti shall not be able to stay above a momentthank you mrs percy i cant sit downmrs crabstock the crossest of crabstocks and stiffest of patternwomen is in the carriage waiting for me give me joyi have accomplished my purpose and without lady jane granvilles assistanceobtained a permit to go with lady trant and made her take me to lady angelicas last night grand conversazionesaw the german baron caught both the profileshave em heredefy you not to smile look cried her ladyship drawing out of her reticule a caricature which she put into carolines hand and whilst she was looking at it lady frances went on speaking rapidly only a sketch a scrawl in pencil while they thought i was copying a sonnet to wisdomon the worst bit of paper too in the worldold cover of a letter i stole from lady trants reticule while she was at cards mr temple you shall see my chefdoeuvre by and by dont look at the reverse of the medal pray did not i tell you you were the most impatient man in the world it was true that mr temple was at this instant most impatient to get possession of the paper for on the back of that cover of the letter on which the caricature was drawn the handwriting of the direction appeared to himhe dared scarcely believe his eyeshis hopes mrs crabstock my lady said the footman is waiting i know sir said lady frances so caroline you wont see the likeness very well if i cant get a compliment i must be off when you draw a caricature i wont praise it here mr temple one look since you are dying for it one look will not satisfy me cried mr temple seizing the paper your ladyship must leave the drawing with us till tomorrow usmust given at our court of st jamess lord oldboroughs own imperative style imperative no humbly i beseech your ladyship thus humbly cried mr temple kneeling in jest but keeping in earnest fast hold of the paper but whywhy are you acquainted with lady angelica i did not know you knew her it is excellentit is admirablei cannot let it go this hand that seized it long shall hold the prize the mans mad but dont think ill give it to youi would not give it to my mother but ill lend it to you if youll tell me honestly why you want it honestlyi want to show it to a particular friend who will be delighted with it tell me who this minute or you shall not have it mrs crabstock my lady bids me say the duchess the duchessthe deuceif shes come to the duchess i must go i hope your man mrs percy wont tell mrs crabstock he saw this gentleman kneeling mrs crabstocks getting out my lady said the footman returning mr temple for mercys sake get up never till your ladyship gives the drawing there there let me goaudacious good morning to you mrs percygood bye carolinebe at lady janes tonight for im to be there her ladyship ran off and met mrs crabstock on the stairs with whom we leave her to make her peace as she pleases my dear temple i believe you are out of your senses said alfred i never saw any man so importunate about a drawing that is not worth a strawtrembling with eagerness and kneelingcaroline what do you think rosamond would have thought of all this if she knew the whole she would have thought i acted admirably said mr temple but come i have business alfred took him into his study and there the whole affair was explained mr temple had brought with him the specimen of the forgery to show to alfred and upon comparing it with the handwriting on the cover of the letter on which the caricature was drawn the similarity appeared to be strikingly exact the cover which had been stolen as lady frances arlington said from lady trants reticule was directed to captain nuttall he was one of the persons to whom forged letters had been written as appeared by the list which lord oldborough had left with mr temple the secretary was almost certain that his lordship had never written with his own hand to any captain nuttall but this he could ask the moment he should see lord oldborough again it seemed as if this paper had never been actually used as the cover of a letter for it had no postmark seal or wafer upon farther inspection it was perceived that a t had been left out in the name of nuttall and it appeared probable that the cover had been thrown aside and a new one written in consequence of this omission but alfred did not think it possible that lady trant could be the forger of these letters because he had seen some of her ladyships notes of invitation to caroline and they were written in a wretched cramped hand but that cramped hand might be feigned to conceal the powers of penmanship said mr temple well granting her ladyships talents were equal to the mere execution alfred persisted in thinking she had not abilities sufficient to invent or combine all the parts of such a scheme she might be an accomplice but she must have had a principaland who could that principal be the same suspicion the same person came at the same moment into the heads of both gentlemen as they sat looking at each other there is an intimacy between them said alfred recollect all the pains lady trant took for mrs falconer about english claythey mrs falconer but how could she possibly get at lord oldboroughs private seala seal that is always locked upa seal never used to any common letter never to any but those written by his own hand to some private friend and on some very particular occasion since i have been with him i have not seen him use that seal three times when and to whom can you recollect said alfred i recollecti have it all exclaimed mr temple striking the tablei have it but lady frances arlingtoni am sorry she is gone why what of herlady frances can have nothing more to do with the business she has a great deal more i can assure youbut without knowing it of that i am certain or all the world would have known it long ago but tell me how i recollect at the time when i was dangling after lady francestheres good in every thingjust before we went down to falconercourt her ladyship who you know has always some reigning fancy was distracted about what she called breadseals she took off the impression of seals with breadno matter how but she didand used to torment meno i thought it a great pleasure at the timeto procure for her all the pretty seals i could but surely you did not give her lord oldboroughs inot ihow could you imagine such a thing you were in love and might have forgotten consequences a man in love may forget every thing i grantexcept his fidelity no i never gave the seal but i perfectly recollect lady frances showing it to me in her collection and my asking her how she came by it and how did she from the cover of a note which the duke her uncle had received from lord oldborough and i at the time remembered his lordships having written it to the duke of greenwich on the birth of his grandson lord oldborough had upon a former occasion affronted his grace by sending him a note sealed with a waferthis time his lordship took special care and sealed it with his private seal of honour well but how does this bring the matter home to mrs falconer said alfred stayi am bringing it as near home to her as possible we all went down to falconercourt together and there i remember lady frances had her collection of breadseals and was daubing and colouring them with vermilionand mrs falconer was so anxious about themand lady frances gave her severali must see lady frances again directly to inquire whether she gave her among the rest lord oldboroughsill go to lady jane granvilles this evening on purpose but had i not better go this moment to lady trant alfred advised that having traced the matter thus far they should not hazard giving any alarm to lady trant or to mrs falconer but should report to lord oldborough what progress had been made mr temple accordingly went home to be in readiness for his lordships return in the mean time the first exaltation of indignant pride having subsided and his cool judgment reflecting upon what had passed lord oldborough considered that however satisfactory to his own mind might be the feeling of his innocence the proofs of it were necessary to satisfy the public he saw that his character would be left doubtful and at the mercy of his enemies if he were in pique and resentment hastily to resign before he had vindicated his integrity if your proofs be produced my lordthese words recurred to him and his anxiety to obtain these proofs rose high and high was his satisfaction the moment he saw his secretary for by the first glance at mr temples countenance he perceived that some discovery had been made alfred that night received through mr temple his lordships request that he would obtain what farther information he could relative to the private seal in whatever way he thought most prudent his lordship trusted entirely to his discretionmr temple was engaged with other business alfred went with caroline to lady jane granvilles to meet lady frances arlington he entered into conversation and by degrees brought her to his point playing all the time with her curiosity and humouring her childishness while he carried on his crossexamination at first she could not recollect any thing about making the seals he talked of it was a fancy that had passedand a past fancy she said was like a past love or a past beauty good for nothing but to be forgotten however by proper leading of the witness and suggesting time place and circumstance he did bring to the fair ladys mind all that he wanted her to remember she could not conceive what interest mr percy could take in the matterit was some jest about mr temple she was sure yes she did recollect a seal with a cupid riding a lion that mr temple gave her just before they went to falconercourtwas that what he meant nobut a curious seal alfred described the device lord oldboroughs yes there was some such odd seal but it was not given to her by mr templeshe took that from a note to her uncle the duke of greenwich yesthat alfred said he knew but what did her ladyship do with it you know how i got it bless me you seem to know every thing i do and say you know my affairs vastly wellyou act the conjuror admirablypray can you tell me whom i am to marry that i willwhen your ladyship has told me to whom you gave that seal that i would and welcome if i could recollectbut i really cant if you think i gave it to mr temple i assure you you are mistakenyou may ask him i know your ladyship did not give it to mr templebut to whom did you give it i remember nownot to any gentleman after allyou are positively out i gave it to mrs falconer you are certain of that lady frances arlington i am certain mr alfred percy and how can you prove it to me lady frances the easiest way in the worldby asking mrs falconer only i dont go there now much since georgiana and i have quarrelledbut what can make you so curious about it thats a secretat the word secret her attention was fixedmay i ask if your ladyship would know the seal again if you saw itis this any thing like the impression showing her the seal on the forged cover the very same that i gave mrs falconer ill swear to itill tell you how i know it particularly theres a little outer rim here with points to it which there is not to the other i fastened my breadseal into an old setting of my own from which i had lost the stone mrs falconer took a fancy to it among a number of others so i let her have it now i have answered all your questionsanswer minewhom am i to marry your ladyship will marry whomsoeveryour ladyship pleases that was an ambiguous answer she observed for that she pleased every body her ladyship was going to run on with some further questions but alfred pretending that the oracle was not permitted to answer more explicitly left her completely in the dark as to what his meaning had been in this whole conversation he reported progress to lord oldboroughand his lordship slept as soundly this night as he did the night after he had been attacked by the mob the next morning the first person he desired to see was mr falconerhis lordship sent for him into his cabinet mr commissioner falconer i promised to give you notice whenever i should see any probability of my going out of power good heaven my lord exclaimed the commissioner starting back the surprise the consternation were reallord oldborough had his eye upon him to determine that point impossible surelyi hope his hope flitted at the moment to the duke of greenwichbut returned instantly he had made no termshad missed his time if lord oldborough should go out of officehis place his pension goneutter ruin lord oldborough marked the vacillation and confusion of his countenance and saw that he was quite unprepared i hopemerciful powers i trusti thought your lordship had triumphed over all your enemies and was firmer in favour and power than ever what can have occurred without making any answer lord oldborough beckoned to the commissioner to approach nearer the window where his lordship was standing and then suddenly put into his hand the cover with the forged handwriting and seal what am i to understand by this my lord said the bewildered commissioner turning it backwards and forwards captain nuttalli never saw the man in my life may i ask my lord what i am to comprehend from this i see sir that you know nothing of the business the whole was explained by lord oldborough succinctly the astonishment and horror in the poor commissioners countenance and gestures and still more the eagerness with which he begged to be permitted to try to discover the authors of this forgery were sufficient proofs that he had not the slightest suspicion that the guilt could be traced to any of his own family lord oldboroughs look fixed on the commissioner expressed what it had once before expressedsir from my soul i pity you the commissioner saw this look and wondered why lord oldborough should pity him at a time when all his lordships feelings should naturally be for himself my lord i would engage we shall discoverwe shall trace it i believe that i have discoveredthat i have traced it said lord oldborough and he sighed now that sigh was more incomprehensible to the commissioner than all the rest and he stood with his lips open for a moment before he could utter why then resign my lord that is my affair said lord oldborough let us if you please sir think of yours for probably this is the only time i shall ever more have it in my power to be of the least service to you oh my lordmy lord dont say so said the commissioner quite forgetting all his artificial manner and speaking naturally the last time you shall have it in your poweroh my dear lord dont say so my dear sir i mustit gives me painyou see it does at such a time as this to think of me instead of yourself my lord i never knew you till this momentso well nor i you sir said lord oldborough it is the more unfortunate for us both that our connexion and intercourse must now for ever cease never never my lord if you were to go out of power tomorrowwhich heaven in its mercy and justice forbid i could never forget the goodnessi would never desertin spite of all interesti should continuei hope your lordship would permit me to pay my dutyall intercourse could never cease lord oldborough saw and almost smiled at the struggle between the courtier and the manthe confusion in the commissioners mind between his feelings and his interest partly his lordship relieved and partly he pained mr falconer by saying in his firm tone i thank you mr falconer but all intercourse must cease after this hour we meet no more i beg you sir to collect your spirits and to listen to me calmly before this day is at an end you will understand why all farther intercourse between us would be useless to your interest and incompatible with my honour before many hours are past a blow will be struck which will go to your heartfor i see you have oneand deprive you of the power of thought it is my wish to make that blow fall as lightly upon you as possible oh my lord your resignation would indeed be a blow i could never recover the bare apprehension deprives me at this moment of all power of thought but still i hope hear me sir i beg without interruption it is my business to think for you go immediately to the duke of greenwich make what terms with him you canmake what advantage you can of the secret of my approaching resignationa secret i now put in your power to communicate to his grace and which no one yet suspectsi having told it to no one living but to yourself go quickly to the duketime pressesi wish you successand a better patron than i have been than my principles would permit me to be farewell mr falconer the commissioner moved towards the door when lord oldborough said time presses but the commissioner stoppedturned backcould not go the tearsreal tearsrolled down his cheekslord oldborough went forward and held out his hand to himthe commissioner kissed it with the reverence with which he would have kissed his sovereigns hand and bowing he involuntarily backed to the door as if quitting the presence of majesty it is a pity that man was bred a mere courtier and that he is cursed with a family on none of whom there is any dependence thought lord oldborough as the door closed upon the commissioner for ever lord oldborough delayed an hour purposely to give mr falconer advantage of the day with the duke of greenwich then ordered his carriage and drove tomrs falconers great was her surprise at the ministers entranceconcerned the commissioner was not at home my business is with mrs falconer my lordyour lordshipthe honour and the pleasure of a visitgeorgiana my dear mrs falconer nodded to her daughter who most unwillingly and as if dying with curiosity retired the smile died away upon mrs falconers lips as she observed the stern gravity of lord oldboroughs countenance she moved a chair towards his lordshiphe stood and leaning on the back of the chair paused as he looked at her what is to comecunningham perhaps thought mrs falconer or perhaps something about john when will he speaki canti musti am happy to see your lordship looking so well is mrs falconer acquainted with lady trant lady trantyes my lord mercy is it possibleno for her own sake she would not betray me thought mrs falconer intimately said lord oldborough intimatelythat is as ones intimate with every body of a certain sortone visitsbut no fartheri cant say i have the honour mrs falconer was so distracted by seeing lord oldborough searching in his pocketbook for a letter that in spite of all her presence of mind she knew not what she said and all her presence of countenance failed when lord oldborough placed before her eyes the cover directed to captain nuttall can you guess how this came into lady trants possession madam i protest my lord her voice trembling in spite of her utmost efforts to command it i dont knownor can i conceive nor can you conceive by whom it was written madam it appearsit bears a resemblancesome likenessas far as i recollectbut it is so long since i have seen your lordships own handand hands are so likesometimesand i am so bad a judgeevery hand all fashionable hands are so like and every seal like every seal said lord oldborough placing the counterfeit seal before mrs falconer i recommend it to you madam to waste no farther time in evasion but to deliver to me the counterpart of this seal the impression of my private seal which you had from lady frances arlington a mere breadseal her ladyship surely has not saidi really have lost itif i ever had iti declare your lordship terrifies me so by this strange mode i recommend it to you once more madam and for the last time i earnestly recommend it to you to deliver up to me that seal for i have sworn to my belief that it is in your possession a warrant will in consequence be issued to seize and search your papers the purport of my present visit of which i should gladly have been spared the pain is to save you madam from the public disgrace of having a warrant executed do not faint madam if you can avoid it nor go into hysterics for if you do i must retire and the warrant must be executed your best course is to open that desk to give me up the seal to make to me at this instant a full confession of all you know of this transaction if you do thus for your husbands sake madam i will as far as i can consistently with what is due to myself spare you the shame of an arrest mrs falconer with trembling hands unlocked the desk and delivered the seal and a letter which i see in the same handwriting madam if you please she gave it and then unable to support herself longer sunk upon a sofa but she neither fainted nor screamedshe was aware of the consequences lord oldborough opened the window to give her air she was relieved by a burst of tears and was silentand nothing was heard but her sobs which she endeavoured to suppress in vain she was more relieved on looking up by one glance at lord oldboroughs countenance where she saw compassion working strongly but before she could take any advantage of it the expression was changed the feeling was controlled he was conscious of its weaknesshe recollected what public justice and justice to his own character requiredhe recollected all the treachery the criminality of which she had been guilty madam you are not now in a condition i see to explain yourself fartheri will relieve you from my presence my reproaches you will never hear but i shall expect from you before one hour such an avowal in writing of this whole transaction as may with the written confession of lady trant afford the proofs which are due to my sovereign and to the public of my integrity mrs falconer bowed her head covered her face clasped her hands in agony as lord oldborough retired she sprang up followed to throw herself at his feet yet without knowing what she could say the commissioner is innocentif you forsake him he is undoneall all of us utterly ruined oh georgiana georgiana where are you speak for me georgiana was in an inner apartment trying on a new robe a la georgienne whatever you may wish farther to say to me madam said lord oldborough disengaging himself from her and passing decidedly on before georgiana appeared you will put in writing and let me have within this houror never within that hour commissioner falconer brought for lord oldborough the paper his wife had drawn up but which he was obliged to deliver to mr temple for lord oldborough had so ordered and his lordship persevered in refusing to see him more mrs falconers paper was worded with all the art and address of which she was mistress and all the pathos she could commandlord oldborough looked only for factsthese he marked with his pencil and observed where they corroborated and where they differed from lady trants confession which mr temple had been charged to obtain during his lordships visit to mrs falconer the greater part of the night lord oldborough and mr alfred percy were employed arranging these documents so as to put the proofs in the clearest and shortest form to be laid before his majesty the succeeding day it appeared that mrs falconer had been first tempted to these practices by the distress for money into which extravagant entertainments or as she stated the expenses incident to her situationexpenses which far exceeded her incomehad led her it was supposed from her having kept open house at times for the minister that she and the commissioner had great influence she had been applied topresents had been offered and she had long withstood but at length lady trant acting in concert with her they had been supplied with information by a clerk in one of the offices a relation of lady trant who was a vain incautious youth and it seems did not know the use made of his indiscretion he told what promotions he heard spoken ofwhat commissions were making out the ladies prophesied and their prophecies being accomplished they gained credit for some time they kept themselves behind the scenesand many applying to ab and dealing with they did not know whom paid for promotions which would have come unpaid for others paid and were never promoted and wrote letters of reproachcaptain nuttall was among these and he it was who finding himself duped first stirred in the business and by means of an active member of opposition to whom he made known his secret grievance brought the whole to light the proofs arranged and lord oldborough never slept till they were perfected he reposed tranquilly the next day asking an audience of his majesty he simply laid the papers on his majestys table observing that he had been so fortunate as to succeed in tracing the forgery and that he trusted these papers contained all the necessary proofs his lordship bowed and retired instantly leaving his majesty to examine the papers alone the resolution to resign his ministerial station had long been forming in lord oldboroughs mind it was not a resolution taken suddenly in pride or pique but after reflection and upon strong reasons it was a measure which he had long been revolving in his secret thoughts during the enthusiasm of political life the proverbial warnings against the vanity of ambition and the danger of dependence on the favour of princes had passed on his ear but as a schoolboys lesson a phrase to point a moral or adorn a tale he was not a reading man and the maxims of books he disregarded or disbelieved but in the observations he made for himself he trusted the lessons he drew from life were never lost upon him and he acted in consequence of that which he believed with a decision vigour and invariability seldom found even among philosophers of late years he had in real life seen striking instances of the treachery of courtiers and had felt some symptoms of insecurity in the smile of princes fortune had been favourable to himshe was ficklehe determined to quit her before she should change ambition it is true had tempted himhe had risen to her highest pinnacle he would not be hurled from highhe would descend voluntarily and with dignity lord oldboroughs habits of thought were as different as possible from those of a metaphysician he had reflected less upon the course of his own mind than upon almost any other subject but he knew human nature practically disquisitions on habit passion or the sovereign good were unread by him nor in the course of his life had he ever formed a system moral or prudential but the same penetration the same longanimity which enabled him to govern the affairs of a great nation gave him when his attention turned towards himself a foresight for his own happiness in the meridian of life he had cherished ambition as the only passion that could supply him with motive strong enough to call great powers into great action but of late years he had felt something not only of the waywardness of fortune but of the approaches of agenot in his mind but in his health which had suffered by his exertions the attacks of hereditary gout had become more violent and more frequent if he lived these would probably at seasons often incapacitate him from his arduous ministerial duties much that he did well must be ill done by deputy he had ever reprobated the practice of leaving the business of the nation to be done by clerks and underlings in office yet to this the minister however able however honest must come at last if he persist in engrossing business and power beyond what an individual can wield love for his country a sense of his own honour integrity and consistency here combined to determine this great minister to retire while it was yet timeto secure at once the dignity and happiness of the evening of life the day had been devoted to good and high purposesthat was enoughhe could now selfsatisfied and full of honour bid adieu to ambition this resolution once formed was fixed in vain even his sovereign endeavoured to dissuade him from carrying it into execution when the king had examined the papers which lord oldborough had laid before him his majesty sent for his lordship again and the moment the minister entered the cabinet his majesty expressed his perfect satisfaction in seeing that his lordship had with so little trouble and with his usual ability got to the bottom of this affair what was to be done next the duke of greenwich was to be summoned his grace was in astonishment when he saw the papers which contained lord oldboroughs complete vindication and the crimination of mrs falconer through the whole as he read on his grace had but one idea viz commissioner falconer has deceived me with false intelligence of the intended resignation not one word was said by lord oldborough to give his grace hope of that eventtill the member of opposition by whom the forged letters had been producedtill all those who knew or had heard any thing of the transaction were clearly and fully apprised of the truth after this was established and that all saw lord oldborough clear and bright in honour and at least apparently as firm in power as he had ever been to the astonishment of his sovereign his lordship begged permission to resign whatever might have been the effect of misrepresentation to lower lord oldboroughs favour at the moment when he spoke of retiring his king recollected all his past servicesall that must in future be hazarded and lost in parting with such a ministerso eminent in abilities of such tried integrity of such fidelity such attachment to his person such a zealous supporter of royalty such a favourite with his people so successful as well as so able a minister never was he so much valued as at this moment all his sovereigns early attachment returned in full strength and warmth no my lord you must notyou will not leave me these simple words spoken with the warmth of the heart touched lord oldborough more than can be told it was difficult to resist them especially when he saw tears in the eyes of the monarch whom he loved but his resolution was taken he thanked his majesty not with the commonplace thanks of courtiers but with his whole heart and soul he thanked his majesty for this gracious condescensionthis testimony of approbationthese proofs of sensibility to his attachment which paidoverpaid him in a moment for the labours of a life the recollection of them would be the glory the solace of his agecould never leave his memory while life lastedwould he thought be present to him if he should retain his senses in his dying moment but he was in the midst of this strong feeling firm to the resolution his reason had taken he humbly represented that he had waited for a favourable time when the affairs of the country were in a prosperous train when there were few difficulties to embarrass those whom his majesty might name to succeed to his place at the head of administration there were many who were ambitious of that stationzeal talents and the activity of youth were at his majestys command for himself he found it necessary for his health and happiness to retire from public business and to resign the arduous trust with which he had been honoured my lord if i must accept of your resignation i mustbut i do it with regret is there any thing your lordship wishesany thing you will name for yourself or your friends that i can do to show my sense of your services and merit for myself your majestys bounty has left me nothing to wish for your friends then my lordlet me have the satisfaction of obliging you through them nothing could be more gracious or more gratifying than the whole of this parting audience it was lord oldboroughs last audience the news of his resignation quickly whispered at court was not that day publicly known or announced the next morning his lordships door was crowded beyond example in the memory of ministers mr temple by his lordships order announced as soon as possible the ministers having resigned all were in astonishmentmany in sorrow some fewa very few of the most insignificant of the crowd persons incapable of generous sympathy who thought they could follow their own paltry interests unnoticedleft the room without paying their farewell respects to this great ministerminister now no more the moment he appeared there was sudden silence all eyes were fixed upon him every one pressing to get into the circle gentlemen thank you for these marks of attentionof regard mr temple has told youyou know my friends that i am a man without power we know answered a distinguished gentleman that you are lord oldborough with or without power the same in the eyes of your friends and of the british nation lord oldborough bowed low and looked gratified his lordship then went round the circle with an air more cheerful more free from reserve than usual with something in his manner more of sensibility but nothing less of dignity all who merited distinction he distinguished by some few appropriate words which each remembered afterwards and repeated to their families and friends he spoke or listened to each individual with the attention of one who is courting not quitting popularity free from that restraint and responsibility which his public and ministerial duties had imposed upon him he now entered into the private concerns of all and gave his parting assistance or counsel he noted all grievancesregistered all promises that ought to be recommended to the care of his successor in office the wishes of many to whom he had forborne to give any encouragement he now unexpectedly fulfilled and surpassed when all were satisfied and had nothing more to ask or to hope from him they yet delayed and parted from lord oldborough with difficulty and regret a proof that justice commands more than any other quality the respect and gratitude of mankind take time and numbers into the calculation and all discover in their turn the advantage of this virtue this minister a few regretted instances excepted had shown no favour but strict justice in his patronage all lord oldboroughs requests for his friends were grantedall his recommendations attended to it was grateful to him to feel that his influence lasted after his power had ceased though the sun had apparently set its parting rays continued to brighten and cheer the prospect under a new minister mr temple declined accepting of the embassy which had been offered to him remuneration suitable to his services and to the high terms in which lord oldborough had spoken of his merit was promised and without waiting to see in what form or manner this promise would be accomplished the secretary asked and obtained permission to accompany his revered master to his retirement alfred percy zealous and ardent in lord oldboroughs service the more this great mans character had risen upon his admiration had already hastened to the country to prepare every thing at clermontpark for his reception by his orders that establishment had been retrenched by alfred percys activity it was restored services which the richest nobleman in the land could not have purchased or the highest have commanded alfred was proud to pay as a voluntary tribute to a noble character lord oldborough set out for the country at a very early hour in the morning and no one previously knew his intentions except mr temple he was desirous to avoid what it had been whispered was the design of the people to attend him in crowds through the streets of the metropolis as they drove out of town lord oldborough recollected that in some account either of the duke of marlborough or the duke of ormonds leaving london after his dismission from court it is said that of all those whom the duke had served all those who had courted and flattered him in the time of his prosperity and power none showed any gratitude or attachment excepting one page who appeared at the coachdoor as his master was departing and gave some signs of genuine sorrow and respect i am fortunate said lord oldborough in having few complaints to make of ingratitude i make none the few i might make continued his lordship who now rewarded mr temples approved fidelity by speaking to him with the openness and confidence of friendship the few i might make have been chiefly caused by errors of my own in the choice of the persons i have obliged i thank heaven however that upon the whole i leave public life not only with a good conscience but with a good opinion of human nature i speak not of courtiersthere is nothing of nature about themthey are what circumstances make them were i to live my life over again the hours spent with courtiers are those which i should most wish to be spared but by a statesman or a minister these cannot be avoided for myself in resigning my ministerial office i might say as charles the fifth when he abdicated said to his successor i leave you a heavy burthen for since my shoulders have borne it i have not passed one day exempt from anxiety but from the first moment i started in the course of ambition i was aware that tranquillity must be sacrificed and to the last moment i abided by the sacrifice the good i had in view i have reachedthe prize at which i aimed i have won the glory of england was my objecther approbation my reward generous peopleif ever i bore toil or peril in your cause i am rewarded and never shall you hear me say that the unfruitful glories please no more the esteem of my sovereigni possess it it is indefeasibly mine his favour his smiles are his to give or take away never shall he hear from me the wailings of disappointed ambition chapter xxxix caroline took advantage of the opportunity of returning home with her brother alfred when he went to the country to prepare clermontpark for the reception of lord oldborough and now she saw her home again with more than wonted delight every thing animate and inanimate seemed to smile upon her every heart rejoiced at her return and she enjoyed equally the pleasure of loving and of being beloved by such friends she had been amused and admired during her residence in london but a life of dissipation she had always thought and now she was convinced from experience could never suit her taste or character she would immediately have resumed her former occupations if rosamond would have permitted but rosamond took entire possession of her at every moment when her father or mother had not claimed their prior right to hear and to be heard caroline my dear dont natter yourself that you shall be left in peaceseeshe is sitting down to write a letter as if she had not been away from us these six monthsyou must write to lady jane granvillewell finish your gratitude quicklyand no more writing reading or drawing this day you must think of nothing but talking or listening to me much as she loved talking in general rosamond now so far preferred the pleasure of hearing that with her eyes fixed on caroline her countenance varying with every variety of carolines expression she sat perfectly silent all the time her sister spoke and scarcely was her voice heard even in exclamation but during the pauses of narrative when the pause lasted more than a minute she would say go on my dear caroline go on tell us something more the conversation was interrupted by the sudden entrance of mr templeand rosamond did not immediately find her fluency of speech increase mr temple had seized the first moment that duty and gratitude to his master and friend permitted to hasten to the hills nor had lord oldborough been unmindful of his feelings little as his lordship was disposed to think of love affairs it seems he recollected those of his secretary for the morning after their arrival at clermontpark when he proffered his services lord oldborough said that he had only to trouble mr temple to pay a visit for him if it would not be disagreeable to his old friend mr percy tell him that i know his first wish will be to come to show me that it is the man not the minister for whom he had a regard tell him this proof of his esteem is unnecessary he will wish to see me for another reason he is a philosopherand will have a philosophical curiosity to discover how i exist without ambition but of that he cannot yet form a judgmentnor can i therefore if he pleases let his visit be delayed till next week i have some papers to arrange which i should wish to show him and i cannot have them sooner in readiness if you mr temple can contrive to pass this week at mr percys let me not detain you there is no fear added he smiling that in solitude i should be troubled by the spectre which haunted the minister in gil blas in his retirement never was man happier than mr temple when he found himself in the midst of the family circle at the hills and seated beside rosamond free from all cares all business all intrigues of courtiers and restraints of office no longer in the horrors of attendance and dependence but with the promise of a competent provision for lifewith the consciousness of its having been honourably obtained and to brighten all the hope the delightful hope of soon prevailing on the woman he loved to become his for ever alfred percy had been obliged to return directly to london and for once in his life mr temple benefited by the absence of his friend in the small house at the hills alfreds was the only room that could have been spared for him and in this room scarcely fourteen feet square the exsecretary found himself lodged more entirely to his satisfaction than he had ever been in the sumptuous apartments of the great the happy are not fastidious as to their accommodations they never miss the painted ceiling or the long arcade and their slumbers require no bed of down the lovers only fear was that this happy week would pass too swiftly and indeed time flew unperceived by him and by rosamond one fine day after dinner mrs percy proposed that instead of sitting longer in the house they should have their dessert of strawberries in some pleasant place in the lawn or wood rosamond eagerly seconded this proposal and whispered carolines bower thither they went this bower of caroline this favourite spot rosamond during her sisters absence had taken delight in ornamenting and it did credit as much to her taste as to her kindness she had opened a view on one side to a waterfall among the rocks on the other to a winding path descending through the glen honeysuckle rose and eglantine near the bower were in rich and wild profusion all these the song of birds and even the smell of the newmown grass seemed peculiarly delightful to mr temple of late years he had been doomed to close confinement in a capital city but all his tastes were rural and as he said he feared he should expose himself to the ridicule dr johnson throws on those who talk of sheep and goats and who babble of green fields mr percy thought dr johnson was rather too intolerant of rural description and of the praises of a country life but acknowledged that he quite agreed with him in disliking pastoralsexcepting always that beautiful drama the gentle shepherd mr percy said that in his opinion a life purely pastoral must if it could be realized prove as insufferably tiresome in reality as it usually is found to be in fiction he hated delias and shepherdesses and declared that he should soon grow tired of any companion with whom he had no other occupation in common but tending a few sheep there was a vast difference he thought between pastoral and domestic life his idea of domestic life comprised all the varieties of literature exercise and amusement for the faculties with the delights of cultivated society the conversation turned from pastoral life and pastorals to scotch and english ballads and songs their various merits of simplicity pathos or elegance were compared and discussed after the reliques of ancient poetry had been sufficiently admired rosamond and caroline mentioned two modern compositions both by the same author each exquisite in its different style of poetryone beautiful the other sublime rosamonds favourite was the exile of erin carolines the mariners of england to justify their tastes they repeated the poems caroline fixed the attention of the company on the flag which has braved a thousand years the battle and the breeze when suddenly her own attention seemed to be distracted by some object in the glen below she endeavoured to go on but her voice falteredher colour changed rosamond whose quick eye followed her sisters instantly caught a glimpse of a gentleman coming up the path from the glen rosamond started from her seat and clasping her hands exclaimed it is it is heit is count altenberg they had not recovered from their astonishment when count altenberg stood before them to mr percy to mrs percy to rosamond to each he spoke before he said one word to caroline but one look had said all had spoken and had been understood that he was not married she was certainfor that look said he loved herand her confidence in his honour was secure whatever had delayed his return or had been mysterious in his conduct she felt convinced that he had never been to blame and on his part did he read as distinctly the truth in her countenancewas the high colour the radiant pleasure in that countenance unmarked the joy was so veiled by feminine modesty that he doubted trembled and if at last the rapid feelings ended in hope it was respectful hope with deference the most marked mingled with dignity tenderness and passion he approached caroline he was too delicate too wellbred to distress her by distinguishing her more particularly but as he took the seat which she left for him beside her mother the open and serene expression of her eye with the soft sound of her voice in the few words she answered to what he said were enough to set his heart at ease the sight of mr temple had at first alarmed the count but the alarm was only momentary one glance at rosamond reassured him ideas which it requires many words to tell passed instantaneously with the rapidity of light after they were seated some minutes were spent in commonplace questions and answers such as those which benjamin franklin would wisely put all together into one formula to satisfy curiosity count altenberg landed the preceding dayhad not stopped to see any one in englandhad not even heard of lord oldboroughs resignationhad proceeded directly to the hillshad left his equipage at a town a few miles distantthought he had been fully master of the wellknown road but the approach having been lately changed he had missed his way this settled to make room for a more interesting explanation mr temple had the politeness to withdraw rosamond had the humanity and caroline the discretion to accompany him in his walk count altenberg then said addressing himself to mr percy on whose regard he seemed to have reliance and to mrs percy whom he appeared most anxious to interest in his favour you certainly sir as a man of penetration and a father you madam as a mother and as a lady who must have been accustomed to the admiration of our sex could not avoid seeing when i was in this country before that i felt the highest admiration that i had formed the strongest attachment for your daughtermiss caroline percy mr and mrs percy both acknowledged that they thought count altenberg had shown some preference for caroline but as he had never declared his attachment they had not felt themselves justified in inferring more from his attentions than his general good opinion a change in his manner which they observed shortly before they quitted hungerford castle had impressed them with the idea that he had no such views as they had once been led to imagine and their never having heard any thing from him since had confirmed them in this belief painfulexquisitely painful as it was to me said count altenberg i felt myself bound in honour to leave you in that error and at all hazards to myself to suffer you to continue under that persuasion as i was then and have been till within these few days in dread of being obliged to fulfil an engagement made without my concurrence or knowledge and which must for ever have precluded me from indulging the first wish of my heart the moment literally the moment i was at liberty i hastened hither to declare my real sentiments and to solicit your permission to address your daughter but before i can expect that permission before i can hope for your approbation of my suitan approbation which i am well aware must depend entirely upon your opinion of my characteri must to explain whatever may have appeared unintelligible in my conduct be permitted to make you fully acquainted with the circumstances in which i have been placed beginning with the history of his fathers letters and his own respecting the projected marriage with the countess christina he related nearly as follows all that passed after his having in obedience to his fathers summons returned home he found contracts drawn up and ready for his signaturethe friends of both families apprized of the proposed alliance and every thing actually prepared for his marriage remonstrances with his father were vain the old count said that it was impossible to break off the match that his honour and the honour of his house was pledged but independently of all promises he considered the accomplishment of this marriage as most desirable and advantageous with all the vehemence of affection and all the force of parental authority he charged his son to fulfil his engagements the old count was a fond but an imperious father a good but an ambitious man it was his belief that love is such a transient passion that it is folly to sacrifice to its indulgence any of the solid and permanent interests of life his experience at courts and his observation on the gallantries of young princes and nobles had taught him to believe that love is not only a transient but a variable and capricious feeling easily changing its object and subsisting only by novelty all that his son said of his attachment to caroline of the certainty of its permanence and of its being essential to the happiness of his life the father heard but as the common language of every enamoured youth he let his son speak without interruption but smiled incredulous and listened only as to the voice of one in the paroxysm of a passion which however violent would necessarily subside between the fits he endeavoured to control the fever of his mind and as a spell repeated these words albert see the young countess christinabut oncei ask no more albert with the respect due to a father but with the firmness due to himself and with all the courage which love only could have given to oppose the authority and affection of a parent refused to ratify the contract that had been prepared and declined the proposed interview he doubted not he said that the lady was all his father describedbeautiful amiable and of transcendant talents he doubted not her power to win any but a heart already won he would enter into no invidious comparisons nor bid defiance to her charmshis own choice was made he was sure of his constancy and he thought it not only the most honourable course but the most respectful to the lady christina ingenuously at once and without having any interview with her or her friends to state the truththat the treaty had been commenced by his father without his knowledge and carried on under total ignorance of an attachment he had formed in england the father after some expressions of anger and disappointment was silent and appeared to acquiesce he no longer openly urged the proposed interview but he secretly contrived that it should take place at a masked ball at court count albert entered into conversation with a minerva whose majestic air and figure distinguished her above her companions whose language thoughts and sentiments perfectly sustained the character which she assumed he was struck with admiration by her talents and by a certain elevation of thought and sentiment which in all she said seemed the habitual expression of a real character not the strained language of a feigned personage she took off her maskhe was dazzled by her beauty they were at this moment surrounded by numbers of her friends and of his who were watching the effect produced by this interview his father satisfied by the admiration he saw in count alberts countenance when they both took off their masks approached and whispered the countess christina count altenberg grew pale and for a moment stood in silent consternation the lady smiled with an air of haughty superiority which in some degree relieved him by calling his own pride to his aid and by convincing him that tenderness or feminine timidity which he would have most dreaded to wound were not the characteristics of her mind he instantly asked permission to pay his respects to her at her fathers palace the ensuing day she changed colourdarted a penetrating glance at the count and after an incomprehensible and quick alternation of pleasure and pain in her countenance she replied that she consented to grant count albert altenberg that interview which he and their mutual friends desired she then retired with friends from the assembly in spite of the haughtiness of her demeanour it had been obvious that she had desired to make an impression upon count albert and all who knew her agreed that she had never on any occasion been seen to exert herself so much to shine and please she shone but had not pleased the father however was content an interview was promisedhe trusted to the charms and talents of the countesshe trusted to her flattering desire to captivate and with impatience and confidence he waited for the event of the succeeding day some intervening hours a night of feverish and agonizing suspense would have been spared to count albert had he at this time known any thing of an intriguean intrigue which an artful enemy had been carrying on with design to mortify disgrace and ruin his house the plan was worthy of him by whom it was formedm de tourvillea person between whom and count albert there seemed an incompatibility of character and even of manner an aversion openly indiscreetly shown by the count even from his boyish years but cautiously concealed on the part of m de tourville masked in courtly smiles and a diplomatic air of perfect consideration fear mixed with m de tourvilles dislike he was aware that if count albert continued in confidence with the hereditary prince he would when the prince should assume the reins of government become in all probability his prime minister and then adieu to all m de tourvilles hopes of rising to favour and fortune fertile in the resources of intrigue gallant and political he combined them upon this occasion with exquisite address when the countess christina was first presented at court he had observed that the prince was struck by her beauty m de tourville took every means that a courtier well knows how to employ to flatter the taste by which he hoped to benefit in secret he insinuated into the ladys ear that she was admired by the prince m de tourville knew her to be of an aspiring character and rightly judged that ambition was her strongest passion when once the hope of captivating the prince had been suggested to her she began to disdain the proposed alliance with the house of altenberg but she concealed this disdain till she could show it with security she played her part with all the ability foresight and consummate prudence of which ambition undisturbed by love is capable many obstacles opposed her views the projected marriage with count albert altenbergthe certainty that the reigning prince would never consent to his sons forming an alliance with the daughter of a subject but the old prince was dying and the lady christina calculated that till his decease she could protract the time appointed for her marriage with count albert the young prince might then break off the projected match prevail upon the emperor to create her a princess of the empire and then without derogating from his rank or giving offence to german ideas of propriety he might gratify his passion and accomplish the fulness of her ambition determined to take no counsel but her own she never opened her scheme to any of her friends but pursued her plan secretly in concert with m de tourville whom she considered but as a humble instrument devoted to her service he all the while considering her merely as a puppet played by his art to secure at once the purposes of his interest and of his hatred he thought he foresaw that count albert would never yield his intended bride peaceably to his princehe knew nothing of the counts attachment in englandthe lady christina was charmingthe alliance highly advantageous to the house of altenbergthe breaking off such a marriage and the disappointment of a passion which he thought the young countess could not fail to inspire would as m de tourville hoped produce an irreparable breach between the prince and his favourite on count alberts return from england symptoms of alarm and jealousy had appeared in the prince unmarked by all but by the countess christina and by the confidant who was in the secret of his passion so far m de tourvilles scheme had prospered and from the character of the hereditary prince it was likely to succeed in its ultimate view he was a prince of good dispositions but wanting in resolution and civil courage capable of resisting the allurements of pleasure for a certain time but soon weary of painful endurance in any cause with a taste for virtue but destitute of that power to bear and forbear without which there is no virtue a hero when supported by a stronger mind such as that of his friend count albert but relaxing and sinking at once when exposed to the influence of a flatterer such as m de tourville subject to exquisite shame and selfreproach when he had acted contrary to his own idea of right yet from the very same weakness that made him err disposed to be obstinate in error m de tourville argued well from his knowledge of his character that the prince enamoured as he was of the charms of the fair christina would not long be able to resist his passion and that if once he broke through his sense of honour and declared that passion to the destined bride of his friend he would ever afterwards shun and detest the man whom he had injured all this m de tourville had admirably well combined no man understood and managed better the weaknesses of human nature but its strength he could not so well estimate and as for generosity as he could not believe in its sincerity he was never prepared for its effects the struggles which the prince made against his passion were greater and of longer duration than m de tourville had expected if count albert had continued absent the prince might have been brought more easily to betray him but his return recalled in the midst of love and jealousy the sense of respect he had for the superior character of this friend of his early days he knew the value of a friendeven at the moment he yielded his faith to a flatterer he could not at once forfeit the esteem of the being who esteemed him mosthe could not sacrifice the interest and as he thought the happiness of the man who loved him best the attachment his favourite had shown him his truth his confiding openness of temper the pleasure in his countenance when he saw him first upon his return from england all these operated on the heart of the prince and no declaration of his passion had been made at the time when the appointed interview took place between count albert and the countess christina at her fathers palace her friends not doubting that her marriage was on the eve of its accomplishment had no scruple even in that court of etiquette in permitting the affianced lovers to have as private a conference as each seemed to desire the ladys manner was this morning most alarmingly gracious count albert was however struck by a difference in her air the moment she was alone with him from what it had been whilst in the presence of her friends all that he might without vanity have interpreted as marking a desire to please to show him favour and to evince her approbation at least of the choice her friends had made for her vanished the moment they withdrew what her motives might be count altenberg could not guess but the hope he now felt that she was not really inclined to consider him with partiality rendered it more easy to enter into that explanation upon which he was at all events resolved with all the delicacy due to her sex with all the deference due to her character and all the softenings by which politeness can soothe and conciliate pride he revealed to the countess christina the real state of his affections he told her the whole truth concluding by repeating the assurance of his belief that her charms and merit would be irresistible to any heart that was disengaged the lady heard him in astonishment for this turn of fate she had been wholly unpreparedthe idea of his being attached to another had never once presented itself to her imagination she had never calculated on the possibility that her alliance should be declined by any individual of a family less than sovereign she possessed however pride of character superior to her pride of rank and strength of mind suited to the loftiness of her ambition with dignity in her air and countenance after a pause of reflection she replied count albert altenberg is i find equal to the high character i have heard of him deserving of my esteem and confidence by that which can alone command esteem and merit confidencesincerity his example has recalled me to my nobler self and he has in this moment rescued me from the labyrinth of a diplomatist count alberts sincerity ilittle accustomed to imitation but proud to follow in what is good and greatshall imitate know then sir that my heart like your own is engaged and that you may be convinced i do not mock your ear with the semblance of confidence i shall at whatever hazard to myself trust to you my secret my affections have a high objectare fixed upon him whose friend and favourite count albert altenberg deservedly is i should scorn myselfno throne upon earth could raise me in my own opinion if i could deceive or betray the man who has treated me with such sincerity relieved at once by this explanation and admiring the manner in which it was made mingled joy and admiration were manifest in his countenance and the lady forgave him the joy in consideration of the tribute he paid to her superiority admiration was a tribute he was most willing to yield at this moment when released from that engagement to love which it had been impossible for him to fulfil the countess recalled his attention to her affairs and to his own without his making any inquiry she told him all that had been done and all that yet remained to be done for the accomplishment of her hopes she had been assured she said by one now in the favour and private confidence of the hereditary prince that his inclination for her waspainfully and with struggles which in her eyes made his royal heart worthy her conquestsuppressed by a sense of honour to his friend this conflict would now cease count albert said it should be his immediate care to relieve his prince from all difficulty on his account by what means the countess asked simply by informing him of the truthas far as i am concerned your secret madam is safeyour confidence sacred of all that concerns myselfmy own attachment and the resignation of any pretensions that might interfere with his he shall immediately be acquainted with the whole truth the countess coloured and repeating the words the whole truth looked disconcerted and in great perplexity replied that count alberts speaking to the prince directlyhis immediate resignation of his pretensionswould perhaps defeat her plans this was not the course she had intended to pursuefar from that which m de tourville had pointed out after some moments reflection she said i abide by the truthspeak to the princebe it so i trust to your honour and discretion to speak to him in such terms as not to implicate me to commit my delicacy or to derogate from my dignity we shall see then whether he loves me as i desire to be loved if he does he will free me at once from all difficulty with my friends for he will speak en princeand not speak in vain if he loves me not i need not tell you sir that you are equally free my friends shall be convinced that i will never be the bride of any other man after the explanation with the lady christina count albert lost no time he went instantly to the palace in his way thither he was met by one of the pages who told him the prince desired to see him immediately he found the prince alone advancing to meet him with great effort in his manner to command his emotion the prince said i have sent for you count albert to give you a proof that the friendship of princes is not in every instance so vain a thing as it is commonly believed to be mine for you has withstood strong temptationyou come from the countess christina i believe and can measure better than any one the force of that temptation know that in your absence it has been my misfortune to become passionately enamoured of your destined bride but i have never either by word or look directly or indirectly infringed on what i felt to be due to your friendship and to my own honour never did i give her the slightest intimation of my passion never attempted to take any of the advantages which my situation might be supposed to give count albert had just received the most convincing testimony corroborating these assertionshe was going to express his sense of the conduct of his prince and to explain his own situation but the prince went on speaking with the eagerness of one who fears his own resolution who has to say something which he dreads that he should not be able to resume or finish if his feelings should meet with any interruption and now let me as your friend and prince congratulate you count albert on your happiness and with the same sincerity i request that your marriage may not be delayed and that you will take your bride immediately away from my fathers court time will i hope render her presence less dangerous time will i hope enable me to enjoy your society in safety and when it shall become my duty to govern this state i shall hope for the assistance of your talents and integrity and shall have deserved in some degree your attachment the count in the strongest manner expressed his gratitude to his prince for these proofs of his regard given under circumstances the most trying to the human heart he felt at this instant exquisite pleasure in revealing to his highness the truth in showing him that the sacrifice he had so honourably so generously determined to make was not requisite that their affections were fixed on different objects that before count albert had any idea of the princes attachment to the lady christina it had been his ardent wish his determination at all hazards to break off engagements which he could not fulfil the prince was in rapturous joyall his ease of manner towards his friend returned instantly his affection and confidence flowed in full tide proud of himself and happy in the sense of the imminent danger from which he had escaped he now described the late conflicts his heart had endured with the eloquence of selfcomplacency and with that sense of relief which is felt in speaking on the most interesting of all subjects to a faithful friend from whom a secret has been painfully concealed the prince now threw open every thought every feeling of his mind count altenberg rose higher than ever in his favour not the temporary favourite of the momentthe companion of pleasuresthe flatterer of present passion or caprice but the friend in whom there is certainty of sympathy and security of counsel the prince confiding in count alberts zeal and superior powers now took advice from him and made a confidant no longer of m de tourville the very means which that intriguing courtier had taken to undermine the count thus eventually proved the cause of establishing more firmly his credit the plain sincerity of the count and the generous magnanimity of the lady at once disconcerted and destroyed the artful plan of the diplomatist m de tourvilles disappointment when he heard from the countess christina the result of her interview with count albert and the reproaches which in that moment of vexation he could not refrain from uttering against the lady for having departed from their plan and having trusted to the count unveiled to her the meanness of his character and the baseness of his designs she plainly saw that his object had been not to assist her love but to gratify his own hate not merely to advance his own fortunethat she knew must be the first object of every courtierbut to rise upon the ruins of anothers fame and this she determined should never be accomplished by her assistance or with her connivance she put count albert on his guard against this insidious enemy the count grateful to the lady yet biassed neither by hope of her future favour nor by present desire to please firm in honour and loyalty to the prince who asked his counsel carefully studied the character of the countess christina to determine whether she possessed the qualities fit for the high station to which love was impatient that she should be elevated when he was convinced that her character was such as was requisite to ensure the private happiness of the prince to excite him to the attainment of true glorythen and not till then he decidedly advised the marriage and zealously offered any assistance in his power to promote the union the hereditary prince about this time became by the death of his father sole master of his actions but it was not prudent to begin his government with an act in open defiance of the prejudices or customs of his country by these customs he could not marry any woman under the rank of a princess and the emperor had been known to refuse conferring this rank even on favourites of powerful potentates by whom he had been in the most urgent manner solicited count albert altenberg stood high in the esteem of the emperor at whose court he had spent some time and his prince now commissioned him to go to vienna and endeavour to move the emperor to concede this point in his favour this embassy was a new and terrible delay to the counts anxious desire of returning to england but he had offered his services and he gave them generously he repaired to vienna and persevering through many difficulties at length succeeded in obtaining for the countess the rank of princess the attachment of the prince was then publicly declaredthe marriage was solemnizedall approved of the princes choiceallexcept the envious who never approve of the happy count albert received both from the prince and princess the highest marks of esteem and favour m de tourville detected and despised retired from court in disgrace and in despair immediately after his marriage the prince declared his intention of appointing count albert altenberg his prime minister but before he entered on the duties of his office and the very moment that he could be spared by his prince he asked and obtained permission to return to england to the lady on whom his affections were fixed the old count his father satisfied with the turn which affairs had taken and gratified in his utmost ambition by seeing his son minister of state now willingly permitted him to follow his own inclination in the choice of a wife and concluded count albert my father rejoices that my heart is devoted to an englishwoman having himself married an english lady he knows from experience how to appreciate the domestic merits of the ladies of england he is prepossessed in their favour he agrees indeed with foreigners of every nation who have had opportunities of judging and who all allow thatnext to their own countrywomenthe english are the most charming and the most amiable women in the world when the count had finished and had pronounced this panegyric of a nation while he thought only of an individual he paused anxious to know what effect his narrative had produced on mr and mrs percy he was gratified both by their words and looks which gave him full assurance of their entire satisfaction and since he had done them the honour of appealing to their opinion they might be permitted to add their complete approbation of every part of his conduct in the difficult circumstances in which he had been placed they were fully sensible of the high honour that such a man as count altenberg conferred on their daughter by his preference as to the rest they must refer him to caroline herself mr percy said with a grave voice but with a smile from which the count augured well that even for the most advantageous and in his opinion desirable connexion he would not influence his daughters inclinationcaroline must decide the count with all the persuasive tenderness and energy of truth and love pleaded his own cause and was heard by caroline with a modest dignified ingenuous sensibility which increased his passion her partiality was now heightened by her conviction of the strength and steadiness of his attachment but whilst she acknowledged how high he stood in her esteem and did not attempt to conceal the impression he had made on her heart yet he saw that she dreaded to yield to the passion which must at last require from her the sacrifice of her home country friends and parents as long as the idea of being united to him was faint and distant so was the fear of the sacrifices that union might demand but now the hope the fear the certainty at once pressed on her heart with the most agitating urgency the count as far as possible relieved her mind by the assurance that though his duty to his prince and his father that though all his private and public connexions and interests obliged him to reside some time in germany yet that he could occasionally visit england that he should seize every opportunity of visiting a country he preferred to all others and for his own sake he should cultivate the friendship of her family as each individual was in different ways suited to his taste and stood high in his esteem caroline listened with fond anxiety to these hopes she was willing to believe in promises which she was convinced were made with entire sincerity and when her affections had been wrought to this point when her resolution was once determined she never afterwards tormented the man to whom she was attached with wavering doubts and scruples count altenbergs promise to his prince obliged him to return at an appointed time caroline wished that time had been more distant she would have delighted in spending the springtime of love in the midst of those who had formed till now all the happiness of her lifewith her parents to whom she owed every thing to whom her gratitude was as warm as strong as her affectionwith her beloved sister who had sympathized so tenderly in all her sorrow and who ardently wished to have some time allowed to enjoy her happiness caroline felt all this but she felt too deeply to display feeling sensible of what the duty and honour of count altenberg demanded she asked for no delay the first letters that were written to announce her intended marriage were to mrs hungerford and to lady jane granville and it may be recorded as a fact rather unusual that caroline was so fortunate as to satisfy all her friends not to offend one of her relations by telling any too soon or too late of her intentions in fact she made no secret no mystery where none was required by good sense or propriety nor did she communicate it under a strict injunction of secrecy to twenty friends who were afterwards each to be angry with the other for having or not having told that of which they were forbidden to speak the order of precedency in carolines confidential communications was approved of even by all the parties concerned mrs hungerford was at pembroke with her nieces when she received carolines letter her answer was as follows my dear child i am ten years younger since i read your letter therefore do not be surprised at the quickness of my motionsi shall be with you at the hills in town or wherever you are as soon as it is possible after you let me know when and where i can embrace you and our dear count at the marriage of my niece lady mary barclay your mother will remember that i prayed to heaven i might live to see my beloved caroline united to the man of her choicei am grateful that this blessing this completion of all my earthly hopes and happiness has been granted to me m elizabeth hungerford the answer of lady jane granville came next confidential this is the last confidential letter i shall ever be able to write to youfor a married womans letters you know or you will soon know become like all the rest of her property subject to her husbandexcepting always the secrets of which she was possessed before marriage which do not go into the common stock if she be a woman of honourso i am safe with you caroline and any erroneous opinion i might have formed or any hasty expressions i may have let drop about a certain count you will bury in oblivion and never let me see you look even as if you recollected to have heard them you were right my dear in that whole businessi was wrong and all i can say for myself is that i was wrong with the best possible intentions i now congratulate you with as sincere joy as if this charming match had been made by my advice under my chaperonage and by favour of that patronage of fashion of which i know your father thinks that both my head and heart are full there he is only half right after all so do not let him be too proud i will not allow that my heart is ever wrong certainly not where you are concerned i am impatient my dear caroline to see your count altenberg i heard him most highly spoken of yesterday by a polish nobleman whom i met at dinner at the duke of greenwichs is it true that the count is to be prime minister of the prince of the duke of greenwich asked me this question and i promised i would let his grace know from the best possible authoritybut i did not commit you and now my dear for my own interest if you have really and cordially forgiven me for having so rashly said upon a late occasion that i would never forgive you prove to me your placability and your sincerityuse your allpowerful influence to obtain for me a favour on which i have set my heart will you prevail on all your house to come up to town directly and take possession of minecount altenberg you say has business to transact with ministers whilst this is going on and whilst the lawyers are settling preliminaries where can you all be better than with me i hope i shall be able to make mr and mrs percy feel as much at home in one hours time as i found myself the first evening after my arrival at the hills some years ago i know the hungerfords will press you to go to them and alfred and mrs a percy will plead nearest of kini can only throw myself upon your generosity the more inducements you have to go to other friends the more i shall feel gratified and obliged if you favour me with this proof of your preference and affection indulge me my dear caroline perhaps for the last time with your company of which believe me i have though a woman of the world sense and feeling sufficient fully to appreciate the value yours at all events ever and affectionately j granville spring gardenstuesday p si hope your father is of my opinion that weddings especially among persona of a certain rank of life ought always to be publicattended by the friends and connexions of the families and conducted with something of the good old aristocratic formality pomp and state of former times lady jane granvilles polite and urgent request was granted caroline and all her family had pleasure in showing lady jane that they felt grateful for her kindness mr temple obtained permission from lord oldborough to accompany the percys to town and it was settled that rosamond and caroline should be married on the same day but the morning after their arrival in london mr temple appeared with a countenance very unlike that which had been seen the night beforehope and joy had fledall pale and in consternationrosamond was ready to die with terror she was relieved when he declared that the evil related only to his fortune the place that had been promised to him was given indeedthe word of promise was kept to the earbut by some management either of lord skreenes or lord skrimpshires the place had been saddled with a pension to the widow of the gentleman by whom it had been previously held and the amount of this pension was such as to reduce the profits of the place to an annual income by no means sufficient to secure independence or even competence to a married man mr temple knew that when the facts were stated to lord oldborough his lordship would by his representations to the highest authority obtain redress but the secretary was unwilling to implicate him in this disagreeable affair unwilling to trouble his tranquillity again with court intrigues especially as mr temple said where his own personal interest alone was concernedat any rate this business must delay his marriage count altenberg could not possibly defer the day named for his weddingdespatches from the continent pressed the absolute necessity of his return revolutionary symptoms had again appeared in the cityhis prince could not dispense with his services his honour was at stake mr temple did not attempt or pretend to bear his disappointment like a philosopher he bore it like a lover that is to say very ill rosamond poor rosamond rallied him with as much gaiety as she could command with a very heavy heart after a little time for reflection her good sense which when called upon to act never failed to guide her conduct induced her to exert decisive influence to prevent mr temple from breaking out into violent complaints against those in power by whom he had been illtreated the idea of being married on the same day with her sister she said after all was a mere childish fancy for which no solid advantage should be hazarded therefore she conjured her lover not in heat of passion to precipitate things but patiently to waitto return and apply to lord oldborough if he should find that the representations he had already made to lord skrimpshire failed of effect with much reluctance mr temple submitted to postpone the day promised for his marriage but both mr and mrs percy so strongly supported rosamonds arguments that he was compelled to be prudent rosamond now thought only of her sisters approaching nuptials mrs hungerford and mrs mortimer arrived in town and all mr and mrs percys troops of friends gathered round them for this joyful occasion lady jane granville was peculiarly happy in finding that mr percy agreed with her in opinion that marriages ought to be publicly solemnized and rejoiced that when caroline should be led to the altar by the man of her choice she would feel that choice sanctioned by the approbation of her assembled family and friends lady jane justly observed that it was advantageous to mark as strongly as possible the difference between marriages with consent of friends and clandestine unions which from their very nature must always be as private as possible if some little love of show and some aristocratic pride of family mixed with lady janes good sense upon this as upon most other occasions the truly philosophic will be inclined to pardon her for they best know how much of all the principles which form the strength and happiness of society depends upon mixed motives mr and mrs percy grateful to lady jane and willing to indulge her affection in its own way gratified her with permission to arrange the whole ceremonial of the wedding now that rosamonds marriage was postponed she claimed first right to be her sisters bridemaid lady florence pembroke mrs hungerfords niece had made her request and obtained carolines promise to be the second and these were all that caroline desired to have but lady jane granville evidently wished for the honour and glory of lady frances arlington for a third because she was niece to the duke of greenwich and besides as lady jane pleaded though a little selfish she really would have been generous if she had not been spoiled to be sure she cared in general for no one but herself yet she absolutely showed particular interest about caroline besides her ladyship had set her heart upon the matter and never would forgive a disappointment of a fancy her ladyships request was granted further than this affair of the three bridemaids we know notthere is no record concerning who were the bridemen but before we come to the weddingday we think it necessary to mention for the satisfaction of the prudent part of the world that the settlements were duly signed sealed and delivered in the presence of proper witnesses at the moment of recording this fact we are well aware that as much as we shall gain in the esteem of the old we shall lose in the opinion of the young we must therefore be satisfied with the nod of approbation from parents and must endure the smile of scorn from lovers we know that jointure portion gold estate houses householdstuff or land the low conveniences of fate are greek no lovers understand we regret that we cannot gratify some of our courteous readers with a detailed account of the marriage of caroline and count altenberg with a description of the weddingdresses or a list of the company who after the ceremony partook of an elegant collation at lady jane granvilles house in springgardens we lament that we cannot even furnish a paragraph in honour of count altenbergs equipage after all their other friends had made their congratulations had taken leave of caroline and had departed mrs hungerford and mrs mortimer still lingered i know my love said mrs hungerford i ought to resign you in these last moments to your parents your brothers your own rosamond yet i have some excuse for my selfishnessthey will see you again it is to be hoped oftenbut ithat is not in the course of nature the blessing i scarcely could have expected to live to enjoy has been granted to me and now that i have seen you united to one worthy of you one who knows your value i am contenti am grateful farewell again and again my beloved caroline may every tears spoke the rest turning from caroline she leaned on count altenbergs arm as he conducted her to her carriage you are a happy man count altenberg said she forgive me if i am not able to congratulate you as i oughtdaughter mortimer you know my heartspeak for me if you can count altenberg was more touched by this strong affection for caroline than he could have been by any congratulatory compliments to himself after the departure of mrs hungerford and mrs mortimer came the separation so much dreaded by all the family for which all stood prepared despising and detesting the display of sensibility they had fortified themselves for this moment with all their resolution and each struggled to repress their own feelings count altenberg had delayed till the last moment it was now necessary that they should set out caroline flushed crimson to the very temples one instant and pale the next commanded with the utmost effort her emotion rosamond unable to repress hers clung to her sister weeping carolines lips quivered with a vain attempt to speakshe could only embrace rosamond repeatedly and then her mother her father pressed her to his bosomblessed herand then drawing her arm within his led her to her husband as they passed through the hall the faithful housekeeper and the old steward who had come from the country to the marriage pressed forward in hopes of a last look caroline stopped and took leave of each she was able though with difficulty to speak and she thanked them for all the services and kindness she had received from them from childhood to this hour then her father led her to the carriage it is the order of nature my dear child said he we are fond but not selfish parents your happiness is gained by the sacrifice and we can part with you chapter xl some sage moralist has observed that even in the accomplishment of our most ardent wishes in this world there is always some circumstance that disappoints our expectations or mixes somewhat of pain with the joy this is perfectly true thought rosamond how often have i wished for carolines marriage with count altenbergand now she is marriedreally marriedand gone it had passed with the rapidity of a dream the hurry of joy the congratulationsall all was over and in sad silence rosamond felt the reality of her lossby rosamond doubly felt at this moment when all her own affairs were in great uncertainty mr temple was still unable to obtain the performance of the promise which had been made him of remuneration and competent provision he had gone through in compliance with the advice of his friends the mortification of reiterating vain memorials and applications to the duke of greenwich lord skrimpshire lord skreene and mr secretary cope the only thing which mr temple refused to do was to implicate lord oldborough or to disturb him on the subject he had spent some weeks with his old master in his retirement without once adverting to his own difficulties still hoping that on his return to town a promise would be fulfilled which lord skreene had given him that the affair should in his absence be settled to his satisfaction but on his return to town his lordship found means of evasion and delay and threw the blame on others the course of memorials and representations was to be recommenced mr temples pride revolted his love was in despairand frequently in the bitterness of disappointment he reiterated to his friend alfred his exclamations of regret and selfreproach for having quitted from pique and impatience of spirit a profession where his own perseverance and exertions would infallibly have rendered him by this time independent rosamond saw with sympathy and anguish the effect which these feelings of selfreproach and hope delayed produced on mr temples spirits and health his sensibility naturally quick and rendered more acute by disappointment seemed now continually to draw from all characters and events and even from every book he opened a moral against himself some new illustration or example which convinced him more and more of the folly of being a dependant on the great he was just in this repentant mood when one morning at mrs alfred percys rosamond heard him sigh deeply several times as he was reading with great attention she could not forbear asking what it was that touched him so much he put the book into her hands pointing to the following passage the whole of this letter said he is applicable to me and excellent but this really seems as if it had been written for me or by me footnote letter from mr williams secretary to lord chancellor west to mrs williams she read i was a young man and did not think that men were to die or to be turned out what was to be done nowno money my former patron in disgrace friends that were in favour not able to serve me or not willing that is cold timid careful of themselves and indifferent to a man whose disappointments made him less agreeable i languished on for three long melancholy years sometimes a little elated a smile a kind hint a downright promise dealt out to me from those in whom i had placed some silly hopes now and then brought a little refreshment but that never lasted long and to say nothing of the agony of being reduced to talk of ones own misfortunes and ones wants and that basest and lowest of all conditions the slavery of borrowing to support an idle useless beingmy time for those three years was unhappy beyond description what would i have given then for a profession any useful profession is infinitely better than a thousand patrons to this rosamond entirely acceded and admired the strong good sense of the whole letter but she observed to mr temple that it was very unjust not only to himself but what was of much more consequence to her to say that all this applied exactly to his case did mr temple she asked mean to assert that she could esteem a man who was an idle useless being a mere dependant on great men a follower of courts could such a man have recommended himself to her father could such a man ever have been the chosen friend of her brother alfred it was true she acknowledged that this friend of her brother had made one mistake in early life but who is there that can say that he has not in youth or age committed a single error mr temple had done one silly thing to be sure in quarrelling with his profession but he had suffered and had made amends for this afterwards by persevering application to literature there he had obtained the success he deserved gentlemen might sigh and shake their heads but could any gentleman deny this could it be denied that mr temple had distinguished himself in literature could any person deny that a political pamphlet of his recommended him to the notice of lord oldborough one of the ablest statesmen in england who made him his secretary and whose esteem and confidence he afterwards acquired by his merit and continued in place and out to enjoywill any gentleman deny this rosamond added that in defence of her brothers friend she could not help observing that a man who had obtained the esteem of some of the first persons of their day who had filled an employment of trust that of secretary to a minister with fidelity and credit who had published three celebrated political pamphlets and two volumes of moral and philosophical disquisitions which as she had heard the bookseller say were become stock books could not deserve to be called an idle useless being to be born and die would not make all his historyno such a man would at least be secure of honourable mention in the biographia britannica as a writermoralpoliticalmetaphysical but while rosamond thus did her utmost to support the spirits of her lover her own began to fail her vivacity was no longer natural she felt every day more and more the want of her sisters sympathy and strength of mind letters from abroad gave no hope of carolines returndelay after delay occurred no sooner had quiet been restored to the country than count altenbergs father was taken ill and his illness after long uncertainty terminated fatally after the death of his father the count was involved in a variety of domestic business which respect for the memory of his parent and affection for surviving relations could not allow him to leave when all this had been arranged and when all seemed preparing for their return to england just when rosamond hoped that the very next letter would announce the day when they would set out the french declared war the french troops were actually in motioninvasion was hourly expectedit was necessary to prepare for the defence of the country at such a moment the count could not quit his country or his prince and there was caroline in the midst of a country torn by civil war and in the midst of all the horrors of revolution about this time to increase the anxiety of the percy family they learned that godfrey was taken prisoner on his way home from the west indies the transport in which his division of the regiment had embarked had been separated from her convoy by a gale of wind in the night and it was apprehended that she had been taken by the enemy godfreys family hoped for a moment that this might be a false alarm but after enduring the misery of reading contradictory paragraphs and contests of the newspaper writers with each other for several successive days it was at last too clearly established and confirmed by official intelligence that the transport was taken by a dutch ship in the midst of these accumulating causes of anxiety trials of another kind were preparing for this family as if fortune was determined to do her utmost to ruin and humble those who had despised her worshippers struggled against her influence and risen in the world in defiance of her power to explain the danger which now awaited them we must return to their old family enemy sir robert percy master of percyhall and of all that wealth could give he could not enjoy his prosperity but was continually brooding on plans of avarice and malice since his marriage with miss falconer sir robert percys establishment had become so expensive as to fret his temper continually his tenants had had more and more reason to complain of their landlord who when any of his farms were out of lease raised his rents exorbitantly to make himself amends as he said for the extravagance of his wife the tenants who had ever disliked him as the successor and enemy of their own good and beloved landlord now could not and attempted not to conceal their aversion this renewed and increased the virulence of his dislike to our branch of the percys who as he knew were always compared with him and his and seemed to be for ever present to the provoking memories of these tenants sir robert was disappointed hitherto in the hope for which he married the hope of an heir who should prevent the estate from returning to those from whom it had been wrested by his arts envy at seeing the rising and prosperous state of those percys who in spite of their loss of fortune had made their way up again through all obstacles combined to increase his antipathy to his relations his envy had been exasperated by the marriage of caroline to count altenberg and by the high reputation of her brother he heard their praises till his soul sickened and he was determined to be their destruction he found a willing and able assistant in sharpe the attorney and they soon devised a plan worthy of their conjoined malice at the time when sir robert had come into possession of percyhall after the suit had been decided in his favour he had given up all claim to the rents which mr percy had received during the years which he had held the estate and had accepted in lieu of them the improvements which mr percy had made on the estate and a considerable quantity of family plate and a collection of pictures but now sir robert wrote to mr percy without adverting to this agreement and demanding from him the amount of all the rents which he had received deducting only a certain sum on his own valuation for improvements the plate and pictures which he had left at percyhall sir robert said he was willing to take in lieu of the debt but an immense balance against mr percy remained in technical phrase we believe he warned mr percy that sharpe his attorney had directions to commence a suit against him for the mesne rents the amount of the claim was such as it was absolutely impossible that mr percy could pay even by the sale of every thing he possessed in the world if this claim were established his family would be reduced to beggary he must end his days in a prison or fly his country and take refuge in some foreign land to this last extremity sir robert hoped to reduce him in reply however to his insolent letter he was surprised by receiving from mr percy a calm and short reply simply saying that his son alfred would take the proper steps to bring the affair to trial and that he must submit to the decision of the law whatever that might be sir robert was mortified to the quick by finding that he could not extort from his victim one concession or complaint nor one intemperate expression but however calm and dignified was mr percys conduct it could not be without the greatest anxiety that he awaited the event of the trial which was to decide his future fate and that of his whole family the length of time which must elapse before the trial could come on was dreadful suspense was the evil they found most difficult to endure suspense may be easily borne by persons of an indolent character who never expect to rule their destiny by their own genius but to those who feel themselves possessed of energy and abilities to surmount obstacles and to brave dangers it is torture to remain passiveto feel that prudence virtue genius avail them notthat while rapid ideas pass in their imagination time moves with an unaltered pace and compels them to wait along with the herd of vulgar mortals for knowledge of futurity chapter xli what has become all this time of the falconer family since the marriage of miss falconer with sir robert percy all intercourse between the falconers and our branch of the percy family had ceased but one morning when alfred was alone intently considering his fathers case and the legal difficulties which threatened him he was surprised by a visit from commissioner falconer the commissioner looked thin pale and wretched he began by condoling with alfred on their mutual family misfortunes alfred received this condolence with politeness but with a proud consciousness that notwithstanding his fathers present difficulties and the total loss of fortune with which he was threatened neither his father nor any individual in his family would change places with any one of the falconers since nothing dishonourable could be imputed to mr percy and since none of his misfortunes had been occasioned by any imprudence of his own a deep sigh from the commissioner at the moment these thoughts were passing in alfreds mind excited his compassion for he perceived that the same reflections had occurred to him after taking an immoderate quantity of snuff the commissioner went on and disclaimed in strong terms all knowledge of his soninlaw sir roberts cruel conduct to his cousin the commissioner said that sir robert percy had since his marriage with bell falconer behaved very ill and had made his wife show great ingratitude to her own familythat in mrs falconers distress when she and georgiana were most anxious to retire from town for a short time and when mrs falconer had naturally looked to the house of her married daughter as a sure asylum the doors of percyhall had been actually shut against her sir robert declaring that he would not be involved in the difficulties and disgrace of a family who had taken him in to marry a girl without any fortune alfred was perfectly convinced both from the cordial hatred with which the commissioner now spoke of his soninlaw and from mr falconers disposition that he had nothing to do with the cruel measures which sir robert had taken against his father commissioner falconer was not a malevolent but a weak manincapable of being a disinterested friendequally incapable of becoming a malicious enemy the commissioner now proceeded to his own affairs and to the business of his visit he said that he had been disappointed in all his hopes from the greenwich partythat when that sad business of mrs falconers came out they had seized this as a pretence for dropping him altogetherthat when they had by lord oldboroughs retreat from office obtained every thing they wanted and had no more occasion for assistance or information they had shamefully forgotten or disowned all their former promises to cunningham they had refused to accredit him at the court of denmark refused even to defray the expenses of his journey thither which in the style he had thought it necessary for an ambassador to travel in had been considerable upon the hopes held out he had taken a splendid house in copenhagen and had every day for some weeks been in expectation of the arrival of his credentials when it was publicly known that another ambassador was appointed cunninghams creditors became clamorous he contrived to escape from copenhagen in the night and was proceeding incog in his journey homewards when he was stopped at one of the small frontier towns and was there actually detained in prison for his debts the poor commissioner produced his sons letter giving an account of his detention and stating that unless the money he had raised in copenhagen was paid there was no hope of his being liberatedhe must perish in a foreign jail we spare the reader the just reproaches which the unhappy father at this moment uttered against the sons duplicity it was his fate he said to be ruined by those for whom he had been labouring and planning night and day for so many years and now concluded mr falconer here am i reduced to sell almost the last acre of my paternal estatei shall literally have nothing left but falconercourt and my annuitynothingbut it must be done ill as he has used me and impossible as it is ever even at this crisis to get the truth from himi must pay the money he is in jail and cannot be liberated without this sum i have here you see under the hand of the chief magistrate sufficient proofi will not however trouble you my dear sir with showing more of these lettersonly it is a comfort to me to speak to one who will listen with some sympathyah sir when out of placeout of favourselling ones estatehow people changebut i am taking up your time since these lands are to be sold the sooner the better your father you know is trustee to my marriagesettlements and i believe his consent his signature will be necessarywill it noti am no lawyeri really am not clear what is necessaryand my solicitor mr sharpe i have dismissed perhaps you will allow me to put the business into your hands alfred undertook it and kindly told the commissioner that if he would send him his papers he would without putting him to any expense look them over carefullyhave all the necessary releases drawnand make his title clear to any purchaser who should apply the commissioner was full of gratitude for this friendly offer and immediately begged that he might leave his titledeeds accordingly the servant was desired to bring in the box which he had left in the carriage the commissioner then rose to take leave but alfred begged he would stay till he had written a list of the deeds as he made it a rule never to take charge of any papers without giving a receipt for them the commissioner thought this a superfluous delicacy between friends and relatives but alfred observed that relations would perhaps oftener continue friends if in matters of business they took care always to be as exact as if they were strangers the commissioner looked at his watchsaid he was in hastehe was going to wait upon lord somebody from whom in spite of all his experience he expected something you will find a list of the deeds i have a notion said he in the box mr alfred percy and you need only sign itthat will be quite sufficient when i have compared the papers with the list i will sign it said alfred my clerk and i will do it as quickly as possible believe me you cannot be in greater haste than i am the commissioner secretly cursing alfreds accuracy and muttering something of the necessity for his own punctuality was obliged to submit he sat downthe clerk was sent forthe box was opened the list of the papers was as alfred found drawn out by buckhurst falconer and the commissioner now recollected the time just when poor buckhurst said the father with a sigh was arguing with me against going into the churchat that time i remember he was desperately in love with your sister caroline why in truth said alfred smiling as he read over the scrawled list this looks a little as if it were written by a man in loveheres another reason for our comparing the papers and the list well well i took it all upon trusti am no lawyeri never looked at themnever opened the box and am very sorry to be obliged to do it now the essential care either of papers or estate the commissioner had evermore neglected while he had all his life been castlebuilding or pursuing some phantom of fortune at court whilst alfred was comparing the papers and the list the commissioner went on talking of the marriage of caroline with count altenberg asking when they expected them to return it was possible that count altenberg might be moved to make some remonstrance in favour of cunningham and a word or two from him to the duke of greenwich would do the business the commissioner longed to hint this to alfred but he was so intent upon these bundles of parchment that till every one of them was counted it would be in vain to make that attempt so the commissioner impatiently stood by while the clerk went on calling over the papers and alfred in equal strains replying thank heaven said he to himself they have got to the last bundle bundle eighteen cried the clerk bundle eighteen replied alfred how many numbers does it contain six said the clerk sixno seven if you please said alfred but six in the list sir i will read them over said alfred no deed of assignment to filmer griffin esq no deed of mortgage to margaret simpson widow no deed of lease and release no lease for a year no no such thingstop sirdeed alfred gave one look at the paper and starting up snatched it from the hands of his clerk with an exclamation of joy signed the receipt for the commissioner put it into his hands locked the box and sat down to write a letter all with such rapidity that the commissioner was struck with astonishment and curiosity notwithstanding all his impatience to be punctual to his own engagement he now stood fixed to the spot and at last began with my dear mr alfred percy may i ask what has happened my dear commissioner i have found iti have found itthe longlost deed and i am writing to my father to tell him excuse meexcuse me if i am not able to explain farther at this moment the commissioner understood it all too quickly he saw how it had happened through buckhursts carelessness at the time buckhurst had been packing up these papers some of mr percys had been lying on the tablebuckhurst had been charged not to mix them with his fathers but he was in love and did not know what he was doing the commissioner began three sentences and left them all unfinished while alfred did not hear one word of them the first was an apology for buckhurst the second a congratulation for his good cousin percy the third was an exclamation that came from his heart good heavens but what will become of my daughter bell and sir robert i do not comprehend quite my dear sir perceiving that he was not heard by alfred the commissioner took up his hat and departed determining that he would inquire farther from sir roberts solicitor concerning the probable consequences of the recovery of this deed alfred had no sooner finished his joyful letter to his father than he wrote to sir robert percy informing him of the recovery of the deed and letting him know that he was ready to show it to whomsoever sir robert would send to his house to examine it he made this offer to put an end at once to all doubts he trusted he said that when sir robert should be satisfied of the existence and identity of the deed he would stop his present proceedings for the recovery of the mesne rents and that he would without obliging his father to have farther recourse to law restore to him the percy estate to this letter no answer was received for some time at length mr sharpe called on alfred and begged to see the deed he was permitted to examine it in alfreds presence he noted down the date names of the witnesses and some other particulars of which he observed it was necessary he should inform sir robert before he could be satisfied as to the identity of the conveyance sharpe was particularly close and guarded in his looks and words during this interview would neither admit nor deny that he was satisfied and went away leaving nothing certain but that he would write to sir robert alfred thought he saw that they meant to avoid giving an answer in order to keep possession some months longer till another term he took all the necessary steps to bring the matter to trial immediately without waiting for any answer from sir robert no letter came from him but alfred received from his solicitor the following note sir i am directed by sir robert percy to acquaint you in reply to yours of the th instant that conceiving his title to the percy estate to be no way affected by the instrument to which you allude therein he cannot withdraw his present suit for the mesne rents that had been already received if you proceed in an ejectment for the recovery of the aforesaid estate i am sir your humble servant a sharpe wednesday alfred was surprised and alarmed by this letter it had never occurred to him as possible that sir robert and his counsel would attempt to stand a new trial in the face of this recovered deed this was beyond all he could have conceived even from their effrontery and villany he consulted mr friend who after considering sharpes letter could not devise what defence they intended to make as the deed upon most accurate examination appeared duly executed according to the provision of the statute of frauds upon the whole mr friend was of opinion that the letter was meant merely to alarm the plaintiffs and to bring them to offer or consent to a compromise in this opinion alfred was confirmed the next day by an interview with sharpe accidental on alfreds part but designed and prepared by the solicitor who watched alfred as he was coming out of the courts and dogged him till he parted from some gentlemen with whom he was walkingthen joining him he said in a voice which mr allscrip might have envied for its power of setting sense at defiance i am happy mr alfred percy to chance to see you today for with a view to put an end to litigation and difficulties i had a few words to suggestpremising that i do not act or speak now in any wise as or for sir robert percy or with reference to his being my client or as a solicitor in this cause be it understood but merely and solely as one gentleman to another upon honourand not bringing forward any idea to be taken advantage of hereafter as tending to any thing in the shape of an offer to compromise which in a legal point of view you know sir i could not be warranted to hazard for my client and of consequence which i hereby declare i do not in any degree mean would you be so good mr sharpe to state at once what you do mean for i confess i do not in any degree understand you why then sir what i mean is simply and candidly and frankly this that if i could without compromising the interest of my client which as an honest man i am bound not to do or appear to do i should wish to put an end to this litigation between relations and though your father thinks me his enemy would convince him to the contrary if he would allow me and could point out the means of shortening this difference between relations which has occasioned so much scandal and moreover could devise an accommodation which might be agreeable to both parties and save you a vast deal of trouble and vexation possession added he laughing being nine points of the law mr sharpe paused as if hoping that something would now be said by alfred that might direct him whether to advance or recede but alfred only observed that probably the end mr sharpe proposed to himself by speaking was to make himself understood and that this desirable end he had not yet attained why sir in some cases one cannot venture to make ones self understood any way but by inuendoes then good morning to you siryou and i can never understand one another pardon me sir unless you are in a hurry cried mr sharpe catching alfred by the button which when so large an estate to which you might eventually succeed is in question you are too much a man of business to bein one word then for i wont detain you another moment and i throw myself open and trust to your honour you do me honour put a parallel case you plaintiff a i defendant b i should if i were a but no way advising it being b offer to divide the whole property the claim for the mesne rents being wholly given up and that the offer would be accepted id engage upon my honour supposing myself witnessing the transaction only just as a gentleman impossible sir cried alfred with indignation do you take me for a fool do you think i would give up half my fathers estate knowing that he has a right to the whole pardon me siri only suggested an a b case but one word more sir cried mr sharpe holding alfred who was breaking from him for your ownyour fathers interest you see this thing quite in a wrong point of view when you talk of a few months more or less delay of getting possession being all there is between usdepend upon it if it goes to trial you will never get possession then sir if you think so you are betraying the interest of your client in advising me not to let it go to trial good god sir but that is between you and me only pardon me sir it is between you and your conscience oh if thats allmy conscience is at ease when im trying to prevent the scandal of litigation between relations therefore just let me mention to you for your private information what i know sir robert would not wish to come out before the trial dont tell it to me siri will not hear it cried alfred breaking from him and walking on very fast faster still sharpe pursued youll remember sir at all events that what has been said is not to go furtheryoull not forget i shall never forget that i am a man of honour sir said alfred sharpe parted from him muttering that if he lived to the day of trial he would repent this and if i live till the day of judgment i shall never repent it thought alfred now fully convinced that sir robert desired a compromise and wanted only to secure while in possession some portion of that property which he knew the law would ultimately force him to relinquish alfred persevered in his course relieved from the alarm into which he had at first been thrown when he learned that his opponents intended to make a defence alfred felt assured that they would never let the matter come to trial but time passed on and they still persisted many of his brother lawyers were not only doubtful but more inclined to despond than to encourage him as to the event of the trial several regretted that he had not accepted of mr sharpes offered compromise half the estate certain and his fathers release from all difficulties they thought too good offers to have been rejected he might as sharpe had prophesied have to repent his rejection of that proposal others observed that though mr alfred percy was certainly a young man of great talents and had been successful at the bar still he was a young lawyer and it was a bold and hazardous not to say rash thing to take upon himself the conduct of a suit against such opponents as mr sharpe and sir robert percy practised in law hardened in iniquity and now driven to desperation mr friend was the only man who stood steadily by alfred and never wavered in his opinion trust to truth and justice said he you did right not to compromisebe firm if you fail you will have this consolationyou will have done all that man could do to deserve success the day of trial approached mr friend had hoped till very late in the business that the object of their adversaries was only to intimidate and that they would never let it go to trial now it was plain they would but on what grounds again and again mr friend and alfred perused and reperused sir john percys deed and examined the opinions of counsel of the first eminence both law and right appeared to be clearly on their side but it was not likely that their experienced opponents should persist without having some strong resource a dread silence was preserved by sir robert percy and by mr solicitor sharpe they must have some deep design what it could be remained to be discovered even till the day of trial chapter xlii the day of trial arrivedmr percy came up to town and brought mrs percy and rosamond with him to his son alfreds that they might all be together and hear as soon as possible their fate the trial came on about three oclock in the afternoon the court was uncommonly crowded mr percy his son erasmus and all his friends and sir robert and his adherents appeared on opposite sides of the galleries the excellent countenance and gentlemanlike demeanour of mr percy were contrasted with the dark inauspicious physiognomy of sir robert who sat opposite to him and who was never tranquil one second but was continually throwing notes to his counsel beckoning or whispering to his attorneywhile convulsive twitches of face and head snufftaking and handkerchief spread frequently to conceal the expression of his countenance betrayed the malignant flurry of his spirits alfred conducted his fathers cause in the most judicious and temperate manner an attempt had been made by sir robert to prejudice the public against mr percy by representing him as the descendant of a younger brother who was endeavouring to dispossess the heir of the elder branch of the family of that estate which belonged to him by right of inheritance alfreds fast care was to put the court and the jury in full possession of the facts he stated that his father lewis percy plaintiff in this cause and robert percy bart defendant both descended from sir john percy who was their grandfather sir john outlived both his sons who left him two grandsons robert was the son of his eldest and lewis of his youngest son sir john had two estates one of them paternal which went in the ordinary course of descent to the representative of the eldest son being the present sir robert percy sir johns other estate in hampshire which came to him by his wife he conveyed a short time before his death to his youngest grandson the present lewis percy who had held undisturbed possession of it for many years but in process of time sir robert percy ruined himself by play and having frequent intercourse with sharpe the solicitor upon some great emergency inquired whether it was not possible to shake the title of his cousin mr percys estate he suggested that the conveyance might not be forthcoming but sir robert assured him that both his grandfather and the present mr percy were men of business and that there was little likelihood either that the deeds should be lost or that there should be any flaw in the title afterwards a fire broke out at percyhall which consumed that wing of the house in which were mr percys papersthe papers were all saved except this deed of conveyance mr sharpe being accidentally apprized of the loss conveyed the intelligence to sir robert he immediately commenced a suit against his cousin and had finally succeeded in obtaining a verdict in his own favour and possession of the hampshire estate at the time when mr percy delivered up possession and quitted percyhall in consideration of the extensive improvements which he had made and in consideration of his giving up to sir robert plate furniture wine horses and equipages sir robert had promised to forego whatever claim he might have upon mr percy for the rents which he had received during the time he had held the estate but afterwards sir robert repented of having made this agreement broke his promise and took out a writ against his cousin for the mesne rents they amounted to an immense sum which mr percy was utterly unable to pay and he could have had no hope of avoiding ruin had the claim been by law decided against him by fortunate circumstances however he had while this cause was pending recovered that lost conveyance which proved his right to the hampshire estate of this he had apprized sir robert who had persisted nevertheless in holding possession and in his claim for the mesne rents the present action was brought by mr percy in resistance of this unjust claim and for the recovery of his property not one word of invective of eloquence of ornament or of any attempt at pathos did our barrister mix with this statement it was his object to put the jury and the court clearly in possession of facts which unadorned he knew would appear stronger than if encumbered by any flowers of oratory having produced the deed conveying the hampshire estate to his father alfred called evidence to prove the signature of sir john percy and the handwriting of the witnesses he farther proved that this conveyance had been formerly seen among his fathers papers at percyhall showed it had been recently recovered from mr falconers box of papers and explained how it had been put there by mistake and he supported this fact by the evidence of commissioner falconer fatherinlaw to the defendantalfred rested his cause on these proofs and waited anxious to know what defence the defendant was prepared to make to his astonishment and consternation sir roberts counsel produced another deed of sir john percys revoking the deed by which sir john had made over his hampshire estate to his younger grandson mr percy it appearing by a clause in the original deed that a power for this purpose had been therein reserved this deed of revocation was handed to the judge and to the jury that it might be examined the two deeds were carefully compared the nicest inspection could not discover any difference in the signature or seal when mr friend examined them he was in dismay the instrument appeared perfect whilst the jury were occupied in this examination mr friend and alfred had a moment to consult together we are undone whispered mr friend if they establish this deed of revocationit sets us aside for ever neither mr friend nor alfred had any doubt of its being a forgery but those who had plunged thus desperately in guilt would probably be provided with perjury sufficient to support their iniquity if we had been prepared said mr friend but how could we be prepared for such a stroke even now if we had time we could summon witnesses who would discredit theirs but do not despair said alfred still we have a chance that their own witnesses may cross each other or contradict themselves falsehood with all its caution is seldom consistent the trial proceeded alfred in the midst of the fears and sighs of his friends and of the triumphant smiles and anticipating congratulations of his enemies continued to keep both his temper and his understanding cool his attention was fixed upon the evidence produced regardless of the various suggestions whispered or written to him by ignorant or learned advisers william clerke the only surviving witness to the deed of revocation produced by sir robert was the person on whose evidence this cause principally rested he was now summoned to appear and room was made for him he was upwards of eighty years of age he came slowly into court and stood supporting himself upon his staff his head covered with thin gray hairs his countenance placid and smiling and his whole appearance so respectable so venerable as to prepossess immediately the jury and the court in his favour alfred percy could scarcely believe it possible that such a man as this could be the person suborned to support a forgery after being sworn he was desired to sit down which he did bowing respectfully to the court sir robert percys counsel proceeded to examine him as to the points they desired to establish your name sir is william clerke is it not my name is william clerke answered the old man in a feeble voice did you ever see this paper before showing him the deed i didi was present when sir john percy signed ithe bid me witness it that is write my name at the bottom which i did and then he said take notice william clerke this is a deed revoking the deed by which i made over my hampshire estate to my youngest grandson lewis percy the witness was going on but the counsel interrupted you saw sir john percy sign this deedyou are sure of that i am sure of that is this sir john percys signature it isthe very same i saw him write and here is my own name that he bid me put just there you can swear that this is your handwriting i cani do do you recollect what time sir john percy signed this deed yes about three or four days before his death very well that is all we want of you mr clerke alfred percy desired that clerke should be detained in court that he might crossexamine him the defendants went on produced their evidence examined all their witnesses and established all they desired then it came to alfreds turn to crossexamine the witnesses that had been produced by his adversary when william clerke reappeared alfred regarding him stedfastly the old mans countenance changed a little but still he looked prepared to stand a crossexamination in spite of all his efforts however he trembled oh you are trembling on the brink of the grave said alfred addressing him in a low solemn tone pause and reflect whilst you are allowed a moments time a few years must be all you have to spend in this world a few moments may take you to another to appear before a higher tribunalbefore that judge who knows our hearts who sees into yours at this instant the staff in the old mans hand shook violently sir robert percys counsel interruptedsaid that the witness should not be intimidated and appealed to the court the judge was silent and alfred proceeded you know that you are upon your oaththese are possibly the last words you may ever utterlook that they be true you know that men have been struck dead whilst uttering falsehoods you are upon your oathdid you see sir john percy sign this deed the old man attempted in vain to articulate give him time to recollect cried the counsel on the opposite side give him leave to see the writing now he has his spectacles he looked at the writing twicehis head and hands shaking so that he could not fix his spectacles the question was repeated by the judge the old man grew pale as death sir robert percy just opposite to him cleared his throat to catch the witnesss attention then darted at him such a look as only he could give did i see sir john percy sign this deed repeated william clerke yes i did you hear my lord you hear cried sir roberts counsel the witness says he didthere is no occasion farther to intimidate this poor old man he is not used to speak before such an audience there is no need of eloquenceall we want is truth the evidence is positive my lord with your lordships leave i fancy we may dismiss him they were going to hurry him away but alfred percy said that with the permission of the court he must crossexamine that witness farther as the whole event of the trial depended upon the degree of credit that might be given to his evidence by this time the old man had somewhat recovered himself he saw that his age and reverend appearance still prepossessed the jury in his favour and from their looks and from the whispers near him he learned that his tremor and hesitation had not created any suspicion of guilt but had been attributed rather to the sensibility of virtue and the weakness of age and now that the momentary emotion which eloquence had produced on his mind had subsided he recollected the bribe that had been promised to him he was aware that he had already sworn what if he contradicted might subject him to be prosecuted for perjury he now stood obstinately resolved to persevere in his iniquity the first falsehoods pronounced and believed the next would be easy your name is william clerke and this said alfred pointing to the witnesss signature is your handwriting yes i say it is you can write then putting a pen into his hand be so good as to write a few words in the presence of the court he took the pen but after making some fruitless attempts replied i am too old to writei have not been able to write my name these many yearsindeed sir indeed you are too hard upon one like me god knows said he looking up to heaven some thought with feeling some suspected with hypocrisygod knows sir i speak the truth and nothing but the truth have you any more questions to put to me i am ready to tell all i know what interest have i to conceal any thing continued he his voice gaining strength and confidence as he went on repeating the lesson which he had been taught it was long a long while ago he said since it had all happened but thank heaven his memory had been spared him and he remembered all that had passed the same as if it was but yesterday he recollected how sir john looked where he sat what he said when he signed this deed and moreover he had often before heard of a dislike sir john had taken to his younger grandsonay to that young gentlemans father looking at alfred and i was very sorry to hear itvery sorry there should be any dispute in the family for i loved them all said he wiping his eyesay i loved em all and all alike from the time they were in their cradles i remember too once sir john said to me william clerke says he you are a faithful ladfor i was a lad once alfred had judiciously allowed the witness to go on as far as he pleased with his story in the expectation that some exaggeration and contradiction would appear but the judge now interrupted the old man observing that this was nothing to the purposethat he must not take up the time of the court with idle tales but that if he had any thing more to give in evidence respecting the deed he should relate it the judge was thought to be severe and the old man after glancing his eye on the jury bowed with an air of resignation and an appearance of difficulty which excited their compassion we may let him go now my lord may not we said sir robert percys counsel with the permission of his lordship i will ask one other question said alfred now it should be observed that after the first examination of this witness alfred had heard him say to mr sharpe they forgot to bring out what i had to say about the seal to which sharpe had replied enough without it alfred had examined the seal and had observed that there was something underneath itthrough a small hole in the parchment he saw something between the parchment and the sealingwax you were present i think you say mr clerke not only when this deed was signed but when it was sealed i was sir cried clerke eager to bring out this part of the evidence as it had been prepared for him by sir robert i surely was and i remember it particularly because of a little remarkable circumstance sir john god bless himi think i see him nowmy lord under this seal continued the old man addressing himself to the judge and putting his shrivelled finger upon the seal under this very seal sir john put a sixpenceand he called upon me to observe him doing itfor my lord it is my opinion he thought then of what might come to passhe had a sort of a foreboding of this day and now my lord order them if you please to break the sealbreak it before them alland if there is not the sixpence under it why this deed is not sir johns and this is none of my writing and cried he lifting up his hands and eyes i am a liar and perjured there was a profound silence the seal was broken the sixpence appeared it was handed in triumph by sir robert percys counsel to the jury and to the judge there seemed to be no longer a doubt remaining in the minds of the juryand a murmur of congratulation among the partisans of sir robert seemed to anticipate the verdict tis all over i fear whispered friend to alfred alfred you have done all that could be done but they have sworn through every thingit is over with us not yet said alfred every eye turned upon him some from pity some from curiosity to see how he bore his defeat at length when there was silence he begged to be permitted to look at the sixpence the judge ordered that it should be shown to him he held it to the light to examine the date of the coin he discovered a faint impression of a head on the sixpence and upon closer inspection he made out the date and showed clearly that the date of the coin was later than the date of the deed so that there was an absolute impossibility that this sixpence could have been put under the seal of the deed by sir john the moment alfred stated this fact the counsel on the opposite side took the sixpence examined it threw down his brief and left the court people looked at each other in astonishment the judge ordered that william clerke should be detained that he might be prosecuted by the crown for perjury the old man fell back senseless mr sharpe and sir robert percy pushed their way together out of court disclaimed by all who had till now appeared as their friends no farther evidence was offered so that here the trial closed the judge gave a short impressive charge to the jury who without withdrawing instantly gave their verdict in favour of the plaintiff lewis percya verdict that was received with loud acclamations which not even respect to the court could restrain mr percy and alfred hastily shook hands with their friends and in the midst of universal applause hurried away to carry the good news to mrs percy and rosamond who were at alfreds house waiting to hear the event of the trial neither alfred nor mr percy had occasion to speakthe moment mrs percy and rosamond saw them they knew the event yes said mr percy our fortune is restored and doubly happy we are in having regained it in a great measure by the presence of mind and ability of my son his mother and sister embraced alfred with tears of delight for some moments a spectator might have imagined that he beheld a family in deep affliction but soon through these tears appeared on the countenance of each individual the radiance of joy smiles of affection tenderness gratitude and every delightful benignant feeling of the human heart has any body sent to mrs hungerford and to lady jane granville said mr percy yes yes messengers were sent off the moment the verdict was given said erasmus i took care of that it is a pity said rosamond that caroline is not here at this moment and godfrey it is best as it is said mrs percy we have that pleasure still in store and now my beloved children said mr percy after having returned thanks to providence let me here in the midst of all of you to whom i owe so large a share of my happiness sit down quietly for a few minutes to enjoy the sober certainty of waking bliss chapter xliii the day after the trial brought several happy letters to the percys rosamond called it the day of happy letters and by that name it was ever after recorded in the family the first of these letters was from godfrey as follows dear father mother brothers and sisters all i hope you are not under any anxiety about me for here i am safe and sound and in excellent quarters at the house of mynheers grinderweld groensveld and slidderschild amsterdam the dutch merchants who were shipwrecked on our coast years ago if it had happened yesterday the thing could not be fresher in their memories my dear rosamond when we laughed at their strange names square figures and formal advice to us if ever we should by the changes and chances of human events be reduced to distress we little thought that i a prisoner should literally come to seek shelter at their door and most hospitably have i been received national prejudices which i early acquired i dont know how against the dutch made me fancy that a dutchman could think only of himself and would give nothing for nothing i can only say from experience i have been as hospitably treated in amsterdam as ever i was in london these honest merchants have overwhelmed me with civilities and substantial services and still they seem to think they can never do enough for me i wish i may ever see them on english ground again but we have no percyhall to receive them in now and as well as i remember the hills we could not conveniently stow more than one at a time side by side as they stood after breakfast i recollect at percyhall they would completely fill up the parlour at the hills i may well be in high spirits today for these good people have just been telling me that the measures they have been taking to get my exchange effected have so far succeeded they have reason to believe that in a week or a fortnight at farthest i shall be under weigh for england in the mean time you will wonder perhaps how i got here for i perceive that i have subjected myself to rosamonds old reproach of never beginning my story at the beginning my father used to say half the mistakes in human affairs arise from our taking for granted but i think i may take it for granted that either from the newspapers or from gascoigne who must be in england by this time you have learned that the transport i was on board with my division of the regiment parted convoy in the storm of the th in the night and at daybreak fell in with two dutchmen our brave boys fought as englishmen always do but all that is over now so it does not signify prosing about it two to one was too muchwe were captured i had not been five minutes on the dutchmans deck when i observed one of the sailors eyeing me very attentively presently he came up and asked if my name was not percy and if i did not recollect to have seen him before he put me in mind of the shipwreck and told me he was one of the sailors who were harboured in one of my fathers outhouses whilst they were repairing the wreck i asked him what had become of the drunken carpenter and told him the disaster that ensued in consequence of that rascals carelessness my sailor was excessively shocked at the account of the fire at percyhall he thumped his breast till i thought he would have broken his breastbone and after relieving his mind by cursing and swearing in high dutch low dutch and english against the drunken carpenter he told me there was no use in saying any more for that he had punished himselfhe was found dead one morning behind a barrel from which in the night he had been drinking spirits surreptitiously through a straw pray tell this to old john who used always to prophesy that this fellow would come to no good assure him however at the same time that all the dutch sailors do not deserve his maledictions tell him i can answer for the poor fellow who recognized me and who during the whole passage never failed to show me and my fellowprisoners every little attention in his power when we got to amsterdam it was he reminded me of the dutch merchants told me their names which without his assistance i might have perished before i could ever have recollected and showed me the way to their house and never rested till he saw me well settled you will expect from me some account of this place you need not expect any for just as i had got to this line in my letter appeared one who has put all the lions of amsterdam fairly out of my headmr gresham he has been for some weeks in the country and has just returned the dutch merchants not knowing of his being acquainted with my family never mentioned him to me nor me to him so our surprise at meeting was great what pleasure it is in a foreign country and to a poor prisoner to see any one from dear england and one who knows our own friends i had never seen mr gresham myself but you have all by your letters made me well acquainted with him i like him prodigiously to use a ladys word not yours rosamond letters from mr henry were waiting for him here he has just opened them and the first news he tells me is that caroline is going to be married is it possible count altenberg the last time i heard from you you mentioned nothing of all this some of your letters must have been lost pray write again immediately and do not take it for granted that i shall be at home before a letter reaches me but give me a full history of every thing up to the present moment groensveld is sealing his letters for london and must have mine now or never adieu pray write fully you cannot be too minute for a poor prisoner yours affectionately burning with curiosity godfrey percy a letter from mr gresham to mr henry farther informed them that godfreys exchange was actually effected and that he had secured his passage on board a vessel just ready to sail for england next came letters from count altenberg briefly in the laconic style of a man pressed at once by sudden events and strong feelings he related that at the siege of the city of by the french early in the morning of the day on which it was expected that the enemy would attempt to storm the place his prince while inspecting the fortifications was killed by a cannonball on the very spot where the count had been standing but a moment before all public affairs were changed in his country by the death of the prince his successor of a weak character was willing to purchase present ease and to secure his low pleasures at any priceready to give up the honour of his country and submit to the conquerorthat he had been secretly intriguing with the enemy had been suspected and this suspicion was confirmed by his dastardly capitulation when the means of defence were in his power and the spirit of his people eager for resistance with indignation heightened by grief contrast and despairing patriotism count altenberg had remonstrated in vainhad refused as minister to put his signature to the capitulationhad been solicited urgently to concedeoffers of wealth and dignities pressed upon him these he rejected with scorn released from all his public engagements by the death of the prince and by the retiring of the princess from court count altenberg refused to act as minister under his successor and seeing that under such a successor to the government no means of serving or saving the country remained he at once determined to quit it for ever resolved to live in a free country already his own half by birth and wholly by inclination where he had property sufficient to secure him independence sufficient for his own wishes and for those of his beloved carolinea country where he could enjoy better than on any other spot in the whole compass of the civilized world the blessings of real liberty and of domestic tranquillity and happiness his decision made it was promptly executed he left to a friend the transacting the sale of his german property and caroline concluded his letter with my dear friends passports are obtained every thing ready early next week we set out for england by the first of next month we shall be at home then came a letter from lord oldborough some time previously to the trial surprised at neither seeing mr temple nor hearing of his marriage his lordship had written to inquire what delayed his promised return taking it for granted that he was married his lordship in the most polite manner begged that he would prevail upon his bride to enliven the retirement of an old statesman by her sprightly company as the friend of her father he made this request with a confidence in her hereditary disposition to show him kindness in reply to this letter mr temple told his friend and master what had delayed his marriage and why he had hitherto forborne to trouble him on the subject lord oldborough astonished and indignant uttered once and but once contemptuous exclamations against the inconceivable meanness of lord skrimpshire and the infinitely small mind of his grace of greenwich then without condescending to any communication with inferior powers his lordship applied directly to the highest authority the consequence was that a place double the value of that which had been promised was given to mr temple and it was to announce his appointment to it that occasioned the present letter from lord oldborough enclosing one from mr secretary cope who had it in command to assure his lordship that the delay had arisen solely from the anxious desire of his majestys ministers to mark their respect for his lordships recommendation and their sense of mr temples merit by doing more than had been originally proposed an opportunity for which they had impatiently waited had now put it into their power to evince the sincerity of their intentions in a mode which they trusted would prove to the entire satisfaction of his lordship the greatest care was taken both in substance and manner to gratify lord oldborough whose loss had been felt and whose value had upon comparison increased in estimation rosamond was rewarded by seeing the happiness of the man she loved and hearing him declare that he owed it to her prudence rosamonds prudencewhoever expected to hear this mr percy exclaimed and yet the praise is just so henceforward none need ever despair of grafting prudence upon generosity of disposition and vivacity of temper mr temple obtained from rosamond a promise to be his as soon as her sister caroline and her brother should arrive lady jane granville who felt the warmest interest in their prosperity was the first to whom they communicated all this joyful intelligence her ladyships horses had indeed reason to rue this day for they did more work this day than london horses ever accomplished before in the same number of hours not excepting even those of the merciless mrs john prevost for lady jane found it necessary to drive about to her thousand acquaintance to spread the news of the triumph and felicity of the percy family in the midst of this tumult of joy mr percy wrote two letters one was to his faithful old steward john nelson who deserved from his master this mark of regard the other was to commissioner falconer to make him some friendly offers of assistance in his own affairs and to beg that through him his daughter the unhappy and deserted lady of sir robert percy might be assured that neither mr percy nor any of his family wished to put her to inconvenience and that far from being in haste to return to percyhall they particularly wished to wait in town for the arrival of caroline and count altenberg and they therefore requested that she would not hasten her removal from any false idea of their impatience we said the deserted lady of sir robert percy for sir robert had fled from the country on quitting the court after the trial he took all the ready money he had previously collected from his tenants and set out for the continent leaving a note for his wife apprizing her that she would never see him more and that she had better return to her father and mother as he had no means left to support her extravagance commissioner falconer was at this time at falconercourt where he had been obliged to go to settle some business with his tenantry previously to the sale of his land for the redemption of cunningham the commissioners answer to mr percys letter was as follows i cannot tell you my dear sir how much i was touched by the kindness of your letter and conductso different from what i have met with from others i will not cloud your happinessin which believe me i heartily rejoiceby the melancholy detail of all my own sorrows and disappointments but only answer briefly to your friendly inquiries respecting my affairs and first for my unfortunate married daughter who has been in this terrible manner returned upon our hands she thanks you for your indulgence on which she will not encroach before you receive this she will have left percyhall she is going to live with a miss clapham a great heiress who wants a fashionable companion and chaperon mrs falconer became acquainted with her at tunbridge and has devised this plan for arabella i fear bells disposition will not suit such a situation but she has no other resource mrs falconer and georgiana have so overmanaged matters with respect to petcalf that it has ended as i long since feared it would in his breaking off if mrs falconer had taken my advice georgiana might now be completely settled instead of which she is fitting out for india she is going to be sure in good company but in my opinion the expense which heaven knows i can ill afford will be thrown away like all the restfor georgiana has been much worn by late hours and though still young has i fear lost her bloom and looks rather old for india i am truly obliged to you my dear sir for your friendly offer with respect to falconercourt and have in consequence stopped the sale of the furniture i shall rejoice to have such a good tenant as mr temple it is indeed much more agreeable to me to let than to sell the accommodation as you propose will put it in my power to release cunningham which is my most pressing difficulty as you are the only person in the world now who takes an interest in my affairs or to whom i can safely unburden my mind i must though i know complaint to be useless relieve my heart by it for a moment i can safely say that for the last ten years of my life i have never spent a day for myself i have been continually planning and toiling to advance my familynot an opportunity has been neglected and yet from this very family springs all my unhappiness even mrs falconer blames me as the cause of that sad business which has disgraced us for ever and deprived us of all our friendsand has afforded an excuse for breaking all promises there are many whom i will not name but they are persons now high in office who havei may venture to say it to youused me shamefully ill many an honest tradesman and manufacturer to say nothing of men of talents in the liberal professions i have seen in the course of the last forty years make their own fortunes and large fortunes while i have ended worse than i beganhave literally been working all my life for others not only without reward but without thanks if i were to begin life again i certainly should follow your principles my dear sir and depend more upon myself and less upon others than i have donebut now all is over let me assure you that in the midst of my own misfortunes i rejoice in your prosperity and in the esteem and respect with which i hear you and yours spoken of by all present my affectionate regards and congratulations to mrs percy and to all your amiable and happy circle propriety and feeling for my poor daughter lady percy must prevent my paying at present my personal congratulations to you at percyhall but i trust you will not the less believe in the sincerity of my attachment i am my dear sir your obliged and faithful friend and servant t falconer psi have just learnt that the little place i mentioned to mr alfred percy when we last met is not disposed of lord oldboroughs influence as mr temple well knows is still allpowerful and your interest with his lordship you must be sensible is greater than that of any other person living without exception a word from you would do the business for me it is but a trifle which i should once have been ashamed to ask but it is now a matter of necessity the event of the trial and the restoration of the percy family to their property were heard with transports of joy by the old tenantry they had not needed the effect of contrast to make them love and feel the value of their good landlord but certainly sir robert percys tyranny and all that he had made them suffer for their obstinate fidelity to the old branch had heightened and fortified their attachment it was now their turn to glory in that honest obstinacy and with the strong english sense of justice they triumphed in having the rightful owners restored to their estate and to the seat of their ancestors as the percy family crossed the wellknown bridge at the end of the village those bells which had sounded so mournfully which had been muffled when they quitted their home now rang out a merry triumphant pealand it was rung by the hands of the very same persons who had formerly given that proof of attachment to him in his adversityemotion as strong now seized mr percys heart at the same spot he jumped out of the carriage and by the same path along which he had hastened to stop the bellringers lest they should ruin themselves with sir robert he now hastened to see and thank these honest courageous people in passing through the village which had been freshly swept and garnished the people whom he remembered to have seen in tears following the carriage at their departure were now crowding to their doors with faces bright with smiles hats that had never stirred and backs that had never bent for the usurper were now eager with low bows to mark their proud respect to the true man there were no noisy acclamations for all were touched the voices of the young children however were heard who as their mothers held them up in their arms to see the landlord of whom they had heard so much offered their little nosegays as the open carriage passed and repeated blessings on those on whom from their cradles they had heard blessings bestowed by their parents the old steward stood ready at the parkgate to open it for his master his master and the ladies put their hands out of the carriage to shake hands with him but he could not stand it he just touched his masters hand tears streamed down his face and turning away without being able to say one word he hid himself in the porters lodge as they drove up to the house they saw standing on the steps waitingand long had he been waiting there for the first sound of the carriagejohnson the butler who had followed the family to the hills and had served them in their fallen fortunesjohnson was now himself before the halldoor wide open to receive them he stood with the liveryservants in due order mrs harte the good old housekeeper had been sent down to prepare for the reception of the family and a world of trouble she had had but all was now right and proper and she was as active and alert as the youngest of her maidens could have been in conducting the ladies to their apartments in showing all the old places and doing what she called the honours of the reinstallation she could have wished to have vented a little of her indignation and to have told how some things had been left but her better taste and judgment and her sense of what would be pleasing to her master and mistress repressed all recrimination by the help of frequent recurrence to her snuffbox in difficulties great together with much rubbing of her hands and some bridling of her head she got through it without naming those who should not be thought of as she observed on this joyful day the happiness of the percy family was completed by the return of godfrey of caroline and count altenberg godfrey arrived just as his family were settled at percyhall after his long absence from his home and country he doubly enjoyed this scene of domestic prosperity beloved as rosamond was by rich and poor in the neighbourhood and the general favourite of her family her approaching marriage spread new and universal joy it is impossible to give an idea of the congratulations and of the bustle of the various preparations which were going on at this time at percyhall especially in the lower regions even mrs hartes allregulating genius was insufficient for the exigencies of the times indeed her head and her heart were now at perpetual variance continually counteracting and contradicting each other one moment delighted with the joy and affection of the world below she would come up to boast of it to her mistress and her young ladies the next moment she would scold all the people for being out of their wits and for not minding or knowing a single thing they were doing or ordered to do no more than the babes in the wood then proving the next minute and acknowledging that she was really quite as bad as themselves and no wonder for the thoughts of miss rosamonds marriage had turned her head entirely upside downfor she had been at miss rosamonds christening held her by proxy and considered her always as her particular own child and well she might for a better except perhaps miss carolinei should say the countessnever breathed the making a desert island for miss rosamonds weddingdinner was the object which had taken such forcible possession of mrs hartes imagination that till it was accomplished it was in vain to hope that any other could in her eyes appear in any kind of proportion in the midst of all the sentimental joy above stairs and in the midst of all the important business of settlements and lawyers mrs harte was pursuing the settled purpose of her soul constructing with infinite care as directed by her complete english housekeeper a desert island for a wedding in a deep china dish with a mount in the middle two figures upon the mount with crowns on their heads a knot of rockcandy at their feet and gravelwalks of shot comfits judiciously intersecting in every direction their dominions chapter xliv as soon as it was possible after his return to percyhall mr percy went to pay his respects to lord oldborough he found this great statesman happy in retirement without any affectation of happiness there were proofs in every thing about him that his mind had unbent itself agreeably his powers had expanded upon different objects building planting improving the soil and the people he had many tastes which had long lain dormant or rather which had been held in subjugation by one tyrant passion that passion vanquished the former tastes resumed their activity the superior strength of his character was shown in his never recurring to ambition its vigour was displayed in the means by which he supplied himself not only with variety of occupation but with variety of motive those who best know the human mind must be aware of the difficulty of supplying motive for one accustomed to stimulus of so high a kind as that to which lord oldborough had been habituated for one who had been at the head of the government of a great nation to make for himself objects in the stillness and privacy of a country life required no common talent and energy of soul the difficulty was increased to lord oldborough for to him the vast resource of a taste for literature was wanting the biographer of sir robert walpole tells us that though he had not forgotten his classical attainments he had little taste for literary occupations sir robert once expressed his regret on this subject to mr fox in the library at houghton i wish he said i took as much delight in reading as you do it would be the means of alleviating many tedious hours in my present retirement but to my misfortune i derive no pleasure from such pursuits lord oldborough felt but never condescended to complain of that deficiency of general literature which was caused in him partly by his not having had time for the attainment and partly by his having formed too low an estimate of the influence and power of literature in the political world but he now took peculiar delight in recalling the classical studies in which he had in his youth excelled as mr percy sympathized with him in this taste there was another point in which they coalesced mr percy stayed with his old friend some days for he was anxious to give him this proof of attachment and felt interested in seeing his character develope itself in a new direction displaying fresh life and strength and unexpected resource in circumstances in which statesmen of the most vigorous minds and of the highest spirit have been seen to droop and drowse to sink into indolence sensuality or the horrors of hypochondriacism and superstition lord oldborough on his first retiring to clermontpark had informed mr percy that he should wish to see him as soon as he had arranged certain papers he now reminded his lordship of it and lord oldborough put into his hands a sketch which he had been drawing out of the principal transactions in which he had been engaged during his political career with copies of his letters to the first public characters of the day in our own and in foreign countries even by those who had felt no regard for the man the letters of such a minister would have been read with avidity but mr percy perused them with a stronger interest than any which could be created by mere political or philosophical curiosity he read them with a pleasure which a generous mind takes in admiring that which is good and great with the delight which a true friend feels in seeing proofs that justify all the esteem he had previously felt he saw in these original documents in this history of lord oldboroughs political life the most perfect consistency and integrity the most disinterested and enlightened patriotism when mr percy returned the manuscript to his lordship he spoke of the satisfaction he must experience in looking back upon this record of a life spent in the service of his country and observed that he was not surprised that with such a solid source of selfapprobation such indefeasible claims to the gratitude of his countrymen and such wellearned fame he should be as he appeared happy in retirement i am happy and i believe principally from the cause you have mentioned said lord oldborough who had a mind too great for the affectation of humility so far i am happy yet added he after a considerable pause i have i feel a greater capability of happiness for which i have been prevented from making any provision partly by the course of life of which i made choice and partly by circumstances over which i had no control he paused again and turning the conversation spoke of his sister an elderly lady who had come to pass some time with him they had lived separate almost all their lives she in scotland with her husband a scottish nobleman who having died about the time when lord oldborough had resigned his ministerial situation she had accepted his lordships invitation to visit him in his retirement the early attachment he had had for this sister seemed to revive in his mind when they met and as if glad to have some object for his affections they were poured out upon her mr percy observed a tenderness in his manner and voice when he spoke to her a thousand little attentions which no one would have expected from the apparently stern lord oldborough a man who had been engrossed all his life by politics on the morning of the last day which mr percy meant to spend at clermontpark his lordship as they were sitting together in his study expressed more than common regret at the necessity for his friends departure but said i have no right to detain you from your family then after a pause he added mr percy you first gave me the idea that a private life is the happiest my lord in most cases i believe it is but i never meant to assert that a public life spent in noble exertion and with the consciousness of superior talent and utility is not more desirable than the life of any obscure individual can possibly be even though he possess the pleasure of domestic ease and tranquillity there are men of eminent abilities capable of extraordinary exertions inspired by exalted patriotism i believe notwithstanding the corruption of so many has weakened all faith in public virtue i believe in the existence of such men men who devote themselves to the service of their country when the time for their relinquishing the toils of public life arrives honour and selfapprobation follow them in retirement it is true i am happy repeated lord oldborough but to go on with what i began to say to you yesterdayi feel that some addition might be made to my happiness the sense of having to the best of my ability done my duty is satisfactory i do not require applausei disdain adulationi have sustained my public life without sympathyi could seldom meet with itwhere i could i have enjoyed itand could now enjoy itexquisitelyas you do mr percysurrounded by a happy family domestic life requires domestic pleasuresobjects for the affections mr percy felt the truth of this and could answer only by suggesting the idea of mr temple who was firmly and warmly attached to lord oldborough and for whom his lordship had a strong regard mr temple and my daughter rosamond whom your lordship honoured with so kind an invitation propose i know paying their respects to you next week though i am her father i may venture to say that rosamonds sprightliness is so mixed with solid information and good sense that her society will become agreeable to your lordship i shall rejoice to see mrs temple here as the daughter of one friend and the wife of another she has a double claim to my regard and to say nothing of hereditary genius or dispositionsin which you do not believe and i do there can be no doubt that the society of a lady educated as your daughter has been must suit my taste the danger is that her society should become necessary to me for mr temple i already feel a degree of affection which i must repress rather than indulge represswhy so my lord you esteem himyou believe in the sincerity of his attachment i do then why with stoicismpardon me my dear lordwhy repress affection lest i should become dependent for my daily happiness on one whose happiness is independent of minein some degree incompatible with mine even if his society were given to me his heart must be at his home and with his family you see i am no proud stoic but a man who dares to look at lifethe decline of life such as it isas it must be different mr percy in your situationand in mine the conversation was here interrupted by the arrival of a carriage lord oldborough looked out of the window as it passedthen smiled and observed how altered the times were since clermontpark used to be crowded with visitors and carriagesnow the arrival of one is an event the servant announced a foreign name a neapolitan abbe who had come over in the train of a new ambassador he had just arrived in england and had letters from the cardinal his uncle which he was desired to deliver into lord oldboroughs own hand the abbe was it appeared personally a stranger to him but there had been some ministerial intercourse between his lordship and the cardinal lord oldborough received these political letters with an air of composure and indifference which proved that he ceased to have an interest in the game he supposed he said that the abbe had been apprized that he was no longer one of his majestys ministersthat he had resigned his official situationhad retiredand that he took no part whatever in public affairs the abbe replied that he had been apprized that lord oldborough had retired from the public office but his uncle he added with a significant smile was aware that lord oldboroughs influence was as great still as it had ever been and greater than that of any ostensible minister this lord oldborough disclaimedcoolly observing that his influence whatever it might be could not be known even to himself as it was never exerted and that as he had determined nevermore to interfere in public business he could not be of the least political service to the cardinal the duke of greenwich was now the person to whom on such subjects all applications should be addressed the abbe however repeated that his instructions from the cardinal were positive and peremptory to deliver these letters into no hands but those of lord oldboroughthat in consequence of this strict injunction he had come purposely to present them he was instructed to request his lordship would not put the letters into the hands of any secretary but would have the goodness to examine them himself and give his counsel how to proceed and to whom they should in case of his lordships declining to interfere be addressed mr percy said lord oldborough recalling mr percy who had risen to quit the room you will not leave mewhatever you may wish to say m labbe may be said before this gentlemanmy friend his lordship then opened the packet examined the lettersread and redirected some to the duke of greenwich others to the king the abbe all the time descanting vehemently on neapolitan politicsregretting lord oldboroughs resignationadverting still to his lordships powerful influenceand pressing some point in negotiation for which his uncle the cardinal was most anxious among the letters there was one which lord oldborough did not open he laid it on the table with the direction downwards leaned his elbow upon it and sat as if calmly listening to the abbe but mr percy knowing his countenance saw signs of extraordinary emotion with difficulty repressed at length the gesticulating abbe finished and waited his lordships instructions they were given in few words the letters redirected to the king and the duke of greenwich were returned to him he thanked his lordship with many italian superlativesdeclined his lordships invitation to stay till the next day at clermontparksaid he was pressed in point of timethat it was indispensably necessary for him to be in london to deliver these papers as soon as possible his eye glanced on the unopened letter private sir said lord oldborough in a stern voice without moving his elbow from the paper whatever answer it may require i shall have the honour to transmit to youfor the cardinal the abbe bowed low left his address and took leave lord oldborough after attending him to the door and seeing him depart returned took out his watch and said to mr percy come to me in my cabinet in five minutes seeing his sister on the walk approaching his house he added let none follow me when the five minutes were over mr percy went to lord oldboroughs cabinetknockedno answerknocked againlouderall was silenthe enteredand saw lord oldborough seated but in the attitude of one just going to rise he looked more like a statue than a living person there was a stiffness in his muscles and over his face and hands a deathlike colour his eyes were fixed and directed towards the doorbut they never moved when mr percy entered nor did lord oldborough stir at his approach from one hand which hung over the arm of his chair his spectacles had dropped his other hand grasped an open letter my dear lord cried mr percy he neither heard nor answered mr percy opened the window and let down the blind then attempting to raise the hand which hung down he perceived it was fixed in all the rigidity of catalepsy in hopes of recalling his senses or his power of motion mr percy determined to try to draw the letter from his grasp the moment the letter was touched lord oldborough startedhis eyes darting fiercely upon him who dares who are you sir cried he your friend percymy lord lord oldborough pointed to a chairmr percy sat down his lordship recovered gradually from the species of trance into which he had fallen the cataleptic rigidity of his figure relaxedthe colour of life returnedthe body regained its functionsthe soul resumed at once her powers without seeming sensible of any interruption or intermission of feeling or thought lord oldborough went on speaking to mr percy the letter which i now hold in my hand is from that italian lady of transcendent beauty in whose company you once saw me when we first met at naples she was of high rankhigh endowments i loved her how welli need notcannot say we married secretly i was inducedno matter howto suspect her fidelitypass over these circumstancesi cannot speak or think of them we partedi never saw her more she retired to a convent and died shortly after nor did i till i received this letter written on her deathbed know that she had given me a son the proofs that i wronged her are irresistible would that they had been given to me when i could have repaired my injusticebut her pride prevented their being sent till the hour of her death on the first reading of her letter lord oldborough had been so struck by the idea of the injustice he had done the mother that he seemed scarcely to advert to the idea of his having a son absorbed in the past he was at first insensible both to the present and the future early associations long dormant were suddenly wakened he was carried back with irresistible force to the days of his youth and something of likeness in air and voice to the lord oldborough he had formerly known appeared to mr percy as the tumult of passionate recollections subsided as this enthusiastic reminiscence faded and the memory of the past gave way to the sense of the present lord oldborough resumed his habitual look and manner his thoughts turned upon his son that unknown being who belonged to him who had claims upon him who might form a great addition to the happiness or misery of his life he took up the letter again looked for the passage that related to his son and read it anxiously to himself then to mr percyobserving that the directions were so vague that it would be difficult to act upon them the boy was sent when three years old to england or ireland under the care of an irish priest who delivered him to a merchant recommended by the hamburg banker c i shall have difficulty in tracing thisgreat danger of being mistaken or deceived said lord oldborough pausing with a look of anxiety would to god that i had means of knowing with certainty where and above all what he is or that i had never heard of his existence my lord are there any more particulars inquired mr percy eagerly lord oldborough continued to read four hundred pounds of your english money have been remitted to him annually by means of these hamburg bankers to them we must apply in the first instance said lord oldborough and i will write this moment i think my lord i can save you the trouble said mr percy i know the man lord oldborough put down his pen and looked at mr percy with astonishment yes my lord however extraordinary it may appear i repeat iti believe i know your son and if he be the man i imagine him to be i congratulate youyou have reason to rejoice the facts my dear sir cried lord oldborough do not raise my hopes mr percy repeated all that he had heard from godfrey of mr henryrelated every circumstance from the first commencement of themthe impertinence and insult to which the mystery that hung over his birth had subjected him in the regimentthe quarrels in the regimentthe goodness of major gascoignethe gratitude of mr henrythe attachment between him and godfreyhis selling out of the regiment after godfreys ineffectual journey to londonhis wishing to go into a mercantile housethe letter which godfrey then wrote begging his father to recommend mr henry to mr gresham disclosing to mr percy with mr henrys permission all that he knew of his birth i have that letter at home said mr percy your lordship shall see it i perfectly recollect the circumstances of mr henrys having been brought up in ireland by a dublin merchant and having received constantly a remittance in quarterly payments of four hundred pounds a year from a banker in cork did he inquire why or from whom said lord oldborough and does he know his mother certainly not the answer to his first inquiries prevented all further questions he was told by the bankers that they had directions to stop payment of the remittance if any questions were asked lord oldborough listened with profound attention as mr percy went on with the history of mr henry relating all the circumstances of his honourable conduct with respect to miss pantonhis disinterestedness decision and energy of affection lord oldboroughs emotion increasedhe seemed to recognize some traits of his own character i hope this youth is my son said his lordship in a low suppressed voice he deserves to be yours my lord said mr percy to have a son might be the greatest of evilsto have such a son must be the greatest of blessings said his lordship he was lost in thought for a moment then exclaimed i must see the letteri must see the man my lord he is at my house lord oldborough started from his seatlet me see him instantly tomorrow my lord said mr percy in a calm tone for it was necessary to calm his impetuositytomorrow mr henry could not be brought here tonight without alarming him or without betraying to him the cause of our anxiety tomorrow let it beyou are right my dear friend let me see him without his suspecting that i am any thing to him or he to meyou will let me have the letter tonight certainly my lord mr percy sympathized with his impatience and gratified it with all the celerity of a friend the letter was sent that night to lord oldborough in questioning his sons more particularly concerning mr henry mr percy learnt from erasmus a fresh and strong corroborating circumstance dr percy had been lately attending mr greshams porter obrien the irishman who had been so ill that imagining himself dying he had sent for a priest mr henry was standing by the poor fellows bedside when the priest arrived who was so much struck by the sight of him that for some time his attention could scarcely be fixed on the sick man the priest after he had performed his official duties returned to mr henry begged pardon for having looked at him with so much earnestness but said that mr henry strongly reminded him of the features of an italian lady who had committed a child to his care many years ago this led to farther explanation and upon comparing dates and circumstances mr henry was convinced that this was the very priest who had carried him over to irelandthe priest recognized him to be the child of whom he had taken charge but farther all was darkness the priest knew nothing morenot even the name of the lady from whom he had received the child he knew only that he had been handsomely rewarded by the dublin merchant to whom he had delivered the boyand he had heard that this merchant had since become bankrupt and had fled to america this promise of a discovery and sudden stop to his hopes had only mortified poor mr henry and had irritated that curiosity which he had endeavoured to lull to repose mr percy was careful both for mr henrys sake and for lord oldboroughs not to excite hopes which might not ultimately be accomplished he took precautions to prevent him from suspecting any thing extraordinary in the intended introduction to lord oldborough there had been some dispute between the present minister and some london merchant about the terms of a loan which had been made by lord oldboroughmr greshams house had some concern in this transaction and it was now settled between mr percy and lord oldborough that his lordship should write to desire to see mr henry who as mr greshams partner could give every necessary information mr henry accordingly was summoned to clermontpark and accompanied mr percy with his mind intent upon this business mr henry in common with all who were capable of estimating a great public character had conceived high admiration for lord oldborough he had seen him only in public and at a distanceand it was not without awe that he now thought of being introduced to him and of hearing and speaking to him in private lord oldborough meanwhile who had been satisfied by the perusal of the letter and by mr percys information waited for his arrival with extreme impatience he was walking up and down his room and looking frequently at his watch which he believed more than once to have stopped at length the door opened mr percy and mr henry my lord lord oldboroughs eye darted upon henry struck instantly with the resemblance to the mother lord oldborough rushed forward and clasping him in his arms exclaimed my son tenderness excessive tenderness was in his look voice soul as if he wished to repair in a moment the injustice of years yes said lord oldborough now i am happynow i also mr percy may be proud of a soni too shall know the pleasures of

dont stir prayi begi requesti insist i am by no means ceremonious sir obla bustling and setting two chairs no but id wish to show respect proper to him i consider the first man in the county mr carv

it really obla oh but upon my word and honour its too much theres rason in all things a man of mr carvers fortin to be slaving if you were a man in business like me it would be another thing i must slave at the desk to keep all round see mr carver seeever since the day you advised me to be as particular as yourself in keeping accounts to a farthing i do to a fraction even like state accounts see mr carv and i trust you find your advantage in it sir pray how does the distillery business go on obla swimmingly ever since that time mr carver your interest at the castle helped me at the dead lift and got that fine took off tis to your purtiction encouragement and advice entirely i owe my present unexampled prosperity which you prophesied and mr carvers prophecies seldom i may say never fail to be accomplished mr carv i own there is some truth in your observation i confess i have seldom been mistaken or deceived in my judgment of man woman or child obla who can say so much mr carv for what reason i dont pretend to say but the fact ostensibly is that the few persons i direct with my advice are unquestionably apt to prosper in this world obla mighty apt for which rason i would wish to trouble you for your unprecedently good advice on another pint if it would not be too great a liberty mr carv no liberty at all my good geraldi am always ready to adviseonly todaycertainly the fair day of ballynavogue there are so many calls upon me both in a public and private capacity so much business of vital importance obla aside vital importancethat is his word on all occasions aloud may be then oh where was my head may be you would not have breakfasted all this time and weve the kittle down always in this house rising patjackmickjenny put the kittle down mr carv sit down sit still my worthy fellow breakfasted at bobs fort as i always do obla but a bit of cakea glass of wine to refrish and replinish nature mr carv too earlyspoil my dinner but what was i going to say obla aside burn me if i know and i pray all the saints you may never recollect mr carv i recollect how many times do you think i was stopped on horseback coming up the street of ballynavoguefive times by weights and measures imperiously calling for reformation sir thirteen times upon my veracity by booths applestalls nuisances vagabonds and drunken women pigs without end sirwanting ringing and all squealing in my ears while i was settling sixteen disputes about tolls and customs add to this my regular battle every fairday with the crane which ought to be any where but where it is and my perputual discoveries of fraudulent kegs and stones in the butter now sir i only ask can you wonder that i wipe my forehead wiping his forehead obla in troth mr carver i cannot but these are the pains and penalties of being such a man of consequence as you evidently areand i that am now going to add to your troubles too by consulting you about my little pint mr carv a point of law i dare to say for people somehow or other have got such a prodigious opinion of my law takes snuff obla aside no coming to the pint till he has finished his own panygeric mr carv and i own i cannot absolutely turn my back on people yet as to poor people i always settle them by telling them it is my principle that law is too expensive for the poor i tell them the poor have nothing to do with the laws obla except the penal mr carv true the civil is for us men of property and no man should think of going to law without hes qualified there should be licenses obla no doubt pinalties there are in plinty still those who can afford should indulge in ireland it would as ill become a gentleman to be any way shy of a lawshute as of a duel mr carv yet law is expensive sir even to me obla but tis the best economy in the end for when once you have cast or nonshuted your man in the courts tis as good as winged him in the field and suppose you dont get sixpence costs and lose your cool hundred by it still its a great advantage for you are let alone to enjoy your own in pace and quiet ever after which you could not do in this county without it but the love of the law has carried me away from my business the pint i wanted to consult you about is not a pint of law tis another matter mr carv looking at his watch i must be at bobs fort to seal my despatches for the castle and theres another thing i say of myself obla aside remorseless agotist mr carv i dont know how the people all have got such an idea of my connexions at the castle and my influence with his excellency that i am worried with eternal applications they expect i can make them all gaugers or attorneygenerals i believe how do they know i write to the castle obla oh the postoffice tells asy by the big sales seals to your despatchesasidewhich ill engage is all the castle ever rades of them though carver has his excellency always in his mouth god help him mr carv well you wanted to consult me gerald obla and youll give me your advice which will be

own dressingtable at hamdenplace in kent exact gilbert most punctual of valet de chambresand a young fellow as he is too it is admirableay though he looks as if he were made of wood and moves like an automaton he has a warm heart and a true english spirittrueborn english every inch of him i remember him when first i saw him ten years ago at his fathers farmer ashfields at the harvesthome there was gilbert in all his glory seated on the top of a hayrick singing then sing in praise of men of kent so loyal brave and free of britains race if one surpass a man of kent is he how he brought himself to quit the men of kent to come to ireland with me is wonderful however now he is here i hope he is tolerably happy i must ask the question in direct terms for gilbert would never speak till spoken to let him feel what he might sir w calls gilbertgilbert enter gilbert gilb here sir sir w gilbert now you have been in ireland some weeks i hope you are not unhappy gilb no sir thank you sir sir w but are you happy man gilb yes sir thank you sir gilbert retires and seems busy arranging his masters clothes sir william continues dressing sir w aside yes sir thank you sir as dry as a chipsparing of his words as if they were his last and the fellow can talk if he wouldhas humour too if one could get it out and eloquence could i but touch the right string the heartstring ill try again aloud gilbert gilb yes sir comes forward respectfully sir w pray what regiment was it that was passing yesterday through the village of bannow gilb i do not know indeed sir sir w that is to say you saw they were highlanders and that was enough for youyou are not fond of the scotch gilbert gilb no sir i cant say as i be sir w but gilbert for my sake you must conquer this prejudice i have many scotch friends whom i shall go to visit one of these daysexcellent friends they are gilb are they sir if so be you found them so i will do my best im sure sir w then pray go down to the inn here and inquire if any of the scotch officers are there gilb i will sir i heard say the officers went off this morning sir w then you need not go to inquire for them gilb no sir only as i heard say the drummajor and band is to stay a few days in bannow on account of their wanting to enlist a new bugleboy i was a thinking if so be sir you thought well of it on account you like these scotch id better to step down and see how the men be as to being comfortable sir w thats right do pray have they tolerable accommodations at the inn in this village gilb smiling i cant say much for that sir sir w aside now i shall set him going aloud what the inn here is not like one of our english inns on the bath road gilb suppressing a laugh bath road bless you sir its no more like an inn on the bath road nor on any road cross or byroad whatsomdever as ever i seed in england no more likeno more like than nothing at all sir sir w what sort of a place is it then gilb why sir id be ashamed almost to tell you why sir i never seed such a place to call an inn in all my born days afore first and foremost sir theres the pig is in and out of the kitchen all day long and next the calf has what they call the run of the kitchen so what with them brute beasts and the poultry that has no coop and is always under ones feet or over ones head the kitchen is no place for a christian even to eat his bread and cheese in sir w well so much for the kitchen but the parlourthey have a parlour i suppose gilb yes sir they have a parlour as they may call it if they think proper sir but then again an honest english farmer would be afeard on his life to stay in it on account of the ceiling just a coming down a top of his head and if he should go up stairs sir why thats as bad again and worse for the half of them there stairs is rotten and ever so many pulled down and burnt sir w burntthe stairs gilb burnt sir as sure as im standing hereburnt sir for fuel one scarce year as they says sir moreover when a man does get up the stairs sir why he is as bad off again and worse for the floor of the place they calls the bedchamber shakes at every step as if it was a coming down with one and the walls has all cracks from top to toeand theres ratholes or holes o some sort or tother all in the floor so that if a man dont pick his steps curiously his leg must go down through the ceiling below and moreover theres holes over head through the roof sir so that if it rains it cant but pour on the bed they tell me they used for to shift the bed from one place to another to find as they say the dry corner but now the floor is grown so crazy they dare not stir the bed for their lives sir w worse and worse gilb and moreover they have it now in the worst place in the whole room sir close at the head of the bed there is a window with every pane broke and some out entirely and the womens petticoats and the mens hats just stuck in to stop all for the night as they say sir gilbert tries to stifle his laughter sir w laugh out honest gilbert in spite of your gravity and your civility laugh there is no harm but sometimes a great deal of good done by laughing especially in ireland laughing has mended or caused to be mended many things that never would have been mended otherwise gilb recovering his gravity thats true i dare to say sir sir w now gilbert if you were to keep an inn it would be a very different sort of inn from what you have been describingwould not it gilb i hope so sir sir w i remember when we were talking of establishing you in england that your father told me you would like to set up an inn gilb his face brightening for sartin sir tis the thing in the whole world i should like the best and be the proudest on if so be it was in my power and if so be sir you could spare me holding his masters coat for him to put on sir w could spare you gilberti will spare you whether i can conveniently or not if i had an opportunity of establishing advantageously a man who has served me faithfully for ten years do you think i would not put myself to a little inconvenience to do itgilbert you do not know sir william hamden gilb thank you sir but i doand i should be main sorry to leave you thats sartin if it was even to be landlord of the best inn in all englandi know i should sir w i believe itbut staylet us understand one anotheri am not talking of england and perhaps you are not thinking of ireland gilb yes sir but i am sir w you are i am heartily glad to hear it for then i can serve you directly this young heiress my niece to whom this town belongs has a new inn ready built gilb i know sir sir w then gilbert write a proposal for this inn if you wish for it and i will speak to my niece gilb bowing i thank you sironly i hope i shall not stand in any honest mans light as to a dishonest man i cant say i value standing in his light being that he has no right to have any as i can see sir w so gilbert you will settle in ireland at last i am heartily glad to see you have overcome your prejudices against this country how has this been brought about gilb why sir the thing was i didnt know nothing about it and there was a many lies told backwards and forwards of ireland by a many that ought to have known better sir w and now that you have seen with your own eyes you are happily convinced that in ireland the men are not all savages gilb no sir no ways savage except in the article of some of them going barefooted but the men is good men most of them sir w and the women you find that they have not wings on their shoulders gilb no sir smiling and im glad they have not got wings else they might fly away from us which id be sorry forsome of them after making this speech gilbert steps back and brushes his masters hat diligently sir w aside ha is that the case now i understand it all tis fair that cupid who blinds so many should open the eyes of some of his votaries aloud when you set up as landlord in your new inn gilbert gilbert comes forward you will want a landlady shall not you gilb falls back and answers i shall sir i suppose sir w misswhats her name the daughter of the landlord of the present inn misswhats her name gilb answers without coming forward miss gallagher sir sir w miss gallaghera very ugly namei think it would be charity to change it gilbert gilb bashfully it would no doubt sir sir w she is a very pretty girl gilb she is sir no doubt cleaning the brush with his hand bows and is retiring sir w gilbert stay gilbert returns i say gilbert i took particular notice of this miss gallagher as she was speaking to you last sunday i thought she seemed to smile upon you gilbert gilb very bashfully i cant say indeed sir sir w i dont mean my good gilbert to press you to say any thing that you dont choose to say it was not from idle curiosity that i asked any questions but from a sincere desire to serve you in whatever way you like best gilbert gilb oh dear master i cant speak you are so good to me and always wastoo goodso i say nothing only im not ungratefuli know im not ungrateful that i am not and as to the rest theres not a thought i have youd condescend for to know but you should know it as soon as my motherthats to say as soon as ever i knowed it myself but sir the thing is this since youre so good to let me speak to you sir sir w speak on pray my good fellow gilb then sir the thing is this theres one girl they say has set her thoughts upon me now i dont like she because why i loves another but i should not choose to say so on account of its not being over and above civil and on account of my not knowing yet for sartin whether or not the girl i loves loves me being i never yet could bring myself to ask her the question id rather not mention her name neither till i be more at a sartinty but since you be so kind sir if you be so good to give me till this evening sir as i have now with the hopes of the new inn an independency to offer her i will take courage and i shall have her answer soon sirand i will let you know with many thanks sir whetherwhether my hearts broke or not exit gilbert hastily sir w alone good affectionate creature but who would have thought that out of that piece of wood a lover could be

to see thee rest while mabel is singing the second stanza owen and andrew hope enter mr hope stops short and listens he makes a sign to owen to stand still and not to interrupt mabelwhile owen approaches her on tiptoe mr h aside she taks my fancy back to dear scotland to my ain hame and my ain mither and my ain kate owen so mabel i thought you never sung for strangers mabel turns and sees mr hopeshe rises and curtsies mr h advancing softly i fear to disturb the mother whose slumbers are so blest and id fain hear that lullaby again if the voice stop the mother may miss it and wake mabel looking into the room in which her mother sleeps then closing the door gently no sirshell not miss my voice now i thank youshe is quite sound asleep owen this is mr andrew hope mabelyou might remember

what is it youre talking of going turning towards the door of her mothers room suddenly take care but shed wake and hear you and shed never sleep easy again owen and do you think so mabel do i think so am not i sure of it and you too owen if youd take time to think and feel owen why theres no doubt but its hard when the mother has reared the son for him to quit her as soon as he can go alone but it is what i was thinking it is only the militia you know and id not be going out of the three kingdoms ever at all and i could be sending money home to my mother like johnny reel did to his mabel money is it then theres no money you could send hernot the full of lough erne itself in golden guineas could make her amends for the loss of yourself owen and you know that mr h and i am not the man that would entice you to list or gang with me in contradiction to your duty at home or your interest abroad so turning to mabel do not look on me as the tempter to evil nor with distrust as you do kind sister as you are and like my own kate but hear me coolly and without prejudice for it is his gude i wish mabel i am listening then and i ask your pardon if i looked a doubt mr h the gude mother must wish above all things here below the weal and advancement and the honour of her bairns and she would not let the son be tied to her apronstrings for any use or profit to herself but ever wish him to do the best in life for his sel is not this truth gude friendsplain truth mabel it is theni own that truth and sense too owen now see there mabel mr h and better for him to do something abroad than digging at home and in the army he might get onand heres the bugleboys pay mabel is it a bugleboy you are thinking of making him mr h thats the only thing i could make him i wish i could offer better mabel then i thank you sir and i wouldnt doubt yeand it would be very well for a common boy that could only dig but my brothers no common boy sir owen oh mabel mabel hush owen for its the truth im telling and if to your face i cant help it you may hide the face but i wont hide the truth mr h then speak on my warmhearted lassy speak on mabel then sir he got an edication while ever my poor father lived and no better scholar they said for the teaching he gotbut all was given over when the father died and the troubles came and owen as he ought give himself up intirely for my mother to help her a widow but its not digging and slaving he is to be alwaysits with the head as my father used to say hell make more than the hands and we hope to get a clerks place for him sometime or there will be a schoolmaster wanting in this town and that will be what he would be fit for and notbut its not civil before you a soldier sir to say the rest mr h fear not you will not give offence mabel and not to be spending his breath blowing through a horn all his days for the sake of wearing a fine red coat i beg your pardon again sir if i say too muchbut its to save my brother and my mother mr h i like you the better for all youve said for both owen and im off entirelyill not list i thank you sir mabel clasps her hands joyfully then embraces her brother mr h and ill not ask you to listand i would not

was mistakenthats all mabel i hope thats all but ive no dependance on him for a friend nor has my mother owen why he was saying to me and i could not say against it that he had a right to propose for the inn if he could though gilbert and we wanted to get it mabel then i wonder why christy should be preferred rather than my mother owen then thats a wonderand i cant understand how that was mr h i

it is to be born a woman in vain dear leonora would you reconcile me to my doom condemned to incessant hypocrisy or everlasting misery woman is the slave or the outcast of society confidence in our fellowcreatures or in ourselves alike forbidden us to what purpose have we understandings which we may not use hearts which we may not trust to our unhappy sex genius and sensibility are the most treacherous gifts of heaven why should we cultivate talents merely to gratify the caprice of tyrants why seek for knowledge which can prove only that our wretchedness is irremediable if a ray of light break in upon us it is but to make darkness more visible to show us the narrow limits the gothic structure the impenetrable barriers of our prison forgive me if on this subject i cannot speakif i cannot thinkwith patience is it not fabled that the gods to punish some refractory mortal of the male kind doomed his soul to inhabit upon earth a female form a punishment more degrading or more difficult to endure could scarcely be devised by cruelty omnipotent what dangers what sorrows what persecutions what nameless evils await the woman who dares to rise above the prejudices of her sex ah happy they the happiest of their kind who without a struggle submit their reason to be swathed by all the absurd bandages of custom what though they cripple or distort their minds are not these deformities beauties in the eyes of fashion and are not these people the favoured nurselings of the world secure of her smiles her caresses her fostering praise her partial protection through all the dangers of youth and all the dotage of age ah happy they the happiest of their kind who learn to speak and think and act by rote who have a phrase or a maxim or a formula ready for every occasion who follow all the nurse and all the priest have taught and is it possible that olivia can envy these tidelessblooded souls their happinesstheir apathy is her high spirit so broken by adversity not such the promise of her early years not such the language of her unsophisticated heart alas i scarcely know i scarcely recollect that proud self which was wont to defy the voice of opinion and to set at nought the decrees of prejudice the events of my life shall be related or rather the history of my sensations for in a life like mine sensations become eventsa metamorphosis which you will see in every page of my history i feel an irresistible impulse to open my whole heart to you my dear leonora i ought to be awed by the superiority of your understanding and of your character yet there is an indulgence in your nature a softness in your temper that dissipates fear and irresistibly attracts confidence you have generously refused to be prejudiced against me by busy malignant rumour you have resolved to judge of me for yourself nothing then shall be concealed in such circumstances i cannot seek to extenuate any of my faults or follies i am ready to acknowledge them all with selfhumiliation more poignant than the sarcasms of my bitterest enemies but i must pause till i have summoned courage for my confession dear leonora adieu olivia letter ii olivia to leonora full of life and spirits with a heart formed for all the enthusiasm for all the delicacy of love i married early in the fond expectation of meeting a heart suited to my own cruelly disappointed i foundmerely a husband my heart recoiled upon itself true to my own principles of virtue i scorned dissimulation i candidly confessed to my husband that my love was extinguished i proved to him alas too clearly that we were not born for each other the attractive moment of illusion was pastnever more to return the repulsive reality remained the living was chained to the dead and by the inexorable tyranny of english laws that chain eternally galling to innocence can be severed only by the desperation of vice divorce according to our barbarous institutions cannot be obtained without guilt appalled at the thought i saw no hope but in submission yet to submit to live with the man i could not love was to a mind like mine impossible my principles and my feelings equally revolted from this legal prostitution we separated i sought for balm to my wounded heart in foreign climes to the beauties of nature i was ever feelingly alive amidst the sublime scenes of switzerland and on the consecrated borders of her classic lakes i sometimes forgot myself to happiness felicity how transienttransient as the daydreams that played upon my fancy in the bright morning of love alas not all creations charms could soothe me to repose i wandered in search of that which change of place cannot afford there was an aching void in my heartan indescribable sadness over my spirits sometimes i had recourse to books but how few were in unison with my feelings or touched the trembling chords of my disordered mind commonplace morality i could not endure history presented nothing but a mass of crimes metaphysics promised some relief and i bewildered myself in their not inelegant labyrinth but to the bold genius and exquisite pathos of some german novelists i hold myself indebted for my largest portion of ideal bliss for those rapt moments when sympathy with kindred souls transported me into better worlds and consigned vulgar realities to oblivion i am well aware my leonora that you approve not of these my favourite writers but yours is the morality of one who has never known sorrow i also would interdict such cordials to the happy but would you forbid those to taste felicity in dreams who feel only misery when awake would you dash the cup of lethe from lips to which no other beverage is salubrious or sweet by the use of these opiates my soul gradually settled into a sort of pleasing pensive melancholy has it not been said that melancholy is a characteristic of genius i make no pretensions to genius but i am persuaded that melancholy is the habitual perhaps the natural state of those who have the misfortune to feel with delicacy you my dear leonora will class this notion amongst what you once called my refined errors indeed i must confess that i see in you an exception so striking as almost to compel me to relinquish my theory but again let me remind you that your lot in life has been different from mine alas how different why had not i such a friend such a mother as yours early to direct my uncertain steps and to educate me to happiness i might have beenbut no matter what i might have been i must tell you what i have been separated from my husband without a guide without a friend at the most perilous period of my life i was left to that most insidious of counsellorsmy own heartmy own weak heart when i was least prepared to resist the impression it was my misfortune to meet with a man of a soul congenial with my own before i felt my danger i was entangled beyond the possibility of escape the net was thrown over my heart its struggles were to no purpose but to exhaust my strength virtue commanded me to be miserableand i was miserable but do i dare to expect your pity leonora for such an attachment it excites your indignation perhaps your horror blame despise detest me all this would i rather bear than deceive you into fancying me better than i really am do not however think me worse if my views had been less pure if i had felt less reliance on the firmness of my own principles and less repugnance to artifice i might easily have avoided some appearances which have injured me in the eyes of the world with real contrition i confess that a fatal mixture of masculine independence of spirit and of female tenderness of heart has betrayed me into many imprudences but of vice and of that meanest species of vice hypocrisy i thank heaven my conscience can acquit me all i have now to hope is that you my indulgent my generous leonora will not utterly condemn me truth and gratitude are my only claims to your friendshipto a friendship which would be to me the first of earthly blessings which might make me amends for all i have lost consider this before unworthy as i am you reject me from your esteem counsel guide save me without vanity but with confidence i say it i have a heart that will repay you for affection you will find me easily moved easily governed by kindness yours has already sunk deep into my soul and your power is unlimited over the affections and over the understanding of your obliged olivia letter iii from lady leonora l to her mother the duchess of enclosing the preceding letters i am permitted to send you my dear mother the enclosed letters mixed with what you may not approve you will i think find in them proofs of an affectionate heart and superior abilities lady olivia is just returned to england scandal imported from the continent has had such an effect in prejudicing many of her former friends and acquaintance against her that she is in danger of being excluded from that society of which she was once the ornament and the favourite but i am determined to support her cause and to do every thing in my power to counteract the effects of malignity i cannot sufficiently express the indignation that i feel against the mischievous spirit of scandal which destroys happiness at every breath and which delights in the meanest of all malignant feelingsthe triumph over the errors of superior characters olivia has been much blamed because she has been much envied indeed my dear mother you have been prejudiced against her by false reports do not imagine that her fascinating manners have blinded my judgment i assure you that i have discerned or rather that she has revealed to me all her faults and ought not this candour to make a strong impression upon my mind in her favour consider how young how beautiful she was at her first entrance into fashionable life how much exposed to temptation surrounded by flatterers and without a single friend i am persuaded that she would have escaped all censure and would have avoided all the errors with which she now reproaches herself if she had been blessed with a mother such as mine leonora l letter iv the duchess of to her daughter my dearest child i must answer your last before i sleepbefore i can sleep in peace i have just finished reading the rhapsody which it enclosed and whilst my mind is full and warm upon the subject let me write for i can write to my own satisfaction at no other time i admire and love you my child for the generous indignation you express against those who trample upon the fallen or who meanly triumph over the errors of superior genius and if i seem more cold or more severe than you wish me to be attribute this to my anxiety for your happiness and to that caution which is perhaps the infirmity of age in the course of my long life i have alas seen vice and folly dressed in so many different fashions that i can find no difficulty in detecting them under any disguise but your unpractised eyes are almost as easily deceived as when you were five years old and when you could not believe that your pasteboard nun was the same person in her various changes of attire nothing would tempt you to associate with those who have avowed themselves regardless of right and wrong but i must warn you against another and a far more dangerous class who professing the most refined delicacy of sentiment and boasting of invulnerable virtue exhibit themselves in the most improper and hazardous situations and who because they are without fear expect to be deemed free from reproach either from miraculous good fortune or from a singularity of temper these adventurous heroines may possibly escape with what they call perfect innocence so much the worse for society their example tempts others who fall a sacrifice to their weakness and folly i would punish the tempters in this case more than the victims and for them the most effectual species of punishment is contempt neglect is death to these female lovers of notoriety the moment they are out of fashion their power to work mischief ceases those who from their character and rank have influence over public opinion are bound to consider these things in the choice of their associates this is peculiarly necessary in days when attempts are made to level all distinctions you have sometimes hinted to me my dear daughter with all proper delicacy that i am too strict in my notions and that unknown to myself my pride mixes with morality be it so the pride of family and the pride of virtue should reciprocally support each other were i asked what i think the best guard to a nobility in this or in any other country i should answer virtue i admire that simple epitaph in westminster abbey on the duchess of newcastleher name was margaret lucas youngest sister to the lord lucas of colchestera noble family for all the brothers were valiant and all the sisters virtuous i look to the temper of the times in forming rules for conduct of late years we have seen wonderful changes in female manners i may be like the old marquis in gil blas who contended that even the peaches of modern days had deteriorated but i fear that my complaints of the degeneracy of human kind are better founded than his fears for the vegetable creation a taste for the elegant profligacy of french gallantry was i remember introduced into this country before the destruction of the french monarchy since that time some sentimental writers and pretended philosophers of our own and foreign countries have endeavoured to confound all our ideas of morality to every rule of right they have found exceptions and on these they have fixed the public attention by adorning them with all the splendid decorations of eloquence so that the rule is despised or forgotten and the exception triumphantly established in its stead these orators seem as if they had been employed by satan to plead the cause of vice and as if possessed by the evil spirit they speak with a vehemence which carries away their auditors or with a subtlety which deludes their better judgment they put extreme cases in which virtue may become vice or vice virtue they exhibit criminal passions in constant connexion with the most exalted the most amiable virtues thus making use of the best feelings of human nature for the worst purposes they engage pity or admiration perpetually on the side of guilt eternally talking of philosophy or philanthropy they borrow the terms only to perplex the ignorant and seduce the imagination they have their systems and their theories and in theory they pretend that the general good of society is their sole immutable rule of morality and in practice they make the variable feelings of each individual the judges of this general good their systems disdain all the vulgar virtues intent upon some beau ideal of perfection or perfectibility they set common sense and common honesty at defiance no matter their doctrine so convenient to the passions and soporific to the conscience can never want partisans especially by weak and enthusiastic women it is adopted and propagated with eagerness then they become personages of importance and zealots in support of their sublime opinions and they can readand they can writeand they can talkand they can effect a revolution in public opinion i am afraid indeed that they can for of late years we have heard more of sentiment than of principles more of the rights of woman than of her duties we have seen talents disgraced by the conduct of their possessors and perverted in the vain attempt to defend what is unjustifiable where must all this end where the abuse of reason inevitably endsin the ultimate law of force if in this age of reason women make a bad use of that power which they have obtained by the cultivation of their understanding they will degrade and enslave themselves beyond redemption they will reduce their sex to a situation worse than it ever experienced even in the ages of ignorance and superstition if men find that the virtue of women diminishes in proportion as intellectual cultivation increases they will connect fatally for the freedom and happiness of our sex the ideas of female ignorance and female innocence they will decide that one is the effect of the other they will not pause to distinguish between the use and the abuse of reason they will not stand by to see further experiments tried at their expense but they will prohibit knowledge altogether as a pernicious commodity and will exert the superior power which nature and society place in their hands to enforce their decrees opinion obtained freedom for women by opinion they may be again enslaved it is therefore the interest of the female world and of society that women should be deterred by the dread of shame from passing the bounds of discretion no false lenity no partiality in favour of amusing talents or agreeable manners should admit of exceptions which become dangerous examples of impunity the rank and superior understanding of a delinquent ought not to be considered in mitigation but as aggravating circumstances rank makes ill conduct more conspicuous talents make it more dangerous women of abilities if they err usually employ all their powers to justify rather than to amend their faults i am afraid my dear daughter that my general arguments are closing round your olivia but i must bid you a good night for my poor eyes will serve me no longer god bless you my dear child letter v leonora to her mother i agree with you my dear mother that in these times especially it is incumbent upon all persons whose rank or reputation may influence public opinion to be particularly careful to support the cause of female honour of virtue and religion with the same object in view we may however differ in the choice of means for its attainment pleasure as well as pain acts upon human creatures and therefore in governing them may not reward be full as efficacious as punishment our sex are sufficiently apprised of the fatal consequences of ill conduct the advantages of wellearned reputation should be at least as great as certain and as permanent in former times a single finger pointed at the scutcheon of a knight challenged him to defend his fame but the defiance was open the defence was public and if the charge proved groundless it injured none but the malicious accuser in our days female reputation which is of a nature more delicate than the honour of any knight may be destroyed by the finger of private malice the whisper of secret scandal which admits of no fair or public answer is too often sufficient to dishonour a life of spotless fame this is the height not only of injustice but of impolicy women will become indifferent to reputation which it is so difficult even by the prudence of years to acquire and which it is so easy to lose in a moment by the malice or thoughtlessness of those who invent or who repeat scandal those who call themselves the world often judge without listening to evidence and proceed upon suspicion with as much promptitude and severity as if they had the most convincing proofs but because caesar nearly two thousand years ago said that his wife ought not even to be suspected and divorced her upon the strength of this sentiment shall we make it a general maxim that suspicion justifies punishment we might as well applaud those who when their friends are barely suspected to be tainted with the plague drive them from all human comfort and assistance even where women from the thoughtless gaiety of youth or the impulse of inexperienced enthusiasm may have given some slight cause for censure i would not have virtue put on all her gorgon terrors nor appear circled by the vengeful band of prudes her chastening hand will be more beneficially felt if she wear her more benign form to place the imprudent in the same class with the vicious is injustice and impolicy were the same punishment and the same disgrace to be affixed to small and to great offences the number of capital offenders would certainly increase those who were disposed to yield to their passions would when they had once failed in exact decorum see no motive no fear to restrain them and there would be no pause no interval between error and profligacy amongst females who have been imprudent there are many things to be considered which ought to recommend them to mercy the judge when he is obliged to pronounce the immutable sentence of the law often with tears wishes that it were in his power to mitigate the punishment the decisions of opinion may and must vary with circumstances else the degree of reprobation which they inflict cannot be proportioned to the offence or calculated for the good of society among the mitigating circumstances i should be inclined to name even those which you bring in aggravation talents and what is called genius in our sex are often connected with a warmth of heart an enthusiasm of temper which expose to dangers from which the coldness of mediocrity is safe in the illuminated palace of ice the lights which render the spectacle splendid and which raise the admiration of the beholders endanger the fabric and tend to its destruction but you will tell me dear mother that allusion is not argumentand i am almost afraid to proceed lest you should think me an advocate for vice i would not shut the gates of mercy inexorably and indiscriminately upon all those of my own sex who have even been more than imprudent he taught them shame the sudden sense of ill shame natures hasty conscience which forbids weak inclination ere it grows to will or stays rash will before it grows to deeds whilst a woman is alive to shame she cannot be dead to virtue but by injudicious or incessant reproach this principle even where it is most exquisite may be most easily destroyed the mimosa when too long exposed to each rude touch loses its retractile sensibility it ought surely to be the care of the wise and benevolent to cherish that principle implanted in our nature as the guard of virtue that principle upon which legislators rest the force of punishment and all the grand interests of society my dear mother perhaps you will be surprised at the style in which i have been writing and you will smile at hearing your leonora discuss the duties of legislators and the grand interests of society she has not done so from presumption or from affectation she was alarmed by your supposing that her judgment was deluded by fascinating manners and she determined to produce general arguments to convince you that she is not actuated by particular prepossession you see that i have at least some show of reason on my side i have forborne to mention olivias name but now that i have obviated i hope by reasoning the imputation of partiality i may observe that all my arguments are strongly in her favour she had been attacked by slander the world has condemned her upon suspicion merely she has been imprudent but i repeat in the strongest terms that i am convinced of her innocence and that i should bitterly regret that a woman with such an affectionate heart such uncommon candour and such superior abilities should be lost to society tell me my dear mother that you are no longer in anxiety about the consequences of my attachment to olivia your affectionate daughter leonora letter vi the duchess of to her daughter you lament my dear child that such an affectionate heart such great abilities as olivias should be lost to society before i sympathize in your pity my judgment must be convinced that it is reasonable what proofs has lady olivia given of her affectionate heart she is at variance with both her parents she is separated from her husband and she leaves her child in a foreign country to be educated by strangers am i to understand that her ladyships neglecting to perform the duties of a daughter a wife and a mother are proofs of an affectionate heart as to her superior talents do they contribute to her own happiness or to the happiness of others evidently not to her own for by her account of herself she is one of the most miserable wretches alive she tells you that she went to foreign climes in search of balm for a wounded heart and wandered from place to place looking for what no place could afford she talks of indescribable sadnessan aching voidan impenetrable prisondarkness visibledead bodies chained to living ones and she exhibits all the disordered furniture of a diseased mind but you say that though her powers are thus insufficient to make herself happy they may amuse or instruct the world and of this i am to judge by the letters which you have sent me you admire fine writing so do i i class eloquence high amongst the fine arts but by eloquence i mean something more than dr johnson defines it to be the art of speaking with fluency and elegance this is an art which is now possessed to a certain degree by every boardingschool miss every scribbling young lady can now string sentences and sentiments together and can turn a period harmoniously upon the strength of these accomplishments they commence heroines and claim the privileges of the order privileges which go to an indefinite and most alarming extent every heroine may have her own code of morality for her private use and she is to be tried by no other she may rail as loudly as she pleases at the barbarous institutions of society and may deplore the inexorable tyranny of the english laws if she find herself involved in delicate entanglements of crossing duties she may break through any one or all of them to extricate herself with a noble contempt of prejudice i have promised to reason calmly but i cannot repress the terror which i feel at the idea of my daughters becoming the friend of one of these women olivias letters are i think in the true heroine style and they might make a brilliant figure in a certain class of novels she begins with a bold exclamation on the misfortune of being born a womanthe slave or the outcast of society condemned to incessant hypocrisy does she mean modesty her manly soul feels it the most degrading punishment that omnipotent cruelty could devise to be imprisoned in a female form from such a masculine spirit some fortitude and magnanimity might be expected but presently she begs to be pitied for a broken spirit and more than female tenderness of heart i have observed that the ladies who wish to be men are usually those who have not sufficient strength of mind to be women olivia proceeds in an ironical strain to envy as the happiest of their sex those who submit to be swathed by custom these persons she stigmatizes with the epithet of tidelessblooded it is the common trick of unprincipled women to affect to despise those who conduct themselves with propriety prudence they term coldness fortitude insensibility and regard to the rights of others prejudice by this perversion of terms they would laugh or sneer virtue out of countenance and by robbing her of all praise they would deprive her of all immediate motive conscious of their own degradation they would lower every thing and every body to their own standard they would make you believe that those who have not yielded to their passions are destitute of sensibility that the love which is not blazoned forth in glaring colours is not entitled to our sympathy the sacrifice of the strongest feelings of the human heart to a sense of duty is to be called mean or absurd but the shameless frenzy of passion exposing itself to public gaze is to be an object of admiration these heroines talk of strength of mind but they forget that strength of mind is to be shown in resisting their passions not in yielding to them without being absolutely of an opinion which i have heard maintained that all virtue is sacrifice i am convinced that the essential characteristic of virtue is to bear and forbear these sentimentalists can do neither they talk of sacrifices and generosity but they are the veriest egotiststhe most selfish creatures alive open your eyes my dear leonora and see things as they really are lady olivia thinks it a sufficient excuse for abandoning her husband to say that she found his soul was not in unison with hers she thinks it an adequate apology for a criminal attachment to tell you that the net was thrown over her heart before she felt her danger that all its struggles were to no purpose but to exhaust her strength if she did not feel her danger she prepared it the course of reading which her ladyship followed was the certain preparation for her subsequent conduct she tells us that she could not endure the commonplace of morality but metaphysics promised her some relief in these days a heroine need not be amoralist but she must be a metaphysician she must wander in the not inelegant labyrinth and if in the midst of it she comes unawares upon the monster vice she must not start though she have no clue to secure her retreat from metaphysics lady olivia went on to german novels for her largest portions of bliss for those rapt moments which consigned vulgar realities to oblivion she owns herself indebted to those writers who promise an ideal world of pleasure which like the mirage in the desert bewilders the feverish imagination i always suspected the imagination of these women of feeling to be more susceptible than their hearts they want excitation for their morbid sensibility and they care not at what expense it is procured if they could make all the pleasures of life into one cordial they would swallow it at a draught in a fit of sentimental spleen the mental intemperance that they indulge in promiscuous novelreading destroys all vigour and clearness of judgment every thing dances in the varying medium of their imagination sophistry passes for reasoning nothing appears profound but what is obscure nothing sublime but what is beyond the reach of mortal comprehension to their vitiated taste the simple pathos which oersteps not the modesty of nature appears cold tame and insipid they must have scenes and a coup de theatre and ranting and raving and stabbing and drowning and poisoning for with them there is no love without murder love in their representations is indeed a distorted ridiculous horrid monster from whom common sense taste decency and nature recoil but i will be calmyou say my dear leonora that your judgment has not been blinded by lady olivias fascinating manners but that you are strongly influenced in her favour by that candour with which she has revealed to you all her faults the value of candour in individuals should be measured by their sensibility to shame when a woman throws off all restraint and then desires me to admire her candour i am astonished only at her assurance do not be the dupe of such candour lady olivia avows a criminal passion yet you say that you have no doubt of her innocence the persuasion of your unsuspecting heart is no argument when you give me any proofs in her favour i shall pay them all due attention in the mean time i have given you my opinion of those ladies who place themselves in the most perilous situations and then expect you to believe them safe olivias professions of regard for you are indeed enthusiastic she tells you that your power is unlimited over her heart and understanding that your friendship would be to her one of the greatest of earthly blessings may be sobut i cannot wish you to be her friend with whatever confidence she makes the assertion do not believe that she has a heart capable of feeling the value of yours these sentimental unprincipled women make the worst friends in the world we are often told that poor creatures they do nobody any harm but themselves but in society it is scarcely possible for a woman to do harm to herself without doing harm to others all her connexions must be involved in the consequences of her imprudence besides what confidence can you repose in them if you should happen to be an obstacle in the way of any of their fancies do you think that they will respect you or your interest when they have not scrupled to sacrifice their own to the gratification of their passions do you think that the gossamer of sentiment will restrain those whom the strong chains of prudence could not hold oh my dearest child forcibly as these arguments carry conviction to my mind i dread lest your compassionate generous temper should prevent their reaching your understanding then let me conjure you by all the respect which you have ever shown for your mothers opinions by all that you hold dear or sacred beware of forming an intimacy with an unprincipled woman believe me to be your truly affectionate mother letter vii leonora to her mother no daughter ever felt more respect for the opinions of a parent than i do for yours my dearest mother but you have never even from childhood required from me a blind submissionyou have always encouraged me to desire conviction and now when the happiness of another is at stake you will forgive me if i am less disposed to yield than i should be i hope if my own interest or taste were alone concerned you ask me what proofs i have of lady olivias innocence believe me i have such as are convincing to my unbiassed judgment and such as would be sufficient to satisfy all your doubts were i at liberty to lay the whole truth before you but even to exculpate herself olivia will not ruin in your opinion her husband of whom you imagine that she has no reason to complain i who know how anxious she is to obtain your esteem can appreciate the sacrifice that she makes and in this instance as in many others i admire her magnanimity it is equal to her candour for which she is entitled to praise even by your own principles dear mother since far from having thrown off all restraint she is exquisitely susceptible of shame as to her understandinghave no persons of great talents ever been unfortunate frequently we see that they have not been able by all their efforts and all their powers to remedy the defects in the characters and tempers of those with whom they have unhappily been connected olivia married very young and was unfortunately mistaken in her choice of a husband on that subject i can only deplore her error and its consequences but as to her disagreements with her own family i do not think her to blame for the mistakes we make in the choice of lovers or friends we may be answerable but we cannot be responsible for the faults of the relations who are given to us by nature if we do not please them it may be our misfortune it is not necessarily our fault i cannot be more explicit without betraying lady olivias confidence and implicating others in defending her with respect to that attachment of which you speak with so much just severity she has given me the strongest assurances that she will do every thing in her power to conquer it absence you know is the first and the most difficult step and this she has taken her course of reading displeases you i cannot defend it but i am persuaded that it is not a proof of her taste being vitiated many people read ordinary novels as others take snuff merely from habit from the want of petty excitation and not as you suppose from the want of exorbitant or improper stimulus those who are unhappy have recourse to any trifling amusement that can change the course of their thoughts i do not justify olivia for having chosen such comforters as certain novels but i pity her and impute this choice to want of fortitude not to depravity of taste before she married a strict injunction was laid upon her not to read any book that was called a novel this raised in her mind a sort of perverse curiosity by making any books or opinions contraband the desire to read and circulate them is increased bad principles are consequently smuggled into families and being kept secret can never be subject to fair examination i think it must be advantageous to the right side of any question that all which can be said against it should be openly heard that it may be answered i do not hate when vice can bolt her arguments for i know that virtue has a tongue to answer her the more vice repeats her assertions the better because when familiarized their boldness will not astound the understanding and the charm of novelty will not be mistaken for the power of truth we may observe that the admiration for the class of writers to whom you allude though violent in its commencement has abated since they have been more known and numbers who began with rapture have ended with disgust persons of vivacious imaginations like olivia may be caught at first view by whatever has the appearance of grandeur or sublimity but if time be allowed for examination they will infallibly detect the disproportions and these will ever afterwards shock their taste if you will not allow leisure for comparisonif you say do not look at such strange objects the obedient eyes may turn aside but the rebel imagination pictures something a thousand times more wonderful and charming than the reality i will venture to predict that olivia will soon be tired of the species of novels which she now admires and that once surfeited with these books and convinced of their pernicious effects she will never relapse into the practice of novel reading as to her taste for metaphysical booksdear mother i am very daring to differ with you in so many points but permit me to say that i do not agree with you in detesting metaphysics people may lose themselves in that labyrinth but why should they meet with vice in the midst of it the characters of a moralist a practical moralist and a metaphysician are not incompatible as we may see in many amiable and illustrious examples to examine human motives and the nature of the human mind is not to destroy the power of virtue or to increase the influence of vice the chemist after analyzing certain substances and after discovering their constituent parts can lay aside all that is heterogeneous and recompound the substance in a purer state from analogy we might infer that the motives of metaphysicians ought to be purer than those of the vulgar and ignorant to discover the art of converting base into noble passions or to obtain a universal remedy for all mental diseases is perhaps beyond the power of metaphysicians but in the pursuit useful discoveries may be made as to olivias lettersi am sorry i sent them to you for i see that they have lowered instead of raising her in your opinion but if you criticise letters written in openness and confidence of heart to a private friend as if they were set before the tribunal of the public you aremay i say itnot only severe but unjust for you try and condemn the subjects of one country by the laws of another dearest mother be half as indulgent to olivia as you are to me indeed you are prejudiced against her and because you see some faults you think her whole character vicious but would you cut down a fine tree because a leaf is withered or because the cankerworm has eaten into the bud even if a main branch were decayed are there not remedies which skilfully applied can save the tree from destruction and perhaps restore it to its pristine beauty and now having exhausted all my allusions all my arguments and all my little stock of eloquence i must come to a plain matter of fact before i received your letter i had invited lady olivia to spend some time at l castle i fear that you will blame my precipitation and i reproach myself for it because i know it will give you pain however though you will think me imprudent i am certain you would rather that i were imprudent than unjust i have defended olivia from what i believe to be unmerited censure i have invited her to my house she has accepted my proffered kindness to withdraw it afterwards would be doing her irreparable injury it would confirm all that the world can suspect it would be saying to the censoriousi am convinced that you are right and i deliver your victim up to you thus i should betray the person whom i undertook to defend her confidence in me her having but for a moment accepted my protection would be her ruin i could not act in so base a manner fear nothing for me my best but too anxious friend i may do lady olivia some good she can do me no harm she may learn the principles which you have taught me i can never catch from her any tastes or habits which you would disapprove as to the rest i hazard little or nothing the hereditary credit which i enjoy in my maternal right enables me to assist others without injuring myself your affectionate daughter leonora letter viii the duchess of to her daughter my dearest child i hope that you are in the right and that i am in the wrong your affectionate mother letter ix olivia to madame de p prepare yourself my ever dear and charming gabrielle for all the torments of jealousy know that since i came to england i have formed a new friendship with a woman who is interesting in the extreme who has charmed me by the simplicity of her manners and the generous sensibility of her heart her character is certainly too reserved yet even this defect has perhaps increased her power over my imagination and consequently over my affections i know not by what magic she has obtained it but she has already an ascendancy over me which would quite astonish you who know my wayward fancies and independent spirit alas i confess my heart is weak indeed and i fear that all the power of friendship and philosophy combined will never strengthen it sufficiently oh gabrielle how can i hope to obliterate from my soul that attachment which has marked the colour of my destiny for years yet such courage such cruel courage is required of me and of such i have boasted myself capable lady leonora l my new friend has by all the english eloquence of virtue obtained from me a promise which i fear i shall not have the fortitude to keepbut i must make the attemptforbid r to write to meyes i have written the wordsforbid r to write to meforbid him to think of mei will do moreif possible i will forbid myself henceforward to think of himto think of loveadieu my gabrielleall the illusions of life are over and a dreary blank of future existence lies before me terminated only by the grave tomorrow i go to l castle with feelings which i can compare only to those of the unfortunate la valliere when she renounced her lover and resolved to bury herself in a cloisteralas why have not i the resource of devotion your unhappy olivia letter x general b to mr l publish my travelsnot i my dear friend the world shall never have the pleasure of laughing at general bs trip to paris before a man sets about to inform others he should have seen not only the surface but the bottom of things he should have had not only a vue doiseau but to use a celebrated naval commanders expression a vue de poisson of his subject by this time you must have heard enough of the louvre and the tuilleries and versailles and le petit trianon and st cloudand you have had enough of pictures and statues and you know all that can be known of bonaparte by seeing him at a review or a levee and the fashionable beauties and celebrated characters of the hour have all passed and repassed through the magic lantern a fresh showman might make his figures a little more correct or a little more in laughable caricature but he could produce nothing new alas there is nothing new under the sun nothing remains for the moderns but to practise the oldest follies the newest ways would you for the sake of your female friends know the fashionable dress of a parisian elegante see seneca on the transparent vestments of the roman ladies who like these modern belles were generous in the display of their charms to the public no doubt these french republicanists act upon the true spartan principle of modesty they take the most efficacious method to prevent their influence from being too great over the imaginations of men by renouncing all that insidious reserve which alone can render even beauty permanently dangerous of the cruelties of the revolution i can tell you nothing new the public have been steeped up to the lips in blood and have surely had their fill of horrors but my dear friend you say that i must be able to give a just view of the present state of french society and of the best parts of it because i have not like some of my countrymen hurried about paris from one spectacle to another seen the opera and the playhouses and the masked balls and the gaminghouses and the women of the palais royal and the lions of all sorts gone through the usual routine of presentation and public dinners drunk french wine damned french cookery and come home content i have certainly endeavoured to employ my time better and have had the good fortune to be admitted into the best private societies in paris these were composed of the remains of the french nobility of men of letters and science and of families who without interfering in politics devote themselves to domestic duties to literary and social pleasures the happy hours i have passed in this society can never be forgotten and the kindness i have received has made its full impression upon an honest english heart i will never disgrace the confidence of my friends by drawing their characters for the public caesar in all his glory and all his despotism could not with impunity force a roman knight to go upon the stage but modern anecdotemongers more cruel and insolent than caesar force their friends of all ages and sexes to appear and speak and act for the amusement or derision of the public footnote laberius my dear friend is not my resolution never to favour the world with my tour well grounded i hope that i have proved to your satisfaction that i could tell people nothing but what i do not understand or what is not worth telling them or what has been told them a hundred times or what as a gentleman i am bound not to publish yours truly j b letter xi olivia to madame de p l castle friendship my amiable and interesting gabrielle is more an affair of the heart than of the head more the instinct of taste than the choice of reason with me the heart is no longer touched when the imagination ceases to be charmed explain to me this metaphysical phenomenon of my nature and for your reward i will quiet your jealousy by confessing without compunction what now weighs on my conscience terribly i begin to feel that i can never love this english friend as i ought she is too englishfar too english for one who has known the charms of french ease vivacity and sentiment for one who has seen the bewitching gabrielles infinite variety leonora has just the figure and face that you would picture to yourself for une belle anglaise and if our milton comes into your memory you might repeat for the quotation is not too trite for a foreigner grace is in all her steps heaven in her eye in every gesture dignity and love but then it is grace which says nothing a heaven only for a husband the dignity more of a matron than of a heroine and love that might have suited eve before she had seen this world leonora is certainly a beauty but then a beauty who does not know her power and who consequently can make no one else feel its full extent she is not unlike your beautiful polish princess but she has none of the charming anastasias irresistible transitions from soft silent languor to brilliant eloquent enthusiasm all the gestures and attitudes of anastasia are those of taste and sentiment leonoras are simply those of nature la belle nature but not le beau ideal with a figure that would grace any court or shine upon any stage she usually enters a room without producing or thinking of producing any sensation she moves often without seeming to have any other intention than to change her place and her fine eyes generally look as if they were made only to see with at times she certainly has a most expressive and intelligent countenance i have seen her face enlightened by the fire of genius and shaded by the exquisite touches of sensibility but all this is merely called forth by the occasion and vanishes before it is noticed by half the company indeed the full radiance of her beauty or of her wit seldom shines upon any one but her husband the audience and spectators are forgotten heavens what a difference between the effect which leonora and gabrielle produce but to do her justice much of this arises from the different organization of french and english society in paris the insipid details of domestic life are judiciously kept behind the scenes and women appear as heroines upon the stage with all the advantages of decoration to listen to the language of love and to receive the homage of public admiration in england gallantry is not yet systematized and our sex look more to their families than to what is called society for the happiness of existence and yet the affection of mothers for their children does not appear to be so strong in the hearts of english as of french women in england ladies do not talk of the sentiment of maternity with that elegance and sensibility with which you expatiate upon it continually in conversation they literally are des bonnes meres de famille not from the impulse of sentiment but merely from an early instilled sense of duty for which they deserve little credit however they devote their lives to their children and those who have the misfortune to be their intimate friends are doomed to see them half the day or all day long go through the part of the good mother in all its diurnal monotony of lessons and caresses all this may be vastly rightit is a pity it is so tiresome for my part i cannot conceive how persons of superior taste and talents can submit to it unless it be to make themselves a reputation and that you know is done by writing and talking on the general principles not by submitting to the minute details of education the great painter sketches the outline and touches the principal features but leaves the subordinate drudgery of filling up the parts finishing the drapery c to inferior hands upon recollection in my favourite sorrows of werter the heroine is represented cutting bread and butter for a group of children i admire this simplicity in goethe tis one of the secrets by which he touches the heart simplicity is delightful by way of variety but always simplicity is worse than toujours perdrix children in a novel or a drama are charming little creatures but in real life they are often insufferable plagues what becomes of them in paris i know not but i am sure that they are never in the way of ones conversations or reveries and it would be a blessing to society if english children were as inaudible and invisible these things strike me sensibly upon my return to england after so long an absence surely by means of the machinery of masters and governesses and schools the manufacture of education might be carried on without incommoding those who desire to see only the finished production here i find the daughter of an english duke a woman in the first bloom of youth of the highest pretensions in point of rank beauty fashion accomplishments and talents devoting herself to the education of two children orphans left to her care by an elder sister to take charge of orphans is a good and fine action as such it touches me sensibly but then where is the necessity of sacrificing ones friends and ones pleasures day after day and hour after hour to mere children leonora can persevere only from a notion of duty now in my opinion when generosity becomes duty it ceases to be virtue virtue requires freewill duty implies constraint virtue acts from the impulse of the moment and never tires or is tired duty drudges on in consequence of reflection and weary herself wearies all beholders duty always laborious never can be graceful and what is not graceful in woman cannot be amiablecan it my amiable gabrielle but i reproach myself for all i have written leonora is my friendbesides i am really obliged to her and for the universe would i not hint a thought to her disadvantage indeed she is a most excellent a faultless character and it is the misfortune of your olivia not to love perfection as she ought my charming and interesting gabrielle i am more out of humour with myself than you can conceive for in spite of all that reason and gratitude urge i fear i cannot prefer the insipid virtues of leonora to the lively graces of gabrielle as to the cold husband mr l i neither know nor wish to know any thing of him but i live in hopes of an agreeable and interesting accession to our society today from the arrival of leonoras intimate friend a young widow whose husband i understand was a man of a harsh temper she has gone through severe trials with surprising fortitude and though i do not know her history i am persuaded it must be interesting assuredly this husband could never have been the man of her choice and of course she must have had some secret unhappy attachment which doubtless preyed upon her spirits probably the object of her affection in despair at her marriage plighted his faith unfortunately or possibly may have fallen a sacrifice to his constancy i am all impatience to see her her husbands name was so ruggedly english that i am sure you would never be able to pronounce it especially if you only saw it written therefore i shall always to you call her helen a name which is more pleasing to the ear and more promising to the imagination i have not been able to prevail upon leonora to describe her friend to me exactly she says only that she loves helen too well to overpraise her beforehand my busy fancy has however bodied forth her form and painted her in the most amiable and enchanting colours hark she is just arrived adieu olivia letter xii from mrs c to miss b having now had the honour of spending nearly a week in the society of the celebrated enchantress lady olivia you will naturally expect that i should be much improved in the art of love but before i come to my improvements i must tell you what will be rather more interesting that leonora is perfectly well and happy and that i have the dear delight of exclaiming ten times an hour ay just as i thought it would bejust such a wife just such a mistress of a family i knew she would make not to admire is an art or a precept which i have not been able to practise much since i came here some philosophers tell us that admiration is not only a silly but a fatiguing state of mind and i suppose that nothing could have preserved my mind from being tired to death but the quantity of bodily exercise which i have taken i could if i pleased give you a plan and elevation of this castle nay i doubt not but i could stand an examination in the catalogue of the pictures or the inventory of the furniture you helenyou who could not remember the colour of lady ns new curtains after you had seen them at least a hundred times lady n was indifferent to me and how could i hang up her curtains in my memory by what could they hold do you not know margaret all the fine things that i could say and that quartos have said before me about the association of ideas and sensations c those we love impart to uninteresting objects the power of pleasing as the magnet can communicate to inert metal its attractive influence till mr l was leonoras lover i never liked him much i do not mean to call him inert i always knew that he had many excellent qualities but there was nothing in his temper peculiarly agreeable to me and there was something in his character that i did not thoroughly understand yet since he is become leonoras husband i find my understanding much improved and i dare say it will soon be so far enlarged that i shall comprehend him perfectly leonora has almost persuaded me to like lady olivia not to laugh at her would be impossible i wish you could see the way in which we go on together our first setting out would have diverted you enter lady olivia breathless with an air of theatric expectationadvances to embrace helen who is laughing with leonoraher back turned towards the side of the stage at which olivia entersolivia pauses suddenly and measures helen with a long look what passes in lady olivias mind at this moment i do not know but i guess that she was disappointed woefully by my appearance after some time she was recovered by leonoras assistance from her reverie and presently began to admire my vivacity and to find out that i was clarissas miss howeno i was lady gno i was heloises clara but i choosing to be myself and insisting upon being an original sunk again visibly and rapidly in olivias opinion till i was in imminent danger of being nobody leonora again kindly interposed to save me from annihilation and after an interval of an hour or two dedicated to letterwriting lady olivia returned and seated herself beside me resolved to decide what manner of woman i was certain novels are the touchstones of feeling and intellect with certain ladies unluckily i was not well read in these and in the questions put to me from these sentimental statutebooks i gave strange judgments often for the husband or parents against the heroine i did not even admit the plea of destiny irresistible passion or entrainement as in all cases sufficient excuse for all errors and crimes moreover i excited astonishment by calling things by obsolete names i called a married womans having a lover a crime then i was no judge of virtues for i thought a wifes making an intimate friend of her husbands mistress was scandalous and mean but this i was told is the height of delicacy and generosity i could not perceive the propriety of a mans liking two women at the same time or a womans having a platonic attachment for half a dozen lovers and i owned that i did not wish divorce could be as easily obtained in england as in france all which proved that i have never been out of englanda great misfortune i dare say it will soon be discovered that women as well as madeira cannot be good for any thing till they have crossed the line but besides the obloquy of having lived only in the best company in england i was further disgraced by the discovery that i am deplorably ignorant of metaphysics and have never been enlightened by any philanthropic transcendental foreign professor of humanity profoundly humiliated and not having yet taken the first step towards knowledge the knowing that i was ignorant i was pondering upon my sad fate when lady olivia putting her hand upon my shoulder summoned me into the court of love there in my own proper person to answer such questions as it should please her ladyship to ask for instancewere you ever in lovehow oftenwhenwhereand with whom never having stood a crossexamination in public upon these points i was not quite prepared to reply and i was accused of giving evasive answers and convicted of blushing mr l who was present at this examination enjoyed in his grave way my astonishment and confusion but said not one word i rallied my spirits and my wits and gave some answers which gained the smile of the court on my side from these specimens you may guess my dear margaret how well this lady and i are likely to agree i shall divert myself with her absurdities without scruple yet notwithstanding the flagrancy of these leonora persuades me to think well of olivia indeed i am so happy here that it would be a difficult matter at present to make me think ill of any body the good qualities which leonora sees in her are not yet visible to my eyes but leonoras visual orb is so cleared with charity and love that she can discern what is not revealed to vulgar sight even in the very germ she discovers the minute form of the perfect flower the olivia will i hope in time blow out in full perfection yours affectionately helen c letter xiii olivia to madame de p monday o my gabrielle this helen is not precisely the person that i expected instead of being a dejected beauty she is all life and gaiety i own i should like her better if she were a little more pensive a tinge of melancholy would in her situation be so becoming and natural my imagination was quite disappointed when i beheld the quickness of her eyes and frequency of her smiles even her mode of showing affection to leonora was not such as could please me this is the first visit i understand that she has paid leonora since her marriage these friends have been separated for many monthsi was not present at their meeting but i came into the room a few minutes after helens arrival and i should have thought that they had seen one another but yesterday this dear helen was quite at ease and at home in a few moments and seemed as if she had been living with us for years i make allowance for the ease of wellbred people helen has lived much in the world and has polished manners but the heartthe heart is superior to politeness and even ease in some situations shows a want of the delicate tact of sentiment in a similar situation i should have been silent entranced absorbed in my sensationsovercome by them perhaps dissolved in tears but in helen there appeared no symptoms of real sensibilitynothing characteristicnothing profoundnothing concentrated it was all superficial and evaporated in the common way i was provoked to see leonora satisfied she assures me that helen has uncommonly strong affections and that her character rather exceeds than is deficient in enthusiasm possibly but i am certain that helen is in no danger of becoming romantic far from being abstracted i never saw any one seem more interested and eager about every present occurrencepleased even to childishness with every passing trifle i confess that she is too much of this world for me but i will if possible suspend my judgment and study her a few hours longer before i give you my definitive opinion thursday well my gabrielle my definitive opinion is that i can never love this friend of leonora i said that she had lived much in the worldbut only in the english world she has never seen any other therefore though quite in a different style from leonora she shocks me with the same nationality all her ideas are exclusively english she has what is called english good sense and english humour and english prejudices of all sorts both masculine and feminine she takes fire in defence of her country and of her sex nay sometimes blushes even to awkwardness which one would not expect in the midst of her good breeding and vivacity what a difference between her vivacity and that of my charming gabrielle as great as between the enlargement of your mind and the limited nature of her understanding i tried her on various subjects but found her intrenched in her own contracted notions all new or liberal or sublime ideas in morality or metaphysics she either cannot seize or seizes only to place in a ridiculous point of view a certain sign of mediocrity adieu my gabrielle i must send you the pictures whether engaging or forbidding of those with whom your olivia is destined to pass her time when i have no events to relate still i must write to convey to you my sentiments alas how imperfectlyfor i have interdicted myself the expression of those most interesting to my heart leonora calmly prudent coolly virtuous knows not what it costs me to be faithful to this cruel promise write to me my sympathizing my tender friend your ever unhappy olivia letter xiv mrs c to miss b july th some very good people like some very fine pictures are best at a distance but leonora is not one of these the nearer you approach the better you like her as in arabesquework you may admire the beauty of the design even at a distance but you cannot appreciate the delicacy of the execution till you examine it closely and discover that every line is formed of grains of gold almost imperceptibly fine i am glad that the small sweet courtesies of life have been hailed by one sentimental writer at least the minor virtues are not to be despised even in comparison with the most exalted the common rose i have often thought need not be ashamed of itself even in company with the finest exotics in a hothouse and i remember that your brother in one of his letters observed that the common cock makes a very respectable figure even in the grand parisian assembly of all the stuffed birds and beasts in the universe it is a glorious thing to have a friend who will jump into a river or down a precipice to save ones life but as i do not intend to tumble down precipices or to throw myself into the water above half a dozen times i would rather have for my friends persons who would not reserve their kindness wholly for these grand occasions but who could condescend to make me happy every day and all day long even by actions not sufficiently sublime to be recorded in history or romance do not infer from this that i think leonora would hesitate to make great sacrifices i have had sufficient experience of her fortitude and active courage of mind in the most trying circumstances whilst many who talked more stoutly shrunk from committing themselves by actions some maximmaker says that past misfortunes are good for nothing but to be forgotten i am not of his opinion i think that they are good to make us know our winter from our summer friends and to make us feel for those who have sustained us in adversity that most pleasurable sensation of the human mindgratitude but i am straying unawares into the province of sentiment where i am such a stranger that i shall inevitably lose my way especially as i am too proud to take a guide lady olivia may perhaps be very fond of leonora and as she has every possible cause to be so it is but reasonable and charitable to suppose that she is but i should never guess it by her manner she speaks of her friendship sometimes in the most romantic style but often makes observations upon the enviable coolness and imperturbability of leonoras disposition which convinces me that she does not understand it in the least those who do not really feel always pitch their expressions too high or too low as deaf people bellow or speak in a whisper but i may be mistaken in my suspicions of olivia for to do the lady justice as mrs candour would say she is so affected that it is difficult to know what she really feels those who put on rouge occasionally are suspected of wearing it constantly and never have any credit for their natural colour presently they become so accustomed to common rouge that mistaking scarlet for pale pink they persist in laying on more and more till they are like nothing human yours affectionately helen c letter xv olivia to madame de p i have found it i have found it dear gabrielle rejoice with me i have solved the metaphysical problem which perplexed me so cruelly and now i am once more at peace with myself i have discovered the reason why i cannot love leonora as she merits to be lovedshe has obliged me and the nature of obligation is such that it supposes superiority on one side and consequently destroys the equality the freedom the ease the charm of friendship gratitude weighs upon ones heart in proportion to the delicacy of its feelings to minds of an ordinary sort it may be pleasurable for with them it is sufficiently feeble to be calm but in souls of a superior cast it is a poignant painful sensation because it is too strong ever to be tranquil in short tis bliss but to a certain bound beyond tis agony for my own part the very dread that i shall not be thought to express enough deprives me of the power to speak or even to feel fear you know extinguishes affection and of all fears the dread of not being sufficiently grateful operates the most powerfully thus sensibility destroys itselfgracious heaven teach me to moderate mine in the nature of the obligation with which leonora has oppressed my heart there is something peculiarly humiliating upon my return to this country i found the malignant genius of scandal bent upon destroying my reputation you have no idea of the miserable force of prejudice which still prevails here there are some women who emancipate themselves but then unluckily they are not in sufficient numbers to keep each other in countenance in public one would not choose to be confined to the society of people who cannot go to court though sometimes they take the lead elsewhere we are full half a century behind you in civilization and your revolution has i find afforded all our stiffened moralists incontrovertible arguments against liberty of opinion or conduct in either sex i was thunderstruck when i saw the grave and repulsive faces of all my female acquaintance at first i attributed every thing that was strange and disagreeable to english reserve of which i had retained a sufficiently formidable idea but i presently found that there was some other cause which kept all these nice consciences at a distance from my atmosphere would you believe it i saw myself upon the point of being quite excluded from good society leonora saved me from this imminent danger voluntarily and i must say nobly if not gracefully leonora came forward in my defence vanquishing her natural english timidity she braved the eyes and tongues and advice of all the prudes and old dowagers my enemies amongst whom i may count the superannuated duchess her mother the proudest dowager now living when i appeared in public with a personage of leonoras unblemished reputation scandal much against her will was forced to be silent and it was to be taken for granted that i was in the language of prudery perfectly innocent leonora to be consistent in goodness or to complete her triumph in the face of the world invited me to accompany her to the countryi have now been some weeks at this superb castle heaven is my witness that i came with a heart overflowing with affection but the painful the agonizing sense of humiliation mixed with my tenderest sentiments and all became bitterness insufferable oh gabrielle you and perhaps you alone upon earth can understand my feelings adieupity mei must not ask you a single question abouti must not write the name for ever dearwhat am i saying where are my promisesadieuadieu your unhappy olivia letter xvi mrs c to miss b july th as i have never thought it my duty in this mortal life to mourn for the absurdities of my fellowcreatures i should now enjoy the pleasure of laughing at lady olivia if my propensity were not checked by a serious apprehension that she will injure leonoras happiness from the most generous motives dear leonora is continually anxious to soothe her mind to persuade and reason her into common sense to reestablish her in public opinion and to make her happy but i am convinced that lady olivia never will have common sense and consequently never can be happy twenty times a day i wish her at the antipodes for i dread lest leonora should be implicated in her affairs and involved in her misery last night this foolish woman who unluckily is graced with all the power of words poured forth a fine declamation in favour of divorce in vain leonora reasoned expostulated blushed lady olivia cannot blush for herself and though both mr l and i were present she persisted with that vehemence which betrays personal interest in an argument i suspect that she is going to try to obtain a divorce from her husband that she may marry her lover consider the consequences of this for leonoraleonora to be the friend of a woman who will risk the infamy of a trial at doctors commons but leonora says i am mistaken and that all this is only olivias way of talking i wish then that if she does not intend to act like a fool she would not talk like one i agree with the gentleman who said that a woman who begins by playing the fool always ends by playing the devil even before me though i certainly never solicit her confidence lady olivia talks with the most imprudent openness of her love affairs not i think from ingenuousness but from inability to restrain herself begin what subject of conversation i will as far from cupid as possible she will bring me back again to him before i know where i am she has no ideas but on this one subject leonora dear kindhearted leonora attributes this to the temporary influence of a violent passion which she assures me olivia will conquer and that then all her great and good qualities will as if freed from enchantment reassume their natural vigour naturalthere is nothing natural about this sophisticated lady i wish leonora would think more of herself and less of other people as to lady olivias excessive sensibility i have no faith in it i do not think either the lover or the passion so much to be feared for her as the want of a lover and the habit of thinking that it is necessary to be in love yours affectionately helen c letter xvii general b to mr l my dear l paris hotel de courlande when you ask a countryman in england the way to the next town he replies where do you come from master and till you have answered this question no information can you obtain from him you ask me what i know of lady olivia what is your reason for asking till you have answered this question hope for no information from me seriously lady olivia had left paris before i arrived therefore you cannot have my judgment of her ladyship which i presume is all you could depend upon if you will take hearsay evidence and if you wish me to speak to general character i can readily satisfy you common reputed loud and unanimous in favour of her talents beauty and fashion there is no resisting i am told the fascination of her manners and conversation but her opinions are fashionably liberal and her practice as liberal as her theories since her separation from her husband her lover is publicly named some english friends plead in her favour platonic attachment this like benefit of clergy is claimed of course for a first offence but lady olivias parisian acquaintance are not so scrupulous or so oldfashioned as to think it an offence they call it an arrangement and to this there can be no objection as a french gentleman said to me the other day with an unanswerable shrug tout le monde sait que r est son amant dailleurs cest la femme la plus aimable du monde as to lady olivias friend mad de p she sees a great deal of company her house is the resort of people of various descriptions ministers foreigners coquettes and generals in short of all those who wish without scandal or suspicion to intrigue either in love or politics her assemblies are also frequented by a few of lancien regime who wish to be in favour with the present government mad de p of a noble family herself and formerly much at court has managed matters so as to have regained all her husbands confiscated property and to have acquired much influence with some of the leading men of the day in her manners and conversation there is an odd mixture of frivolity and address of the airs of coquetry and the jargon of sentiment she has the politeness of a french countess with exquisite knowledge of the world and of les convenances joined to that freedom of opinion which marks the present times in the midst of all these inconsistencies it is difficult to guess what her real character may be at first sight i should pronounce her to be a silly woman governed by vanity and the whim of the moment but those who know her better than i do believe her to be a woman of considerable talents inordinately fond of power and uniformly intent upon her own interest using coquetry only as a means to govern our sex and frivolity as a mask for her ambition in short mad de p is a perfect specimen of the combination of an intrigante and an elegante a combination often found in paris here women mingle politics and gallantrymen mix politics and epicurismwhich is the better mixture i have business of importance to my country to transact today therefore i am going to dine with the modern apicius excuse me my dear friend if i cannot stay at present to answer your questions about divorce i must be punctual what sort of a negotiator can he make who is too late at a ministers dinner five minutes might change the face of europe yours truly j b letter xviii madame de p to olivia paris my incomparable olivia your letters are absolutely divine i am maussade i vegetate i cannot be said to live the days when i do not hear from you last thursday i was disappointed of one of these dear letters and braveettendre told me frankly that i was so little amiable he should not have known meas to the rest pardon me for not writing punctually i have been really in a chaos of business and pleasure and i do not know which fatigues most but i am obliged to attend the ministers every day for the sake of my friends a thousand and a thousand thanks for your pictures of your english friends sketches by a masterly hand must be valuable whatever the subject i would rather have the pictures than the realities your helen and your lady leonora are too good for me and i pity you from my soul for being shut up in that old castle i suppose it is like an old castle in dauphiny where i once spent a week and where i was nearly frightened to death by the flapping of the old tapestry behind my bed and by the bats which flew in through the broken windows they say however that our chateaux and yours are something different of this i have no clear conception i send you three comforters in your prisona billetdoux a new novel and a pattern of my sandal a billetdoux from r says every thing for itself but i must say something for the new novel zenobie which i now send you is the declared rival of seraphin parties have run high on both sides and applications were made and inuendoes discovered and wit and sentiment came to close combat and as usual people talked till they did not understand themselves for a fortnight wherever one went the first words to be heard on entering every salon were seraphine and zenobiepeace or warmlle georges and mlle duchesnois were nothing to seraphine and zenobie for heavens sake tell me which you prefer but i fear they will be no more talked of before i have your answer to say the truth i am tired of both heroines for a fortnight is too long to talk or think of any one thing i flatter myself you will like my sandals they are my own invention and my foot really shows them to advantage you know i might say as du psaid of himself jai un pied dont la petitesse echappe a la vitesse de la pensee i thought my poor friend mad dumarais would have died with envy the other day when i appeared in them at her ball which bythebye was in all its decorations as absurd and in as bad taste as usual for the most part these nouveaux riches lavish money but can never purchase taste or a sense of propriety all is gold but that is not enough or rather that is too much in spite of all that both the indies china arabia egypt and even paris can do for them they will be ever out of place in the midst of their magnificence they will never even know how to ruin themselves nobly they must live and die as they were born ridiculous now i would rather not exist than feel myself ridiculous but i believe no one living not even le petit dheronville knows himself to be an object of ridicule there are no lookingglasses for the mind and i question whether we should use them if there were dheronville is just as you left him and as much my amusement as he used to be yours he goes on with an eternal galimatias of patriotism with such a selfsufficient air and decided tone never suspecting that he says only what other people make him say and that he is listened to only to find out what some people think many will say before fools what they would not hazard before wise men not considering that fools can repeat as well as parrots i once heard a great man remark that the only spies fit to be trusted are those who do not know themselves to be such who have no salary but what their vanity pays them and who are employed without being accredited but treve de politiquemy charming olivia i know abhors politics as much as i detest metaphysics from all lips or pens but hers now i must tell you something of your friends here o talks nonsense as agreeably as ever and dances as divinely tis a pity he cannot always dance for then he would not ruin himself at play he wants me to get him a regimentas if i had any poweror as if i would use it for this purpose when i knew that my interesting friend mad qwould break her poor little heart if he were to quit her mon coeur is as pretty as ever but she is now in affliction she has lost her dear little dog corisonde he died suddenly almost in her arms she will erect a monument to him in her charming jardin anglois this will occupy her and then time the comforterinimitable voltaire our dear brillante has just had a superb hommage from her lover the commissarya necklace and bracelets of the finest pearls but she cannot wear them yet her brother having died last week she is in deep mourning this brother was not upon good terms with her he never forgave the divorce he thought it a disgrace to have a sister une divorcee but he was full of prejudice poor man and he is dead and we need think no more of him or of his faults our cidevant chanoine who married that little meudon is as miserable as possible and as ridiculous for he is jealous of his young wife and she is a franchecoquette the poor man looks as if he repented sincerely of his errors what a penitent a coquette can make of a husband bourdaloue and massillon would have tried their powers on this mans heart in vain did i tell you that mad g is a second time divorced but this time it is her husbands doing not hers this handsome husband has spent all the immense fortune she brought him and now procures a divorce for incompatibility of temper and is going to marry another lady richer than mad g and as great a fool this system of divorce though convenient is not always advantageous to women however in one point of view i wonder that the rigid moralists do not defend it as the only means of making a man in love with his own wife a man divorces the law does not permit him to marry the same woman afterwards of course this prohibition makes him fall in love with her of this we have many edifying examples besides fanchette who though she was so beautiful and a tolerable actress would never have drawn all paris to the vaudeville if she had not been a divorcee and if it had not been known that her husband who played the lover of the piece was dying to marry her again apropos mad st germain is acting one of her own romances in the high sublime style and threatens to poison herself for love of her perjured inconstantbut it will not do madame la grande was near having a sad accident the other night in crossing the pontneuf her horses took fright for there was a crowd and embarras a man having just drowned himselfnot for love but for hunger how many men women and children do you think drowned themselves in the seine last year upwards of two hundred this is really shocking and a stop should be put to it by authority it absolutely makes me shudder and reflect but apres nous le deluge was la pompadours maxim and should be ours mad folard se coiffe en cheveux and mad rocroix crowns herself with roses whilst all the world knows that either of them is old enough to be my mother in former days a woman could not wear flowers after thirty and was bel esprit or devote at forty for it was thought bad taste to do otherwise but now every body may be as young as they please or as ridiculous women have certainly gained by the new order of things our poor friend vermeille se meurt de la poitrinea victim to tea and late hours she is an interesting creature and my heart bleeds for her she will never last till winter do you know it is said we shall soon have no wood to burn what can have become of all our forests people should inquire after them the venus de medici has at last found her way down the seine it is not determined yet where to place her but she is at paris and that is a great point gained for her you complained that the apollo stands with his back so near the wall that there is no seeing half the beauties of his shoulders if i have any influence venus shall not be so served i have been to see her she is certainly divinebut not french i do not despair of seeing her surpassed by our artists adieu my adorable olivia i should have finished my letter yesterday but when i came home in the morning expecting to have a moment sacred to you and friendship whom should i find established in an armchair in my cabinet but our old countess cidevant there was no retreat for me in the midst of my concentrated rage i was obliged to advance and embrace her and there was an end of happiness for the day the pitiless woman kept me till it was even too late to dress talking over her family misfortunes as if they were any thing to me she wants to get her son employed but her pride will not let her pay her court properly and she wants me to do it for her not i truly i should shut my doors against her but for the sake of her nephew le roue who is really a pretty young man my angel i embrace you tenderly gabrielle de p letter xix olivia to madame de p how melancholy to a feeling heart is the moment when illusion vanishes whether that illusion has been created by the magic of love or of friendship how many such moments gabrielle has your unfortunate friend been doomed to endure alas when will treacherous fancy cease to throw a deceitful brilliancy upon each new object perhaps i am too delicatebut rs note enclosed in your last my gabrielle was unlike his former letters it was not passionate it was only reasonable a man who can reason is no longer in love the manner in which he speaks of divorce shocked me beyond expression is it for him to talk of scruples when upon this subject i have none i own to you that my pride and my tenderness are sensibly wounded is it for him to convince me that i am in the wrong i shall not be at ease till i hear from you again my amiable friend for my residence here becomes insupportable but a few short weeks are past since i fancied leonora an angel and now she falls below the ordinary standard of mortals but a few short weeks are past since in the full confidence of finding in leonora a second self a second gabrielle i eagerly developed to her my inmost soul yet now my heart closes i fear never more to open the sad conviction that we have but few ideas and no feelings in common stops my tongue when i attempt to speak chills my heart when i begin to listen do you know my gabrielle i have discovered that leonora is inordinately selfish for all other faults i have charity but selfishness which has none to give must expect none o divine sensibility defend me from this isolation of the heart all thy nameless sorrows all thy heartrending tortures would i a thousand times rather endure leonoras selfishness breaks out perpetually and alas it is of the most inveterate incurable kind every thing that is immediately or remotely connected with self she loves and loves with the most provoking pertinacity her mother her husband she adores because they are her own and even her sisters children because she considers them she says as her own all and every possible portion of self she cherishes with the most sordid partiality all that touches these relations touches her and every thing which is theirs or in other words which is hers she deems excellent and sacred last night i just hazarded a word of ridicule upon some of the obsolete prejudices of that august personage that duchess of old tapestry her still living ancestor i wish gabrielle you had seen leonoras countenance her colour rose up to her temples her eyes lightened with indignation and her whole person assumed a dignity which might have killed a presumptuous lover or better far might have enslaved him for life what folly to waste all this upon such an occasion but selfishness is ever blind to its real interests leonora is so bigoted to this old woman that she is already in mind an old woman herself she fancies that she traces a resemblance to her mother and of course to dear self in her infant and she looks upon it with such doting eyes and talks to it with such exquisite tones of fondness as are to me who know the source from which they proceed quite ridiculous and disgusting an infant who has no imaginable merit and to impartial eyes no charms she can love to this excess from no motive but pure egotism then her husbandbut this subject i must reserve for another letter i am summoned to walk with him this moment adieu charming gabrielle olivia letter xx general b to mr l my dear l paris enclosed i send you according to your earnest desire cambaceres reflections upon the intended new law of divorce give me leave to ask why you are so violently interested upon this occasion do you envy france this blessing do you wish that english husbands and wives should have the power of divorcing each other at pleasure for incompatibility of temper and have you calculated the admirable effect this would produce upon the temper both of the weaker and the stronger sex to bear and forbear would then be no longer necessary every happy pair might quarrel and part at a moments noticeat a years notice at most and their children the wisdom of solomon would be necessary to settle the just division of the children i have this morning been attending a court of law to hear a famous trial between two husbands the abdicated lord a cidevant noble and the reigning husband a cidevant grandvicaire who has reformed each party claimed a right to the children by the first marriage for the children were minors entitled to large fortunes the reformed grandvicaire pleaded his own cause with astonishing assurance amidst the discountenancing looks murmurs and almost amidst the groans of disapprobation from the majority of the auditors his powers of impudence however failed him at last i sat on the bench behind him and saw that his ears had the grace to blush after another hearing this cause which had lasted four years was decided and the first husband and real father was permitted to have the guardianship of his own children during the four years litigation the friends of the parties from the grandmother downwards were all at irreconcileable variance what became of the children all this time their mother was represented during the trial as she deserved to be as a wretch void of shame and gratitude the father was universally pitied though his rival painted him as a coward who during the revolution had left his children to save himself by flight and as a fool who had left his wife to the care of a profligate grandvicaire divorce is not countenanced by opinion in paris though permitted by law with a few exceptions in extraordinary cases i have observed that les divorcees are not received into good society to satiate your curiosity i send you all the papers that have been written lately on this subject of which you will find that of cambaceres the best the wits say that he is an impartial judge i presume you want these pamphlets for some foolish friend for yourself you can never want them blessed as you are with such a wife as lady leonora l i am not surprised that profligate men should wish for freedom of divorce because it would save them damages in doctors commons but you rather astonish meif a wise man should be astonished at any thing in these daysby assuring me that you have lately heard this system eloquently defended by a female philosopher what can women expect from it but contempt next to polygamy it would prove the most certain method of destroying the domestic happiness of the sex as well as their influence and respectability in society but some of the dear creatures love to talk of what they do not understand and usually show their eloquence to the greatest advantage by taking the wrong side of a question yours truly j b letter xxi olivia to madame de p l castle from selfishness to jealousy there is but one step or rather there is none for jealousy of a certain sort is but selfishness in another form how different this passion as i have felt it and as i see it shown in some characters it is the symptom of amiable and exquisite sensibility in others of odious coldness and contraction of heart in some of our sex it is you know my gabrielle a delicate fear a tender anxiety a proof of ardent passion in others it is a mere love of power a disgusting struggle for the property of a heart an absurd assertion of rights and prerogatives surely no prejudice of education or institution can be more barbarous than that which teaches a wife that she has an indefeasible and exclusive right both to the affections and the fidelity of her husband i am astonished to hear it avowed by any woman who has the slightest pretensions to delicacy of sentiment or liberality of mind i should expect to find this vulgar prejudice only among the downright dames who talk of my good man and lay a particular emphasis on the possessive pronoun my who understand literally and expect that their spouses should adhere punctually to every coarse article of our strange marriage vow in certain points of view my gabrielle jealousy is undoubtedly the strongest proof of an indelicate mind yet if i mistake not the delicate the divine leonora is liable to this terrestrial passion yesterday evening as i was returning from a stroll in the park with mr l we met leonora and methought she looked embarrassed at meeting us heaven knows there was not the slightest occasion for embarrassment and i could not avoid being surprised at such weakness i had almost said folly in a woman of leonoras sense especially as she knows how my heart is attached in the first moments of our intimacy my confidence was unbounded as it ever is in those i love aware as i was of the light in which the prejudices of her education and her country make her view such connexions yet i scrupled not with the utmost candour to confess the unfortunate attachment which had ruled my destiny after this confidence do not suspicion and jealousy on her part appear strange were mr l and i shut up for life in the same prison were we left together upon a desert island were we alone in the universe i could never think of him and leonora does not see this how the passions obscure and degrade the finest understandings but perhaps i do her injustice and she felt nothing of what her countenance expressed it is certain however that she was silent for some moments after she joined us from what cause she knows bestso was mr l i suppose from english awkwardnessso was i from pure astonishment at length in pity of leonora i broke the silence i had recourse to the beauties of nature what a heavenly evening said i we have been listening to the songs of the birds enjoying this fresh breeze of natures perfumes leonora said something about the superiority of natures perfumes to those of art and observed how much more agreeable the smell of flowers appears in the open air than in confined rooms whilst she spoke she looked at her husband as she continually does for assent and approbation he assented but apparently without knowing what he was saying and only by one of his english monosyllables i alone was at ease can any thing be more beautiful continued i looking back than the soft mellow foliage of those woods and the exquisite tints of their rich colouring what delicious melancholy such an evening spreads over the heartwhat reflectionswhat recollectionsoh leonora look at the lights upon that mountain and the deep shadows upon the lake below just such scenes have i admired by such have i been entranced in switzerland leonora put her arm within mineshe seemed to have no objection to my thoughts going back to switzerlandi sighedshe pressed my hand affectionatelyi wiped the starting tear from my eye mr l looked at me with something like surprise whilst i repeated involuntarily i mourn but ye woodlands i mourn not for you for morn is approaching your charms to restore perfumed with fresh fragrance and glittring with dew i paused recollecting myself struck with the ridicule of repeating verses and of indulging feelings in which no one perhaps sympathized those are beautiful lines said leonora that poem has always been a favourite of mine and of mine also said mr l i prefer beatties hermit to all other hermits said leonora i was not in a mood calmly to discuss with her a point of criticismi walked on in reverie but in this i was not allowed to indulge mr lasked if i could not recollect some more of the hermiti pleaded the worst memory in the worlda memory that can never recollect any poem perfectly by rote only the touches of genius or sensibility that strike meand those are so few but in this poem there are so many said leonora i am sure she insisted only to please her husband and pleaded against her real feelings purposely to conceal them he persisted in his request with more warmth than usual i was compelled to rouse myself from my reverie and to call back my distant thoughts i repeated all that i could recollect of the poem mr l paid me a profusion of compliments upon the sweetness of my voice and my taste in reciting he was pleased to find that my manner and tones gave an italian expression to english poetry which to him was a peculiar charm it reminded him of some signora whom he had known at florence this was the first time i had learned that he had been abroad i was going to explore the foreign field of conversation which he thus opened but just at that moment leonora withdrew her arm from mine and i fancied that she coloured this might be only my fancy or the natural effect of her stooping to gather a flower we were now within sight of the castle i pointed to one of the turrets over a gothic window upon which the gleams of the setting sun produced a picturesque effect my glove happened to be off and leonora unluckily saw that her husbands eyes were fixed upon my arm instead of the turret to which i was pointing twas a trifle which i never should have noticed had she not forced it upon my attention she actually turned pale i had the presence of mind not to put on my glove i must observe more accurately i must decide whether this angelic leonora is or is not susceptible of the mortal passion ycleped jealousy i confess my curiosity is awakened adieu my ever amiable gabrielle olivia letter xxii olivia to madame de p when the passions are asleep we are apt to fancy they are dead i verily thought that curiosity was dead within me it had lain so long dormant while stronger and tenderer sentiments waked in full activity but now that absence and distance from their object lull them to temporary repose the vulgar subordinate passions are roused and take their turn to reign my curiosity was so strongly excited upon the subject of leonoras jealousy that i could not rest without attempting to obtain satisfaction blame me not dearest gabrielle for in my situation you would inevitably have done the same only that you would have done it with more address with that peculiar inimitable address which i envy above all your accomplishments but address is a delicate native of france and though it may now and then exist as a stranger i doubt whether it can ever be naturalized in our rude climate all the attempts i have made are however encouraging enoughyou shall judge my object was to ascertain the existence or nonexistence of leonoras jealousy i set about it with a tolerably careless assurance and followed up the hint which accident had thrown out for my ingenuity to work upon you remember or at least i remember that leonora withdrew her arm from mine and stooped to gather a flower at the moment when her husband mentioned florence and the resemblance of my voice to that of some italian charmer the next day i happened to play some of my sweetest italian airs and to accompany them with my voice the musicroom opens into the great hall leonora and her husband were in the hall talking to some visitors the voices were soon hushed as i expected by the magic sounds but what i did not expect leonora was the first who led the way into the musicroom was this affectation these simple characters sometimes baffle all the art of the decipherer i should have been clear that it was affectation had leonora been prodigal of compliments on my performance but she seemed only to listen for her own pleasure and left it to mr l to applaud whilst i was preparing to play over again the air which pleased him most the two little nephews came running to beg leonora would follow them to look at some trifle some coloured shadow upon the gardenwall i think they said she let them lead her off leaving us together this did not seem like jealousy i was more at a loss than ever and determined to make fresh and more decisive experiments curiosity you know is heightened by doubt to cure myself of curiosity it is necessary therefore to put my mind out of doubt admire the practical application of metaphysics but metaphysics always make you yawn adieu for today olivia letter xxiii mrs c to miss b l castle dear margaret an uncle of mine who ever since i can remember seemed to me cut out for an old bachelor writes me word that he is just going to be married and that i must grace his nuptials i cannot refuse for he has always been very kind to me and we have no right to cut people out for old bachelors that i am sorry to leave leonora it is superfluous to tell you but this is the melancholy part of the business on which i make it a principle to dwell as little as possible lady olivia must be heartily glad that i am going for i have been terribly troublesome to her by my gaiety and my simplicity i shall lose all the pleasure i had promised myself in seeing the denouement of the comedy of the sentimental coquette or the heroine unmasked i made leonora almost angry with me this morning by a hint or two i gave upon this subject she looked so very grave that i was afraid of my own thoughts and i dared not explain myself farther intimate as i am with her there are points on which i am sure that she would never make me her confidante i think that she has not been in her usual good spirits lately and though she treats olivia with uniform kindness and betrays not even to my watchful eyes the slightest symptom of jealousy yet i suspect that she sees what is going forward and she suffers in secret now if she would let me explain myself i could set her heart at ease by the assurance that mr l is only acting a part if her affection for her husband did not almost blind her she would have as much penetration as i havewhich you will allow my dear margaret is saying a great deal yours affectionately helen c letter xxiv olivia to madame de p l castle congratulate me my charming gabrielle upon being delivered from the unfeeling gaiety of that friend of leonora that helen of whom i formerly sent you a too flattering portrait her departure relieves me from many painful sensations dissonance to a musical ear is not more horrid than want of harmony between characters to the soul of sensibility between helen and me there was a perpetual discord of ideas and sentiments which fatigued me inexpressibly besides i began to consider her as a spy upon my actions but there i believe i did her injustice for she was too much occupied with her own trifling thoughts to have any alarming powers of observation since her departure we have been very gay yesterday we had a large company at dinner some of the neighbouring families whom i expected to find mere country visitors that were come a dozen miles to show their antediluvian finery retire half an hour after dinner spoil coffee with cream say nothing but at their appointed hours rise ring for their superb carriages and go home by moonlight however to my astonishment i found myself in a society of wellbred wellinformed persons the women ready to converse and the men even after dinner not impatient to get rid of them two or three of the company had travelled and i was glad to talk to them of italy switzerland and france mr l i knew would join in this conversation i discovered that he came to florence just as i was leaving it i was to have been at our ambassadors one evening when he was there but a headache prevented me these little coincidences you know my gabrielle draw people closer together i remember to have heard of a mr l at florence who was a passionate admirer of our sex he was then unmarried i little thought that this was the same person beneath a cold exterior these englishmen often conceal a wondrous quantity of enthusiasmvolcanoes under snow curiosity dear indefatigable curiosity supported me through the labour of clearing away the snow and i came to indubitable traces of unextinguished and unextinguishable fire the character of l is quite different from what i had imagined it to be it is an excellent study we had a long and interesting conversation upon national manners especially upon those of the females of all nations he concluded by quoting the words of your friend m le vicomte de segur if i were permitted to choose i should prefer a french woman for my friend an english woman for my wife and a polish lady for my mistress from this it seems that i am mistaken about the italian signora or else mr l has an enlarged charity for the graces of all nationsmore subject for curiosity in the evening before the company separated we were standing on the steps of the great hall looking at a fine effect of moonlight and i pointed out the shadow of the arches of a bridge from moonlight we went on to lamplight and many pretty things were said about art and nature a gentleman who had just returned from paris talked of the reflection of the lamps in the seine which one sees in crossing the pontroyal and which as he said appear like a colonnade of fire as soon as he had finished prosing about his colonnade i turned to mr l and asked if he remembered the account which coxe the traveller gives of the polish princess czartoryskis charming fete champetre and the illuminated rustic bridge of one arch the reflection of which in the water was so strong as to deceive the eye and to give the whole the appearance of a brilliant circle suspended in the air mr l seemed enchanted with my description and eagerly said that he would some night have a bridge in his improvements illuminated that we halfgallant englishman might see the effect i carelessly replied that probably it would have a good effect i would then have talked on other subjects to the lady next me but an englishman cannot suddenly change the course of his conversation mr l still persisted in asking a variety of questions about this polish fete i excused myself for if you satisfy curiosity you are no longer sublime besides it is so pedantic to remember accurately any thing one meets with in books i assured him that i had forgotten the particulars my countrymen are wondrous persevering when once roused this morning when i came down to breakfast i found mr l with a volume of coxes travels in his hand he read aloud to leonora the whole description of the illuminated gardens and of a turkish tent of curious workmanship and of a pavilion supported by pillars ornamented with wreaths of flowers leonoras birthday is some time in the next month and her husband probably to prevent any disagreeable little feelings proposed that the fete champetre he designed to give should be on that day she seemed rather to discourage the thing now to what should this indifference be attributed to jealousy i should positively decide but that two reasons oppose this idea and keep me in doubt she was not within hearing at the moonlight conference and knew nothing of my having mentioned the polish fete or of her husbands having proposed to illuminate the bridge for me besides i remember the other day when she was reading the new french novel you sent me she expressed great dislike to the sentimental fetes which the lover prepares for his mistress i would give more than i dare tell you my dear gabrielle to be able to decide whether she is jealous of me or not but where was i mr l who had set his heart upon the fete champetre persisted and combatted her antipathy by reason foolish man he should have tried compliments or caressesif i had not been present my dear leonora said he i think you carry your dislike to these things too far they are more according to the french than to the english taste i know but we should not be influenced by national prejudice i detest the ostentation and the affectation of sentiment as much as you can but where the real feeling exists every mode of showing kindness is agreeable you must let us have this little fete on your birthday besides the pleasure it will give me i really think it is useful to mix ideas of affection with amusement she smiled most graciously and replied that she would with pleasure accept of kindness in any form from him in short she was willing to have the fete when it was clearly explained that she was to be the object of it is not this proof positive of jealousy and yet my curiosity is not thoroughly satisfied i must go on for leonoras sake i must go on when i have been assured of the truth i shall know how to conduct myself and you who know my heart will do me the justice to believe that when i am convinced of my friends weakness i shall spare it with the most delicate caution but till i am convinced i am in perpetual danger of blundering by my careless inadvertent innocence you smile gabrielle dear malicious gabrielle even in your malice you are charming adieu pray for the speedy extinction of my curiosity olivia letter xxv leonora to her mother you say my dearest mother that of late my letters have been more constrained and less cheerful than usual and you conjure me not to conceal from you any thing which may concern my happiness i have ever found you my best and most indulgent friend and there is not a thought or feeling of my mind however weak or foolish that i desire to conceal from you no one in this world is moreis so much interested in my happiness and in every doubtful situation i have always been accustomed to apply to your unerring judgment for assistance your strength of mind your enlightened affection would support and direct me would at once show me how i ought to act and inspire me with courage and fortitude sufficient to be worthy of your esteem and of my own at no period of my life not even when my heart first felt the confused sensations of a passion that was new to it did i ever want or wish for a friend so much as at this instant and yet i hesitate whether i ought to ask even your advice whether i ought to indulge myself in speaking of my feelings even to my mother i refrained from giving the slightest intimation of them to my dear helen though she often led to this subject and seemed vexed by my reserve i thought it not right to accept of her sympathy from her kindness i had every consolation to expect but no assistance from her counsels because she does not understand mr ls character and i could plainly perceive that she had an erroneous idea so fixed in her fancy as to prevent her seeing things in their true light i am afraid of imputing blame where i most wish to avoid it i fear to excite unjust suspicions i dread that if i say the whole you will imagine that i mean much more than i say i have not been quite well lately and my mind probably is more apt to be alarmed than it would be if my health were stronger all that i apprehend may exist merely in my own distempered imagination do not then suppose others are to blame when perhaps i only am in fault i have for some time past been dissatisfied with myself and have had reason to be so i do not say this from any false humility i despise that affectation but i say it with a sincere desire that you may assist me to cure myself of a weakness which if it were to grow upon my mind must render me miserable and might destroy the happiness of the person i love best upon earth you know that i am not naturally or habitually of a suspicious temper but i am conscious of having lately felt a disposition to jealousy i have been spoiled by the excessive attention which my husband paid to me in the first year of our marriage you warned me not to fancy that he could continue always a lover i did not at least i tried not to expect such an impossibility i was prepared for the change at least i thought i was yet now the time the inevitable time is come and i have not the fortitude to bear it as i ought if i had never known what it was to possess his love i might perhaps be content with his friendship if i could feel only friendship for him i should now possibly be happy i know that i have the first place in his esteem i do believei should be miserable indeed if i did not believethat i have the first place in his affection but this affection is certainly different from what it once was i wish i could forget the difference no i retract that wish however painful the comparison the recollection of times that are past is delightful to my heart yet my dear mother if such times are never to return it would be better for me to forget that they have ever been it would be wiser not to let my imagination recur to the past which could then tend only to render me discontented with the present and with the future the future how melancholy that word sounds to me what a dreary length of prospect it brings to my view how young i am how many years may i have to live and how little motive have i left in life those which used to act most forcibly upon me have now scarcely power to move my mind the sense of duty it is true raises me to some degree of exertion i hope that i do not neglect the education of the two children whom my poor sister bequeathed to my care when my mind was at ease they were my delight but now i feel that i am rather interrupted than interested by their childish gaiety and amusements i am afraid that i am growing selfish and i am sure that i have become shamefully indolent i go on with certain occupations every day from habit not from choice my mind is not in them i used to flatter myself that i did many things from a sense of duty and of general benevolence which i am convinced were done merely from a particular wish to please and to make myself more and more beloved by the object of my fondest affection disappointed in this hope i sink into indolence from which the desire to entertain my friends is not sufficient to rouse me helen has been summoned away but i believe i told you that mr and mrs f whose company is peculiarly agreeable to my taste and lady m and her amiable daughters and your witty friend are with us in such society i am ashamed of being stupid yet i cannot contribute to the amusement of the company and i feel surprised at their animation and sprightliness it seems as if i was looking on at dances without hearing any music sometimes i fear that my silence should be observed and then i begin to talk without well knowing what i am saying i confine myself to the most commonplace subjects and hesitate from the dread of saying something quite foreign to the purpose what must mr l think of my stupidity but he does not i believe perceive it he is so much occupied withwith other objects i am glad that he does not see all that passes in my mind for he might despise me if he knew that i am so miserable i did not mean to use so strong an expression but now it is written i will not blot it out lest you should fancy something worse than the reality i am not however yet so weak as to be seriously miserable when i have no real cause to be so the truth is now you know this phrase is a tacit confession that all that has been said before is false the real truth is by my prefacing so long you may be sure that i have reason to be ashamed of this real truths coming out the real truth is that i have been so long accustomed to be the first and only object of mr ls thoughts that i cannot bear to see him think of any thing else yes things i can bear but not personsfemale persons and there is one person here who is so much more agreeable and entertaining than i am that she engrosses very naturally almost all his attention i am not envious i am sure for i could once admire all lady olivias talents and accomplishments and no one could be more charmed than i was with her fascinating manners and irresistible powers of pleasing but when those irresistible powers may rob me of the heart of my beloved husbandof the whole happiness of my lifehow can i admire them all i can promise is to preserve my mind from the meanness of suspicion i can do my rival justice i can believe and entreat you to believe that she does not wish to be my rival that she is perfectly innocent of all design to injure me and that she is not aware of the impression she has made i who know every change of mr ls countenance every inflexion of his voice every turn of his mind can see too plainly what she cannot discern i should indeed have thought that no woman whom he distinguished or preferred in any degree could avoid perceiving it his manner is so expressive so flattering but perhaps this appears so only to mea woman who does not love him may see things very differently lady olivia can be in no danger because her heart fortunately for me is prepossessed in favour of another and a woman whose heart is occupied by one object is absolutely blind as i well know to all others with this security i ought to be satisfied for i believe no one inspires a lasting passion without sharing it i am summoned to give my opinion about certain illuminations and decorations for a fete champetre which mr l is so kind as to give in honour of my birthdayjust at the time i am complaining of his neglectno dear mother i hope i have not complained of him but of myselfand it is your business to teach your daughter to be more reasonable write soon and fully to your affectionate leonora letter xxvi olivia to madame de p this fine fete champetre is overexpect no description of it from me gabrielle for i am horribly out of humour the whole pleasure of the evening was destroyed by the most foolish circumstance imaginable leonoras jealousy is now evident to more eyes than mine no farther doubt upon the subject can remain my curiosity is satisfied but i am now left to reproach myself for having gone so far to ascertain what i ought to have taken for granted all these good english wives are jealous so jealous that no one who has any pretensions to beauty wit or amiability can live with them they can have no society in our sense of the word of course they must live shut up in their own dismal houses with their own stupid families the faithful husband and wife sitting opposite to each other in their own chimney corners yawning models of constancy and this they call virtue how the meanest vices usurp the name of virtue leonoras is a jealousy of the most illiberal and degrading species a jealousy of the temper not of the heart she is too cold to feel the passion of loveshe never could be in love of that i am certain she is too reasonable too prudish besides to imagine that she could be in love with her own husband and after eighteen months marriagethe thing is absurd the thing is impossible no she deceives herself or him or both if she pretends that her jealousy arises from love from what you and i gabrielle understand by the word passion and passion only can plead a just excuse of its own excesses were leonora in love i could pardon her jealousy but now i despise it yes with all her high reputation and imposing qualities i must think of her with contempt and now that i have given vent to my feelings with that freedom in which i ever indulge myself in writing to you my amiable gabrielle chosen friend of my heart i will compose myself and give you a rational account of things you know that i am said to have some taste leonora makes no pretensions to any wishing i suppose that her fete should be as elegant as possible she consulted me about all the arrangements and decorations it was i that did every thing my skill and taste were admired by the whole company and especially by mr l he was in remarkably good spirits at the commencement of the evening quite gay and gallant he certainly paid me a great deal of attention and it was natural he should for besides being his guest i was undoubtedly the most elegant woman present my fame had gone abroad i found that i was the object of general attention to this i have been tolerably well accustomed all my life enough at least to prevent me from giving any visible sign of being moved by admiration in whatever form it comes whether in the polite foreign glance or the broad english stare the starers enjoyed their pleasure and i mine i moved and talked i smiled or was pensive as though i saw them not nevertheless the homage of their gaze was not lost upon me you know my charming gabrielle one likes to observe the sensation one produces amongst new people the incense that i perceived in the surrounding atmosphere was just powerful enough to affect my nerves agreeably that languor which you have so often reproached me for indulging in the company of what we call indifferents gradually dissipated and as poor r used to say of me i came from behind my cloud like the sun in all its glory i was such as you have seen me gabrielle in my best days in my best moments in my very best style i wonder what would excite me to such a waste of powers l seemed inspired too he really was quite agreeable and showed me off almost as well as r himself could have done i had no idea that he had this species of talent you will never know of what my countrymen are capable for you are out of patience with the statues the first half hour now it takes an amazing time to animate them but they can be waked into life and i have a pride in conquering difficultiesthere were more men this night in proportion to the women than one usually sees in english company consequently it was more agreeable i was surrounded by an admiring audience and my conversation of course was sufficiently general to please all and sufficiently particular to distinguish the man whom i wished to animate in all this you will say there was nothing to put one out of humour nothing very mortifyingbut stay my fair philosopher do not judge of the day till you see its endleonora was so hid from my view by the crowd of adorers that i really did not discern her or suspect her jealousy i was quite natural i thought only of myself i declined all invitations to dance declaring that it was so long since i had tried an english country dance that i dared not expose my awkwardness french country dances were mentioned but i preferred conversation at last l persecuted me to try a polish dance with hima multitude of voices overpowered me i have not the talent which some of my countrywomen possess in such perfection of being obstinate about trifles when i can refuse with grace tis well but when that is no longer possible it is my principle or my weakness to yield i was surprised to find that ldanced admirably i became animated you know how dancing animates me when i have a partner who can dancea thing not very common in this country we ended by waltzing first in the polish and afterwards in the parisian manner i certainly surpassed myselfi flew i was borne upon the wings of the wind i floated on the notes of the music animated or languid in every gradation of grace and sentiment i abandoned myself to the inspiration of the moment i was all soul and the spectators were all admiration to you my gabrielle i may speak thus of myself without vanity you know the sensation i was accustomed to produce at paris you may guess then what the effect must be here where such a style of dancing has all the captivation of novelty had i doubted that my success was complete i should have been assured of it by the faces of some prudes amongst the matrons who affected to think that the waltz was too much as l was leading or rather supporting me to my seat for i was quite exhausted i overheard a gentleman who was at no great distance from the place where leonora was standing whisper to his neighbour le valse extreme est la volupte permise i fancy leonora overheard these words as well as myself for my eyes met hers at this instant and she coloured and directly looked another way l neither heard nor saw any thing of all this he was intent upon procuring me a seat and an englishman can never see or think of two things at a time a few minutes afterwards whilst he was fanning me a young awkward peasant girl quite a stranger in this country came up to me and dropping her novice curtsy said heres a ring my lady i found on the grass they tell me it is yours my lady no my good girl it is not mine said i it is lady leonoras said mr l at the sound of her name leonora came forward the girl looked alternately at us can you doubt cried colonel a which of these ladies is mr ls wife oh no sir this is she to be sure said the girl pointing to me what there was in the girls accent or in ls look when she pronounced the words or in mine or in all three together i cannot exactly describe but leonora felt it she turned as pale as death i looked as unconscious as i could l went on fanning me without seeing his wifes change of countenance leonorawould you believe itsank upon a bench behind us and fainted how her husband started when he felt her catch by his arm as she fell he threw down the fan left me ran for wateroh lady leonora lady leonora is ill exclaimed every voice the consternation was wonderful they carried her ladyship to a spot where she could have free air i was absolutely in an instant left alone and seemingly as much forgotten as if i had never existed i was indeed so much astonished that i could not stir from the place where i stood till recollecting myself i pushed my way through the crowd and came in view of leonora just as she opened her eyes as soon as she came to herself she made an effort to stand saying that she was quite well again but that she would go into the house and repose herself for a few minutes as she rose a hundred arms were offered at once to her assistance she stepped forward and to my surprise and i believe to the surprise of every body else took mine made a sign to her husband not to follow us and walked quickly towards the house her woman with a face of terror met us as we were going into lady leonoras apartment with salts and hartshorn and i know not what in her hands i am quite well quite well again i do not want any thing i do not want any thing i do not want you mason said leonora lady olivia is so good as to assist me i am come in only to rest for a few minutes the woman gave me an evil look and left the room never did i wish any thing more than that she should have stayed i was absolutely so embarrassed so distressed when i found myself alone with leonora that i knew not what to say i believe i began with a sentence about the night air that was very little to the purpose the sight of some babylinen which the maid had been making suggested to me something which i thought more appropriate my dear creature said i why will you fatigue yourself so terribly and stand so much and so long in your situation leonora neither accepted nor rejected my interpretation of what had passed she made no reply but fixed her eyes upon me as if she would have read my very soul never did i see or feel eyes so expressive or so powerful as hers were at this moment mine absolutely fell beneath them what deprived me of presence of mind i know not but i was utterly without common sense i am sure i changed colour and leonora must have seen it through my rouge for i had only the slightest tinge upon my cheeks the consciousness that she saw me blush disconcerted me beyond recovery it is really quite unaccountable i trembled all over as i stood before her i was forced to have recourse to the hartshorn and water which stood upon the table leonora rose and threw open the window to give me fresh air she pressed my hand but rather with an air of forgiveness than of affection i was mortified and vexed but my pride revived me we had better return to the company as soon as possible i believe said she looking down at the moving crowd below i am ready to attend you my dear said i coldly whenever you feel yourself sufficiently rested and composed she left the room and i followed you have no idea of the solicitude with which the people hoped she was betterand welland quite well c what amazing importance a fainting fit can sometimes bestow her husband seemed no longer to have any eyes or soul but for her at supper and during the rest of the night she occupied the whole attention of every body present can you conceive any thing so provoking but l must be an absolute fooldid he never see a woman faint beforehe cannot pretend to be in love with his wifei do not understand itbut this i know that he has been totally different in his manner towards me these three days past and now that my curiosity is satisfied about leonoras jealousy i shall absolutely perish with ennui in this stupid place adieu dearest gabrielle how i envy you the void of my heart is insupportable i must have some passion to keep me alive forward any letters from poor r if he has written under cover to you olivia letter xxvii the duchess of to her daughter take courage my beloved daughter take courage have a just confidence in yourself and in your husband for a moment he may be fascinated by the arts of an unprincipled woman for a moment she may triumph over his senses and his imagination but of his esteem his affection his heart she cannot rob you these have been ought to be will be yours trust to your mothers prophecy my child you may trust to it securely for well as she loves youand no mother ever loved a daughter bettershe does not soothe you with mere words of doting fondness she speaks to you the language of reason and of truth i know what such a man as mr l must esteem and love i know of what such a woman as my daughter is capable when her whole happiness and the happiness of all that is dear to her are at stake the loss of temporary admiration and power the transient preference shown to a despicable rival will not provoke you to imprudent reproach nor sink you to helpless despair the arts of an olivia might continue to deceive your husband if he were a fool or to please him if he were a libertine but he has a heart formed for love he cannot therefore be a libertine he is a man of superior abilities and knows women too well to be a dupe with a penetrating and discriminative judgment of character he is a nice observer of female manners his taste is delicate even to excess under a cold exterior he has a vivid imagination and strong sensibility he has little vanity but a superabundance of pride he wishes to be ardently loved but this he conceals it is difficult to convince him that he is beloved and scarcely possible to satisfy him by any common proofs of attachment a coquette will never attach mr l the admiration which others might express for her charms and accomplishments would never pique him to competition far from seeking to win her praise whom all admire he would disdain to enter the lists with the vulgar multitude a heart in which he had a probability of holding only divided empire would not appear to him worth the winning as a coquette whatever may be her talents graces accomplishments and address you have nothing seriously to fear from lady olivia but my dear mr ls mind may be in a situation to require amusement that species of apathy which succeeds to passion is not as the inexperienced imagine the death of love but the necessary and salutary repose from which it awakens refreshed and revived mr ls passion for you has been not only tender but violent and the calm which inevitably succeeds should not alarm you when a man feels that his fondness for a wife is suspended he is uneasy in her company not only from the sense of decreased pleasure but from the fear of her observation and detection if she reproach him affairs become worse he blames himself he fears to give pain whenever he is in her presence if he attempt to conceal his feelings and to appear what he is no longer a lover his attempts are awkward he becomes more and more dissatisfied with himself and the person who compels him to this hypocrisy who thus degrades him in his own eyes must certainly be in danger of becoming an object of aversion a wife who has sense enough to abstain from all reproaches direct or indirect by word or look may reclaim her husbands affections the bird escapes from his cage but returns to his nest i am glad that you have agreeable company at your house they will amuse mr l and relieve you from the necessity of taking a share in any conversation that you dislike our witty friend will supply your share of conversation and as to your silence remember that witty people are always content with those who act audience i rejoice that you persist in your daily occupations to a mind like yours the sense of performing your duty will next to religion be the firmest support upon which you can rely perhaps my dear even when you read this you will still be inclined to justify lady olivia and to conceal from your heart the suspicions which her conduct excites i am not surprised that you should find it difficult to believe that one to whom you have behaved so generously should treat you with treachery and ingratitude i am not surprised that you who feel what it is to love should think that a woman whose heart is occupied by attachment to one object must be incapable of thinking of any other but love in such a heart as yours is totally different from what it is in the fancy of these heroines in their imagination the objects are as fleeting as the pictures in the clouds chased by the wind from lady olivia expect nothing depend only on yourself when you become as you soon must completely convinced that the woman in whom your unsuspecting soul confided is utterly unworthy of your esteem refrain from all imprudent expressions of indignation i despiseyou will soon hateyour rival but in the moment of detection think of what is due to yourself and act as calmly as if you had never loved her she will suffer no pain from the loss of your friendship she has not a heart that can value it probably she is envious of you all these women desire to mortify those whom they cannot degrade to their own level and i am inclined to suspect that this malevolent feeling joined to the want of occupation may be the cause of her present conduct her manoeuvres will not ultimately succeed she will be deserted by mr l disappointed and disgraced and your husband will be more yours than ever when this happy moment comes my leonora when your husband returns preferring yours to all other society then will be the time to exert all your talents all your charms to prove your superiority in every thing but most in love the soothings of female tenderness in certain situations have power not only to calm the feelings of selfreproach but to diffuse delight over the soul of man the oil which the skilful mariner throws upon the sea not only smooths the waves in the storm but when the sun shines spreads the most beautiful colours over the surface of the waters my dear daughter though your mother writes seemingly at her ease you must not fancy that she does not feel for you do not imagine that in the coldness of extinguished passions and in the pride of counselling age your mother expects to charm agony with words no my child i am not so absurd so cruel your letter forced tears from eyes which are not used like sentimental eyes to weep upon every trifling occasion my first wish was to set out immediately to see you but whatever consolation or pleasure my company might afford i believe it might be disadvantageous to you in your present circumstances i could not be an hour in the room with this lady olivia without showing some portion of the indignation and contempt that i feel for her conduct this warmth of mine might injure you in your husbands opinion though you would have too strong a sense of propriety and too much dignity of mind to make complaints of your husband to me or to any one living yet it might be supposed that your mother was your confidante in secret and your partisan in public this might destroy your domestic happiness no husband can or ought to endure the idea of his wifes caballing against him i admire and shall respect your dignified silence and now fare you well my dearest child may god bless you if a mothers prayers could avail you would be the happiest of human beings i do without partiality believe you to be one of the best and most amiable of women letter xxviii leonora to her mother had your letter my dearest mother reached me a few hours sooner i should not have exposed myself as i have done yesterday at our fete champetre you would have been ashamed of me i am ashamed of myself i did the very reverse of what i ought of what i would have done if i had been fortified by your counsel instead of being calm and dignified i was agitated beyond all power of control i lost all presence of mind all common sense all recollection i know your contempt for swooning heroines what will you say when you hear that your daughter faintedfainted in public i believe however that as soon as i recovered i had sufficient command over myself to prevent the accident from being attributed to the real cause and i hope that the very moment i came to my recollection my manner towards lady olivia was such as to preclude all possibility of her being blamed or even suspected from living much abroad she has acquired a certain freedom of manner and latitude of thinking which expose her to suspicion but of all serious intention to injure me or to pass the bounds of propriety i totally acquit her she is not to blame for the admiration she excites nor is she to be the sufferer for my weakness of mind or of health great and unreasonable folly i am sure i showedbut i shall do so no more the particular circumstances i need not explain you may be assured that wherever i think it right to be silent nothing shall tempt me to speak but i understood by the conclusion of your letter that you expect me to preserve an absolute silence upon this subject in future this i will not promise i cannot conceive that i who do not mean to injure any human being ought because i am unhappy and when i am most in want of a friend to be precluded from the indulgence of speaking of what is nearest my heart to that dear safe most enlightened and honourable of friends who has loved guided instructed and encouraged me in every thing that is right from my infancy why should i be refused all claim to sympathy why must my thoughts and feelings be shut up in my own breast and why must i be a solitary being proscribed from commerce with my own family with my beloved mother to whom i have been accustomed to tell every feeling and idea as they arose no to all that is honourable i will strictly conform but by the superstition of prudence i do not hold myself bound nothing could be kinder than my husbands conduct to me the evening after i was taken ill he left home early this morning he is gone to meet his friend general b who has just returned from abroad i hope that mr l will be absent only a few days for it would be fatal to my happiness if he should find amusement at a distance from home his home at all events shall never be made a cage to him when he returns i will exert myself to the utmost to make it agreeable this i hope can be done without obtruding my company upon him or putting myself in competition with any person i could wish that some fortunate accident might induce lady olivia to leave us before mr ls return had i the same high opinion of her generosity that i once formed had i the same perfect confidence in her integrity and in her friendship for me i would go this moment and tell her all that passes in my heart no humiliation of my vanity would cost me any thing if it could serve the interests of my love no mean pride could stand in my mind against the force of affection but there is a species of pride which i cannot will not renouncebelieving as i do that it is the companion the friend the support of virtue this pride i trust will never desert me it has grown with my growth it was implanted in my character by the education which my dear mother gave me and now even by her it cannot be eradicated surely i have misunderstood one passage in your letter you cannot advise your daughter to restrain just indignation against vice from any motive of policy or personal interest you say to me in the moment of detection think of what is due to yourself and act as calmly as if you had never loved her if i could i would not do this contempt shown by virtue is the just punishment of vice a punishment which no selfish consideration should mitigate if i were convinced that lady olivia were guilty would you have me behave to her as if i believed her to be innocent my countenance my voice my principles would revolt from such mean and pernicious hypocrisy degrading to the individual and destructive to society may i never more see the smile of love on the lips of my husband nor its expression in his eyes if i do so degrade myself in my own opinion and in his yes in his for would not he would not any man of sense or delicacy recur to that idea so common with his sex and so just that if a woman will sacrifice her sense of honour to her passions in one instance she may in another would he not argue if she will do this for me because she is in love with me why not for a new favourite if time or accident should make me less an object of passion no i may lose his lovethis would be my misfortune but to forfeit his esteem would be my fault and under the remorse which i should then have to endure i am persuaded that no power of art or nature could sustain my existence so much for myself as to the general good of society that i confess is not at this moment the uppermost consideration in my mind but i will add a few words on that subject lest you should imagine me to be hurried away by my own feelings public justice and reason are i think on my side what would become of the good order of society or the decency of families if every politic wife were to receive or invite or permit her husbands mistress to reside in her house what would become of conjugal virtue in either sex if the wife were in this manner not only to connive at the infidelity of her husband but to encourage and provide for his inconsistency if she enters into bonds of amity and articles of partnership with her rival with that person by whom she has been most injured instead of being the dignified sufferer she becomes an object of contempt my dearest mother my most respected friend my sentiments on this subject cannot essentially differ from yours i must have mistaken your meaning pray write quickly and tell me so and forgive if you cannot approve of the warmth with which i have spoken i am your truly affectionate and grateful daughter leonora l letter xxix olivia to madame p my amiable gabrielle i must be faithful to my promise of writing to you every week though this place affords nothing new either in events or sentiment mr ls absence made this castle insupportably dull a few days ago he returned home and met me with an easy kind of indifference provoking enough to a woman who has been accustomed to excite some sensation however i was rejoiced at this upon leonoras account she was evidently delighted and her spirits and affections seemed to overflow involuntarily upon all around her even to me her manner became quite frank and cordial almost caressing she is really handsome when she is animated and her conversation this evening quite surprised me i saw something of that playfulness those light touches that versatility of expression those words that mean more than meet the ear every thing in short that could charm in the most polished foreign society leonora seemed to be inspired with all the art of conversation by the simple instinct of affection what astonished me most was the grace with which she introduced some profound philosophical remarks such pearls said mr l come from the deep with all these talents what might not leonora be in proper hands but now she is nothing except to her husband and a few intimate friends however this is not my affair let me go on to what concerns myself you may believe my dear gabrielle that i piqued myself upon showing at least as much easy indifference as was shown to me freedom encourages freedom as there was no danger of my being too amiable i did not think myself bound in honour or sentiment to keep myself in the shade but i could not be as brilliant as you have seen me at your soirees the magic circle of adorers the inspiring power of numbers the eclat of public representation were wanting i retired to my own apartment at night quite out of humour with myself and josephine as she undressed me put me still further out of patience by an illtimed history of a dispute she has had with leonoras swiss servant the swiss and josephine it seems came to high words in defence of their mistresses charms josephine provoked the swiss by saying that his lady might possibly be handsome if she were dressed in the french taste mais quelle etoit bien angloise and would be quite another thing if she had been at paris the swiss retorted by observing that josephines lady had indeed learnt in perfection at paris the art of making herself up which was quite necessary to a beauty un peu passee the words were not more agreeable to me than they had been to josephine i wonder at her assurance in repeating themun peu passee many a woman in england ten fifteen years older than i am has inspired a violent passion and it has been observed that power is retained by these mature charmers longer than conquest can be preserved by inexperienced beauties there are women who have learnt to combine for their own advantage and for that of their captives all the pleasure and conveniences of society all that a thorough knowledge of the world can givewomen who have a sufficient attention to appearances joined to a real contempt of all prejudices especially that of constancywomen who possess that knowledge of the human heart which well compensates transient bloom who add the expression of sentiment to beautiful features and who employ gay smiles to comfort april showers to move and all the nature all the art of love un peu passee the swiss is impertinent and knows nothing of the matter his master knows but little more he would however know infinitely more if i could take the trouble to instruct him to which i am almost tempted for want of something better to do adieu my gabrielle rs silence is perfectly incomprehensible olivia letter xxx olivia to madame de p so my amiable gabrielle you are really interested in my letters though written during my english exile and you are curious to know whether any of my potent spells can wake into life this man of marble i candidly confess you would inspire me with an ambition to raise my poor countrymen in your opinion if i were not restrained by the sacred sentiment of friendship which forbids me to rival leonora even in a husbands opinion however josephine who feels herself a party concerned ever since her battle with the swiss has piqued herself upon dressing me with exquisite taste i am every day mise a ravirand with such perfection of art that no art appearsall is negligent simplicity i let josephine please herself for you know i am not bound to be frightful because i have a friend whose husband may chance to turn his eye upon my figure when he is tired of admiring hers i rallied l the other day upon his having no eyes or ears but for his wife be assured i did it in such a manner that he could not be angry then i went on to a comparison between the facility of french and english society he admitted that there was some truth and more wit in my observations i was satisfied with these reasonable men the grand point for a woman is to amuse themthey can have logic from their own sex but my gabrielle i am summoned to the salon and must finish my letter another day heaven can it be a fortnight since i wrote a line to my gabriellewhere was iwith these reasonable men the grand point for a woman is to amuse them truemost true l believing himself only amused with my lively nonsense indulged himself with it continually i was to believe only what he believed presently he could not do without my conversation for more than two hours together what was i to do my gabrielle i walked out to avoid him he found me in the woodsrallied me on my taste for solitude and quoted voltaire this led to a metaphysical conversation half playful half seriousthe distinction which a man sometimes makes to his conscience between thinking a woman entertaining and feeling her interesting vanishes more easily and more rapidly than he is aware ofat least in certain situations this was not an observation i could make to my companion in the woods and he certainly did not make it for himself it would have been vanity in me to have broken off our conversation lest he should fall in love with meit would have been blindness not to have seen that he was in some danger i thought of leonoraand sighedand did all that was in my power to put him upon his guard by way of preservative i frankly made him a confession of my attachment to r this i imagined would put things upon a right footing for ever but on the contrary by convincing him of my innocence and of my having no designs on his heart this candour has i fear endangered him still more yet i know not what to thinkhis manner is so variable towards mei must be convinced of what his sentiments are before i can decide what my conduct ought to be adieu my amiable gabrielle i wait for something decisive with an inexpressible degree of anxietyi will not now call it curiosityapropos does r wish that i should forget that he exists what is this business that detains him but why do i condescend to inquire olivia letter xxxi general b to mr l my dear l london i send you the horse to which you took a fancy he has killed one of his grooms and lamed two but you will be his master and i hope he will know it i have a word to say to you on a more serious subject pardon me if i tell you that i think you are a happy man and excuse me if i add that if you do not keep yourself so i shall not think you a wise one a good wife is better than a goodfornothing mistressa selfevident propositiona stupid truism yes but if every man who knows a selfevident proposition when he sees it on paper always acted as if he knew it this would be a very wise and a very happy world and i should not have occasion to write this letter you say that you are only amusing yourself at the expense of a finished coquette take care that she does not presently divert herself at yoursyou are proof against french coquetry and german sentimentgrantedbut a fine womanand your own vanitybut you have no vanityyou call it pride then i suppose i will not quarrel with you for a name pride properly managed will do your business as well as vanity and no doubt lady olivia knows this as well as i do i hope you may never know it better i am my dear friend truly yours j b letter xxxii olivia to madame de p l castle advise me dearest gabrielle i am in a delicate situation and on your judgment and purity of heart i have the most perfect reliance know then that i begin to believe that leonoras jealousy was not so absolutely absurd as i at first supposed she understood her husband better than i did i begin to fear that i have made a serious impression whilst i meant only to amuse myself heaven is my witness i simply intended to satisfy my curiosity and that once gratified it was my determination to respect the weakness i discovered to love leonora as once i imagined i could is out of my power but to disturb her peace to destroy her happiness to make use of the confidence she has reposed in me the kindness she has shown by making me an inmate of her housemy soul shudders at these ideas noif her husband really loves me i will fly leonora shall see that olivia is incapable of treacherythat olivia has a soul generous and delicate as her own though free from the prejudices by which she is fettered to leonora a husband is a loveri shall consider him as such and respect her property you are so little used my dear gabrielle to consider a husband in this point of view that you will scarcely enter into my feelings but put yourself in my situation allow for nationality of principle and i am persuaded you would act as i shall spare me your raillery seriously if leonoras husband is in love with me would you not advise me my dearest friend to fly him far as pole from pole write to me i conjure you my gabriellewrite instantly and tell me whether ris now at paris i will return thither immediately if you advise it my mind is in such confusion i have no power to decide i will be guided by your advice olivia letter xxxiii madame de p to olivia paris advice my charming olivia do you ask me for advice i never gave or took advice in my life except for les vapeurs noirs and your understanding is so far superior to mine and you comprehend the characters of these english so much better than i do that i cannot pretend to counsel you this lady leonora is inconceivable with her passion for her own husband but how ridiculous to let it be suspected if her heart is so tender cannot she with all her charms find a lover on whom to bestow it without tormenting that poor mr l evidently he is tired of her and i am sure i should be worn to death were i in his place nothing so tiresome as love without mystery and without obstacles and this must ever be the case with conjugal love eighteen months married i think you say and lady leonora expects her husband to be still at her feet and she wishes it truly she is the most unreasonable woman upon earthand the most extraordinary but i am tired of thinking of what i cannot comprehend let us pass on to mr l by your last letters i should judge that he might be an agreeable man if his wife were out of the question matrimonial jealousy is a new idea to me i can judge of it only by analogy in affairs of gallantry i have sometimes seen one of the parties continue to love when the other has become indifferent and then they go on tormenting one another and being miserable because they have not the sense to see that a fire cannot be made of ashes sometimes i have found romantic young people persuade themselves that they can love no more because they can love one another no longer but if they had sufficient courage to sayi am tiredand i cannot help itthey would come to a right understanding immediately and part on the best terms possible each eager to make a new choice and to be again in love and happy all this to be done with decency of course and if there be no scandal where is the harm can it signify to the universe whether mons un tel likes madame une telle or madame une autre provided there is love enough all the world is in good humour and that is the essential point for without good humour what becomes of the pleasures of society as to the rest i think of inconstancy or infidelity as it is called much as our good la fontaine didquand on le sait cest peu de chosequand on ne le sait pas ce nest rien to promise to love one person eternally what a terrible engagement it freezes my heart even to think of it i am persuaded that if i were bound to love him for life i should detest the most amiable man upon earth in ten minutesa husband more especially good heavens how i should abhor m de p if i saw him in this point of view on the contrary now i love him infinitelythat is to say as one loves a husband i have his interest at heart and his glory when i thought he was going to prison i was in despair i was at home to no one but braveettendre and to him only to consult on the means of obtaining my husbands pardon m de pis sensible of this and on my part i have no reason to complain of his liberality we are perfectly happy though we meet perhaps but for a few minutes in the day and is not this better than tiring one another for fourandtwenty hours when i grow oldif ever i dohe will be my best friend in the mean time i support his credit with all my influence this very morning i concluded an affair for him which never could have succeeded if the intimate friend of the minister had not been also my lover now why cannot your lady leonora and her mr l live on the same sort of terms but if english manners will not permit of this i have nothing more to say above all things a woman must respect opinion else she cannot be well received in the world i conclude this is the secret of lady leonoras conduct but then jealousyno woman i suppose is bound even in england to be jealous in order to show her love for her husband i lose myself again in trying to understand what is incomprehensible as to you my dear olivia you also amaze me by talking of crimes and horror and flying from pole to pole to avoid a man because you have made him at last find out that he has a heart you have done him the greatest possible service it may preserve him perhaps from hanging himself next novemberthat month in which according to voltaires philosophical calendar englishmen always hang themselves because the atmosphere is so thick and their ennui so heavy lady leonora if she really loves her husband ought to be infinitely obliged to you for averting this danger as to the rest your heart is not concerned so you can have nothing to fear and as for a platonic attachment on the part of mr l his wife even according to her own rigid principles cannot blame you adieu my charming friend instead of laughing at your fit of prudery i ought to encourage your scruples that i might profit by them if they should bring you to paris immediately with what joy should i embrace my olivia and how much gratitude should i owe to the jealousy of lady leonora l r is not yet returned when i have any news to give you of him depend upon it you shall hear from me again accept my interesting olivia the vows of my most tender and eternal friendship gabrielle de p letter xxxiv olivia to madame de p l castle tuesday your charming letter my gabrielle has at once revived my spirits and dissipated all my scruples you mistake however in supposing that leonora is in love with her husband more and more reason have i every hour to be convinced that leonora has never known the passion of love consequently her jealousy was as i at first pronounced it to be the selfish jealousy of matrimonial power and property else why does it subside why does it vanish when if it were a jealousy of the heart it has now more provocation infinitely more than when it appeared in full force leonora could see that her husband distinguished me at a fete champetre she could see what the eyes of others showed her she could hear what envy whispered or what scandal hinted she was mortified she was alarmed even to fainting by a public preference by a silly country girls mistaking me for the wife and doing homage to me as to the lady of the manor but leonora cannot perceive in the object of her affection the symptoms that mark the rise and progress of a real love leonora feels not the little strokes which would be fatal blows to the peace of a truly delicate mind she heeds not the trifles light as air which would be confirmation strong to a soul of genuine sensibility my influence over the mind of lincreases rapidly and i shall let it rise to its acme before i seem to notice it leonora reassured i suppose by a few flattering words and more perhaps by an exalted opinion of her own merit has lately appeared quite at her ease and blind to all that passes before her eyes it is not for me to dissipate this illusion prematurelyit is not for me to weaken this confidence in her husband to an english wife this would be death let her foolish security then last as long as possible after all how much anguish of heart how many pangs of conscience how much of the torture of pity am i spared by this callous temper in my friend i may indulge in a little harmless coquetry without danger to her peace and without scruple enjoy the dear possession of power say for you know charming gabrielle what is the delight of obtaining power over the human heart let the lords of the creation boast of their power to govern all things to charm these governors be ours let the logicians of the earth boast their power to regulate the world by reason be it ours gabrielle to intoxicate and humble proud reason to the dust beneath our feetand who shall blame in us this ardour for universal dominion if they are men i call them tyrantsif they are women i call them hypocritesand the two vices which i most detest are tyranny and hypocrisy frankly i confess that i feel in all its restless activity the passion for general admiration i cannot conceivecan you gabrielle a pleasure more transporting than the perception of extended and extending dominion the struggle of the rebel heart for freedom makes the war more tempting the victory more glorious the triumph more splendid secure of your sympathy ma belle gabrielle i shall not fear to tire you by my commentaries male coquetry justifies female retaliation to any imaginable extent upon this principle on which i have seen you act so often and so successfully i shall now intrepidly proceed this man makes a show of resistance be it at his own peril he thinks that he is gaining power over my heart whilst i am preparing torments for his he fancies that he is throwing chains round me whilst i am rivetting fetters from which he will in vain attempt to escape he is proud and has the insanity of desiring to be exclusively beloved yet affects to set no value upon the preference that is shown to him appears satisfied with his own approbation and stoically allsufficient to his own happiness leonora does not know how to manage his temper but i do the suspense however in which he keeps me is tantalizing he shall pay for it hereafter i had no idea till lately that he had so much selfcommand at times he has actually made me doubt my own power at certain moments i have been half tempted to believe that i had made no serious impression that he had been only amusing himself at my expense and for leonoras gratification but upon careful and cool observation i am convinced that his indifference is affected that all his stoicism will prove vain the arrow is lodged in his heart and he must fall whether he turn upon the enemy in anger or fly in dismay my pride is exasperated i am not accustomed to such obstinate resistance i really almost hate this invincible man andstrange inconsistency of the human heartalmost love him heaven and pride preserve me from such a weakness but there is certainly something that piques and stimulates ones feelings in this species of male coquetry l understands the business better than i thought he could one moment my knowledge of the arts of his sex puts me on my guard the next my sensibility exposes me in the most terrible manner experience ought to protect me but it only shows me the peril and my inability to escape ah gabrielle without a heart how safe we should be how dangerous to our lovers but cursed with sensibility we must alas submit to our fate the habit of loving le besoin daimer is more powerful than all sense of the folly and the danger nor is the tempest of the passions so dreadful as the dead calm of the soul why did r suffer my soul to sink into this ominous calm the fault is his let him abide the consequences why did he not follow me to england why did he not write to me or when he did write why were his letters so cold so spiritless when i spoke of divorce why did he hesitate why did he reason when he should have only felt tell him my tender my delicate friend these are questions which the heart asks and which the heart only can answer adieu olivia letter xxxv madame de p to olivia paris je suis excedee mon coeur alive and but just alive after such a day of fatigues all morning from one minister to another then home to my toilette then a great dinner with a number of foreigners each to be distinguishedthen au feydeau where i was obliged to go to support poor ss play it would be really insupportable if it were not for the finest music in the world which after all the french music certainly is there was a violent party against the piece and we were so late that it was just on the point of perishing my ears have not yet recovered from the horrid noise in the midst of the tumult i happily by a masterstroke turned the fortune of the night i spied the shawl of an english woman hanging over the box this you know like scarlet to the bull is sufficient to enrage the parisian pit to the shawl i directed the fury of the mob of critics luckily for us the lady was attended only by an englishman who of course chose to assert his right not to understand the customs of any country or submit to any will but his own he would not permit the shawl to be stirred a bas a bas resounded from below the uproar was inconceivable you would have thought that the house must have come down in the mean time the piece went on and the shawl covered all its defects admire my generalship t tells me i was born for a general yet i rather think my forte is negotiation but i have not yet come to your affairs for which alone i could undergo the fatigue of writing at this moment guess my olivia what apparition i met at the door of my box tonight but the enclosed note will save you the trouble of guessing i could not avoid permitting him to slide his billetdoux into my hand as he put on my shawl adieu i must refuse myself the pleasure of conversing longer with my sweet friend fresh toils await me madame la grande will never forgive me if i do not appear for a moment at her soiree and la petite q will be jealous beyond recovery if i do not give her a moment and it is madame rs night there i must be for all the ambassadors as usual will be there and as some of them i have reason to believe go on purpose to meet me i cannot disappoint their excellencies my friends would never forgive it i am positively quite weary of this life of eternal bustle but once in the eddy one is carried round and round there is no stopping adieu adieu i write under the hands of victoire o that she had your taste to guide her and to decide my too vacillating judgment we should then have no occasion to dread even the elegant simplicity of madame rs toilette gabrielle de p letter xxxvi olivia to madame de f my gabrielle i have read rs note enclosed in your charming sprightly letter what a contrast so cold so formal a thousand times rather would i not have heard from him than have received a letter so little in unison with my feelings he talks to me of business business what business ought to detain a man a moment from the woman he loves the interests of his ambition are nothing to me what are all these to love is he so mean as to hesitate between them then i despise him and olivia can never love the being she despises does r flatter himself that his power over my heart is omnipotent does he imagine that olivia is to be slighted with impunity does r think that a woman who has even nominally the honour to reign over his heart cannot meditate new conquests oh credulous vanity of man he fancies perhaps that he is secure of the maturer age of one who fondly devoted to him her inexperienced youth security is the curse of fools does he in his wisdom deem a womans age a sufficient pledge for her constancy he might every day see examples enough to convince him of his error in fact the age of women has nothing to do with the number of their years possibly however the gallant gentleman may be of opinion with leonoras swiss that lady olivia is un peu passee adieu my dear friend you who always understand and sympathize in my feelings you will express them for me in the best manner possible i shall not write to r you will see him and olivia commits to you what to a woman of delicacy is more dear than her loveher just resentment olivia letter xxxvii olivia to madame de p l castle pity me dearest gabrielle for i am in need of all the pity which your susceptible heart can bestow never was woman in such a terrible situation yes gabrielle this provoking this incomprehensible this too amiable man has entangled your poor friend past recovery her sentiments and sensations must henceforward be in eternal opposition to each other friendship gratitude honour virtue all in tremendous array forbid her to think of love but love imperious love will not be so defied he seizes upon his victim and now as in all the past will be the ruler the tyrant of olivias destiny never was confusion amazement terror remorse equal to mine gabrielle when i first discovered that i loved him who could have foreseen who could have imagined it i meant but to satisfy an innocent curiosity to indulge harmless coquetry to gratify the natural love of admiration and to enjoy the possession of power alas i felt not that whilst i was acquiring ascendancy over the heart of another i was beguiled of all command over my own i flattered myself that when honour should bid me stop i could pause without hesitation without effort i promised myself that the moment i should discover that i was loved by the husband of my friend i should fly from him for ever alas it is no longer timeto fly from him is no longer in my power oh gabrielle i love him he knows that i love him never did woman suffer more than i have done since i wrote to you last the conflict was too violent for my feeble frame i have been illvery ill a nervous fever brought me nearly to the grave why did i not die i should have escaped the deep humiliation the endless selfreproach to which my future existence is doomedleonorawhy do i start at that name oh there is horror in the sound even now perhaps she knows and triumphs in my weakness even now perhaps her calm insensible soul blesses itself for not being made like mine even now perhaps her husband doubts whether he shall accept olivias love or sacrifice your wretched friend to leonoras pride oh gabrielle no words can describe what i suffer but i must be calm and explain the progress of this fatal passion explainheavens how shall i explain what i cannot recollect without heartrending anguish and confusion oh gabrielle pity your distracted olivia letter xxxviii madame de p to olivia monday my dear romantic olivia you must have a furious passion for tormenting yourself when you can find matter for despair in your present situation in your place i should rejoice to find that in the moment an old passion had consumed itself a new one fresh and vigorous springs from its ashes my charming friend understand your own interests and do not be the dupe of those fine phrases that we are obliged to employ to deceive others rail at cupid as much as you please to the men in public par facon but always remember for your private use that love is essential to our existence in society what is a woman when she neither loves nor is loved a mere personage muet in the drama of life is it not from our lovers that we derive our consequence even a beauty without lovers is but a queen without subjects a woman who renounces love is an abdicated sovereign always longing to resume her empire when it is too late continually forgetting herself like the pseudophilosophic christina talking and acting as though she had still the power of life and death in her hands a tyrant without guards or slaves a most awkward pitiable and ridiculous personage no my fair olivia let us never abjure love even when the reign of beauty passes away that of grace and sentiment remains as much delicacy as you please without delicacy there is no grace and without a veil beauty loses her most captivating charms i pity you my dear for having let your veil be blown aside malheureusement but such accidents will happen who can control the passions or the winds after all lerreur dun moment is not irretrievable and you reproach yourself too bitterly my sweet friend for your involuntary injustice to lady leonora assuredly it could not be your intention to sacrifice your repose to mr l you loved him against your will did you not and it is you know by the intention that we must judge of actions the positive harm done to the world in general is in all cases the only just measure of criminality now what harm is done to the universe and what injury can accrue to any individual provided you keep your own counsel as long as your friend is deceived she is happy it therefore becomes your duty your virtue to dissemble i am no great casuist but all this appears to me selfevident and these i always thought were your principles of philosophy my dear olivia i have drawn out my whole store of metaphysics with some difficulty for your service i flatter myself i have set your poor distracted head to rights one word morefor i like to go to the bottom of a subject when i can do so in two minutes virtue is desirable because it makes us happy consequently to make ourselves happy is to be truly virtuous methinks this is sound logic to tell you the truth my dear olivia i do not well conceive how you have contrived to fall in love with this halffrozen englishman tis done howeverthere is no arguing against facts and this is only one proof more of what i have always maintained that destiny is inevitable and love irresistible voltaires charming inscription on the statue of cupid is worth all the volumes of reasoning and morality that ever were or ever will be written banish melancholy thoughts my dear friend they serve no manner of purpose but to increase your passion repentance softens the heart and every body knows that what softens the heart disposes it more to love for which reason i never abandon myself to this dangerous luxury of repentance mon dieu why will people never benefit by experience and to what purpose do they read history was not la valliere ever penitent and ever transgressing ever in transports or in tears you at all events my olivia can never become a carmelite or a magdalen you have emancipated yourself from superstition but whilst you ridicule all religious orders do not inflict upon yourself their penances the habit of some of the orders has been thought becoming the modest costume of a nun is indeed one of the prettiest dresses one can wear at a masquerade ball and it might even be worn without a mask if it were fashionable but nothing that is not fashionable can be becoming adieu my adorable olivia i will send you by the first opportunity your lyons gown which is really charming gabrielle de p letter xxxix olivia to madame de p nov th your truly philosophical letter my infinitely various gabrielle infused a portion of its charming spirit into my soul my mind was fortified and elevated by your eloquence who could think that a woman of such a lively genius could be so profound and who could expect from a woman who has passed her life in the world such original and deep reflections you see you were mistaken when you thought that you had no genius for philosophic subjects after all that has been said by metaphysicians about the existence and seat of the moral sense i think i can solve every difficulty by a new theory you know some philosophers suppose the moral sense to be intuitive and inherent in man others who deny the doctrine of innate ideas treat this notion of innate sentiments as equally absurd there they certainly are wrong for sentiments are widely different from ideas and i have that within me which convinces my understanding that sentiments must be innate and proportioned to the delicacy of our sensibility no person of common sense or feeling can doubt this but there are other points which i own puzzled me till yesterday some metaphysicians would seat the moral sense inherently in the heart others would place it intuitively in the brain all would confine it to the soul now in my opinion it resides primarily and principally in the nerves and varies with their variations hence the difficulty of making the moral sense a universal guide of action since it not only differs in many individuals but in the same persons at different periods of their existence or as i have often experienced at different hours of the day all this must depend upon the mobility of the nervous system upon this may hinge the great difficulties which have puzzled metaphysicians respecting consciousness identity c if they had attended less to the nature of the soul and more to the system of the nerves they would have avoided innumerable errors and probably would have made incalculably important discoveries nothing is wanting but some great german genius to bring this idea of a moral sense in the nerves into fashion indeed if our friend mad would mention it in the notes to her new novel it would introduce it in the most satisfactory manner possible to all the fashionable world abroad and we take our notions in this country implicitly from the continent as for you my dear gabrielle i know you cut the gordian knot at once by referring with your favourite moralist every principle of human nature to selflove this does not quite accord with my ideas there is something harsh in it that is repugnant to my sensibility but you have a stronger mind than i have and perhaps your theory is right you tell me i contradict myself continually says the acute and witty duke de la rochefoucault no but the human heart of which i treat is in perpetual contradiction to itself permit me to avail myself of this answer dear gabrielle if you should accuse me of contradicting in this letter all that i said to you in my last a few hours after i had despatched it the state of my nerves changed i saw things of course in a new light and repented having exposed myself to your raillery by writing in such a magdalen strain my nerves were more in fault than i when ones mind or ones nerves grow weak the early associations and old prejudices of the nursery recur and tyrannize over ones reason from this evil your liberal education and enviable temperament have preserved you but have charity for my feminine weakness of frame which too often counteracts the masculine strength of my soul now that i have deprecated your ridicule for my last nervous nonsense i will go on in a more rational manner however my better judgment might have been clouded for a moment i have recovered strength of mind enough to see that i am in no way to blame for any thing that has happened if a man is amiable and if i have taste and sensibility i must see and feel it to love as i remember your friend g once finely observed to you to love is a crime only in the eyes of demons or of priests who resemble demons this is a general proposition to which none but the prejudiced can refuse their assent and what is true in general must be true in particular the accident i use the term philosophically not popularly the accident of a mans being married or in other words having entered imprudently into a barbarous and absurd civil contract cannot alter the nature of things the essence of truth cannot be affected by the variation of external circumstances now the proper application of metaphysics frees the mind from vulgar prejudices and dissipates the baby terrors of an illeducated conscience to fall in love with a married man and the husband of your intimate friend how dreadful this sounds to some ears even mine were startled at first till i called reason to my assistance then i had another difficulty to combatto own and own unasked a passion to the object of it would shock the false delicacy of those who are governed by common forms and who are slaves to vulgar prejudices but a little philosophy liberates our sex from the tyranny of custom teaches us to disdain hypocrisy and to glory in the simplicity of truth josephine had been perfuming my hair and i was sitting reading at my toilette the door of my dressingroom happened to be half open l was crossing the gallery and as he passed i suppose his eye was caught by my hair or perhaps he paused a moment i am not certain how it wasmy eyes were on my book ah vous avez raison monsieur cest la plus belle chevelure mais entrez donc monsieur cried josephine whom i can never teach to comprehend or respect english customs eh entrez entrez monsieur madame est a sa toilette as i looked up i could not forbear smiling at the extreme ease and decision of josephines manner and the excessive doubt and anxiety in the gentlemans appearance my smile which heaven knows meant no encouragement decided him timidity instantly gave way to joy he entered what was to be done i could not turn him out again i was not answerable for any foolish conclusions he might draw from what he ought in politeness to have considered as a thing of course all i could do was to blame josephine for being a french woman to defend her and flatter me was the gentlemans part and for an englishman he really acquitted himself with tolerable grace josephine at least was pleased and she found such a perpetual employment for monsieur and his advice was so necessary that there was no chance of his departure so we talked of french toilettes c c in french for josephines edification l paid me some compliments upon the recovery of my looks after my illnessi thought i looked terribly languidbut he assured me that this languor in his eyes was an additional grace i could not understand this he fancied that must be because he did not express himself well in french he explained himself more clearly in english which josephine you know does not understand so that she was now forced to be silent and i was compelled to take my share in the conversation l made me comprehend that languor indicating sensibility of heart was to him the most touching of female charms i sighed and took up the book i had been reading it was the new novel which you sent me dear gabrielle i talked of it in hopes of changing the course of the conversation alas this led to one far more dangerous he looked at the passage i had been reading this brought us back to sensibility againto sentiments and descriptions so terribly apposite we found such a similarity in our tastes yet l spoke only in general and he preserved a command over himself which provoked me though i knew it to be coquetry i saw the struggle in his mind and was determined to force him to be candid and to enjoy my triumph with these views i went farther than i had intended the charm of sensibility he had told me was to him irresistible alas i let him perceive all the weakness of my heartsensibility is the worst timekeeper in the world we were neither of us aware of its progressive motion the swissmy evil geniusthe swiss knocked at the door to let me know dinner was served dinner on what vulgar incidents the happiness of life depends dinner came between the discovery of my sentiments and that declaration of passion which i now must hearor die le diner mon dieu cried josephine maisfinissons doncla toilette de madame i heard the impertinent swiss at the other end of the gallery at his masters door wondering in broken english where his master could be and conjecturing forty absurdities about his boots and his being out riding c c to sally forth in conscious innocence upon the enemys spies and to terminate the adventure as it was begun a la francoise was my resolution l and josephine understood me perfectly eh monsieur de vaud said josephine to the swiss whom we met on the landingplace of the stairs madame nest elle pas coeffee a ravir aujourdhui cest que monsieur vient dassister a la toilette de madame the swiss bowed and said nothing the bow was to his master not to me and it was a bow of duty not of inclination i never saw a man look so like a machine he did not even raise his eyes upon me or my coeffure as we passed bah cried josephine with an inexpressible accent of mingled indignation and contempt she ran down stairs leaving the swiss to his stupidity i was more afraid of his penetration but i entered the diningroom as if nothing extraordinary had happened and after all you know my dear gabrielle nothing extraordinary had befallen us a gentleman had assisted at a ladys toilette nothing more simple nothing more proper in the meridian of paris and does propriety change with meridians there was company at dinner and the conversation was general and uninteresting l endeavoured to support his part with vivacity but he had fits of absence and silence which might have alarmed leonora if she had any suspicion but she is now perfectly secure and absolutely blind therefore you see there can be no danger for her happiness in my remaining where i am for no earthly consideration would i disturb her peace of mind there is no sacrifice i would hesitate for a moment to make to friendship or virtue but i cannot surely be called upon to plant a dagger in my own heart to destroy for ever to destroy my own felicity without advantage to my friend my attachment to l as you say is involuntary and my love as pure as it is fervent i have reason to believe that his sentiments are the same for me but of this i am not yet certain there is the danger and the only real danger for leonoras happiness for whilst this uncertainty and his consequent fits of absence and imprudence last there is hazard every moment of her being alarmed but when l once decides every thing arranges itself you know gabrielle and prudence becomes a duty to ourselves and to leonora no word or look or coquetry could then escape us we should be unpardonable if we did not conduct ourselves with the most scrupulous delicacy and attention to her feelings i am amazed that l who has really a good understanding does not make these reflections and is not determined by this calculation for his for my own but most for leonoras sake i wish that this cruel suspense were at an end adieu dear and amiable gabriellethese things are managed better in france olivia letter xl mrs c to miss b dear margaret l castle i arrived here late yesterday evening in high spirits and high hopes of surprising and delighting all the world by my unexpected appearance but my pride was checked and my tone changed the moment i saw leonora never was any human being so altered in her looks in so short a time i had just and but just presence of mind enough not to say so i am astonished that it does not strike mr l as soon as she left the room i asked him if lady leonora had been ill no perfectly well perfectly welldid not he perceive that she looked extremely ill no she might be paler than usual that was all that mr l had observed lady olivia after a pause added that leonora certainly had not appeared well lately but this was nothing extraordinary in her situation situation nonsense lady olivia went on with sentimental hypocrisy of look and tone saying fine things to which i paid little attention virtue in words and vice in actions thought i people of certain pretensions in the court of sentiment think that they can pass false virtues upon the world for real as some ladies entitled by their rank to wear jewels appear in false stones believing that it will be taken for granted they would wear nothing but diamonds not one eye in a hundred detects the difference at first but in time the hundredth eye comes and then they must for ever hide their diminished rays beware lady olivia beware leonora is ill or unhappy or both but she will not allow that she is either on one subject she is impenetrable a hundred a thousand different ways within these fourandtwenty hours have i led to it with all the ingenuity and all the delicacy of which i am mistress but all to no purpose neither by provocation persuasion laughing teazing questioning cross or round about pushing squeezing encompassing taking for granted wondering or blundering could i gain my point every look guardedevery syllable measuredyet unequivocal she said no more than just the thing she ought because i could find no fault i was half angry i respect the motive of this reserve but towards me it is misplaced and illjudged and it must not exist i have often declared that i would never condescend to play the part of a confidante to any princess or heroine upon earth but leonora is neither princess nor heroine and i would be her confidante but she will not let me now i am punished for my pride if she would only trust me if she would only tell me what has passed since i went and all that now weighs upon her mind i could certainly be of some use i could and would say every thing that she might scruple to hint to lady olivia and i will answer for it i would make her raise the siege but i cannot believe mr l to be such a madman as to think of attaching himself seriously to a woman like olivia when he has such a wife as leonora that he was amusing himself with olivia i saw or thought i saw some time ago and i rather wondered that leonora was uneasy for all husbands will flirt and all wives must bear it thought i when such a coquette as this fell in his way and made advances he would have been more than man if he had receded of course i thought he must despise and laugh at her all the time he was flattering and gallanting her ladyship this would have been fair play and comic but the comedy should have ended by this time i am now really afraid it will turn into a tragedy i even i am alarmed i must prevail upon leonora to speak to me without reserve i see her suffer and i must share her grief have not i always done so from the time we were children and now when she most wants a friend am not i worthy to share her confidence can she mistake friendship for impertinent curiosity does not she know that i would not be burthened with the secrets of any body whom i did not love if she thinks otherwise she does me injustice and i will tell her so before i sleep she does not know how well i love her my dear margaret leonora and i have had a quarrelthe first serious quarrel we ever had in our lives and the end of it is that she is an angel and i am a fool just as i laid down my pen after writing to you though it was long past midnight i marched into leonoras apartment resolved to surprise or to force her confidence i found her awake as i expected and up and dressed as i did not expect sitting in her dressingroom her head leaning upon her hand i knew what she was thinking of she had a heap of mr ls old letters beside her she denied that she was in tears and i will not swear to the tears but i think i saw signs of them notwithstanding i spoke outbut in vainall in vain at last i flew into a passion and reproached her bitterly she answered me with that air of dignified tenderness which is peculiar to herif you believe me to be unhappy my dear helen is this a time to reproach me unjustly i was brought to reason and to tears and after asking pardon like a foolish naughty child was kissed and forgiven upon a promise never to do so any more a promise which i hope heaven will grant me grace and strength of mind enough to keep i was certainly wrong to attempt to force her secret from her leonoras confidence is always given never yielded and in her openness is a virtue not a weakness but i wish she would not contrive to be always in the right in all our quarrels in all the variations of my humour i am obliged to end by doing homage to her reason as the chinese mariners in every change of weather burn incense before the needle your affectionate helen c letter xli mr l to general b my dear general l castle friday i hoped that you would have favoured us with a passing visit in your way from town but i know you will tell me that friendship must not interfere with the interests of the service i have reason to curse those interests they are for ever at variance with mine i had a particular desire to speak to you upon a subject on which it is not agreeable to me to write lady leonora also wished extremely and disinterestedly for your company she does not know how much she is obliged to you the laconic advice you gave me some time ago influenced my conduct longer than counsel which is in opposition to our passions usually does and it has haunted my imagination perpetuallymy dear l do not end by being the dupe of a frenchified coquette my dear friend of that there is no danger no man upon earth despises or detests coquettes more than i do be they french or english i think however that a foreignborn or foreignbred coquette has more of the ease of practice and less of the awkwardness of conscience than a homebred flirt and is in reality less blamable for she breaks no restraints of custom or education she does only what she has seen her mother do before her and what is authorized by the example of most of the fashionable ladies of her acquaintance but let us put flirts and coquettes quite out of the question my dear general you know that i am used to women and take it upon my word that the lady to whom i allude is more tender and passionate than vain every woman has or has had a tincture of vanity but there are a few and those are to me the most amiable of the sex who feel every vanity in fondness lost you know that i am delicate even fastidious in my taste for female manners nothing can in my opinion make amends for any offence against propriety except it be sensibilitygenuine generous sensibility this can in my mind cover a multitude of faults there is so much of selfishness of hypocrisy of coldness in what is visually called female virtue that i often turn with distaste from those to whom i am compelled to do homage for the sake of the general good of society i am not charlatan enough to pretend upon all occasions to prefer the public advantage to my own i confess that let a woman be ever so fair or good or wise be she with that goodness blest which may merit name of best if she be not such to me what care i how good she be and i will further acknowledge that i am not easily satisfied with the manner in which a woman is kind to me if it be dutywork kindness i would not give thanks for it it is done for her reputation not for me and let the world thank her to the best of wives i should make the worst of husbands noi should i hope pay her in her own coin with all due observances attentions and respect but without one grain of love love is only to be had for love and without it nothing a woman can give appears to me worth having i do not desire to be loved well enough to satisfy fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts well enough to decide a woman to marry me rather than disoblige her friends or run the chance of having many a worse offer and living perhaps to be an old maid i do not desire to be loved well enough to keep a woman true and faithful to me till death us do part in short i do not desire to be loved well enough for a husband i desire to be loved sufficiently for a lover not only above all other persons but above all other things all other considerationsto be the first and last object in the heart of the woman to whom i am attached i wish to feel that i sustain and fill the whole of her heart i must be certain that i am every thing to her as she is every thing to me that there is no imaginable situation in which she would not live with me in which she would not be happy to live with me no possible sacrifice that she would not make for me or rather that nothing she could do should appear a sacrifice are these exorbitant expectations i am capable of all this and more for a woman i love and it is my pride or my misfortune to be able to love upon no other terms such proofs of attachment it may be difficult to obtain and even to give more difficult i am sensible for a wife than for a mistress a young lady who is married secundum artem with licence and consent of friends can give no extraordinary instances of affection i should not consider it as an indisputable proof of love that she does me the honour to give me her hand in a church or that she condescends to bespeak my liveries or to be handed into her own coach with all the blushing honours of a bride all the paraphernalia of a wife secured all the prudent and necessary provision made both for matrimonial love and hatred dower pinmoney and separate maintenance on the one hand and on the other lands tenements and hereditaments for the future son and heir and sums without end for younger children to the tenth and twentieth possibility as the case may be nothing herein contained to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding such a jargon cupid does not understand a woman may love this most convenient personage her lawful husband but i should think it difficult for the delicacy of female passion to survive the cool preparations for hymeneal felicity at all events you will allow the lady makes no sacrifice she shows no great generosity and she may or she may not be touched at the altar by the divine flame my good general when you are a husband you will feel these things as i do till then it is very easy to talk as you do and to admire other mens wives and to wish heaven had blessed you with such a treasure for my part the single idea that a woman thinks it her duty to be fond of me would deprive me of all pleasure in her love no man can be more sensible than i am of the amiable and estimable qualities of lady leonora l i should be a brute and a liar if i hesitated to give the fullest testimony in her praise but such is the infirmity of my nature that i could pardon some faults more easily than i could like some virtues the virtues which leave me in doubt of a womans love i can esteem but that is all lady leonora is calm serene perfectly sweettempered without jealousy and without suspicion in one word without love if she loved me she never could have been the wife she has been for some months past you will laugh at my being angry with a wife for not being jealous but so it is certain defects of temper i could bear if i considered them as symptoms of strong affection when i for a moment believed that leonora suffered when i attributed her fainting at our fete champetre to jealousy i was so much alarmed and touched that i absolutely forgot her rival i did more to prevent her feeling uneasiness to destroy the suspicions which i imagined had been awakened in her mind i hesitated not to sacrifice all the pleasure and all the vanity which a man of my age might reasonably be supposed to feel in the prospect of a new and not inglorious conquest i left home immediately and went to meet you my dear friend on your return from abroad this visit i do not set down to your account but to that of honourfoolish unnecessary honour you halfpersuaded me that your hearsay parisian evidence was more to be trusted than my own judgment and i returned home with the resolution not to be the dupe of a coquette leonoras reception of me was delightful i never saw her in such spirits or so amiable but i could not help wishing to ascertain whether i had attributed her fainting to the real cause this proof i tempted to my cost instead of showing any tender alarm at the renewal of my obvious attentions to her rival she was perfectly calm and collected went on with her usual occupations fulfilled all her duties never reproached me by word or look never for one moment betrayed impatience illhumour suspicion or jealousy in short i found that i had been fool enough to attribute to excess of affection an accident which proceeded merely from the situation of her health if anxiety of mind had been the cause of her fainting at the fete champetre she would since have felt and shown agitation on a thousand occasions where she has been perfectly tranquil her friend mrs c who returned here a few days ago seems to imagine that leonora looks ill but i shall not again be led to mistake bodily indisposition for mental suffering leonoras conduct argues great insensibility of soul or great command great insensibility i think for i cannot imagine such command of temper possible to any but a woman who feels indifference for the offender yet even now that i have steeled myself with this conviction i am scarcely bold enough to hazard the chance of giving her pain absurd weakness it has been clearly proved to my understanding that my irresolution my scruples of conscience my combats between love and esteem are more likely to betray the real state of my mind than any decision that i could make i decide theni determine to be happy with a woman who has a soul capable of feeling not merely what is called conjugal affection but the passion of love who is capable of sacrificing every thing to love who has given me proofs of candour and greatness of mind which i value far above all her wit grace and beauty my dear general i know all that you can tell all that you can hint concerning her history abroad i know it from her own lips it was told to me in a manner that made her my admiration it was told to me as a preservative against the danger of loving her it was told to me with the generous design of protecting leonoras happiness and all this at the moment when i was beloved tenderly beloved she is above dissimulation she scorns the arts the fears of her sex she knows you are her enemy and yet she esteems you she urged me to speak to you with the utmost openness let me never said she be the cause of your feeling less confidence or less affection for the best of friends r is sacrificed to me that r with whose cursed name you tormented me my dear friend she will force your admiration as she has won my love yours sincerely f l letter xlii mrs c to miss b l castle as i am not trusted with the secret i may my dear margaret use my own eyes and ears as i please to find it out and i know leonoras countenance so well that i see every thing that passes in her mind just as clearly as if she had told it to me in words it grieves me more than i can express to see her suffering as she does i am now convinced that she has reason to be unhappy and what is worse i do not see what course she can follow to recover her happiness all her forbearance all her patience all her sweet temper i perceive are useless or worse than useless injurious to her in her strange husbands opinion i never liked him thoroughly and now i detest him he thinks her cold insensible she insensiblebrute idiot every thing that she says or does displeases him the merest trifles excite the most cruel suspicions he totally misunderstands her character and sees every thing about her in a false light in short he is under the dominion of an artful fiend who works as she pleases upon his passionsupon his pride which is his ruling passion this evening lady olivia began confessing that she had too much sensibility that she was of an excessively susceptible temper and that she should be terribly jealous of the affections of any person she loved she did not know how love could exist without jealousy mr l was present and listening eagerly leonoras lips were silent not so her countenance i was in hopes mr l would have remarked its beautiful touching expression but his eyes were fixed upon olivia i could have but let me go on lady olivia had the malice suddenly to appeal to leonora and asked whether she was never jealous of her husband leonora astonished by her assurance paused for an instant and then replied it would be difficult to convince me that i had any reason to be jealous of mr l i esteem him so muchi wish to heaven exclaimed lady olivia her eyes turned upwards with a fine st cecilia expression whilst mr ls attention was fixed upon her would to heaven i was blessed with such a reasonable temperwhen you are wishing to heaven lady olivia said i had not you better ask for all you want at once not only such a reasonable temper but such a feeling heart some of the company smiled lady olivia practised as she is looked disconcerted mr l grave and impenetrable leonora blushing turned away to the pianoforte mr l remained talking with lady olivia and he neither saw nor heard her if leonora had sung like an angel it would have made no impression she turned over the leaves of her music quickly to a lively air and played it immediately to prevent my perceiving how much she felt poor leonora you are but a bad dissembler and it is in vain to try to conceal yourself from me i was so sorry for her and so incensed with olivia this night that i could not restrain myself and i made matters worse at supper i came almost to open war with her ladyship i cannot remember exactly what i said but i know that i threw out the most severe inuendoes which politeness could permit and what was the consequence mr l pitied olivia and hated me leonora was in misery the whole time and her husband probably thought that she was the instigator though she was perfectly innocent my dear margaret where will all this end and how much more mischief shall i do with the best intentions possible yours affectionately helen c letter xliii general b to mr l your letter has travelled after me god knows where my dear l and has caught me at last with my foot in the stirrup i have just had time to look it over i find in short that you are in love i give you joy but be in love like a madman not like a fool call a demirep an angel and welcome but remember that such angels are to be had any day in the year and such a wife as yours is not to be had for the mines of golconda coin your heart and drop your blood for it and you will never be loved by any other woman so well as you are by lady leonora l as to your jealous hypochondriacism more of that when i have more leisure in the mean time i wish it well cured i am my dear friend yours truly j b letter xliv olivia to madame de p l castle i triumph dear gabrielle give me joy never was triumph more complete l loves me that i knew long ago but i have at last forced from his proud heart the avowal of his passion love and olivia are victorious over scruples prejudice pride and superstition leonora feels notsees not she requires she excites no pity long may her delusion last but even were it this moment to dissipate what cause have i for remorse who is most to blame he who ceases to love or she who ceases to please leonora perhaps thinks that she loves her husband and no doubt she does so in a conjugal sort of a way he has loved his wife but be it mine to prove that his heart is suited to far other raptures and if olivia be called upon for sacrifices olivia can make them let wealth let honour wait the wedded dame august her deed and sacred be her fame before true passion all those views remove fame wealth and honour what are you to love these lines though quoted perpetually by the tender and passionate can never become stale and vulgar they will always recur in certain situations to persons of delicate sensibility for they at once express all that can be said and justify all that can be felt my amiable gabrielle adieu pardon me if today i have no soul even for friendship this day is all for love olivia letter xlv general b to mr l what the devil would you have of your wife my dear l you would be loved above all earthly considerations honour duty virtue and religion inclusive would you and you would have a wife with her head in the clouds would you i wish you were married to one of the allforlove heroines who would treat you with bowl and dagger every day of your life in your opinion sensibility covers a multitude of faultsyou would have said sins so it had need for it produces a multitude pray what brings hundreds and thousands of women to the piazzas of covent garden but sensibility what does the colonels and the captains and the ensigns mistress talk of but sensibility and are you my dear friend to be duped by this hackneyed word and should you really think it an indisputable proof of a ladys love that she would jump out of a two pair of stairs window into your arms now i should think myself sure of such a womans love only just whilst i held her and scarcely then for i who in my own way am jealous as well as yourself should in this case be jealous of wickedness and should strongly suspect that she would love the first devil that she saw better than me you are always raving about sacrifices your cupid must be a very vindictive little god mine is a goodhumoured rosy little fellow who desires no better than to see me laugh and be happy but to every man his own cupid if you cannot believe in love without sacrifices you must have them to be sure and now in sober sadness what do you think your heroine would sacrifice for you her reputation that pardon me is out of her power her virtue i have no doubt she would but before i can estimate the value of this sacrifice i must know whether she makes it to you or to her pleasure would she give up in any instance her pleasure for your happiness this is not an easy matter to ascertain with respect to a mistress but your wife has put it beyond a doubt that she prefers your happiness not only to her pleasure but to her pride and to every thing that the sex usually prefer to a husband you have been wounded by a poisoned arrow but you have a faithful wife who can extract the poison lady leonoras affection is not a mere fit of goodness and generosity such as i have seen in many women but it is a steadiness of attachment in the hour of trial which i have seen in few for several months past you have by your own account put her temper and her love to the most severe tests yet she has never failed for one moment never reproached you by word or lookbut may be she has no feelingno feeling you can have none if you say so no penetration if you think so would not you think me a tyrant if i put a poor fellow on the picket and told you when he bore it without a groan that it was because he could not feel you do worse you torture the soul of the woman who loves you she endures she is calm she smiles upon you even in agony and you tell me she cannot feel she cannot feel like an olivia no and so much the better for her husband for she will then have only feeling enough for him she will not extend her charity to all his sex but olivia has such candour and magnanimity that i must admire her i humbly thank her for offering to make me her confidant for offering to tell me what i know already and what she is certain that i know these were good moves but i understand the game as well as her ladyship does as to her making a friend of me if she means an enemy to lady leonora l i would sooner see herin heaven but if she would do me the favour to think no more of your heart which is too good for her and to accept of mymywhat shall i saymy devoirs i am at her command she shall drive my curricle c c she would suit me vastly well for a month or two and by that time poor r would make his appearance or somebody in his stead at the worst i should have a chance of some blessed metaphysical quirk which would prove that inconstancy was a virtue or that a new love is better than an old one when it came to that i should make my best bow put on my most disconsolate face and retire you will read all this in a very different spirit from that in which it is written if you are angryno matter i am cool i tell you beforehand that i will not fight you for any thing i have said in this letter or that i ever may say about your olivia therefore my dear l save yourself the trouble of challenging me i thank god i have reputation enough to be able to dispense with the glory of blowing out your brains yours truly j b letter xlvi olivia to madame de p we have been very gay here the last few days the gallant and accomplished prince has been here h the witty h who is his favourite companion introduced him and he seems so much charmed with the old castle its towers and battlements and with its cynosure that i know not when he will be able to prevail upon himself to depart tomorrow he says but so he has said these ten days he cannot resist the entreaties of his kind host and hostess to stay another day the soft accent of the beautiful leonora will certainly detain him one day more and her gracious smile will bereave him of rest for months to come he has evidently fallen desperately in love with her now we shall see virtue in danger i have always been of opinion with st evremond and ninon de lenclos that no female virtue can stand every species of test fortunately it is not always exposed to trial reputation may be preserved by certain persons in certain situations upon very easy terms leonora for instance is armed so strong in character that no common mortal will venture to attack her it would be presumption little short of high treason to imagine the fall of the lady leonora l the daughter of the duchess of who with a long line of immaculate baronesses in their own right each in her armour of stiff stays stands frowning defiance upon the adventurous knights more alarming still to the modern seducer appears a judge in his long wig and a jury with their long faces ready to bring in their verdict and to award damages proportionate to the rank and fortune of the parties then the former reputation of the lady is talked of and the irreparable injury sustained by the disconsolate husband from the loss of the solace and affection of this paragon of wives and it is proved that she lived in the most perfect harmony with him till the vile seducer appeared who in aggravation of damages was a confidential friend of the husbands c c c c c brave indeed and desperately in love must be the man who could dare all these to deserve the fair but princes are it is said naturally brave and ambitious of conquering difficulties i have insinuated these reflections in a general way to l who applies them so as to plague himself sufficiently heaven is my witness that i mean no injury to lady leonora yet i fear that there are moments when my respect for her superiority joined to the consciousness of my own weakness overpowers me and i almost envy her the right she retains to the esteem of the man i love this is a blamable weaknessi know iti reproach myself bitterly but all i can do is to confess it candidly l sees my conflicts and knows how to value the sensibility of my fond heart adieu my gabrielle when shall i be happy since even love has its torments and i am thus doomed to be ever a victim to the tenderness of my soul olivia letter xlvii mrs c to miss b i do not know whether i pity love or admire leonora most just when her mind was deeply wounded by her husbands neglect and when her jealousy was worked to the highest pitch by his passion for her dangerous rival the prince arrives here and struck by leonoras charms of mind and person falls passionately in love with her probably his highnesss friend h had given him a hint of the existing circumstances and he thought a more propitious moment could scarcely be found for making an impression upon a female mind he judged of leonora by other women and i like a simpleton judged of her by myself with shame i confess to you my dear margaret that notwithstanding all my past experience i did expect that she would have done as i am afraid i should have done in her situation i think that i could not have resisted the temptation of coquetting a littlea very littlejust to revive the passion of the man whom i really loved this expedient succeeds so often with that wise sex who never rightly know the value of a heart except when they have just won it or at the moment when they are on the point of losing it in leonoras place and in such an emergency i should certainly have employed that frightful monster jealousy to waken sleeping love since he and only he can do it expeditiously and effectually this i have hinted to leonora talking always in generals for since my total overthrow i have never dared to come to particulars but by putting cases and confessing myself i contrived to make my thoughts understood i then boasted of the extreme facility of the means i would adopt to recover a heart leonora answered in the words of a celebrated great mancest facile de se servir de pareils moyens cest difficile de sy resoudre but if no other means would succeed said i would not you sacrifice your pride to your love my pride willingly but not my sense of what is right said she with an indescribable mixture of tenderness and firmness in her manner can a little coquetry in a good cause be such a heinous offence persisted i i knew that i was wrong all the time but i delighted in seeing how right she was noshe would not allow her mind to be cheated by female sophistry nor yet by the male casuistry of the end sanctifies the means if you had the misfortune to lose the affections of the man you love and if you were quite certain of regaining them by following my recipe said i never shall i forget the look with which leonora left me and the accent with which she said my dear helen if it were ever to be my misfortune to lose my husbands love i would not even if i were certain of success attempt to regain it by any unworthy arts how could i wish to regain his love at the hazard of losing his esteem and the certainty of forfeiting my own i said no morei had nothing more to say i saw that i had given pain and i have never touched upon the subject since but her practice is even beyond her theory never by deed or look or word or thought for i see all her thoughts in her eloquent countenance has she swerved from her principles no pruderyno coquetryno mockhumilityno triumph never for an instant did she by a proud air say to her husbandsee what others think of me never did a resentful look say to himinconstantrevenge is in my power never even did a reproachful sigh expressi am injured yet i do not retaliate mr lis blind he is infatuated he is absolutely bereaved of judgment by a perfidious ungrateful and cruel wretch let me vent my indignation to you dear margaret or it will explode perhaps when it may do leonora mischief yours affectionately helen c letter xlviii olivia to madame de f l castle this lady leonora in her simplicity never dreamed of love till the princes passion was too visible and audible to be misunderstood and then she changed her tone and checked her simplicity and was so reserved and so dignified and so proper it was quite edifying especially to a poor sinner of a coquette like me nothing piquante nothing agacante nothing demivoilee no retiring to be pursued not a single manoeuvre of coquetry did she practise this convinces me that she cares not in the least for her husband because if she really loved him and wished to reclaim his heart what so natural or so simple as to excite his jealousy and thus revive his love after neglecting this golden opportunity she can never convince me that she is really anxious about her husbands heart this i hinted to l and his own susceptibility had hinted it to him efficaciously before i spoke though leonora has been so correct hitherto and so cold to the prince in her husbands presence i have my suspicions that if in his absence proper means were taken if her pride were roused by apt suggestions if it were delicately pointed out to her that she is shamefully neglected that she is a cipher in her own house that her husband presumes too much upon her sweetness of temper that his inconstancy is wondered at by all who have eyes and that a little retaliation might become her ladyship i would not answer for her forbearance that is to say if all this were done by a dexterous man a lover and a prince i shall take care my opinions shall be known for i cannot endure to have the esteem of the man i love monopolized exposed to temptation as i have been and with as ardent affections leonora or i am much mistaken would not have been more estimable adieu my dearest gabrielle nous verrons nous verrons olivia sunday evening ps i open my letter to tell you that the prince is actually gone doubtless he will return at a more auspicious moment lady m and all the troop of friends are to depart on monday all but the bosom friend lamie intime that insupportable helen who is ever at daggersdrawing with me so much the better l sees her cabals with his wife she is a partisan without the art to be so to any purpose and her manoeuvres tend only to increase his partiality for his olivia letter xlix olivia to madame de p l castle in short leonora has discovered all that she might have seen months ago between her husband and me what will be the consequence i long yet almost fear to meet her again she is now in her own apartment writing i presume to her mother for advice letter l leonora to olivia left on lady olivias dressingtable o you whom no kindness can touch whom no honour can bind whom no faith can hold enjoy the torments you have inflicted on me enjoy the triumph of having betrayed a confiding friend friend no moreaffect presume no longer to call me friend i am under no necessity to dissemble and dissimulation is foreign to my habits and abhorrent to my nature i know you to be my enemy and i say somy most cruel enemy one who could without reluctance or temptation rob me of all i hold most dear yes without temptation for you do not love my husband olivia on this point i cannot be mistaken i know too well what it is to love him had you been struck by his great or good and amiable qualities charmed by his engaging manners or seduced by the violence of his passion and had i seen you honourably endeavour to repress that passion had i seen in you the slightest disposition to sacrifice your pleasure or your vanity to friendship or to duty i think i could have forgiven i am sure i should have pitied you but you felt no pity for me no shame for yourself you made no attempt to avoid you invited the danger mr l was not the deceiver but the deceived by every art and every charm in your powerand you have manyyou won upon his senses and worked upon his imagination you saw and made it your pride to conquer the scruples of that affection he once felt for his wife and that wife was your friend by passing bounds which he could not conceive that any woman could pass except in the delirium of passion you made him believe that your love for him exceeds all that i feel how he will find himself deceived if you had loved him as i do you could not so easily have forfeited all claim to his esteem had you loved him so much you would have loved honour more it is possible that mr l may taste some pleasure with you whilst his delusion lasts whilst his imagination paints you as mine once did in false colours possessed of generous virtues and the victim of excessive sensibility but when he sees you such as you are he will recoil from you with aversion he will reject you with contempt knowing my opinion of you lady olivia you will not choose to remain in this house nor can i desire for my guest one whom i can no longer in private or in public make my companion adieu leonora l letter li olivia to mr l l castle midnight farewell for everit must be sofarewell for ever would to heaven i had summoned courage sooner to pronounce these fatal necessary irrevocable words then had i parted from you without remorse without the obloquy to which i am now exposed oh my dearest l mine do i still dare to call you yes mine for the last time i must call you mine i must fancy you though for the impious thought the furies themselves were to haunt me to madness my dearest l never more must we meet in this world think not that my weak voice alone forbids it no a stronger voice than mine is heardan injured wife reclaims you what a letter have i just receivedfromleonora she tells me that she no longer desires for her guest one whom she cannot in public or private make her companionoh leonora it was sufficient to banish me from your heart she tells me not only that i have for ever forfeited her confidence her esteem her affection but that i shall soon be your aversion and contempt oh cruel cruel words but i submiti have deserved it alli have robbed her of a heart above all price leonora why did you not reproach me more bitterly i desire i implore to be crushed to be annihilated by your vengeance most admirable most virtuous most estimable of women best of wives i have with sacrilegious love profaned a soul consecrated to you and conjugal virtue i acknowledge my crime trample upon me as you will i am humbled in the dust more than all your bitterest reproaches do i feel the remorse of having for a moment interrupted such serenity of happiness oh why did you persuade me l and why did i believe that leonora was calm and free from all suspicion how could i believe that any woman whom you had ever loved could remain blind to your inconstancy or feel secure indifference happy woman in you to love is not a crime you may glory in your passion whilst i must hide mine from every human eye drop in shameful secrecy the burning tear stifle the struggling sigh blush at the conflicts of virtue and sensibility and carry shame and remorse with me to the grave happy leonora happy even when most injured you have a right to complain to him you lovehe is yoursyou are his wifehis esteem his affection are yours on olivia he has bestowed but a transient thought and eternal ignominy must be her portion so let it beso i wish it to be would to heaven i may thus atone for the past and secure your future felicity fly to her my dearest l i conjure you throw yourself at her feet entreat implore obtain her forgiveness she cannot refuse it to your tears to your caresses to withstand them she must be more or less than woman no she cannot resist your voice when it speaks words of peace and love she will press you with transport to her heart and olivia poor olivia will be for ever forgotten yet she will rejoice in your felicity absolved perhaps in the eye of heaven though banished from your society she will die content full well am i aware of the consequences of quitting thus precipitately the house of lady leonora l but nothing that concerns myself alone can for a moment make me hesitate to do that which the sentiment of virtue dictates and which is yet more strongly urged by regard for the happiness of one who once allowed me to call her friend i know my reputation is irrecoverably sacrificed but it is to one for whom i would lay down my life can a woman who feels as i do deem any earthly good a sacrifice for him she loves dear l adieu for ever olivia letter lii leonora to the duchess of dearest mother it is all overmy husband is gonegone perhaps for everall is in vainall is lost without saying more to you than i ought i may tell you that in consequence of an indignant letter which i wrote last night to lady olivia she left my house this morning early before any of the family were up mr l heard of her departure before i did he has i will not say followed her for of that i am not certain but he has quitted home and without giving me one kind look at parting without even noticing a letter which i left last night upon his table at what slight things we catch to save us from despair how obstinate how vain is hope i fondly hoped even to the last moment that this letter this foolish letter would work a sudden change in my husbands heart would operate miracles would restore me to happiness i fancied absurdly fancied that laying open my whole soul to him would have an effect upon his mind alas has not my whole soul been always open to him could this letter tell him any thing but what he knows already or what he will never knowhow well i love him i was weak to expect so much from it yet as it expressed without complaint the anguish of disappointed affection it deserved at least some acknowledgment could not he have said my dear leonora i thank you for your letteror more colder stillleonora i have received your letter even that would have been some relief to me but now all is despair i saw him just when he was going away but for a moment till the last instant he was not to be seen then in spite of all his command of countenance i discerned strong marks of agitation but towards me an air of resentment more than any disposition to kinder thoughts i fancy that he scarcely knew what he said nor i am sure did i he talked i remember of having immediate business in town and i endeavoured to believe him contrary to his usual composed manner he was in such haste to be gone that i was obliged to send his watch and purse after him which he had left on his dressingtable how melancholy his room looked to me his clothes just as he had left thema rose which lady olivia gave him yesterday was in water on his table my letter was not there so he has it probably unread he will read it some time or other perhapsand some time or other perhaps when i am dead and gone he will believe i loved him could he have known what i felt at the moment when he turned from me he would have pitied me for his nature his character cannot be quite altered in a few months though he has ceased to love leonora from the window of his own room i watched for the last glimpse of himheard him call to the postilions and bid them drive fastfaster this was the last sound i heard of his voice when shall i hear that voice again i think that i shall certainly hear from him the day after tomorrowand i wish today and tomorrow were gone i am afraid that you will think me very weak but my dear mother i have no motive for fortitude now and perhaps it might have been better for me if i had not exerted so much i begin to fear that all my fortitude is mistaken for indifference something mr l said the other day about sensibility and sacrifices gave me this idea sensibilityit has been my hard task for some months past to repress mine that it might not give pain or disgust i have done all that my reason and my dearest mother counselled surely i cannot have done wrong how apt we are to mistake the opinion or the taste of the man we love for the rule of right sacrifices what sacrifices can i makeall that i have is it not hismy whole heart is it not his myself all that i am all that i can be have i not lived with him of late without recalling to his mind the idea that i suffer by his neglect have i not left his heart at liberty and can i make a greater sacrifice i really do not understand what he means by sacrifices a woman who loves her husband is part of him whatever she does for him is for herself i wish he would explain to me what he can mean by sacrificesbut when will he ever again explain his thoughts and feelings to me my dearest mother it has been a relief to my mind to write all this to you if there is no sense in it you will forgive and encourage me by your affection and strength of mind which in all situations have such power to soothe and support your daughter the prince who spent a fortnight here paid me particular attention the prince talked of soon paying us another visit if he should i will not receive him in mr ls absence this may seem like vanity or prudery but no matter what it appears if it be right well might you my best friend bid me beware of forming an intimacy with an unprincipled woman i have suffered severely for neglecting your counsels how much i have still to endure is yet to be tried but i can never be entirely miserable whilst i possess and whilst i hope that i deserve the affection of such a mother leonora l letter liii the duchess of to her daughter if my approbation and affection can sustain you in this trying situation your fortitude will not forsake you my beloved daughter great minds rise in adversity they are always equal to the trial and superior to injustice betrayed and deserted they feel their own force and they rely upon themselves be yourself my leonora persevere as you have begun and trust me you will be happy i abide by my first opinion i repeat my prophecyyour husbands esteem affection love will be permanently yours change of circumstances however alarming cannot shake the fixed judgment of my understanding character as you justly observe cannot utterly change in a few months your husband is deceived he is now as one in the delirium of a fever he will recover his senses and see lady olivia and you such as you are you do not explain and i take it for granted you have good reasons for not explaining to me more fully the immediate cause of your letter to lady olivia i am sorry that any cause should have thrown her upon the protection of mr l for a man of honour and generosity feels himself bound to treat with tenderness a woman who appears to sacrifice every thing for his sake consider this in another point of view and it will afford you subject of consolation for it is always a consolation to good minds to think those whom they love less to blame than they appear to be you will be more calm and patient when you reflect that your husbands absence may be prolonged by a mistaken sense of honour from the nature of his connexion with lady olivia it cannot last long had she saved appearances and engaged him in a sentimental affair it might have been far more dangerous to your happiness i entirely approve of your conduct with respect to the prince it is worthy of my child and just what i should have expected from her the artifices of coquettes and all the art of love is beneath her she has far other powers and resources and need not strive to maintain her dignity by vengeance i admire your magnanimity and i still more admire your good sense for high spirit is more common in our sex than good sense few know how and when they should sacrifice small considerations to great ones you say that you will not receive the prince in your husbands absence though this may be attributed to prudery or vanity c c you are quite right how many silly women sacrifice the happiness of their lives to the idea of what women or men as silly as themselves will say or think of their motives how many absurd heroines of romance and of those who imitate them in real life do we see who can never act with common sense or presence of mind if a mans carriage breaks down or his horse is tired at the end of their avenues or for some such ridiculous reason they must do the very reverse of all they know to be prudent perpetually exposed by a fatal concurrence of circumstances to excite the jealousy of their lovers and husbands they create the necessity to which they fall a victim i rejoice that i cannot feel any apprehension of my daughters conducting herself like one of these novelbred ladies i am sorry my dear that lady m and your friends have left you yet even in this there may be good your affairs will be made less public and you will be less the subject of impertinent curiosity i advise you however to mix as much as usual with your neighbours in the country your presence and the dignity of your manners will impose silence upon idle tongues no wife of real spirit solicits the world for compassion she who does not court popularity ensures respect adieu my dearest child the time will come when your husband will feel the full merit of your fortitude when he will know how to distinguish between true and false sensibility between the love of an olivia and of a leonora letter liv mrs c to miss b jan my dear margaret i shall never forgive myself i fear i have done leonora irreparable injury and dear magnanimous sufferer she has never reproached me in a fit of indignation and imprudent zeal i made a discovery which has produced a total breach between leonora and lady olivia and in consequence of this mr l has gone off with her ladyship we have heard nothing from mr l since his departure and leonora is more unhappy than ever and my imprudence is the cause of this yet she continues to love me she is an angel i have promised her not to mention her affairs in future even in any of my letters to you dear margaret pray quiet any reports you may hear and stop idle tongues yours affectionately helen c letter lv mr l to general b richmond my dear friend i do not think i could have borne with temper from any other man breathing the last letter which i received from you i am sensible that it was written with the best intentions for my happiness but i must now inform you that the lady in question has accepted of my protection and consequently no man who esteems me can treat her with disrespect it is no longer a question what she will sacrifice for me she has shown the greatest generosity and tenderness of soul and i should despise myself if i did not exert every power to make her happywe are at richmond but if you write direct to me at my house in town yours sincerely f l letter lvi general b to mr l dream your dream out my dear l since you are angry with me as solander was with sir joseph banks for awakening him i shall not take the liberty of shaking you any more i believe i shook you rather too roughly but i assure you it was for your good as people always tell their friends when they do the most disagreeable things imaginable forgive me and i will let you dream in peace you will however allow me to watch by you whilst you sleep and my dear somnambulist i may just take care that you do not knock your head against a post or fall into a well i hope you will not have any objection to my paying my respects to lady olivia when i come to town which i flatter myself i shall be able to do shortly the fortifications here are almost completed yours truly j b letter lvii olivia to madame de p richmond happyno my dear gabrielle nor shall i ever be happy whilst i have not exclusive possession of the heart of the man i love i have sacrificed every thing to him i have a right to expect that he should sacrifice at least a wife for mea wife whom he only esteems but l has not sufficient strength of mind to liberate himself from the cobwebs which restrain those who talk of conscience and who in fact are only superstitious i see with indignation that his soul is continually struggling between passion for me and a something i know not what to call it that he feels for this wife his thoughts are turning towards home i believe that to an englishmans ears there is some magic in the words home and wife i used to think foreigners ridiculous for associating the ideas of milord anglois with roast beef and pudding but i begin to see that they are quite right and that an englishman has a certain set of inveterate homely prejudices which are necessary to his wellbeing and almost to his existence you may entice him into the land of sentiment and for a time keep him there but refine and polish and enlighten him as you will he recurs to his own plain sense as he terms it on the first convenient opportunity in short it is lost labour to civilize him for sooner or later he will hottentot again pray introduce that term gabrielleyou can translate it for my part i can introduce nothing here my maniere detre is really insupportable my talents are lost i who am accustomed to shine in society see nobody i might as josephine every day observes as well be buried alive retirement and love are charming but then it must be perfect lovenot the equivocating sort that l feels for me which keeps the word of promise only to the ear i bear every sort of desagrement for him i make myself a figure for the finger of scorn to point at and he insults me with esteem for a wife can you conceive this my amiable gabrielleno there are ridiculous points in the characters of my countrymen which you will never be able to comprehend and what is still more incomprehensible it is my fate to love this man yes passionately to love himbut he must give me proof of reciprocal passion i have too much spirit to sacrifice every thing for him who will sacrifice nothing for me besides i have another motive to you my faithful gabrielle i open my whole heartpride inspires me as well as love i am resolved that leonora the haughty leonora shall live to repent of having insulted and exasperated olivia in some situations contempt can be answered only by vengeance and when the malice of a contracted and illiberal mind provokes it revenge is virtue leonora has called me her enemy and consequently has made me such tis she has declared the war tis for me to decide the victory l i know has the offer of an embassy to petersburghe shall accept iti will accompany him thither lady leonora may in his absence console herself with her august counsellor and motherthat proudest of earthly paragons is yet to be taught the extent of olivias power adieu my charming gabrielle i will carry your tenderest remembrances to our brilliant russian princess she has often invited me you know to pay her a visit and this will be the ostensible object of my journey a horrible journey to be surebut what will not love undertake and accomplish especially when goaded by pride and inspirited by great revenge olivia letter lviii olivia to mr l victim to the delusions of passion too well i know my danger and now even now foresee my miserable fate too well i know that the delicious poison which spreads through my frame exalts entrances but to destroy too well i know that the meteor fire which shines so bright on my path entices me forward but to plunge me in the depths of infamy the long warnings of recorded time teach me that perjured man triumphs disdains and abandons too well alas i know these fatal truths too well i feel my approaching doom yet infatuated as i am prescience avails not the voice of prudence warns the hand of heaven beckons me in vain my friend my more than friend my lover beloved beyond expression you to whom i immolate myself you for whom i sacrifice more than life oh whisper words of peace for you and you alone can tranquillize this agitated bosom assure me l if with truth you can assure me that i have no rival in your affections oh tell me that the name of wife does not invalidate the claims of love repeat for me a thousand times repeat that i am sole possessor of your heart the moment you quit me i am overpowered with melancholy forebodings scarcely are you out of my sight before i dread that i shall never see you more or that some fatality should deprive me of your love when shall the sails of love waft us from this dangerous shore oh when shall i dare to call you mine heavens how many things may intervene let nothing detain you from richmond this evening but come not at allcome no more unless to reassure my trembling heart and to convince me that love and olivia have banished every other image olivia letter lix mr l to general b my dear general i am come to a resolution to accept of that embassy to russia which i lately refused my mind has been in such constant anxiety for some time past that my health has suffered and change of air and place are necessary to me you will say that the climate of russia is a strange choice for an invalid i could indeed have wished for a milder but in this world we must be content with the least of two evils i wish to have some ostensible reason for going abroad and this embassy is the only one that presents itself in an unquestionable shape any thing is better than staying where i am and as i am my motives are not so entirely personal and selfish as i have stated them a man who has a grain of feeling cannot endure to see the woman whom he loves whose only failing is her love living in a state of dereliction exposed to the silent scorn of her equals and inferiors if not to open insult all her fine talents every advantage of nature and education sacrificed and her sensibility to shame a perpetual source of misery a man must be a brute if he do not feel for a woman whose affection for him has reduced her to this situation my delicacy as to female manners and the high value i set upon public opinion in all that concerns the sex make me peculiarly susceptible and wretched in my present circumstances to raise the drooping spirits and support the selfapprobation of a woman who is conscious that she has forfeited her claim to respectto make love supply the place of all she has sacrificed to love is a difficult and exquisitely painful task my feelings render hers more acute and the very precautions which i take however delicate alarm and wound her pride by reminding her of all she wishes to forget in this country no woman who is not lost to shame can bear to live without reputationi pass over a great many intermediate ideas my dear general your sense and feeling will supply them you see the expediency the necessity of my accepting this embassy olivia urges how can i refuse it she wishes to accompany me she made this offer with such decision of spirit with such passionate tenderness as touched me to the very soul a woman who really loves absolutely devotes herself and becomes insensible to every difficulty and danger to her all parts of the world are alike all she fears is to be separated from the object of her affections but the very excess of certain passions proves them to be genuine even whilst we blame the rashness of those who act from the enthusiasm of their natures whilst we foresee all the perils to which they seem blind we tremble at their danger we grow more and more interested for them every moment we admire their courage we long to snatch them from their fate we are irresistibly hurried along with them down the precipice but why do i say all this to you my dear general to no man upon earth could it be more ineffectually addressed let me see you however before we leave england it would be painful to me to quit this country without taking leave of you notwithstanding all that you have lately done to thwart my inclinations and notwithstanding all i may expect you to say when we meet probably i shall be detained here some weeks as i must wait for instructions from our court i write this day to lady leonora to inform her that i am appointed ambassador to russia she shall have all the honours of war she shall be treated with all the respect to which she is so well entitled i suppose she will wish to reside with her mother during my absence she cannot do better she will then be in the most eligible situation and i shall be relieved from all anxiety upon her account she will be perfectly happy with her mother i have often thought that she was much happier before she married me than she has been since our union i have some curiosity to know whether she will see the prince when i am gone do not mistake me i am not jealous i have too little love and too much esteem for leonora to feel the slightest jealousy i have no doubt that if i were to stay in russia for ten years and if all the princes and potentates in europe were to be at her feet my wife would conduct herself with the most edifying propriety but i am a little curious to know how far vanity or pride can console a virtuous woman for the absence of love yours truly f l letter lx madame de p to olivia paris you are really decided then to go to russia my amiable friend and you will absolutely undertake this horrible voyage and you are not intimidated by the idea of the immense distance between petersburg and paris alas i had hoped soon to see you again the journey from my convent to paris was the longest and most formidable that i ever undertook and at this moment it appears to me terrible you may conceive therefore my admiration of your courage and strength of mind my dear olivia who are going to brave the ocean turning your back on paris and every moment receding from our polished centre of attraction to perish perhaps among mountains of ice mon dieu it makes me shudder to think of it but if it please heaven that you should once arrive at petersburg you will crown your tresses with diamonds you will envelope yourself with those superb furs of the north and smiling at all the dangers you have passed you will be yourself a thousand times more dangerous than they you who have lived so long at paris who speak our language in all its shades of elegance you who have divined all our secrets of pleasing who have caught our very air et la grace encore plus belle que la beaute you who are absolutely a french woman and a parisian what a sensation you will produce at petersburgquels succes vous attendentquels hommages you will have the goodness to offer my tenderest sentiments and the assurances of my perfect respect to our dear princess you will also find the proper moment to remind her of the promise she made to send me specimens of the fine ermines and sables of her country for my part i used to be i confess in a great error with respect to furs i always acknowledged them to be rich but avoided them as heavy i considered them as fitter for the stiff magnificence of an empress of all the russias than for the light elegance of a parisian beauty but our charming princess convinced me that this is a heresy in taste when i beheld the grace with which she wore her ermine and the art with which she knew how to vary its serpent folds as she moved or as she spoke the variety it gave to her costume and attitudes the development it afforded to a fine hand and arm the resource in the pauses of conversation and that soft and attractive air which it seemed to impart even to the play of her wit i could no longer refuse my homage to ermine such is the despotism of beauty over all the objects of taste and fashion and so it is that a woman of sense address and sentiment let her be born or thrown by fate where she may will always know how to avail herself of every possible advantage of nature and art nothing will be too trifling or too vast for her genius i must make you understand me my dear olivia your gabrielle is not so frivolous as simpletons imagine frivolity is an excellent because an unsuspected mask under which serious and important designs may be safely concealed i would explain myself further but must now go to the opera to see the new ballet let me know my interesting my sublime olivia when you are positively determined on your voyage to petersburg and then you shall become acquainted with your friend as a politician her friendship for you will not be confined to a mere intercourse of sentiment but will if you have courage to second her views give you a secret yet decisive weight and consequence of which you have hitherto never dreamedadieuthese gentlemen are so impatient i must go burn the last page of this letter and the whole of my next as soon as you have read it i conjure you my dear gabrielle de p letter lxi general b to mr l dear l i have time but to write one line to satisfy that philosophical curiosity which according to your injunctions i will not denominate jealousyexcept when i talk to myself you have a philosophical curiosity to know whether your wife will see the prince in your absence i saw his favourite yesterday who complained to me that his highness had been absolutely refused admittance at your castle notwithstanding he had made many ingenious and some bold attempts to see lady leonora l in the absence of her faithless husband as to your scheme of going to russia you will be obliged luckily to wait for some time for instructions and in the interval it is to be hoped you will recover your senses i shall see you as soon as possible yours truly j b letter lxii madame de p to lady olivia paris as our vanity always endeavours to establish a balance between our own perfections and those of our friends i must flatter myself my dear olivia that in compensation for that courage and ardent imagination in which you are so much my superior i possess some little advantages over you in my scientific hereditary knowledge of court intrigue and of the arts of representation all which will be necessary to you in your character of ambassadress you will in fact deserve this title for of course you will govern the english ambassador whom you honour with your love and of course you will appear with splendour and you will be particularly careful to have your traineau well appointed pray remember that one of your horses must gallop whilst the other trots or you are nobody it will also be absolutely necessary to have a numerous retinue of servants because this suits the russian idea of magnificence you must have as the russian nobles always had in paris four servants constantly to attend your equipage one to carry the flambeau another to open the door and a couple to carry you into and out of your carriage i beseech you to bear in mind perpetually that you are to be as helpless as possible a frenchman of my acquaintance who spent nine years in russia told me that in his first setting out at petersburg he was put on his guard in this particular by a speech of his russian valetdechambresir the englishman you visited today cannot be worthy of your acquaintance he cannot be a gentleman son valet me dit quil se deshabille seul i suppose you take josephine with you she will be an inestimable treasure and i shall make it my business to send you the first advices of paris fashions which her talents will not fail to comprehend and execute my charming olivia you will be the model of taste and elegance do not suspect that dress is carrying me away from politics i assure you i know what i am about and am going straight to my object the art of attending to trifles is the art of governing the world as all historians know who have gone to the bottom of affairs was not the face of europe changed by a cup of tea thrown on mrs mashams gown as voltaire with penetrating genius remarks women without a doubt understand the importance of trifles better than men do and consequently always move in secret the slight springs of that vast machine the civilized world is not your ambition roused my olivia you must however lay aside a little of your romance and not approach the political machine whilst you are intoxicated with love else you will blunder infallibly and do infinite and irreparable mischief to yourself and your friends permit me to tell you that you have been a little spoiled by sentimental novels which are good only to talk of when one must show sensibility but destructive as rules of action by the false lights which these writers who know nothing of the world have thrown upon objects you have been deluded you have been led to mistake the means for the end love has been with you the sole end of love whereas it ought to be the beginning of power no matter for the past the future is yours at our age this future must be dexterously managed a woman of spirit and what is better of sense must always take care that in her heart the age of love is not prolonged beyond the age of being beloved in these times a woman has no choice at a certain period but politics or bel esprit for devotion which used to be a resource is no longer in fashion we must all take a part my dear i assure you i have taken mine decidedly and i predict that you will take yours with brilliant success how often must one cry in the ears of loverslove must die must die must die but you my dear olivia will not be deaf to the warning voice of common sense your own experience has on former occasions convinced you that passion cannot be eternal and at present if i mistake not there is in your love a certain mixture of other feelings a certain alloy which will make it happily ductile and manageable when your triumph over the wife is complete passion for the husband will insensibly decay and this will be fortunate for you because assuredly your ambassador would not choose to remain all the rest of his days in love and in exile at petersburg all these english are afflicted with the maladie du pays and as you observe so well the words home and wife have ridiculous but unconquerable power over their minds what will become of you my friend when this mr l chooses to return to england to his castle c you could not accompany him you must provide in time against this catastrophe or you will be a deserted disgraced undone woman my dear friend no one should begin to act a romance who has not well considered the denouement it is a charming thing to mount with a friend in a balloon amid crowds of spectators who admire the fine spectacle and applaud the courage of the aerostats the losing sight of this earth and the being in or above the clouds must also be delightful but the moment will come when the travellers descend and then begins the danger then they differ about throwing out the ballast the balloon is rent in the quarrel it sinks with frightful rapidity and they run the hazard like the poor marquis darlande of being spitted upon the spire of the invalides or of being entangled among woods and briersat last alighting upon the earth our adventurers fatigued and bruised and disappointed come out of their shattered triumphal car exposed to the derision of the changeable multitude every thing in this world is judged of by success your voyage to petersburg my dear olivia must not be a mere adventure of romance as a party of pleasure it would be ridiculous we must make something more of it enclosed is a letter to a russian nobleman an old lover of mine who i understand is in favour he will certainly be at your command he is a man possessed by the desire of having reputation among foreigners vain of the preference of our sex generous even to prodigality by his means you will be immediately placed on an easy footing with all the leading persons of the russian court you will go on from one step to another till you are at the height which i have in view now for my grand objectno not nowfor i have forty little notes about nothings to write this morning great things hang upon these nothings so they should not be neglected i must leave you my amiable olivia and defer my grand object till tomorrow gabrielle de p letter lxiii leonora to the duchess of dear mother this moment i have received a letter from mr l he has accepted of an embassy to petersburg i cannot guess by the few lines he has written whether or not he wishes that i should accompany him most ardently i wish it but if my offer should be refused or if it should be accepted only because it could not be well refused if i should be a burthen a restraint upon him i should wish myself dead perhaps he accepts of this embassy on purpose that he may leave me and take another person with him or perhaps dearest mother i hardly dare to hope itperhaps he wishes to break off that connexion and goes to russia to leave temptation behind him i know that this embassy was offered to him some weeks ago and he had then no thoughts of accepting itoh that i could see into his heartthat heart which used to be always open to me if i could discover what his wishes are i should know what mine ought to be i have thoughts of going to town immediately to see him at least i may take leave of him do you approve of it write the moment you receive this but i need not say that for i am sure you will do so dearest mother you have prophesied that his heart will return to me and on this hope i live your ever affectionate daughter leonora l letter lxiv the duchess of to leonora yes my dear i advise you by all means to go to town and to see your husband your desire to accompany him to russia he will know before you see him for i have just written and despatched an express to him with your last letter and with all those which i have received from you within these last six months leave mr l time to read them before he sees you and do not hurry or fatigue yourself unnecessarily you know that an embassy cannot be arranged in two days therefore travel by easy journeys you cannot do otherwise without hazard your courage in offering to undertake this long voyage with your husband is worthy of you my beloved daughter god bless and preserve you if you go to petersburg let me know in time that i may see you before you leave england i will be at any moment at any place you appoint your affectionate mother letter lxv the duchess of to mr l perhaps this letter may find you at the feet of your mistress spare me sir a few moments from your pleasures you may perhaps expect reproaches from the mother of your wife but let me assure you that you have none to apprehend for my daughters sake if not for yours i would forbear never was departing love recalled by the voice of reproach you shall not hear it from me you have not heard it from leonora but mistake not the cause of her forbearance let it not be attributed to pusillanimity of temper or insensibility of heart enclosed i send you all the letters which my daughter has written to me from the first day of her acquaintance with lady olivia to this hour from these you will be enabled to judge of what she has felt for some months past and of the actual state of her heart you will see all the tenderness and all the strength of her soul it has ever been my fixed opinion that a wife who loves her husband and who has possessed his affections may reclaim them from the lure of the most artful of her sex by persevering kindness temper and good sense unless indeed her husband be a fool or a libertine i have prophesied that my daughter will regain your heart and upon this prophecy to use her own expression she lives and even now when its accomplishment is far removed i am so steady in my opinion of her and of you so convinced of the uniform result of certain conduct upon the human mind that undismayed i repeat my prophecy were you to remain in this kingdom i should leave things to their natural course i should not interfere so far even as to send you leonoras letters but as you may be separated for years i think it necessary now to put into your hands incontrovertible proofs of what she is and what she has been do not imagine that i am so weak as to expect that the perusal of these letters will work a sudden change but it is fit that before you leave england you should know that leonora is not a cold sullen or offended wife but one who loves you most tenderly most generously who concealing the agony of her heart waits with resignation for the time when she will be your refuge and the permanent blessing of your life letter lxvi madame de p to olivia paris and now my charming olivia raise your fine eyes as high as ambition can look and you will perhaps discover my grand object you do not see it yet look againdo you not see the emperor of russia what would you think of him for a lover if it were only for noveltys sake it would really be pleasant to have a czar at ones feet reign in his heart and you in fact seat yourself invisibly on the throne of all the russias thence what a commanding prospect you have of the affairs of europe and how we should govern the world at our ease the project is bold but not impracticable the ancients represent cupid riding the numidian lion and why should he not tame the russian bear it would make a pretty design for a vignette i can engrave as well as la pompadour could at least and anticipating your victory my charming olivia i will engrave cupid leading the bear in a chain of flowers this shall be my seal mon cachet de faveur courage my fair politician you have a difficult task but the glory is in proportion to the labour and those who value power properly are paid by its acquisition for all possible fatigue and hardships with your knowledge of our modes you will be at petersburg the arbitress of delights you have a charming taste and invention for fetes and spectacles teach these people to vary their pleasures their monarch must adore you if you banish from his presence that most dreadful enemy of kings and most obstinate resident of courts ennui trust my olivia neither to your wit nor your beauty nor your accomplishments but employ your various arts of trifling prettily and take my word for it you will succeed as i may not have an opportunity of sending you another private letter and as lemonjuice goulard and all those sympathetic inks are subject to unlucky accidents i must send you all my secret instructions by the present safe conveyance you must absolutely sacrifice my dear child all your romantic notions and all your taste for love to the grand object the czar must not have the slightest cause for jealousy these czars make nothing you know of cutting off their mistresses pretty heads upon the bare suspicion of an intrigue but you must do what is still more difficult than to be constant you must yield your will and what is more you must never let this czar guess that his will is not always your pleasure your humour your tastes your wishes must be incessantly and with alacrity sacrificed to his you must submit to the constraint of eternal court ceremony and court dissimulation you must bear to be surrounded with masks instead of the human face divine and instead of fellowcreatures you must content yourself with puppets you will have the amusement of pulling the wires but remember that you must wear a mask perpetually as well as others and never attempt to speak and never expect to hear the language of truth or of the heart you must not be the dupe of attachment in those who call themselves friends or zealous and affectionate servants c c you must have sufficient strength of character to bear continually in mind that all these professions are mere words that all these people are alike false and actuated but by one motive selfinterest to secure yourself from secret and open enemies you must farther have sufficient courage to live without a friend or a confidante for such persons at court are only spies traitors in the worst forms all this is melancholy and provoking to be sure but all this you must see without feeling or at least without showing a spark of indignation a sentimental misanthropist male or female is quite out of place at court you must see all that is odious and despicable in human nature in a comic point of view and you must consider your fellowcreatures as objects to be laughed at not to be hated laughter besides being good for the health and consequently for the complexion always implies superiority without this gratification to our vanity there would be no possibility of enduring that eternal penance of hypocrisy and that solitary state of suspicion to which the ambitious condemn themselves i fear my romantic olivia that you who are a person used to yield to first impressions and not quite accustomed to subdue your passions to your interest will think that politics require too much from you almost as much as constancy or religion but consider the difference for heavens sake my dear consider the greatness of our object would to god that i had the eloquence of bossuet and i would make you a convert from love and a proselyte to glory dare my olivia to be a martyr to ambitionsee already high in air she holds a crown over your headit is almost within your graspstretch out your white arm and seize itfear not the thornsevery crown has thornsbut who upon that account ever yet refused one my dear empress i have the honour to kiss your powerful hands gabrielle de p letter lxvii mr l to general b my dear friend you need not hurry yourself to come to town on my account for by this change of ministry my embassy will be delayed some weeks a few days ago this delay would have been a terrible disappointment to me yet now i feel it a respite a respite you will exclaim yes my dear friendso it is such is the heart of manso changeable so contradictory so much at variance with itself from day to day from hour to hour i believe from what i now feel that every man under the dominion of passion is reduced to a most absurd and miserable conditioni have just been reading some letters from leonora which have wrung my heart letters addressed to her mother laying open every feeling of her mind for some months my dear friend what injustice have i done to this admirable woman with what tenderness with what delicacy has she loved me while i mistaking modesty for coldness fortitude for indifference have neglected injured and abandoned her with what sweetness of temper with what persevering goodness has she borne with me while intoxicated with passion i saw every thing in a false point of view how often have i satisfied myself with the persuasion that she scarcely observed my attachment to olivia or beheld it unconcerned secure by the absence of love from the pangs of jealousy how often have i accused her of insensibility whilst her heart was in tortures olivia was deceived also and confirmed me in this cruel error and all that time leonora was defending her rival and pleading her cause with what generosity with what magnanimity she speaks of olivia in those letters her confidence was unbounded her soul above suspicion to the very last she doubted and blamed herselfdear amiable woman blamed herself for our faults for feeling that jealousy which no wife who loved as she did could possibly subdue she never betrayed it by a single word or look of reproach even though she fainted at that cursed fete champetre yet the moment she came to her senses she managed so that none of the spectators could suspect she thought olivia was her rival my dear general you will forgive meas long as i praise leonora you will understand me at last you will acknowledge that i do justice to the merits of my wife justice noi am unworthy of her i have no heart like hers to offer in return for such love she wishes to go with me to petersburg she has forborne to make this offer directly to me but i know it from her last letter to her mother which now lies before me how can i refuseand how can i accept my soul is torn with violence different ways how can i leave leonora and how can i tear myself from oliviaeven if her charms had no power over my heart how could i with honour desert the woman who has sacrificed every thing for me i will not shield myself from you my friend behind the word honour see me as you have always seen me without disguise and now without defence i respect i love leonorabut alas i am in love with olivia yours ever f l letter lxviii mr l to olivia triumphant as you are over my heart dear enchanting olivia you cannot make me false i cannot even to appease your anger deny this morning what i said last night it is inconsistent with all your professions with your character with your generous disposition to desire me to abjure leonora for ever it would be to render myself for ever unworthy of olivia i am convinced that had you read the letters of which i spoke you would have been touched you would have been struck by them as i was instead of being hurt and displeased by the impression that they made upon me you would have sympathized in my feelings you would have been indignant if i had not admired you would have detested and despised me if i could have been insensible to so much goodness and generosity i repeat my words i will not retract i cannot repent of them my dear olivia when you reflect upon what is past i am persuaded you will acknowledge that your sensibility made you unjust indeed my love you did not show your usual candour i had just read all that leonora had written of you all that she had urged against her mother in your defence even when she had most cause to be irritated against us i could not avoid being shocked by the different manner in which you spoke of her perhaps i told you so too abruptly if i had loved you less i should have been more cautious and more calmif i had esteemed you less calmer still i could then possibly have borne to hear you speak in a manner unbecoming yourself forgive me the pain i gave youthe pain i now give you my dearest olivia my sincerity is the best security you can have for my future love banish therefore this unjust this causeless jealousy moderate this excessive sensibility for both our sakes and depend upon the power you have over my heart you cannot conceive how much i have felt from this misunderstandingthe first we have ever had let it be the last i have spent a sleepless night i am detained in town by provoking tiresome but necessary business meet me in the evening with smiles my olivia let me behold in those fascinating eyes their wonted expression and hear from your voice its usual its natural tone of tenderness and love ever devotedly yours f l letter lxix olivia to mr l you have spoken daggers to me come not to richmond this evening i cannotwill not see you not for the universe would i see you with my present feelings write to me more letters like that which i have just received dip your pen in gall find words more bitter than those which you have already used accuse me of want of candour want of generosity want of every amiable every estimable quality upbraid me with the loss of all of which you have

enjoy itdetermine how much i can endure and live stop just at the point where human nature sinks that you may not lose your victim that she may linger on from day to day your sport and your derision olivia letter lxx mr l to general b my dear general you will rejoice to hear that olivia and i have been in a state of warfare for some days past and you will be still more pleased when you learn the cause of our quarrel on the day that i had been reading leonoras letters i was rather later at richmond than usual olivia offended insisted upon knowing by what i could possibly have been detained her anger knew no bounds when she heard the truth she made use of some expressions in speaking of my wife which i could not i hope have borne at any time but which shocked me beyond measure at that moment i defended leonora with warmth olivia in a scornful tone talked of my wifes coldness of disposition and bid me compare lady leonoras love with hers it was a comparison i had it more in my power to make than olivia was aware of it was the most disadvantageous moment for her in which that comparison could be made she saw or suspected my feelings and perceived that all she had said of my leonoras incapability of loving produced an effect directly contrary to her expectations transported by jealousy she then threw out hints respecting the prince i spoke as i felt indignantly i know not precisely what i said but olivia and i parted in anger i have since received a passionately fond note from her but i feel unhappy dear general when will you come to town yours truly f l letter lxxi mrs c to the duchess of my dear madam your graces cautions and entreaties to lady leonora not to overexert and fatigue herself were alas as ineffectual as mine from the time she heard that mr l had accepted this embassy to petersburg she was so eager to set out on her journey to town and so impatient to see him that neither her mind nor her body had one moments tranquillity she waited with indescribable anxiety for your graces answer to her letter and the instant she was secure of your approbation her carriage was ordered to the door i saw that she was ill but she would not listen to my fears she repeated with triumph that her mother made no objection to her journey and that she had no apprehensions for herself however she was obliged at last to yield the carriage was actually at the door when she was forced to submit to be carried to her bed for several hours she was in such danger that i never expected she could live till this day thank god she is now safe her infant to her great delight is a boy she was extremely anxious to have a son because mr l formerly wished for one so much she forbids me to write to mr l lest i should communicate the account of her sudden illness too abruptly she particularly requests that your grace will mention to him this accident in the least alarming manner possible i shall write again next post lady leonora has now fallen asleep and seems to sleep quietly who should sleep in peace if she cannot i never saw her equal my dear madam i am with respect and attachment your graces sincerely affectionate helen c it is with extreme concern i am forced to add that since i wrote this letter the child has been so ill that i have fears for his lifehis poor mother letter lxxii mr l to general b my dear general all is upon velvet again poor olivia was excessively hurt by my letter she was ill for two daysseriously ill yesterday i at length obtained admittance olivia was all softness all candour she acknowledged that she had been wrong and in so sweet a voice she blamed herself till i could no longer think her blamable she seemed so much humbled and depressed such a tender melancholy appeared in her bewitching eyes that i could not resist the fascination i certainly gave her some cause for displeasure that unfortunate evening for as olivia has strong passions and exquisite sensibility i should not have been so abrupt a fit of jealousy may seize the best and most generous mind and may prompt to what it would be incapable of saying or thinking in dispassionate moments i am sure that olivia has upon reflection felt more pain from this affair than i have my russian embassy is still in abeyance ministers seem to know their own minds as little as i know mine ambition has its quarrels and follies as well as love at all events i shall not leave england till next month and i shall not go down to l castle till i have received my last instructions from our court and till the day for my sailing is fixed the parting with leonora will be a dreadful difficulty i cannot think of it steadily but as she herself says is it not better that she should lose a year of my affections than a life the duchess is mistaken in imagining it possible that any woman let her influence be ever so great over my heart could prejudice me against my amiable my admirable wife what has just passed between olivia and me convinces me that it is impossible she has too much knowledge of my character to hazard in future a similar attempt no my dear friend be assured i would not suffer it i have not yet lost all title to your esteem or to my own this enchantress may intoxicate me with her cup but shall never degrade me and i should feel myself less degraded even by losing the human form than by forfeiting that principle of honour and virtue which more nobly distinguishes man from brute yours most sincerely f l letter lxxiii general b to mr l my dear friend it is well that i did not answer your letter of saturday before i received that of monday my congratulations upon your quarrel with your fair one might have come just as you were kissing hands upon a reconciliation i have often found a great convenience in writing a bad hand my letters are so little like what they are intended for and have among them such equality of unintelligibility that each seems either and with the slightest alteration each will stand and serve for the other my m n and u are convertible letters so are the terms and propositions of your present mode of reasoning my dear l and i perceive that you find your account in it upon this i congratulate you and i congratulate lady leonora upon your being detained some weeks longer in england those who have a just cause need never pray for victory they need only ask the gods for time time always brings victory to truth and shame to falsehood but you are not worthy of such fine apophthegms at present you are not fit to hear yourself convinced i will wait for a better opportunity and have patience with you if i can you seem to plume yourself mightily upon your resolve to do justice to the merits of your wife and upon the courage you have shown in stuffing cotton into your ears to prevent your listening to the voice of the siren but pray take the cotton out and hear all she can say or sing lady leonora cannot be hurt by any thing olivia can say but her own malice may destroy herself in the mean time as you tell me that you are upon velvet again i am to presume that you are perfectly at ease and i should be obliged to you if as often as you can find leisure you would send me bulletins of your happiness i have never yet been in love with one of these highflown heroines and i am really curious to know what degree of felicity they can bestow upon a man of common sense i should be glad to benefit by the experience of a friend yours truly jb letter lxxiv olivia to madame de p richmond accept my sincere thanks inimitable gabrielle for having taken off my hands a lover who really has halfwearied me to death if you had dealt more frankly with me i could however have saved you much superfluous trouble and artifice i now perfectly comprehend the cause of poor rs strange silence some months ago he was then under the influence of your charms and it was your pleasure to deceive me even when there was no necessity for dissimulation you knew the secret of my growing attachment to l and must have foreseen that r would be burthensome to me you needed therefore only to have treated me with candour and you would have gained a lover without losing a friend but madame de p is too accomplished a politician to go the simple straight road to her object i now perfectly comprehend why she took such pains to persuade me that an imperial lover was alone worthy of my charms she was alarmed by an imaginary danger believe me i am incapable of disputing with any one les restes dun coeur permit me to assure you madam that your incomparable talents for explanation will be utterly thrown away on me in future i am in possession of the whole truth from a person whose information i cannot doubt i know the precise date of the commencement of your connexion with r so that you must perceive it will be impracticable to make me believe that you have not betrayed my easy confidence i cannot however without those pangs of sentiment which your heart will never experience reflect upon the treachery the perfidy of one who has been my bosom friendreturn my letters gabriellewith this you will receive certain souvenirs at which i could never henceforward look without sighing i return you that ring i have so long worn with delight the picture of that treacherous eye which you know so well how to useadieu gabriellethe illusion is overhow many of the illusions of my fond heart have been dispelled by time and treachery olivia footnote certain ladies at this time carried pictures of the eyes of their favourites letter lxxv madame de p to monsieur r paris i have just received the most extravagant letter imaginable from your olivia really you may congratulate yourself my dear friend upon having recovered your liberty twere better to be a galley slave at once than to be bound to please a woman for life who knows not what she would have either in love or friendship can you conceive anything so absurd as her upbraiding me with treachery because i know the value of a heart of which she tells me she was more than half tired as if i were to blame for her falling in love with mr l and as if i did not know the whole progress of her inconstancy her letters to me give a new history of the birth and education of love here we see love born of envy nursed by ennui and dandled in turn by all the vices and this lady olivia fancies that she is a perfect french woman there is nothing we parisians abhor and ridicule so much as these foreign and always awkward caricatures of our manners with us there are many who according to a delicate distinction lose their virtue without losing their taste for virtue but i flatter myself there are few who resemble olivia entirelywho have neither the virtues of a man nor of a woman one cannot even say that her head is the dupe of her heart since she has no heart but enough of such a tiresome and incomprehensible subject how i overvalued that head when i thought it could ever be fit for politics tis well we did not commit ourselves you see how prudent i am my dear r and how much those are mistaken who think that we women are not fit to be trusted with secrets of state love and politics make the best mixture in the world adieu victoire summons me to my toilette gabrielle de p letter lxxvi madame de p to lady olivia paris really my dear olivia this is too childish what make a complaint in form against me for taking a lover off your hands when you did not know what to do with him do you quarrel in england every time you change partners in a country dance but i must be serious for the highsounding words treachery and perfidy are surely sufficient to make any body grave seriously then if you are resolved to be tragical et de me faire une scene i must submitconsole myself and above all things take care not to be ridiculous your letters as you desire it so earnestly and with so much reason shall be returned by the first safe conveyance but excuse me if i forbear to restore your souvenirs with us parisians this returning of keepsakes has been out of fashion since the days of moliere and le depit amoureux adieu my charming olivia i embrace you tenderly i was going to say but i believe according to your english etiquette i must now conclude with i have the honour to be madam your most obedient humble servant gabrielle de p letter lxxvii from olivia to mr l tuesday morning come not to richmond today i am not in spirits to see you my dearest l allow me to indulge my melancholy retired from every human eye olivia letter lxxviii from lady olivia to mr l tuesday evening explain to you the cause of my melancholy vain requestcruel as vain your ignorance of the cause too well justifies my sad presentiments were our feelings in unison as once they were would not every chord of your heart vibrate responsively to mine with me love is an absorbing vortex of the soul into which all other thoughts feelings and ideas are irresistibly impelled with you it is but as the stranger stream that crosses the peaceful lake and as it flows wakens only the surface of the slumbering waters communicating to them but a temporary agitation with you my dear but too tranquilminded friend love is but one amid the vulgar crowd of pleasures it concentrates not your ideas it entrances not your faculties it is not as in my heart the supreme delight which renders all others tasteless the only blessing which can make life supportable the sole sufficient object of existence alas how cruelly different is the feeble attachment that i have inspired from that allpowerful sentiment to which i live a victim countless symptoms by you unheeded mark to my lovewatchful eye the decline of passion how often am i secretly shocked by the cold carelessness of your words and manner how often does the sigh burst from my bosom the tear fall from my eye when you have left me at leisure to recall by memorys torturing power instances of your increasing indifference seek not to calm my too wellfounded fears professions with all their unmeaning inanimate formality but irritate my anguish permit me to indulge to feed upon my grief in silence ask me no more to explain to you the cause of my melancholy too plainly alas i feel it is beyond my utmost power to endure it amiable werterdivine st preuxyou would sympathize in my feelings sublime goethealleloquent rousseauyou alone could feel as i do and you alone could paint my anguish the miserable olivia letter lxxix mr l to general b expect no bulletin of happiness from me my friend i find it impossible to make olivia happy she has superior talents accomplishments beauty grace all that can attract and fascinate the human heartthat could triumph over every feeling every principle that opposed her power she lives with the man she loves and yet she is miserable rousseau it has been said never really loved any woman but his own julie i have lately been tempted to think that olivia never really loved any man but st preux werter perhaps and some other german heroes might dispute her heart even with st preux but as for me i begin to be aware that i am loved only as a feeble resemblance of those divine originals to whom however my character bears not the slightest similarity and i am often indirectly and sometimes directly reproached with my inferiority to imaginary models but how can a plain englishman hope to reach the high sublime of deep absurd i am continually reviled for not using a romantic language which i have never learned and which as far as i can judge is foreign to all natural feeling i wish to make olivia happy there is nothing i would not do to satisfy her of my sincerity but nothing i can do will suffice she has a sort of morbid sensibility which is more alive to pain than pleasure more susceptible of jealousy than of love no terms are sufficiently strong to convince her of my affection but an unguarded word makes her miserable for hours she requires to be agitated by violent emotions though they exhaust her mind and leave her spiritless and discontented in this alternation of rapture and despair all her time passes as she says of herself she has no soul but for love she seems to think it a crime against sentiment to admit of relief from common occupations or indifferent subjects with a sort of superstitious zeal she excludes all thoughts but those which relate to one object and in this spirit of amorous mysticism she actually makes a penance even of love i am astonished that her heart can endure this variety of selfinflicted torments what will become of olivia when she ceases to love and be loved and what passion can be durable which is so violent as hers and to which no respite is allowed no affection can sustain these hourly trials of suspicion and reproach jealousy of leonora has taken such possession of olivias imagination that she misinterprets all my words and actions by restraining my thoughts by throwing obstacles in the way of my affection for my wife she stimulates and increases it she forces upon me continually those comparisons which she dreads till i knew olivia more intimately than the common forms of a first acquaintance or the illusions of a treacherous passion permitted her defects did not appear but now that i suffer and that i see her suffer daily i deplore them bitterly her happiness rests and weighs heavily on my honour i feel myself bound to consider and to provide for the happiness of the woman who has sacrificed to me all independent means of felicity a man without honour or humanity may perhaps finish an intrigue as easily as he can begin it but this is not exactly the case of your imprudent friend f l letter lxxx general b to mr l wednesday ay ay just as i thought it would be this is all the comfort my dear friend that i can give you all the comfort that wise people usually afford their friends in distress provided things happen just as they predicted they care but little what is suffered in the accomplishment of their prophecies but seriously my dear l i am not sorry that you are in a course of vexation the more you see of your charmer the better she will allay your intoxication by gentle degrees and send you sober home pray keep in the course you have begun and preserve your patience as long as possible i should be sorry that you and olivia quarrelled violently and parted in a passion such quarrels of lovers are proverbially the renewal of love il faut delier lamitie il faut couper lamour in some cases this maxim may be just but not in the present instance i would rather wait till the knot is untied than cut it for when once you see the art with which it was woven a similar knot can never again perplex you yours truly j b letter lxxxi from olivia to mr l richmond saturday you presume too much upon your power over my heart and upon the softness of my nature know that i have spirit as well as tendernessa spirit that will neither be injured nor insulted with impunity you were amazed you say by the violence which i showed yesterday why did you provoke that violence by opposing the warmest wish of my heart and with a calmness that excited my tenfold indignation imagine not that i am a tame subjugated female to be treated with neglect if i remonstrate and caressed as the price of obedience fancy not that i am one of your chimneycorner household goddesses doomed to the dull uniformity of domestic worship destined to to be adored to be hung with garlands or undeified or degraded with indignity i have been accustomed to a different species of worship and the fondness of my weak heart has not yet sunk me so low and rendered me so abject that i cannot assert my rights you tell me that you are unconscious of giving me any just cause of offence just causehow i hate the cold accuracy of your words this single expression is sufficient offence to a heart like mine you entreat me to be reasonable reasonabledid ever man talk of reason to a woman he loved when once a man has recourse to reason and precision there is an end of love no just cause of offencewhat have i no cause to be indignant when i find you thus trifle with my feelings postpone from week to week and month to month our departure from this hateful country bid me hope on from day to day and wish and wish my soul away yes you know it to be the most ardent wish of my soul to leave england you know that i cannot enjoy a moments peace of mind whilst i am here yet in this racking suspense it is your pleasure to detain me no it shall not bethis shall not go on it is in vain you tell me that the delay originates not with you that you must wait for instructions and i know not whatpaltry diplomatic excuses olivia letter lxxxii mr l to general b richmond amuse yourself my good general at my expense i know that you are seriously interested for my happiness but the way is not quite so clear before me as you imagine it is extremely easy to be philosophic for our friends but difficult to be so for ourselves when our passions are concerned indeed this would be a contradiction in terms you might as well talk of a cold sun or of hot ice as of a philosopher falling in love or of a man in love being a philosopher you say that olivia will wear out my passion and that her defects will undo the work of her charms i acknowledge that she sometimes ravels the web she has woven but she is miraculously expeditious and skilful in repairing the mischief the magical tissue again appears firm as ever glowing with brighter colours and exhibiting finer forms in plain prose my dear friendfor as you ate not in love you will find it difficult to follow my poetic nightsin plain prose i must confess that olivia has the power to charm and touch my heart even after she has provoked me to the utmost verge of human patience she knows her power and i am afraid this tempts her to abuse it her temper which formerly appeared to me all feminine gentleness is now irritable and violent but i am persuaded that this is not her natural disposition it is the effect of her present unhappy state of mind tortured by remorse and jealousy if in the height of their paroxysms olivia make me suffer from their fury is it for me to complain i who caused should at least endure the evil every thing is arranged for my embassy and the day is fixed for our leaving england i go down to l castle next week your faithful f l letter lxxxiii josephine to victoire mad de ps woman richmond i am in despair dear victoire and unless your genius can assist me absolutely undone here is this romantic lady of mine determined upon a journey to russia with her new english lover what whims ladies take into their heads and how impossible it is to make them understand reason i have been labouring in vain to convince my lady olivia that this is the most absurd scheme imaginable and i have repeated to her all i learnt from lady fs women who are just returned from petersburg and whom i met at a party last night all declaring they would rather die a thousand deaths than go through again what they have endured such seas of ice such going in sledges such barbarians such beds and scarcely a lookingglass and nothing fit to wear but what one carries with one and god knows how long we may stay at petersburg the coachmens ears are frozen off every night on their boxes waiting for their ladies and there are bears and wild beasts i am told howling with their mouths wide open night and day in the forests which we are to pass through and even in the towns the men i hear are little better for it is the law of the country for the men to beat their wives and many wear long beards how horridmy lady fs woman who is a parisian born and very pretty if her eyes were not so small and better dressed than her lady always except diamonds assures me upon her honour she never had a civil thing said to her whilst she was in russia except by one or two frenchmen in the suite of the ambassadors these russians think of nothing but drinking brandy and they put pepper into it mon dieu what savages put pepper into brandy but that is inconceivable positively i will never go to petersburg and yet if my lady goes what will become of me for you know my sentiments for brunel and he is decided to accompany my lady so i cannot stay behind but absolutely i am shocked at this intrigue with mr l and my conscience reproaches me terribly with being a party concerned in it for in this country an affair of gallantry between married people is not so light a thing as with us here wives sometimes love their husbands seriously as if they were their lovers and my lady leonora l is one of this sort of wives she is very unhappy i am told one day at lcastle i assure you my heart quite bled for her when she gave me a beautiful gown of english muslin little suspecting me then to be her enemy she is certainly very unsuspicious and very amiable and i wish to heaven her husband would think as i do and take her with him to petersburg instead of carrying off my lady olivia and me adieu mon chou embrace every body i know tenderly for me josephine letter lxxxiv mrs c to the duchess of my dear madam i believe when i wrote last to your grace i said that i had no hopes of the childs life from the moment of his birth there was but little probability of his being any thing but a source of misery to his mother i cannot on her account regret that the struggle is over he expired this morning my poor friend had hopes to the last though i had none and it was most painful and alarming to see the feverish anxiety with which she watched over her little boy frequently repeating mr l used to wish so much for a soni hope the boy will live to see his father last night partly by persuasion partly by compulsion i prevailed with her to let the child be taken out of her room this morning as soon as it was light i heard her bell ring the poor little thing was at that moment in convulsions and knowing that lady leonora rang to inquire for it i went to prepare her mind for what i knew must be the event the moment i came into the room she looked eagerly in my face but did not ask me any questions about the child i sat down by the side of her bed but without listening to what i said about her own health she rang her bell again more violently than before susan came in susanwithout my childsaid she starting up susan hesitated but i saw by her countenance that it was all overso did lady leonora she said not a word but drawing her curtain suddenly she lay down and never spoke or stirred for three hours the first words she said afterwards were to me you need not move so softly my dear helen i am not asleep have you my mothers last letter i think my mother says that she will be here tomorrow she is very kind to come to me will you be so good as to write to her immediately and send a servant with your letter as soon as you can to meet her on the road that she may not be surprised when she arrives lady leonora is now more composed and more like herself than she has been for some time past i rejoice that your grace will so soon be here because you will be her best possible consolation and i do not know any other person in the world who could have sufficient influence to prevent her from attempting to set out upon a journey before she can travel with safety to do her justice she has not hinted that such were her intentions but still i know her mind so well that i am certain what her thoughts are and what her actions would be most ladies talk more than they act but leonora acts more decidedly than she talks believe me dear madam with much respect your graces sincerely affectionate helen c letter lxxxv mr l to general b i thank you my excellent friend for the kindness of your last letter which came to me at the time i wanted it most in the whole course of my life i never felt so much selfreproach as i have done since i heard of the illness of leonora and the loss of my son from this blow my mind will not easily recover of all torments selfreproach is the worst and even now i cannot follow the dictates of my own heart and of my better judgment in olivias company i am compelled to repress my feelings she cannot sympathize in them they offend her she is dissatisfied even with my silence and complains of my being out of spirits out of spiritshow can i be otherwise at present has olivia no touch of pity for a woman who was once her friend who always treated her with generous kindness but perhaps i am a little unreasonable and expect too much from female nature at all events i wish that olivia would spare me at this moment her sentimental metaphysics she is for ever attempting to prove to me that i cannot love so well as she can i admit that i cannot talk of love so finely i hope all this will not go on when we arrive at petersburg the ministry at last know their own minds i saw today and every thing will be quickly arranged therefore my dear friend do not delay coming to town to your obliged f l footnote this letter does not appear letter lxxxvi general b to mr l perhaps you are a little unreasonable indeed my dear friend i do not think you a little unreasonable but very nearly stark mad what quarrel with your mistress because she is not sorry that your wife is ill and because she cannot sympathize in your grief for the loss of your son where except perhaps in absurd novels did you ever meet with these paragons of mistresses who were so magnanimous and so generous as to sacrifice their own reputations and then be satisfied to share the only possible good remaining to them in life the heart of their lover with a rival more estimable more amiable than themselves and who has the advantage of being a wife this sharing of hearts this union of souls with this opposition of intereststhis metaphysical gallantry is absolute nonsense and all who try it in real life will find it so to their cost why should you my dear l expect such superlative excellence from your olivia do you think that a woman by losing one virtue increases the strength of those that remain as it is said that the loss of one of our senses renders all the others more acute do you think that a lady by yielding to love and by proving that she has not sufficient resolution or forbearance to preserve the honour of her sex gives the best possible demonstration of her having sufficient strength of character to rise superior to all the other weaknesses incident to human and more especially to female natureenvy and jealousy for instance no no my good friend you have common sense though you lately have been sparing of it in action you had a wife and a good wife and you had some chance of being happy but with a wife and a mistress granting them to be both the best of their kind the probabilities are rather against you i speak only as a man of the world morality you know is now merely an affair of calculation according to the most approved tables of happiness you have made a bad bargain but be just at any rate and do not blame your olivia for the inconveniences and evils inseparable from the species of connexion that you have been pleased to form do you expect the whole course of society and the nature of the human heart to change for your special accommodation do you believe in truth by wholesale and yet in detail expect a happy exception in your own favourseriously my dear friend you must either break off this connexion or bear it i shall see you in a few days yours truly j b letter lxxxvii mrs c to miss b l castle leonora has recovered her strength surprisingly she was so determined to be well that her body dared not contradict her mind her excellent mother has been of the greatest possible service to us for she has had sufficient influence to prevent her daughter from exerting herself too much her grace had a letter from mr l todayvery short but very kindat least all that i heard read of it he has set my heart somewhat more at ease by the comfortable assurance that he will not leave england without seeing lady leonora i have the greatest hopes from this interview i have not felt so happy for many monthsbut i will not be too sanguine mr l talks of being here the latter end of this month the duchess with her usual prudence intends to leave her daughter before that time lest mr lshould be constrained by her presence or should imagine that leonora acts from any impulse but that of her own heart i also though much against my inclination shall decamp for he might perhaps consider me as an adviser caballer confidante or at least a troublesome spectator all reconciliation scenes should be without spectators men do not like to be seen on their knees they are at a loss like sir walter raleigh in the critic they cannot get off gracefully i am dear margaret yours affectionately helen c letter lxxxviii general b to mr l my dear l friday ask yourself in the name of common sense why you should go to petersburg with this sentimental coquette this romantic termagant of whom i see you are already more than half tired as to your being bound to her in honour i cannot see how why should you make honour justice humanity and gratitude plead so finely all on one side and that the wrong side of the question have none of these one word to whisper in favour of any body in this world but of a worthless mistress who makes you miserable i think you have learned from your heroine to be so expert in sentimental logic that you can change virtues into vices and vices into virtues till at last you do not know them asunder else why should you make it a point of conscience to abandon your wifejust at the moment too when you are thoroughly convinced of her love for you when you are touched to the soul by her generous conduct and when your heart longs to return to her please to remember that this lady olivias reputation was not unimpeached before her acquaintance with you and do not take more glory or more blame to yourself than properly falls to your share do not forget that poor r was your predecessor and do not let this delicate lady rest all the weight of her shame upon you as certain chinese culprits rest their portable pillories on the shoulders of their friends in two days i shall follow this letter and repeat in person all the interrogatories i have just put to you my dear friend prepare yourself to answer me sincerely such questions as i shall ask yours truly jb letter lxxxix from olivia to mr l monday oclock for a few days did you say to bid adieu oh if once more you return to that fatal castle that enchanted home olivia for ever loses all power over your heart bid her die stab her to the heart and she will call it mercy and she will bless you with her dying lips but talk not of leaving your olivia on her knees she writes this her face all bathed in tears and must she in her turn implore and supplicate must she abase herself even to the dust yeslove like hers vanquishes even the stubborn potency of female pride your too fond olivia letter xc from olivia to mr l dated a few hours after the preceding monday halfpast three oh this equivocating answer to my fond heart passion makes and admits of no compromise be mine and wholly mineor never never will i survive your desertion i can be happy only whilst i love i can love only whilst i am beloved with fervency equal to my own and when i cease to love i cease to exist no coward fears restrain my soul the word suicide shocks not my ear appals not my understanding death i consider but as the eternal rest of the wretchedthe sweet the sole refuge of despair your resolute olivia letter xci from olivia to mr l tuesday return return on the wings of love return to the calm the prudent the happy the transcendently happy leonora returnbut not to bid her adieureturn to be hers for ever and only hers i give you back your faithi give you back your promisesyou have taken back your heart but if you should desire once more to see olivia if you should have any lingering wish to bid her a last adieu it must be this evening tomorrows sun rises not for olivia for her but a few short hours remain love let them be all thy own intoxicate thy victim mingle pleasure in the cup of death and bid her fearless quaff it to the dregs letter xcii mr l to general b thursday my dear friend you have by argument and raillery and by every means that kindness and goodness could devise endeavoured to expel from my mind a passion which you justly foresaw would be destructive of my happiness and of the peace of a most estimable and amiable woman with all the skill that a thorough knowledge of human nature in general and of my peculiar character and foibles could bestow you have employed those words and spells which can control between the fits the fever of the soul circumstances have operated in conjunction with your skill to medicine me to repose the fits have gradually become weaker and weaker the fever is now gone but i am still to suffer for the extravagances committed during its delirium i have entered into engagements which must be fulfilled i have involved myself in difficulties from which i see no method of extricating myself honourably notwithstanding all the latitude which the system of modern gallantry allows to the conscience of our sex and in spite of the convenient maxim which maintains that all arts are allowable in love and war i think that a man cannot break a promise whether made in words or by tacit implication on the faith of which a woman sacrifices her reputation and happiness lady olivia has thrown herself upon my protection i am as sensible as you can be my dear general that scandal had attacked her reputation before our acquaintance commenced but though the world had suspicions they had no proofs now there can be no longer any defence made for her character there is no possibility of her returning to that rank in society to which she was entitled by her birth and which she adorned with all the brilliant charms of wit and beauty no happiness no chance of happiness remains for her but from my constancy of naturally violent passions unused to the control of authority habit reason or religion and at this time impelled by love and jealousy olivia is on the brink of despair i am not apt to believe that women die in modern times for love nor am i easily disposed to think that i could inspire a dangerous degree of enthusiasm yet i am persuaded that olivias passion compounded as it is of various sentiments besides love has taken such possession of her imagination and is as she fancies so necessary to her existence that if i were to abandon her she would destroy that life which she has already attempted i thank god ineffectually what a spectacle is a woman in a paroxysm of ragea woman we love or whom we have loved excuse me my dear friend if i wrote incoherently for i have been interrupted many times since i began this letter i am this day overwhelmed by a multiplicity of affairs which in consequence of olivias urgency to leave england immediately must be settled with an expedition for which my head is not at present well qualified i do not feel well i can command my attention but on one subject and on that all my thoughts are to no purpose whichever way i now act i must endure and inflict misery i must either part from a wife who has given me the most tender the most touching proofs of affectiona wife who is all that a man can esteem admire and love or i must abandon a mistress who loves me with all the desperation of passion to which she would fall a sacrifice but why do i talk as if i were still at liberty to make a choicemy head is certainly very confused i forgot that i am bound by a solemn promise and this is the evil which distracts me i will give you if i can a clear narrative last night i had a terrible scene with olivia i foresaw that she would be alarmed by my intended visit to l castle even though it was but to take leave of my leonora i abstained from seeing olivia to avoid altercation and with all the delicacy in my power i wrote to her assuring her that my resolution was fixed note after note came from her with pathetic and passionate appeals to my heart but i was still resolute at length the day before that on which i was to set out for l castle she wrote to warn me that if i wished to take a last farewell i must see her that evening her note concluded with tomorrows sun will not rise for olivia this threat and many strange hints of her opinions concerning suicide i at the time disregarded as only thrown out to intimidate a lover however knowing the violence of olivias temper i was punctual to the appointed hour fully determined by my firmness to convince her that these female wiles were vain my dear friend i would not advise the wisest man and the most courageous upon earth to risk such dangers confident in his strength even a victory may cost him too dear i found olivia reclining on a sofa her beautiful tresses unbound her dress the perfection of elegant negligence i half suspected that it was studied negligence yet i could not help pausing as i entered to contemplate a figure she never looked more beautifulmore fascinating holding out her hand to me she said with her languid smile and tender expression of voice and manner you are come then to bid me farewell i doubted whether but i will not upbraidmine be all the pain of this last adieu during the few minutes we have to pass together between us two let there be peace i sat down beside her rather agitated i confess but commanding myself so that my emotion could not be visible in a composed tone i asked why she spoke of a last adieu and observed that we should meet again in a few days never replied olivia weak woman as i am love inspires me with sufficient force to make and to keep this resolution as she spoke she took from her bosom a rose and presenting it to me in a solemn manner put this rose into water tonight continued she tomorrow it will be alive her look her expressive eyes seemed to say this flower will be alive but olivia will be dead i am ashamed to confess that i was silent because i could not just then speak i have used some precaution resumed olivia to spare you my dearest l unnecessary painlook around you the room i now for the first time observed was ornamented with flowers this apartment i hope continued she has not the air of the chamber of death i have endeavoured to give it a festive appearance that the remembrance of your last interview with your once loved olivia may be at least unmixed with horror at this instant my dear general a confused recollection of rousseaus heloise the dying scene and her room ornamented with flowers came into my imagination and destroying the idea of reality changed suddenly the whole course of my feelings in a tone of raillery i represented to olivia her resemblance to julie and observed that it was a pity she had not a lover whose temper was more similar than mine to that of the divine st preux stung to the heart by my illtimed raillery olivia started up from the sofa broke from my arms with sudden force snatched from the table a penknife and plunged it into her side she was about to repeat the blow but i caught her armshe struggledpromise me then cried she that you will never more see my hated rival i cannot make such a promise olivia said i holding her uplifted arm forcibly i will not the words hated rival which showed me that olivia was actuated more by the spirit of hatred than love made me reply in as decided a tone as even you could have spoken my dear general but i was shocked and reproached myself with cruelty when i saw the blood flow from her side she was terrified i took the knife from her powerless hand and she fainted in my arms i had sufficient presence of mind to reflect that what had happened should be kept as secret as possible therefore without summoning josephine whose attachment to her mistress i have reason to suspect i threw open the windows gave olivia air and water and her senses returned then i despatched my swiss for a surgeon i need not speak of my own feelingsno suspense could be more dreadful than that which i endured between the sending for the surgeon and the moment when he gave his opinion he relieved me at once by pronouncing it to be a slight flesh wound that would be of no manner of consequence olivia however whether from alarm or pain or from the sight of the blood fainted three times during the dressing of her side and though the surgeon assured her that it would be perfectly well in a few days she was evidently apprehensive that we concealed from her the real danger at the idea of the approach of death which now took possession of her imagination all courage forsook her and for some time my efforts to support her spirits were ineffectual she could not dispense with the services of josephine and from the moment this french woman entered the room there was nothing to be heard but exclamations the most violent and noisy as to assistance she could give none at last her exaggerated demonstrations of horror and grief ended withdieu merci an moins nous voila delivres de ce voyage affreux apparemment quil ne sera plus question de ce vilain petersburg pour madame a new train of thoughts was roused by these words in olivias mind and looking at me she eagerly inquired why the journey to petersburg was to be given up if she was in no danger i assured her that josephine spoke at random that my intentions with regard to the embassy to russia were unaltered seulement retarde un peu said josephine who was intent only upon her own selfish objectsurement madame ne voyagera pas dans cet etat olivia started up and looking at me with terrific wildness in her eyes swear to me said she swear that you will not deceive me or i will this instant tear open this wound and never more suffer it to be closed deceive you olivia cried i what deceit can you fear from mewhat is it you require of me i require from you a promise a solemn promise that you will go with me to russia i solemnly promise that i will said i now be tranquil olivia i beseech you the surgeon represented the necessity of keeping herself quiet and declared that he would not answer for the cure of his patient on any other terms satisfied by the solemnity of my promise olivia now suffered me to depart this morning she sends me word that in a few days she shall be ready to leave england can you meet me my dear friend at l castle i go down there today to bid adieu to leonora from thence i shall proceed to yarmouth and embark immediately olivia will follow me your obliged f l letter xciii leonora to her mother l castle dearest mother my husband is here at home with me with your happy leonoraand his heart is with her his looks his voice his manner tell me so and by them i never was deceived no he is incapable of deceit whatever have been his errors he never stooped to dissimulation he is again my own still capable of loving me still worthy of all my affection i knew that the delusion could not last long or rather you told me so my best friend and i believed you you did him justice he was indeed deceivedwho might not have been deceived by olivia his passions were under the power of an enchantress but now he has triumphed over her arts he sees her such as she is and her influence ceases i am not absolutely certain of all this but i believe because i hope it yet he is evidently embarrassed and seems unhappy what can be the meaning of this perhaps he does not yet know his leonora sufficiently to be secure of her forgiveness how i long to set his heart at ease and to say to him let the past be forgotten for ever how easy it is to the happy to forgive there have been moments when i could not i fear have been just when i am sure that i could not have been generous i shall immediately offer to accompany mr l to russia i can have no farther hesitation for i see that he wishes it indeed just now he almost said so his baggage is already embarked at yarmouthhe sails in a few daysand in a few hours your daughters fate your daughters happiness will be decided it is decided for i am sure he loves me i see i hear i feel it dearest mother i write to you in the first moment of joyi hear his foot upon the stairs your happy leonora l letter xciv leonora to her mother l castle my dear mother my hopes are all vain your prophecies will never be accomplished we have both been mistaken in mr ls character and henceforward your daughter must not depend upon him for any portion of her happiness i once thought it impossible that my love for him could be diminished he has changed my opinion mine is not that species of weak or abject affection which can exist under the sense of illtreatment and injustice much less can my love survive esteem for its object i told you my dear mother and i believed that his affections had returned to me but i was mistaken he has not sufficient strength or generosity of soul to love me or to do justice to my love i offered to go with him to russia he answered that is impossibleimpossibleis it then impossible for him to do that which is just or honourable or seeing what is right must he follow what is wrong or can his heart never more be touched by virtuous affections is his taste so changed so depraved that he can now be pleased and charmed only by what is despicable and profligate in our sex then i should rejoice that we are to be separatedseparated for ever may years and years pass away and wear out if possible the memory of all he has been to me i think i could better much better bear the total loss the death of him i have loved than endure to feel that he had survived both my affection and esteem to see the person the same but the soul changed to feel every day every hour that i must despise what i have so admired and loved mr l is gone from hence he leaves england the day after tomorrow lady olivia is to follow him i am glad that public decency is not to be outraged by their embarking together my dearest mother be assured that at this moment your daughters feelings are worthy of you indignation and the pride of virtue support her spirit leonora l letter xcv general b to lady leonora l yarmouth had i not the highest confidence in lady leonora ls fortitude i should not venture to write to her at this moment knowing as i do that she is but just recovered from a dangerous illness mr l had requested me to meet him at l castle previously to his leaving england but it was out of my power i met him however on the road to yarmouth and as we travelled together i had full opportunity of seeing the state of his mind permit methe urgency of the case requires itto speak without reserve with the freedom of an old friend i imagine that your ladyship parted from mr l with feelings of indignation at which i cannot be surprised but if you had seen him as i saw him indignation would have given way to pity loving you madam as you deserve to be loved most ardently most tenderly touched to his inmost soul by the proofs of affection he had seen in your letters in your whole conduct even to the last moment of parting my unhappy friend felt himself bound to resist the temptation of staying with you or of accepting your generous offer to accompany him to petersburg he thought himself bound in honour by a promise extorted from him to save from suicide one whom he thinks he has injured one who has thrown herself upon his protection of the conflict in his mind at parting with your ladyship i can judge from what he suffered afterwards i met mr l with feelings of extreme indignation but before i had been an hour in his company i never pitied any man so much in my life for i never yet saw any one so truly wretched and so thoroughly convinced that he deserved to be so you know that he is not one who often gives way to his emotions not one who expresses them much in wordsbut he could not command his feelings the struggle was too violent i have no doubt that it was the real cause of his present illness as the moment approached when he was to leave england he became more and more agitated towards evening he sunk into a sort of apathy and gloomy silence from which he suddenly broke into delirious raving at twelve oclock last night the night he was to have sailed he was seized with a violent and infectious fever as to the degree of immediate danger the physicians here cannot yet pronounce i have sent to town for dr your ladyship may be certain that i shall not quit my friend and that he shall have every possible assistance and attendance i am with the truest esteem your ladyships faithful servant j b letter xcvi leonora to her mother dear mother l castle this moment an express from general b mr l is dangerously ill at yarmoutha fever brought on by the agitation of his mind how unjust i have been forget all i said in my last i write in the utmost hastejust setting out for yarmouth i hope to be there tomorrow your affectionate leonora l i open this to enclose the generals letter which will explain every thing letter xcvii general b to the duchess of my dear madam yarmouth your grace i find is apprised of lady leonora ls journey hither i fear that you rely upon my prudence for preventing her exposing herself to the danger of catching this dreadful fever but that has been beyond my power her ladyship arrived late last night i had foreseen the probability of her coming but not the possibility of her coming so soon i had taken no precautions and she was in the house and upon the stairs in an instant no entreaties no arguments could stop her i assured her that mr ls fever was pronounced by all the physicians to be of the most infectious kind dr joined me in representing that she would expose her life to almost certain danger if she persisted in her determination to see her husband but she pressed forward regardless of all that could be said to the physicians she made no answer to me she replied you are mr ls friend but i am his wife you have not feared to hazard your life for him and do you think i can hesitate i urged that there was no necessity for more than one persons running this hazard and that since it had fallen to my lot to be with my friend when he was first taken illshe interrupted meis not this taking a cruel advantage of me general you know that i too would have been with mr l ifif it had been possible her manner her pathetic emphasis and the force of her implied meaning struck me so much that i was silent and suffered her to pass on but again the idea of her danger rushing upon my mind i sprang before her to the door of mr ls apartment and opposed her entrance then general said she calmly perhaps you mistake meperhaps you have heard repeated some unguarded words of mine in the moment of indignation unjust you best know how unjust indignationand you infer from these that my affection for my husband is extinguished i deserve thisbut do not punish me too severely i still kept my hand upon the lock of the door expostulating with lady leonora in your graces name and in mr ls assuring her that if he were conscious of what was passing and able to speak he would order me to prevent her seeing him in his present situation and you too general said she bursting into tears i thought you were my friendwould you prevent me from seeing him and is not he conscious of what is passing and is not he able to speak sir i must be admitted you have done your dutynow let me do mine consider my right is superior to yours no power on earth should or can prevent a wife from seeing her husband when he is dear dear general said she clasping her raised hands and falling suddenly at my feet let me see him but for one minute and i will be grateful to you for ever i could resist no longeri tremble for the consequences i know your grace sufficiently to be aware that you ought to be told the whole truth i have but little hopes of my poor friends life with much respect your graces faithful servant jb letter xcviii olivia to mr l richmond a mist hung over my eyes and my ears with hollow murmurs rung when the dreadful tidings of your alarming illness were announced by your cruel messenger my dearest l why does inexorable destiny doom me to be absent from you at such a crisis oh this fatal wound of mine it would i fear certainly open again if i were to travel so this corporeal being must be imprisoned here while my anxious soul my viewless spirit hovers near you longing to minister each tender consolation each nameless comfort that love alone can with fond prescience and magic speed summon round the couch of pain o that i had the wings of a dove that i might fly to you why must i resign the sweetlypainful task of soothing you in the hour of sickness and shall others with officious zeal guess the faint wish explain the asking eye alas it must be soeven were i to fly to him my sensibility could not support the scene to behold him stretched on the bed of diseaseperhaps of deathwould be agony past endurance let firmer nerves than olivias and hearts more callous assume the offices from which they shrink not tis the fate the hard fate of all endued with exquisite sensibility to be palsied by the excess of their feelings and to become imbecile at the moment their exertions are most necessary your too tenderly sympathizing olivia letter xcix leonora to her mother yarmouth my husband is alive and that is all never did i see nor could i have conceived such a change and in so short a time when i opened the door his eyes turned upon me with unmeaning eagerness he did not know me the good general thought my voice might have some effect i spoke but could obtain no answer no sign of intelligence in vain i called upon him by every name that used to reach his heart i kneeled beside him and took one of his burning hands in mine i kissed it and suddenly he started up exclaiming olivia olivia with dreadful vehemence in his delirium he raved about olivias stabbing herself and called upon us to hold her arm looking wildly towards the foot of the bed as if the figure were actually before him then he sunk back as if quite exhausted and gave a deep sigh some of my tears fell upon his hand he felt them before i perceived that they had fallen and looked so earnestly in my face that i was in hopes his recollection was returning but he only said olivia i believe that you love me then sighed more deeply than before drew his hand away from me and as well as i could distinguish said something about leonora but why should i give you the pain of hearing all these circumstances my dear mother it is enough to say that he passed a dreadful night this morning the physicians say that if he passes this nightifmy dear mother what a terrible suspense leonora l letter c leonora to her mother yarmouth morning is at last come and my husband is still alive so there is yet hope when i said i thought i could bear to survive him how little i knew of myself and how little how very little i expected to be so soon tried all evils are remediable but one that one which i dare not name the physicians assure me that he is better his friend to whose judgment i trust more thinks as they do i know not what to believe i dread to flatter myself and to be disappointed i will write again dearest mother tomorrow your ever affectionate leonora l letter ci leonora to her mother wednesday no material change since yesterday my dear mother this morning as i was searching for some medicine i saw on the chimneypiece a note from lady olivia it might have been there yesterday and ever since my arrival but i did not see it at any other time it would have excited my indignation but my mind is now too much weakened by sorrow my fears for my husbands life absorb all other feelings letter cii olivia to mr l richmond words cannot express what i have suffered since i wrote last oh why do i not bear that the danger is overlong since would i have been with you all that my soul holds dear could i have escaped from these tyrants these medical despots who detain me by absolute force and watch over me with unrelenting vigilance i have consulted dr who assures me that my fears of my wound opening were i to take so long a journey are too wellfounded that in the present feverish state of my mind he would not answer for the consequences i heed him notlife i value notmost joyfully would i sacrifice myself for the man i love but even could i escape from my persecutors too well i know that to see you would be a vain attempttoo well i know that i should not be admitted your love your fears for olivia would barbarously banish her and forbid her your dear your dangerous atmosphere too justly would you urge that my rashness might prove our mutual ruinthat in the moment of crisis or of convalescence anxiety for me might defeat the kind purpose of nature and even were i secure of your recovery the delay i speak not of the danger of my catching the disease would circumstanced as we are be death to our hopes we should be compelled to part the winds would waft you from me the waves would bear you to another region faroh far from your olivia letter ciii general b to the duchess of

to her mother my dearest mother yarmouth the delirium has subsided a few minutes ago as i was kneeling beside him offering up an almost hopeless prayer for his recovery his eyes opened and i perceived that he knew me he closed his eyes again without speaking opened them once more and then looking at me fixedly exclaimed it is not a dream you are leonoramy leonora what exquisite pleasure i felt at the sound of these words at the tone in which they were pronounced my husband folded me in his arms and till i felt his burning lips i forgot that he was ill when he came thoroughly to his recollection and when the idea that his fever might be infectious occurred to him he endeavoured to prevail upon me to leave the room but what danger can there be for me now my whole soul my whole frame is inspired with new life if he recover your daughter may still be happy letter cv general bto the duchess of my dear madam a few hours ago my friend became perfectly sensible of his danger and calling me to his bedside told me that he was eager to make use of the little time which he might have to live he was quite calm and collected he employed me to write his last wishes and bequests and i must do him the justice to declare that the strongest idea and feeling in his mind evidently was the desire to show his entire confidence in his wife and to give her in his last moments proofs of his esteem and affection when he had settled his affairs he begged to be left alone for some time between twelve and one his bell rang and he desired to see lady leonora and me he spoke to me with that warmth of friendship which he has ever felt from our childhood then turning to his wife his voice utterly failed and he could only press to his lips that hand which was held out to him in speechless agony excellent woman he articulated at last then collecting his mind he exclaimed my beloved leonora i will not die without expressing my feelings for you i know yours for me i do not ask for that forgiveness which your generous heart granted long before i deserved it your affection for me has been shown by actions at the hazard of your life i can only thank you with weak words you possess my whole heart my esteem my admiration my gratitude lady leonora at the word gratitude made an effort to speak and laid her hand upon her husbands lips he added in a more enthusiastic tone you

callous is that heart which knows not that there is a pang more dreadful than absencefar as the death of lingering torture exceeds in corporeal sufferance the soft slumber of expiring nature suspense suspense compared with thy racking agony even absence is but the blessed euthanasia of love my dearest l why this torturing silence one line one word i beseech you from your own hand say but i live and love you my olivia hour after hour and day after day have i waited and waited and hoped and feared to hear from you oh this intolerable agonizing suspense yet hope clings to my fond hearthope

out of danger and as soon as my strength is sufficient to bear the voyage i shall sail according to my promise your prudence or that of your physician has saved me much anxietyperhaps saved my life for had you been so rash as to come hither besides my fears for your safety i should have been exposed in the moment of my returning reason to a conflict of passions which i could not have borne leonora is with me she arrived the night after i was taken ill and forced her way to me when my fever was at the highest and while i was in a state of delirium lady leonora will stay with me till the moment i sail which i expect to do in about ten days i cannot say positively for i am still very weak and may not be able to keep my word to a day adieu i hope your mind will now be at ease i am glad

power what phrasesyou will sail according to your promisethen nothing but your honour binds you to olivia and even now at this guilty instant in your secret soul you wish you expect from my offended pride from my disgusted delicacy a renunciation of this promise a release from all the ties that bind you to me you are right this is what i ought to do what i would do if love had not so weakened my soul so prostrated my spirit rendered me so abject a creature that i cannot what i would i must love onfemale pride and resentment call upon me in vain i cannot hate you even by the feeble tie which i see you long to break i must hold rather than let you go for ever i will not renounce your promise i claim it i adjure you by all which a man of honour holds most sacred to quit england the moment your health will allow you to sail no equivocating with your consciencei hold you to your word oh my dearest l to feel myself reduced to use such language to you to find myself clinging to that last resource of shipwrecked love a promise it is with unspeakable agony i feel all this lower i cannot sink in misery raise me if indeed you wish my happinessraise me it is yet in your power tell me that my too susceptible heart has mistaken phantoms for realitiestell me that your last was not colder than usual yes i am ready to be deceived tell me that it was only the languor of disease assure me that my rival forced her way only to your presence that she has not won her easy way back to your heartassure me that you are impatient once more to see your own olivia letter cxi leonora to her mother my dearest mother yarmouth can you believe or imagine that i am actually unwilling to say or to think that mr l is quite well yet this is the fact such is the inconsistency and weakness of our naturesof my nature i should say but a short time ago i thought that no evil could be so great as his danger now that danger is past i dread to hear him say that he is perfectly recovered the moment he is able he goes to russia that is decided irrevocably the promise has been claimed and repeated a solemn promise cannot be broken for any human consideration i should despise him if he broke it but can i love him for keeping it his mind is at this instant agitated as much as mine ismore it cannot be yet i ought to be better able to part with him now than when we parted before because i have now at least the consolation of knowing that he leaves me against his willthat his heart will not go from me this time i cannot be deceived i have had the most explicit assurances of his undivided love and indeed i was never deceived all the appearances of regret at parting with me were genuine the general witnessed the consequent struggle in mr ls mind and this fever followed i will endeavour to calm and content myself with the possession of his love and with the assurance that he will return to me as soon as possible as soon as possible but what a vague hope he sails with the first fair wind what a dreadful certainty perhaps tomorrow oh my dearest mother perhaps tonight leonora l letter cxii general b to the duchess of my dear madam yarmouth today mr l finding himself sufficiently recovered gave orders to all his suite to embark and the wind being fair determined to go on board immediately in the midst of the bustle of the preparations for his departure lady leonora exhausted by her former activity and unable to take any part in what was passing sat silent pale and motionless opposite to a window which looked out upon the sea the vessel in which her husband was to sail lay in sight and her eyes were fixed upon the streamers watching their motion in the wind mr l was in his own apartment writing letters an express arrived and among other letters for the english ambassador to russia there was a large packet directed to lady leonora l upon opening it the crimson colour flew into her face and she exclaimed olivias letterslady olivias letters to mad de p who could send these to me i give you joy with all my heart cried i no matter how they comethey come in the most fortunate moment possible i would stake my life upon it they will unmask olivia at once where is mr l he must read them this moment i was hurrying out of the room to call my friend but lady leonora stopped my career and checked the transport of my joy you do not think my dear general said she that i would for any consideration do so dishonourable an action as to read these letters only let mr l read them interrupted i that is all i ask of your ladyship give them to me for the soul of me i can see nothing dishonourable in this let lady olivia be judged by her own words your ladyship shall not be troubled with her trash but give the letters to me i beseech you no i cannot said lady leonora steadily it is a great temptation but i ought not to yield she deliberately folded them up in a blank cover directed them to lady olivia and sealed them whilst i half in admiration and half in anger went on expostulating good god this is being too generous but my dear lady leonora why will you sacrifice yourself this is misplaced delicacy show those letters and ill lay my life mr l never goes to russia my dear friend said she looking up with tears in her eyes do not tempt me beyond my power to resist say no more at this instant mr lcame into the room and i am ashamed to confess to your grace i really was so little master of myself that i was upon the point of seizing olivias letters and putting them into his hands l said i here is your admirable wife absurdly yes i must say it absurdly standing upon a point of honour with one who has none that packet which she has before her lady leonora imposed silence upon me by one of those looks which no man can resist my dear leonora you are right said mr l and you are almost right my dear general i know what that packet contains and without doing anything dishonourable i hold myself absolved from my promise i shall not go to russia my dearest wife he flew into her armsand i left them i question whether they either of them felt much more than i did for some minutes i was content with knowing that these things had really happened that i had heard mr l say he was absolved from all promises and that he would not go to russia but how did all this happen so suddenlyhow did he know the contents of olivias letters and without doing any thing dishonourable there are some people who cannot be perfectly happy till they know the rationale of their happiness i am one of these i did not feel a sober certainty of waking bliss till i read a letter which mr l received by the same express that brought olivias letters and which he read while we were debating i beg your graces pardon if i am too minute in explanation but i do as i would be done by the letter was from one of the private secretaries who is i understand a relation and friend of lady leonora l as the original goes this night to lady olivia i send your grace a copy you will give me credit for copying and at such a time as this i congratulate your grace and i have the honour to be c j b letter cxiii to mr l private london st jamessstreet my dear sir in the same moment you receive this your lady for whom i have the highest regard will receive from me a valuable present a packet of lady olivia s letters to one of her french friends these letters were lately found in a french frigate taken by one of our cruisers and as intercepted correspondence is the order of the day these with all the despatches on board were transmitted to our office to be examined in hopes of making reprisals of state secrets some letters about the court and emperor of russia led us to suppose that we should find some political manoeuvres and we examined farther the examination fortunately fell to my lot as private secretary after looking them all over however i found that these papers contain only family secrets i obtained permission to send them to lady leonora l to ensure the triumph of virtue over viceto put it into her ladyships power completely to unmask her unworthy rival these letters will show you by what arts you have been deceived you will find yourself ridiculed as a cold awkward englishman one who will hottentot again whatever pains may be taken to civilize him a man of ice to be taken as a lover from pure charity or pure curiosity or the pure besoin daimer here are many pure motives of which you will my dear sir take your choice you will farther observe in one of her letters that lady olivia premeditated the design of prevailing with you to carry her to russia that she might show her power to that proudest of earthly prudes the duchess of and that she might gratify her great revenge against lady leonora l sincerely hoping my dear sir that these letters may open your eyes and restore you and my amiable relation to domestic happiness i make no apology for the liberty i take and cannot regret the momentary pain i may inflict you

the exclusive society of your intimate friends spend your winters in london your rank your fortune and i may be permitted to add your character manners and abilities give you the power of drawing round you persons of the best information and of the highest talents your husband will find in such society every thing that can attach him to his home and in you his most rational friend and his most charming companion who will excite him to every generous and noble exertion for the good and wise there is in love a power unknown to the ignorant and the vicious a power of communicating fresh energy to all the faculties of the soul of exalting them to the highest state of perfection the friendship which in later life succeeds to such love is perhaps the greatest and certainly the most permanent blessing of life an admirable german writeryou see my dear that i have no prejudices against good german writersan admirable german writer says that love is like the morning shadows which diminish as the day advances but friendship is like the shadows of the evening which increase even till the setting of the sun letter from a gentleman to his friend upon the birth of a daughter with the answer i congratulate you my dear sir upon the birth of your daughter and i wish that some of the fairies of ancient times were at hand to endow the damsel with health wealth wit and beauty witi should make a long pause before i accepted of this gift for a daughteryou would make none as i know it to be your opinion that it is in the power of education more certainly than it was ever believed to be in the power of fairies to bestow all mental gifts and as i have heard you say that education should begin as early as possible i am in haste to offer you my sentiments lest my advice should come too late your general ideas of the habits and virtues essential to the perfection of the female character nearly agree with mine but we differ materially as to the cultivation which it is necessary or expedient to bestow upon the understandings of women you are a champion for the rights of woman and insist upon the equality of the sexes but since the days of chivalry are past and since modern gallantry permits men to speak at least to one another in less sublime language of the fair i may confess to you that i see neither from experience nor analogy much reason to believe that in the human species alone there are no marks of inferiority in the femalecurious and admirable exceptions there may be but many such have not fallen within my observation i cannot say that i have been much enraptured either on a first view or on a closer inspection with female prodigies prodigies are scarcely less offensive to my taste than monsters humanity makes us refrain from expressing disgust at the awkward shame of the one whilst the intemperate vanity of the other justly provokes ridicule and indignation i have always observed in the understandings of women who have been too much cultivated some disproportion between the different faculties of their minds one power of the mind undoubtedly may be cultivated at the expense of the rest as we see that one muscle or limb may acquire excessive strength and an unnatural size at the expense of the health of the whole body i cannot think this desirable either for the individual or for societythe unfortunate people in certain mountains of switzerland are some of them proud of the excrescence by which they are deformed i have seen women vain of exhibiting mental deformities which to me appeared no less disgusting in the course of my life it has never been my good fortune to meet with a female whose mind in strength just proportion and activity i could compare to that of a sensible man allowing however that women are equal to our sex in natural abilities from their situation in society from their domestic duties their taste for dissipation their love of romance poetry and all the lighter parts of literature their time must be so fully occupied that they could never have leisure for even supposing that they were capable of that severe application to which our sex submitbetween persons of equal genius and equal industry time becomes the only measure of their acquirementsnow calculate the time which is wasted by the fair sex and tell me how much the start of us they ought to have in the beginning of the race if they are to reach the goal before usit is not possible that women should ever be our equals in knowledge unless you assert that they are far our superiors in natural capacitynot only time but opportunity must be wanting to complete female studieswe mix with the world without restraint we converse freely with all classes of people with men of wit of science of learning with the artist the mechanic the labourer every scene of life is open to our view every assistance that foreign or domestic ingenuity can invent to encourage literary studies is ours almost exclusively from academies colleges public libraries private associations of literary men women are excluded if not by law at least by custom which cannot easily be conqueredwhenever women appear even when we seem to admit them as our equals in understanding every thing assumes a different form our politeness delicacy habits towards the sex forbid us to argue or to converse with them as we do with one anotherwe see things as they are but women must always see things through a veil or cease to be womenwith these insuperable difficulties in their education and in their passage through life it seems impossible that their minds should ever acquire that vigour and efficiency which accurate knowledge and various experience of life and manners can bestow much attention has lately been paid to the education of the female sex and you will say that we have been amply repaid for our carethat ladies have lately exhibited such brilliant proofs of genius as must dazzle and confound their critics i do not ask for proofs of genius i ask for solid proofs of utility in which of the useful arts in which of the exact sciences have we been assisted by female sagacity or penetrationi should be glad to see a list of discoveries of inventions of observations evincing patient research of truths established upon actual experiment or deduced by just reasoning from previous principlesif these or any of these can be presented by a female champion for her sex i shall be the first to clear the way for her to the temple of fame i must not speak of my contemporaries else candour might oblige me to allow that there are some few instances of great talents applied to useful purposesbut except these what have been the literary productions of women in poetry plays romances in the art of imposing upon the understanding by means of the imagination they have excelledbut to useful literature they have scarcely turned their thoughts i have never heard of any female proficients in sciencefew have pretended to science till within these few years you will tell me that in the most difficult and most extensive science of politics women have succeededyou will cite the names of some illustrious queens i am inclined to think with the duke of burgundy that queens who reigned well were governed by men and kings who reigned ill were governed by women the isolated examples of a few heroines cannot convince me that it is safe or expedient to trust the sex with powertheir power over themselves has regularly been found to diminish in proportion as their power over others has been increased i should not refer you to the scandalous chronicles of modern times to volumes of private anecdotes or to the abominable secret histories of courts where female influence and female depravity are synonymous terms but i appeal to the open equitable page of history to a body of evidence collected from the testimony of ages for experiments tried upon the grandest scale of which nature admits registered by various hands without the possibility of collusion and without a view to any particular systemfrom these you must be convinced that similar consequences have uniformly resulted from the same causes in nations the most unlike and at periods the most distant trace the history of female nature from the court of augustus to the court of louis the fourteenth and tell me whether you can hesitate to acknowledge that the influence the liberty and the power of women have been constant concomitants of the moral and political decline of empiresi say the concomitants where events are thus invariably connected i might be justified in saying that they were causesyou would call them effects but we need not dispute about the momentary precedence of evils which are found to be inseparable companionsthey may be alternately cause and effectthe reality of the connexion is established it may be difficult to ascertain precisely its nature you will assert that the fatal consequences which have resulted from our trusting the sex with liberty and power have been originally occasioned by the subjection and ignorance in which they had previously been held and of our subsequent folly and imprudence in throwing the reins of dominion into hands unprepared and uneducated to guide them i am at a loss to conceive any system of education that can properly prepare women for the exercise of power cultivate their understandings cleanse the visual orb with euphrasy and rue till they can with one comprehensive glance take in one half at least of round eternity still you have no security that their reason will govern their conduct the moral character seems even amongst men of superior strength of mind to have no certain dependence upon the reasoning facultyhabit prejudice taste example and the different strength of various passions form the moral character we are impelled to action frequently contrary to the belief of our sober reason and we pursue what we could in the hour of deliberation demonstrate to be inconsistent with that greatest possible share of happiness which it is the object of every rational creature to secure we frequently think with one species of enthusiasm and act with another and can we expect from women more consistency of conduct if they are allowed the same libertyno one can feel more strongly than you do the necessity and the value of female integrity no one can more clearly perceive how much in society depends upon the honour of women and how much it is the interest of every individual as well as of every state to guard their virtue and to preserve inviolate the purity of their manners allow me then to warn you of the danger of talking in loud strains to the sex of the noble contempt of prejudice you would look with horror at one who should go to sap the foundations of the building beware then how you venture to tear away the ivy which clings to the walls and braces the loose stones together i am by no means disposed to indulge in the fashionable ridicule of prejudice there is a sentimental metaphysical argument which independently of all others has lately been used to prevail upon us to relinquish that superiority which strength of body in savage and strength of mind in civilized nations secure to man we are told that as women are reasonable creatures they should be governed only by reason and that we disgrace ourselves and enslave them when we instil even the most useful truths as prejudicesmorality should we are told be founded upon demonstration not upon sentiment and we should not require human beings to submit to any laws or customs without convincing their understandings of the universal utility of these political conventions when are we to expect this conviction we cannot expect it from childhood scarcely from youth but from the maturity of the understanding we are told that we may expect it with certaintyand of what use can it then be to us when the habits are fixed when the character is decided when the manners are formed what can be done by the bare conviction of the understanding what could we expect from that woman whose moral education was to begin at the moment when she was called upon to act and who without having imbibed in her early years any of the salutary prejudices of her sex or without having been educated in the amiable acquiescence to well established maxims of female prudence should boldly venture to conduct herself by the immediate conviction of her understanding i care not for the names or titles of my guides all that i shall inquire is which is best acquainted with the road provided women be conducted quietly to their good it is scarcely worth their while to dispute about the pompous metaphysical names or precedency of their motives why should they deem it disgraceful to be induced to pursue their interest by what some philosophers are pleased to call weak motives is it not much less disgraceful to be peaceably governed by weak reasons than to be incapable of being restrained by the strongest the dignity of human nature and the boasted freewill of rational agents are highsounding words likely to impose upon the vanity of the fair sex as well as upon the pride of ours but if we analyze the ideas annexed to these terms to what shall we reduce them reason in its highest perfection seems just to arrive at the certainty of instinct and truth impressed upon the mind in early youth by the united voice of affection and authority gives all the real advantages of the most investigating spirit of philosophy if the result of the thought experience and sufferings of one race of beings is when inculcated upon the belief of the next to be stigmatized as prejudice there is an end to all the benefits of history and of education the mutual intercourse of individuals and of nations must be only for the traffic or amusement of the day every age must repeat the same experiments every man and every nation must make the same mistakes and suffer the same miseries whilst the civilization and happiness of the world if not retrograde in their course must for ever be stationary let us not then despise or teach the other sex to despise the traditional maxims of experience or those early prepossessions which may be termed prejudices but which in reality serve as their moral instinct i can see neither tyranny on our part nor slavery on theirs in this system of education this sentimental or metaphysical appeal to our candour and generosity has then no real force and every other argument for the literary and philosophical education of women and for the extraordinary cultivation of their understandings i have examined you probably imagine that by the superior ingenuity and care you may bestow on your daughters education you shall make her an exception to general maxims you shall give her all the blessings of a literary cultivation and at the same time preserve her from all the follies and faults and evils which have been found to attend the character of a literary lady systems produce projects and as projects in education are of all others the most hazardous they should not be followed till after the most mature deliberation though it may be natural is it wise for any man to expect extraordinary success from his efforts or his precautions beyond what has ever been the share of those who have had motives as strong for care and for exertion and some of whom were possibly his equals in ability is it not incumbent upon you as a parent and as a philosopher to calculate accurately what you have to fear as well as what you have to hope you can at present with a sober degree or interest bear to hear me enumerate the evils and ridicule the foibles incident to literary ladies but if your daughter were actually in this class you would not think it friendly if i were to attack them in this favourable moment then i beg you to hear me with temper and as i touch upon every danger and every fault consider cautiously whether you have a certain preventive or a specific remedy in store for each of them women of literature are much more numerous of late than they were a few years ago they make a class in society they fill the public eye and have acquired a degree of consequence and an appropriate character the esteem of private friends and the admiration of the public for their talents are circumstances highly flattering to their vanity and as such i will allow them to be substantial pleasures i am also ready to acknowledge that a taste for literature adds much to the happiness of life and that women may enjoy to a certain degree this happiness as well as men but with literary women this silent happiness seems at best but a subordinate consideration it is not by the treasures they possess but by those which they have an opportunity of displaying that they estimate their wealth to obtain public applause they are betrayed too often into a miserable ostentation of their learning coxe tells us that certain russian ladies split their pearls in order to make a greater display of finery the pleasure of being admired for wit or erudition i cannot exactly measure in a female mind but state it to be as delightful as you can imagine it to be there are evils attendant upon it which in the estimation of a prudent father may overbalance the good the intoxicating effect of wit upon the brain has been well remarked by a poet who was a friend to the fair sex and too many ridiculous and too many disgusting examples confirm the truth of the observation the deference that is paid to genius sometimes makes the fair sex forget that genius will be respected only when united with discretion those who have acquired fame fancy that they can afford to sacrifice reputation i will suppose however that their heads shall be strong enough to bear inebriating admiration and that their conduct shall be essentially irreproachable yet they will show in their manners and conversation that contempt of inferior minds and that neglect of common forms and customs which will provoke the indignation of fools and which cannot escape the censure of the wise even whilst we are secure of their innocence we dislike that daring spirit in the female sex which delights to oppose the common opinions of society and from apparent trifles we draw unfavourable omens which experience too often confirms you will ask me why i should suppose that wits are more liable to be spoiled by admiration than beauties who have usually a larger share of it and who are not more exempt from vanity those who are vain of trifling accomplishments of rank of riches or of beauty depend upon the world for their immediate gratification they are sensible of their dependence they listen with deference to the maxims and attend with anxiety to the opinions of those from whom they expect their reward and their daily amusements in their subjection consists their safety whilst women who neither feel dependent for amusement nor for selfapprobation upon company and public places are apt to consider this subjection as humiliating if not insupportable perceiving their own superiority they despise and even set at defiance the opinions of their acquaintance of inferior abilities contempt where it cannot be openly retorted produces aversion not the less to be dreaded because constrained to silence envy considered as the involuntary tribute extorted by merit is flattering to pride and i know that many women delight to excite envy even whilst they affect to fear its consequences but they who imprudently provoke it are little aware of the torments they prepare for themselvescover your face well before you disturb the hornets nest was a maxim of the experienced catherine de medici men of literature if we may trust to the bitter expressions of anguish in their writings and in their private letters feel acutely all the stings of envy women who have more susceptibility of temper and less strength of mind and who from the delicate nature of their reputation are more exposed to attack are also less able to endure it malignant critics when they cannot attack an authors peace in his writings frequently scrutinize his private life and every personal anecdote is published without regard to truth or propriety how will the delicacy of the female character endure this treatment how will her friends bear to see her pursued even in domestic retirement if she should be wise enough to make that retirement her choice how will they like to see premature memoirs and spurious collections of familiar letters published by needy booksellers or designing enemies yet to all these things men of letters are subject and such must literary ladies expect if they attain to any degree of eminencejudging then from the experience of our sex i may pronounce envy to be one of the evils which women of uncommon genius have to dread censure says a celebrated writer is a tax which every man must pay to the public who seeks to be eminent women must expect to pay it doubly your daughter perhaps shall be above scandal she shall despise the idle whisper and the common tattle of her sex her soul shall be raised above the ignorant and the frivolous she shall have a relish for higher conversation and a taste for higher society but where is she to find or how is she to obtain this society you make her incapable of friendship with her own sex where is she to look for friends for companions for equals amongst men amongst what class of men not amongst men of business or men of gallantry but amongst men of literature learned men have usually chosen for their wives or for their companions women who were rather below than above the standard of mediocrity this seems to me natural and reasonable such men probably feel their own incapacity for the daily business of life their ignorance of the world their slovenly habits and neglect of domestic affairs they do not want wives who have precisely their own defects they rather desire to find such as shall by the opposite habits and virtues supply their deficiencies i do not see why two books should marry any more than two estates some few exceptions might be quoted against stewarts observations i have just seen under the article a literary wife in disraelis curiosities of literature an account of francis phidelphus a great scholar in the fifteenth century who was so desirous of acquiring the greek language in perfection that he travelled to constantinople in search of a grecian wife the lady proved a scold but to do justice to the name of theodora as this author adds she has been honourably mentioned in the french academy of sciences i hope this proved an adequate compensation to her husband for his domestic broils happy mad dacier you found a husband suited to your taste you and mons dacier if dalembert tells the story rightly once cooked a dish in concert by a receipt which you found in apicius and you both sat down and ate of your learned ragout till you were both like to die were i sure my dear friend that every literary lady would be equally fortunate in finding in a husband a man who would sympathize in her tastes i should diminish my formidable catalogue of evils but alas m dacier is no more and we shall never live to see his fellow literary ladies will i am afraid be losers in love as well as in friendship by the superioritycupid is a timid playful child and is frightened at the helmet of minerva it has been observed that gentlemen are not apt to admire a prodigious quantity of learning and masculine acquirements in the fair sexwe usually consider a certain degree of weakness both of mind and body as friendly to female grace i am not absolutely of this opinion yet i do not see the advantage of supernatural force either of body or mind to female excellence herculesspinster found his strength rather an incumbrance than an advantage superiority of mind must be united with great temper and generosity to be tolerated by those who are forced to submit to its influence i have seen witty and learned ladies who did not seem to think it at all incumbent upon them to sacrifice any thing to the sense of propriety on the contrary they seemed to take both pride and pleasure in showing the utmost stretch of their strength regardless of the consequences panting only for victory upon such occasions when the adversary has been a husband or a father i must acknowledge that i have felt sensations which few ladies can easily believe they excite airs and graces i can bear as well as another but airs without graces no man thinks himself bound to bear and learned airs least of all ladies of high rank in the court of parnassus are apt sometimes to claim precedency out of their own dominions which creates much confusion and generally ends in their being affronted that knowledge of the world which keeps people in their proper places they will never learn from the muses moliere has pointed out with all the force of comic ridicule in the femmes savantes that a lady who aspires to the sublime delights of philosophy and poetry must forego the simple pleasures and will despise the duties of domestic life i should not expect that my house affairs would be with haste despatched by a desdemona weeping over some unvarnished tale or petrified with some history of horrors at the very time when she should be ordering dinner or paying the butchers billi should have the less hope of rousing her attention to my culinary concerns and domestic grievances because i should probably incur her contempt for hinting at these sublunary matters and her indignation for supposing that she ought to be employed in such degrading occupations i have heard that if these sublime geniuses are awakened from their reveries by the appulse of external circumstances they start and exhibit all the perturbation and amazement of cataleptic patients sir charles harrington in the days of queen elizabeth addressed a copy of verses to his wife on womens vertuesthese he divides into the private civill and heroyke the private belong to the country housewife whom it concerned chiefly the fruit malt hops to tend to dry to utter to beat strip spin the wool the hemp the flax breed poultry gather honey try the wax and more than all to have good cheese and butter then next a step but yet a large step higher came civill vertue fitter for the citty with modest looks good clothes and answers witty these baser things not done but guided by her as for heroyke vertue and heroyke dames honest sir charles would have nothing to do with them allowing however that you could combine all these virtuesthat you could form a perfect whole a female wonder from every creatures bestdangers still threaten you how will you preserve your daughter from that desire of universal admiration which will ruin all your work how will you along with all the pride of knowledge give her that retiring modesty which is supposed to have more charms for our sex than the fullest display of wit and beauty the fair pauca of thoulouse was so called because she was so fair that no one could live either with or without beholding herwhenever she came forth from her own mansion which history observes she did very seldom such impetuous crowds rushed to obtain a sight of her that limbs were broken and lives were lost wherever she appeared she ventured abroad less frequentlythe evil increasedtill at length the magistrates of the city issued an edict commanding the fair pauca under the pain of perpetual imprisonment to appear in broad daylight for one hour every week in the public marketplace modern ladies by frequenting public places so regularly declare their approbation of the wholesome regulations of these prudent magistrates very different was the crafty policy of the prophet mahomet who forbad his worshippers even to paint his picture the turks have pictures of the hand the foot the features of mahomet but no representation of the whole face or person is allowed the portraits of our beauties in our exhibitionroom show a proper contempt of this insidious policy and those learned and ingenious ladies who publish their private letters select maxims secret anecdotes and family memoirs are entitled to our thanks for thus presenting us with fulllengths of their minds can you expect my dear sir that your daughter with all the genius and learning which you intend to give her should refrain from these imprudent exhibitions will she yield her charms of mind with sweet delay will she in every moment of her life recollect that the fatal desire for universal applause always defeats its own purpose especially if the purpose be to win our love as well as our admiration it is in vain to tell me that more enlarged ideas in our sex would alter our tastes and alter even the associations which now influence our passions the captive who has numbered the links of his chains and has even discovered how these chains are constructed is not therefore nearer to the recovery of his liberty besides it must take a length of time to alter associations and opinions which if not just are at least common in our sex you cannot expect even that conviction should operate immediately upon the public taste you will in a few years have educated your daughter and if the world be not educated exactly at the right time to judge of her perfections to admire and love them you will have wasted your labour and you will have sacrificed your daughters happiness that happiness analyze it as a man of the world or as a philosopher must depend on friendship love the exercise of her virtues the just performance of all the duties of life and the selfapprobation arising from the consciousness of good conduct i am my dear friend yours sincerely answer to the preceding letter i have as little taste for mad daciers learned ragout as you can have my dear sir and i pity the great scholar who travelled to constantinople for the termagant theodora believing as you do that the honourable mention made of her by the french academy of sciences could be no adequate compensation to her husband for domestic disquiet but the ladys learning was not essential to his misfortune he might have met with a scolding dame though he had not married a grecian a profusion of vulgar aphorisms in the dialects of all the counties in england proverbs in welsh scotish french spanish italian and hebrew might be adduced to prove that scolds are to be found amongst all classes of women i am however willing to allow that the more learning and wit and eloquence a lady possesses the more troublesome and the more dangerous she may become as a wife or daughter unless she is also possessed of good sense and good temper of your honest sir charles harringtons two pattern wives i think i should prefer the country housewife with whom i could be sure of having good cheese and butter to the citty dame with her good clothes and answers wittyi should be afraid that these answers witty might be turned against me and might prove the torment of my lifeyou who have attended to female disputants must have remarked that learned or unlearned they seldom know how to reason they assert and declaim employ wit and eloquence and sophistry to confute persuade or abash their adversaries but distinct reasoning they neither use nor comprehendtill women learn to reason it is in vain that they acquire learning you are satisfied i am sure with this acknowledgment i will go farther and at once give up to you all the learned ladies that exist or that ever have existed but when i use the term literary ladies i mean women who have cultivated their understandings not for the purposes of parade but with the desire to make themselves useful and agreeable i estimate the value of a womans abilities and acquirements by the degree in which they contribute to her happiness you think yourself happy because you are wise said a philosopher to a pedanti think myself wise because i am happy you tell me that even supposing i could educate my daughter so as to raise her above the common faults and follies of her sex even supposing i could give her an enlarged understanding and literature free from pedantry she would be in danger of becoming unhappy because she would not amongst her own sex find friends suited to her taste nor amongst ours admirers adequate to her expectations you represent her as in the situation of the poor flyingfish exposed to dangerous enemies in her own element yet certain if she tries to soar above them of being pounced upon by the hawkeyed critics of the higher regions you allow however that women of literature are much more numerous of late than they were a few years ago that they make a class in society and have acquired a considerable degree of consequence and an appropriate character how can you then fear that a woman of cultivated understanding should be driven from the society of her own sex in search of dangerous companions amongst ours in the female world she will be neither without an equal nor without a judge she will not have much to fear from envy because its malignant eye will not fix upon one object exclusively when there are numbers to distract its attention and share the stroke the fragile nature of female friendships the petty jealousies which break out at the ball or in the drawingroom have been from time immemorial the jest of mankind trifles light as air will necessarily excite not only the jealousy but the envy of those who think only of trifles give them more employment for their thoughts give them a nobler spirit of emulation and we shall hear no more of these paltry feuds give them more useful and more interesting subjects of conversation and they become not only more agreeable but safer companions for each other unmarried women who have stored their minds with knowledge who have various tastes and literary occupations who can amuse and be amused in the conversation of wellinformed people are in no danger of becoming burthensome to their friends or to society though they may not be seen haunting every place of amusement or of public resort they are not isolated or forlorn by a variety of associations they are connected with the world and their sympathy is expanded and supported by the cultivation of their understandings nor can it sink settle and concentrate upon cats parrots and monkeys how far the human heart may be contracted by ignorance it is difficult to determine but i am little inclined to envy the simple pleasures of those whose understandings are totally uncultivatedsir william hamilton in his account of the last eruption of mount vesuvius gives us a curious picture of the excessive ignorance and stupidity of some nuns in a convent at torre del grecoone of these nuns was found warming herself at the redhot lava which had rolled up to the window of her cell it was with the greatest difficulty that these scarcely rational beings could be made to comprehend the nature of their danger and when at last they were prevailed upon to quit the convent and were advised to carry with them whatever they thought most valuable they loaded themselves with sweetmeatsthose who wish for ignorant wives may find them in other parts of the world as well as in italy i do not pretend that even by cultivating my daughters understanding i can secure for her a husband suited to her taste it will therefore be prudent to make her felicity in some degree independent of matrimony many parents have sufficient kindness and foresight to provide in point of fortune for their daughters but few consider that if a single life should be their choice or their doom something more is necessary to secure respect and happiness for them in the decline of life the silent unreproved pleasures of literature are the sure resource of those who have cultivated minds those who have not must wear out their disconsolate unoccupied old age as chance directs when you say that men of superior understanding dislike the appearance of extraordinary strength of mind in the fair sex you probably mean that the display of that strength is disgusting and you associate with the idea of strength of mind masculine arrogant or pedantic manners but there is no necessary connexion between these things and it seems probable that the faults usually ascribed to learned ladies like those peculiar to learned men may have arisen in a great measure from circumstances which the progress of civilization in society has much altered in the times of ignorance men of deep science were considered by the vulgar as a class of necromancers and they were looked upon alternately with terror and admiration and learned men imposed upon the vulgar by assuming strange airs of mystery and selfimportance wore long beards and solemn looks they spoke and wrote in a phraseology peculiar to themselves and affected to consider the rest of mankind as beneath their notice but since knowledge has been generally diffused all this affectation has been laid aside and though we now and then hear of men of genius who indulge themselves in peculiarities yet upon the whole the manners of literary men are not strikingly nor wilfully different from those of the rest of the world the peculiarities of literary women will also disappear as their numbers increase you are disgusted by their ostentation of learning have patience with them my dear sir their taste will become more simple when they have been taught by experience that this parade is offensive even the bitter expression of your disgust may be advantageous to those whose manners are yet to be formed they will at least learn from it what to avoid and your letter may perhaps hereafter be of service in my daughters educationit is scarcely to be supposed that a girl of good understanding would deliberately imitate the faults and follies which she hears ridiculed during her childhood by those whom she esteems as to your dread of prodigies that will subsideprodigies are heard of most frequently during the ages of ignorance a woman may now possess a considerable stock of information without being gazed upon as a miracle of learning and there is not much danger of her being vain of accomplishments which cease to be astonishing nor will her peace be disturbed by the idle remarks of the ignorant vulgara literary lady is no longer a sight the spectacle is now too common to attract curiosity the species of animal is too well known even to admit of much exaggeration in the description of its appearance a lady riding on horseback upon a sidesaddle is not thought a wonderful thing by the common people in england but when an english lady rode upon a sidesaddle in an italian city where the sight was unusual she was universally gazed at by the populace to some she appeared an object of astonishment to others of compassionah poverina they exclaimed nha che una gamba the same objects excite different emotions in different situations and to judge what will astonish or delight any given set of people some years hence we must consider not merely what is the fashion of today but whither the current of opinion runs and what is likely to be the fashion of hereafteryou must have observed that public opinion is at present more favourable to the cultivation of the understanding of the female sex than it was some years ago more attention is paid to the education of women more knowledge and literature are expected from them in society from the literary lady of the present day something more is expected than that she should know how to spell and to write better than swifts celebrated stella whom he reproves for writing villian and daengerperhaps this very stella was an object of envy in her own day to those who were her inferiors in literature no man wishes his wife to be obviously less cultivated than those of her own rank and something more is now required even from ordinary talents than what distinguished the accomplished lady of the seventeenth century what the standard of excellence may be in the next age we cannot ascertain but we may guess that the taste for literature will continue to be progressive therefore even if you assume that the education of the female sex should be guided by the taste and reigning opinions of ours and that it should be the object of their lives to win and keep our hearts you must admit the expediency of attending to that fashionable demand for literature and the fine arts which has arisen in society no woman can foresee what may be the taste of the man with whom she may be united much of her happiness however will depend upon her being able to conform her taste to his for this reason i should therefore in female education cultivate the general powers of the mind rather than any particular faculty i do not desire to make my daughter merely a musician a painter or a poet i do not desire to make her merely a botanist a mathematician or a chemist but i wish to give her early the habit of industry and attention the love of knowledge and the power of reasoning these will enable her to attend to excellence in any pursuit to which she may direct her talents you will observe that many things which formerly were thought above the comprehension of women or unfit for their sex are now acknowledged to be perfectly within the compass of their abilities and suited to their situationformerly the fair sex was kept in turkish ignorance every means of acquiring knowledge was discountenanced by fashion and impracticable even to those who despised fashionour books of science were full of unintelligible jargon and mystery veiled pompous ignorance from public contempt but now writers must offer their discoveries to the public in distinct terms which every body may understand technical language no longer supplies the place of knowledge and the art of teaching has been carried to such perfection that a degree of knowledge may now with ease be acquired in the course of a few years which formerly it was the business of a life to attain all this is much in favour of female literature ladies have become ambitious to superintend the education of their children and hence they have been induced to instruct themselves that they may be able to direct and inform their pupils the mother who now aspires to be the esteemed and beloved instructress of her children must have a considerable portion of knowledge science has of late been enlisted under the banners of imagination by the irresistible charms of genius by the same power her votaries will be led from the looser analogies which dress out the imagery of poetry to the stricter ones which form the ratiocination of philosophybotany has become fashionable in time it may become useful if it be not so already chemistry will follow botany chemistry is a science well suited to the talents and situation of women it is not a science of parade it affords occupation and infinite variety it demands no bodily strength it can be pursued in retirement it applies immediately to useful and domestic purposes and whilst the ingenuity of the most inventive mind may in this science be exercised there is no danger of inflaming the imagination because the mind is intent upon realities the knowledge that is acquired is exact and the pleasure of the pursuit is a sufficient reward for the labour footnote vide preface to darwins botanic garden a clear and ready knowledge of arithmetic is surely no useless acquirement for those who are to regulate the expenses of a family economy is not the mean penny wise and pound foolish policy which some suppose it to be it is the art of calculation joined to the habit of order and the power of proportioning our wishes to the means of gratifying them the little pilfering temper of a wife is despicable and odious to every man of sense but there is a judicious graceful species of economy which has no connexion with an avaricious temper and which as it depends upon the understanding can be expected only from cultivated minds women who have been well educated far from despising domestic duties will hold them in high respect because they will see that the whole happiness of life is made up of the happiness of each particular day and hour and that much of the enjoyment of these must depend upon the punctual practice of those virtues which are more valuable than splendid it is not i hope your opinion that ignorance is the best security for female virtue if this connexion between virtue and ignorance could once be clearly proved we ought to drown our books deeper than ever plummet soundedi say wefor the danger extends equally to both sexes unless you assert that the duties of men rest upon a more certain foundation than the duties of the other sex if our virtues can be demonstrated to be advantageous why should theirs suffer for being exposed to the light of reasonall social virtue conduces to our own happiness or that of our fellowcreatures can it weaken the sense of duty to illustrate this truthhaving once pointed out to the understanding of a sensible woman the necessary connexion between her virtues and her happiness must not those virtues and the means of preserving them become in her eyes objects of the most interesting importance but you fear that even if their conduct continued to be irreproachable the manners of women might be rendered less delicate by the increase of their knowledge you dislike in the female sex that daring spirit which despises the common forms of society and which breaks through the reserve and delicacy of female mannersso do iand the best method to make my pupil respect these things is to show her how they are indispensably connected with the largest interests of society surely this perception of the utility of forms apparently trifling must be a strong security to the prudential reserve of the sex and far superior to the automatic habits of those who submit to the conventions of the world without consideration or conviction habit confirmed by reason assumes the rank of virtue the motives that restrain from vice must be increased by the clear conviction that vice and wretchedness are inseparably united do not however imagine my dear sir that i shall attempt to lay moral demonstration before a child who could not possibly comprehend my meaning do not imagine that because i intend to cultivate my daughters understanding i shall neglect to give her those early habits of reserve and modesty which constitute the female characterbelieving as i do that woman as well as man may be called a bundle of habits i shall be peculiarly careful during my childs early education to give her as many good habits as possible by degrees as her understanding that is to say as her knowledge and power of reasoning shall increase i can explain the advantages of these habits and confirm their power by the voice of reason i lose no time i expose myself to no danger by this system on the contrary those who depend entirely upon the force of custom and prejudice expose themselves to infinite danger if once their pupils begin to reflect upon their own hoodwinked education they will probably suspect that they have been deceived in all that they have been taught and they will burst their bonds with indignationcredulity is always rash in the moment she detects the impositions that have been practised upon her easy temper in this inquiring age few have any chance of passing through life without being excited to examine the motives and principles from which they act is it not therefore prudent to cultivate the reasoning faculty by which alone this examination can be made with safety a false argument a repartee the charms of wit or eloquence the voice of fashion of folly of numbers might if she had no substantial reasons to support her cause put virtue not only out of countenance but out of humour you speak of moral instinct as far as i understand the term it implies certain habits early acquired from education to these i would add the power of reasoning and then and not till then i should think myself safefor i have observed that the pupils of habit are utterly confounded when they are placed in circumstances different from those to which they have been accustomedit has been remarked by travellers and naturalists that animals notwithstanding their boasted instinctive knowledge sometimes make strange and fatal mistakes in their conduct when they are placed in new situationsdestitute of the reasoning faculty and deceived by resemblances they mistake poison for food thus the bullfrog will swallow burning charcoal mistaking it for fireflies and the european hogs and poultry which travelled to surinam poisoned themselves by eating plants that were unknown to them footnote vide stedmens voyage to surinam vol ii p you seem my dear sir to be afraid that truth should not keep so firm a hold upon the mind as prejudice and you produce an allusion to justify your fears you tell us that civil society is like a building and you warn me not to tear down the ivy which clings to the walls and braces the loose stones togetheri believe that ivy in some situations tends to pull down the walls to which it clingsyou think it is not worth while to cultivate the understandings of women because you say that you have no security that the conviction of their reason will have any permanent good effect upon their conduct and to persuade me of this you bid me observe that men who are superior to women in strength of mind and judgment are frequently misled by their passions by this mode of argument you may conclude that reason is totally useless to the whole human race but you cannot with any show of justice infer that it ought to be monopolized by onehalf of mankind but why should you quarrel with reason because passion sometimes conquers heryou should endeavour to strengthen the connexion between theory and practice if it be not sufficiently strong already but you can gain nothing by destroying theoryhappiness is your aim but your unpractised or unsteady hand does not obey your will you do not at the first trial hit the mark preciselywould you because you are awkward insist upon being blind the strength of mind which enables people to govern themselves by their reason is not always connected with abilities even in their most cultivated state i deplore the instances which i have seen of this truth but i do not despair on the contrary i am excited to inquire into the causes of this phenomenon nor because i see some evil would i sacrifice the good upon a bare motive of suspicion it is a contradiction to say that giving the power to discern what is good is giving a disposition to prefer what is bad i acknowledge with regret that women who have been but half instructed who have seen only superficially the relations of moral and political ideas and who have obtained but an imperfect knowledge of the human heart have conducted themselves so as to disgrace their talents and their sex these are conspicuous and melancholy examples which are cited oftener with malice than with pity but i appeal to examples amongst our contemporaries to which every man of literature will immediately advert to prove that where the female understanding has been properly cultivated women have not only obtained admiration by their useful abilities but respect by their exemplary conduct i apprehend that many of the errors into which women of literature have fallen may have arisen from an improper choice of books those who read chiefly works of imagination receive from them false ideas of life and of the human heart many of these productions i should keep as i would deadly poison from my child i should rather endeavour to turn her attention to science than to romance and to give her early that taste for truth and utility which when once implanted can scarcely be eradicated there is a wide difference between innocence and ignorance ignorant women may have minds the most debased and perverted whilst the most cultivated understanding may be united with the most perfect innocence and simplicity even if literature were of no other use to the fair sex than to supply them with employment i should think the time dedicated to the cultivation of their minds well bestowed they are surely better occupied when they are reading or writing than when coqueting or gaming losing their fortunes or their characters you despise the writings of womenyou think that they might have made a better use of the pen than to write plays and poetry and romances considering that the pen was to women a new instrument i think they have made at least as good a use of it as learned men did of the needle some centuries ago when they set themselves to determine how many spirits could stand upon its point and were ready to tear one another to pieces in the discussion of this sublime question let the sexes mutually forgive each other their follies or what is much better let them combine their talents for their general advantageyou say that the experiments we have made do not encourage us to proceedthat the increased care and pains which have been of late years bestowed upon female education have produced no adequate returns but you in the same breath allow that amongst your contemporaries whom you prudently forbear to mention there are some instances of great talents applied to useful purposes did you expect that the fruits of good cultivation should appear before the seed was sown you triumphantly enumerate the disadvantages to which women from the laws and customs of society are liablethey cannot converse freely with men of wit science and learning nor even with the artist or artificers they are excluded from academies public libraries c even our politeness prevents us you say from ever speaking plain truth and sense to the fair sexevery assistance that foreign or domestic ingenuity can invent to encourage literary studies is as you boast almost exclusively ours and after pointing out all these causes for the inferiority of women in knowledge you ask for a list of the inventions and discoveries of those who by your own statement of the question have not been allowed opportunities for observation with the insulting injustice of an egyptian taskmaster you demand the work and deny the necessary materials i admit that with respect to the opportunities of acquiring knowledge institutions and manners are as you have stated much in favour of our sex but your argument concerning time appears to me to be unfoundedwomen who do not love dissipation must have more time for the cultivation of their understandings than men can have if you compute the whole of lifewhilst the knowledge of the learned languages continues to form an indispensable part of a gentlemans education many years of childhood and youth must be devoted to their attainmentduring these studies the general cultivation of the understanding is in some degree retarded all the intellectual powers are cramped except the memory which is sufficiently exercised but which is overloaded with words and with words that are not always understoodthe genius of living and of dead languages differs so much that the pains which are taken to write elegant latin frequently spoil the english stylegirls usually write much better than boys they think and express their thoughts clearly at an age when young men can scarcely write an easy letter upon any common occasion women do not read the good authors of antiquity as schoolbooks but they can have excellent translations of most of them when they are capable of tasting the beauties of compositioni know that it is supposed we cannot judge of the classics by translations and i am sensible that much of the merit of the originals may be lost but i think the difference in pleasure is more than overbalanced to women by the time that is saved and by the labour and misapplication of abilities which are spared if they do not acquire a classical taste neither do they imbibe classic prejudices nor are they early disgusted with literature by pedagogues lexicons grammars and all the melancholy apparatus of learningwomen begin to taste the pleasures of reading and the best authors in the english language are their amusement just at the age when young men disgusted by their studies begin to be ashamed of alluding to literature amongst their companions travelling lounging field sports gaming and what is called pleasure in various shapes usually fill the interval between quitting the university and settling for lifewhen this period is past business the necessity of pursuing a profession the ambition to shine in parliament or to rise in public life occupy a large portion of their livesin many professions the understanding is but partially cultivated and general literature must be neglected by those who are occupied in earning bread or amassing riches for their familymen of genius are often heard to complain that in the pursuit of a profession they are obliged to contract their inquiries and concentrate their powers statesmen lament that they must often pursue the expedient even when they discern that it is not the right and men of letters who earn their bread by their writings inveigh bitterly against the tyranny of booksellers who degrade them to the state of literary artisansliterary artisans is the comprehensive term under which a celebrated philosopher classes all those who cultivate only particular talents or powers of the mind and who suffer their other faculties to lose all strength and vigour for want of exercise the other sex have no such constraint upon their understandings neither the necessity of earning their bread nor the ambition to shine in public affairs hurry or prejudice their minds in domestic life they have leisure to be wise footnote professor dugald stewarthistory of the philosophy of the human mind far from being ashamed that so little has been done by female abilities in science and useful literature i am surprised that so much has been effected on natural history on criticism on moral philosophy on education they have written with elegance eloquence precision and ingenuity your complaint that women do not turn their attention to useful literature is surely illtimed if they merely increased the number of books in circulation you might declaim against them with success but when they add to the general fund of useful and entertaining knowledge you cannot with any show of justice prohibit their labours there can be no danger that the market should ever be overstocked with produce of intrinsic worth the despotic monarchs of spain forbid the exploring of any new gold or silver mines without the express permission of government and they have ordered several rich ones to be shut up as not equal to the cost of working there is some appearance of reason for this exertion of power it may prevent the world from being encumbered by nominal wealthbut the dutch merchants who burn whole cargoes of spice lest they should lower the price of the commodity in which they deal show a mean spirit of monopoly which can plead no plausible excusei hope you feel nothing like a disposition to spanish despotism or dutch jealousy when you would exclude female talents from the literary market you observe that since censure is a tax which every man must pay who aspires to eminence women must expect to pay it doubly why the tax should not be equally assessed i am at a loss to conjecture but in fact it does not fall very heavy upon those who have any portion of philosophy they may with the poet of reason exclaim though doubly taxd how little have i lost your dread of the envy attendant upon literary excellence might with equal justice be extended to every species of merit and might be urged against all that is good in art or naturescandal is said to attack always the fairest characters as the birds always peck most at the ripest fruit but would you for this reason have no fruit ripen or no characters aspire to excellence but if it be your opinion that women are naturally inferior to us in capacity why do you feel so much apprehension of their becoming eminent or of their obtaining power in consequence of the cultivation of their understandingsthese expressions of scorn and jealousy neutralize each other if your contempt were unmixed and genuine it would be cool and tranquil inclining rather to pity than to anger you say that in all animals the female is the inferior and you have never seen any reason to believe that the human species affords an exception to this observationsuperiority amongst brutes depends upon force superiority amongst the human species depends upon reason that men are naturally stronger than women is evident but strength of mind has no necessary connexion with strength of body and intellectual ability has ever conquered mere physical force from the times of ajax and ulysses to the present day in civilized nations that species of superiority which belongs to force is much reduced in value amongst the higher classes of societythe baron who struck his sword into an oak and defied any one to pull out the weapon would not in these days fill the hearts of his antagonists with terror nor would the twisting of a horseshoe be deemed a feat worthy to decide a nation in their choice of a kingthe days of chivalry are no more the knight no longer sallies forth in ponderous armour mounted upon a steed as invulnerable as himselfthe damsel no longer depends upon the prowess of his mighty arm to maintain the glory of her charms or the purity of her fame grim barons and castles guarded by monsters and alldevouring dragons are no more and from being the champions and masters of the fair sex we are now become their friends and companions we have not surely been losers by this change the fading glories of romance have vanished but the real permanent pleasures of domestic life remain in their stead and what the fair have lost of adulation they have gained in friendship footnote condorcethistory of the progress of the human mind do not my dear sir call me a champion for the rights of woman i am too much their friend to be their partisan and i am more anxious for their happiness than intent upon a metaphysical discussion of their rights their happiness is so nearly connected with ours that it seems to me absurd to manage any argument so as to set the two sexes at variance by vain contention for superiority it ought not to be our object to make an invidious division of privileges or an ostentatious declaration of rights but to determine what is most for our general advantage you fear that the minds of women should be enlarged and cultivated lest their power in society and their liberty should consequently increase observe that the word liberty applied to the female sex conveys alarming ideas to our minds because we do not stay to define the term we have a confused notion that it implies want of reserve want of delicacy boldness of manners or of conduct in short liberty to do wrongsurely this is a species of liberty which knowledge can never make desirable those who understand the real interests of society who clearly see the connexion between virtue and happiness must know that the liberty to do wrong is synonymous with the liberty to make themselves miserable this is a privilege of which none would choose to avail themselves when reason defines the term there is no danger of its being misunderstood but imagination and false associations often make this word liberty in its perverted sense sound delightful to those who have been kept in ignorance and slavery girls who have been disciplined under the strict high hand of authority are apt to fancy that to escape from habitual restraint to exercise their own will no matter how is to be free and to be happyhence innumerable errors in their conduct hence their mistaken notions of liberty and that inordinate ambition to acquire power which ignorant illeducated women show in every petty struggle where they are permitted to act in private life you believe this temper to be inherent in the sex and a man who has just published a book upon the spanish bullfights declares his belief that the passion for bullfighting is innate in the breast of every spaniarddo not my friend assign two causes for an effect where one is obviously adequate the disposition to love command need not be attributed to any innate cause in the minds of females whilst it may be fairly ascribed to their erroneous education i shall early cultivate my daughters judgment to prevent her from being wilful or positive i shall leave her to choose for herself in all those trifles upon which the happiness of childhood depends and i shall gradually teach her to reflect upon the consequences of her actions to compare and judge of her feelings and to compute the morn and evening to her dayi shall thus i hope induce her to reason upon all subjects even upon matters of taste where many women think it sufficient to say i admire or i detestoh charming or oh horriblepeople who have reasons for their preferences and aversions are never so provokingly zealous in the support of their own tastes as those usually are who have no arguments to convince themselves or others that they are in the right but you are apprehensive that the desire to govern which women show in domestic life should obtain a larger field to display itself in public affairsit seems to me impossible that they can ever acquire the species of direct power which you dread their influence must be private it is therefore of the utmost consequence that it should be judiciousit was not themistocles but his wife and child who governed the athenians it was therefore of some consequence that the boy who governed the mother who governed her husband should not be a spoiled child and consequently that the mother who educated this child should be a reasonable woman thus are human affairs chained together and female influence is a necessary and important link which you cannot break without destroying the whole if it be your object my dear sir to monopolize power for our sex you cannot possibly secure it better from the wishes of the other than by enlightening their minds and enlarging their views they will then be convinced not by the voice of the moralist who puts us to sleep whilst he persuades us of the vanity of all sublunary enjoyments but by their own awakened observation they will be convinced that power is generally an evil to its possessor that to those who really wish for the good of their fellowcreatures it is at best but a painful trustthe mad philosopher in rasselas who imagined that he regulated the weather and distributed the seasons could never enjoy a moments repose lest he should not make to the different nations of the earth an impartial dividend of rain and sunshinethose who are entrusted with the government of nations must if they have an acute sense of justice experience something like the anxiety felt by this unfortunate monarch of the clouds lord kenyon has lately decided that a woman may be an overseer of a parish but you are not i suppose apprehensive that many ladies of cultivated understanding should become ambitious of this honourone step farther in reasoning and a woman would desire as little to be a queen or an empress as to be the overseer of a parishyou may perhaps reply that men even those of the greatest understanding have been ambitious and fond even to excess of power that ambition is the glorious fault of heroes i allow but heroes are not always men of the most enlarged understandingsthey are possessed by the spirit of military adventurean infectious spirit which men catch from one another in the course of their educationto this contagion the fair sex are not exposed at all events if you suppose that women are likely to acquire influence in the state it is prudent to enlighten their understandings that they may not make an absurd or pernicious use of their power you appeal to history to prove that great calamities have ensued whenever the female sex has obtained power yet you acknowledge that we cannot with certainty determine whether these evils have been the effects of our trusting them with liberty or of our neglecting previously to instruct them in the use of itupon the decision of this question rests your whole argument in a most awful tone of declamation you bid me follow the history of female nature from the court of augustus to that of lewis xivth and tell you whether i can hesitate to acknowledge that the liberty and influence of women have always been the greatest during the decline of empiresbut you have not proved to me that women had more knowledge that they were better educated at the court of augustus or during the reign of lewis xivth than at any other place or during any other period of the world therefore your argument gains nothing by the admission of your assertions and unless i could trace the history of female education it is vain for me to follow what you call the history of female nature it is however remarkable that the means by which the sex have hitherto obtained that species of power which they have abused have arisen chiefly from their personal and not from their mental qualifications from their skill in the arts of persuasion and from their accomplishments not from their superior powers of reasoning or from the cultivation of their understanding the most refined species of coquetry can undoubtedly be practised in the highest perfection by women who to personal graces unite all the fascination of wit and eloquence there is infinite danger in permitting such women to obtain power without having acquired habits of reasoning rousseau admires these sirens but the system of rousseau pursued to its fullest extent would overturn the world would make every woman a cleopatra and every man an antony it would destroy all domestic virtue all domestic happiness all the pleasures of truth and lovein the midst of that delirium of passion to which antony gave the name of love what must have been the state of his degraded wretched soul when he could suspect his mistress of designs upon his lifeto cure him of these suspicions she at a banquet poisoned the flowers of his garland waited till she saw him inflamed with wine then persuaded him to break the tops of his flowers into his goblet and just stopped him when the cup was at his lips exclaimingthose flowers are poisoned you see that i do not want the means of destroying you if you were become tiresome to me or if i could live without youand this is the happy pair who instituted the orders of the inimitable loversand the companions in death footnote vide plutarch these are the circumstances which should early be pointed out to both sexes with all the energy of truth let them learn that the most exquisite arts of the most consummate coquette could not obtain the confidence of him who sacrificed to her charms the empire of the world it is from the experience of the past that we must form our judgment of the future how unjustly you accuse me of desiring to destroy the memory of past experiments the wisdom collected by the labour of ages you would prohibit this treasure of knowledge to onehalf of the human species and i on the contrary would lay it open to all my fellowcreaturesi speak as if it were actually in our option to retard or to accelerate the intellectual progress of the sex but in fact it is absolutely out of our power to drive the fair sex back to their former state of darkness the art of printing has totally changed their situation their eyes are openedthe classic page is unrolled they will readall we can do is to induce them to read with judgmentto enlarge their minds so that they may take a full view of their interests and of ours i have no fear that the truth upon any subject should injure my daughters mind it is falsehood that i dread i dread that she should acquire preposterous notions of love of happiness from the furtive perusal of vulgar novels or from the clandestine conversation of ignorant waitingmaidsi dread that she should acquire even from the enchanting eloquence of rousseau the fatal idea that cunning and address are the natural resources of her sex that coquetry is necessary to attract and dissimulation to preserve the heart of mani would not however proscribe an author because i believe some of his opinions to be false i would have my daughter read and compare various books and correct her judgment of books by listening to the conversation of persons of sense and experience women may learn much of what is essential to their happiness from the unprejudiced testimony of a father or a brother they may learn to distinguish the pictures of real life from paintings of imaginary manners and passions which never had which never can have any existencethey may learn that it is not the reserve of hypocrisy the affected demeanour either of a prude or a coquette that we admire but it is the simple graceful natural modesty of a woman whose mind is innocent with this belief impressed upon her heart do you think my dear friend that she who can reflect and reason would take the means to disgust where she wishes to please or that she would incur contempt when she knows how to secure esteemdo you think that she will employ artifice to entangle some heedless heart when she knows that every heart which can be so won is not worth the winningshe will not look upon our sex either as dupes or tyrants she will be aware of the important difference between evanescent passion and that affection founded upon mutual esteem which forms the permanent happiness of life i am not apprehensive my dear sir that cupid should be scared by the helmet of minerva he has conquered his idle fears and has been familiarized to minerva and the muses and now of power his darts are found twice ten thousand times to wound footnote see the introduction of cupid to the muses and minerva in a charming poem of mrs barbauldsthe origin of songwritingwould it not afford a beautiful subject for a picture that the power of beauty over the human heart is infinitely increased by the associated ideas of virtue and intellectual excellence has been long acknowledgeda set of features however regular inspire but little admiration or enthusiasm unless they be irradiated by that sunshine of the soul which creates beauty the expression of intelligent benevolence renders even homely features and cheeks of sorry grain agreeable and it has been observed that the most lasting attachments have not always been excited by the most beautiful of the sex as men have become more cultivated they have attended more to the expression of amiable and estimable qualities in the female countenance and in all probability the taste for this species of beauty will increase amongst the good and wise when agreeable qualities are connected with the view of any particular form we learn to love that form though it may have no other merit women who have no pretensions to grecian beauty may if their countenances are expressive of good temper and good sense have some chance of pleasing men of cultivated mindsin an excellent review of gilliers essays on the causes of the perfection of antique sculpture which i have just seen it is observed that our exclusive admiration of the physiognomy of the greeks arises from prejudice since the grecian countenance cannot be necessarily associated with any of the perfections which now distinguish accomplished or excellent men this remark in a popular periodical work shows that the public mind is not bigoted in matters of taste and that the standard is no longer supposed to be fixed by the voice of ancient authority the changes that are made in the opinions of our sex as to female beauty according to the different situations in which women are placed and the different qualities on which we fix the idea of their excellence are curious and striking ask a northern indian says a traveller who has lately visited them ask a northern indian what is beauty and he will answer a broad flat face small eyes high cheek bones three or four broad black lines across each cheek a low forehead a large broad chin a clumsy hook nose c these beauties are greatly heightened or at least rendered more valuable when the possessor is capable of dressing all kinds of skins converting them into the different parts of their clothing and able to carry eight or ten stone in summer or haul a much greater weight in winterprince matanabbee adds this author prided himself much upon the height and strength of his wives and would frequently say few women could carry or haul heavier loads if some years ago you had asked a frenchman what he meant by beauty he would have talked to you of lair piquant lair spirituel lair noble lair comme il faut and he would have referred ultimately to that je ne scais quoi for which parisian belles were formerly celebratedfrench women mixed much in company the charms of what they called esprit were admired in conversation and the petit minois denoting lively wit and coquetry became fashionable in france whilst gallantry and a taste for the pleasures of society prevailed the countenance expressive of sober sense and modest reserve continues to be the taste of the english who wisely prefer the pleasures of domestic lifedomestic life should however be enlivened and embellished with all the wit and vivacity and politeness for which french women were once admired without admitting any of their vices or follies the more men of literature and polished manners desire to spend their time in their own families the more they must wish that their wives and daughters may have tastes and habits similar to their own if they can meet with conversation suited to their taste at home they will not be driven to clubs for companions they will invite the men of wit and science of their acquaintance to their own houses instead of appointing some place of meeting from which ladies are to be excluded this mixture of the talents and knowledge of both sexes must be advantageous to the interests of society by increasing domestic happinessprivate virtues are public

industry of the artist who to produce the image of perfect beauty selected from the fairest faces their most faultless features equally vain must be the efforts of the philosopher who would excite the idea of mental perfection by combining an assemblage of partycoloured virtues such i had almost said is my system but i mean my sentiments i am not accurate enough to compose a system after all how vain are systems and theories and reasonings we may declaim but what do we really know all is uncertaintyhuman prudence does nothingfortune every thing i leave every thing therefore to fortune you leave nothing such is the difference between usand which shall be the happiest time alone can decide farewell dear caroline i love you better than i thought i could love a philosopher your ever affectionate julia letter ii carolines answer to julia at the hazard of ceasing to be charming interesting captivating i must dear julia venture to reason with you to examine your favourite doctrine of amiable defects and if possible to dissipate that unjust dread of perfection which you seem to have continually before your eyes it is the sole object of a womans life you say to please her amiable defects please more than her noblest virtues her follies more than her wisdom her caprice more than her temper and something a nameless something which no art can imitate and no science can teach more than all art you say spoils the graces and corrupts the heart of woman and at best can produce only a cold model of perfection which though perhaps strictly conformable to rule can never touch the soul or please the unprejudiced taste like one simple stroke of genuine nature i have often observed dear julia that an inaccurate use of words produces such a strange confusion in all reasoning that in the heat of debate the combatants unable to distinguish their friends from their foes fall promiscuously on both a skilful disputant knows well how to take advantage of this confusion and sometimes endeavours to create it i do not know whether i am to suspect you of such a design but i must guard against it you have with great address availed yourself of the two ideas connected with the word art first as opposed to simplicity it implies artifice and next as opposed to ignorance it comprehends all the improvements of science which leading us to search for general causes rewards us with a dominion over their dependent effectsthat which instructs how to pursue the objects which we may have in view with the greatest probability of success all men who act from general principles are so far philosophers their objects may be when attained insufficient to their happiness or they may not previously have known all the necessary means to obtain them but they must not therefore complain if they do not meet with success which they have no reason to expect parrhasius in collecting the most admired excellences from various models to produce perfection concluded from general principles that mankind would be pleased again with what had once excited their admirationso far he was a philosopher but he was disappointed of successyes for he was ignorant of the cause necessary to produce it the separate features might be perfect but they were unsuited to each other and in their forced union he could not give to the whole countenance symmetry and an appropriate expression there was as you say a something wanting which his science had not taught him he should then have set himself to examine what that something was and how it was to be obtained his want of success arose from the insufficiency not the fallacy of theory your object dear julia we will suppose is to please if general observation and experience have taught you that slight accomplishments and a trivial character succeed more certainly in obtaining this end than higher worth and sense you act from principle in rejecting the one and aiming at the other you have discovered or think you have discovered the secret causes which produce the desired effect and you employ them do not call this instinct or nature this also though you scorn it is philosophy but when you come soberly to reflect you have a feeling in your mind that reason and cool judgment disapprove of the part you are acting let us however distinguish between disapprobation of the object and the means averse as enthusiasm is from the retrograde motion of analysis let me my dear friend lead you one step backward why do you wish to please i except at present from the question the desire to please arising from a passion which requires a reciprocal return confined as this wish must be in a womans heart to one object alone when you say julia that the admiration of others will be absolutely necessary to your happiness i must suppose you mean to express only a general desire to please then under this limitationlet me ask you again why do you wish to please do not let a word stop you the word vanity conveys to us a disagreeable idea there seems something selfish in the sentimentthat all the pleasure we feel in pleasing others arises from the gratification it affords to our own vanity we refine and explain and never can bring ourselves fairly to make a confession which we are sensible must lower us in the opinion of others and consequently mortify the very vanity we would conceal so strangely then do we deceive ourselves as to deny the existence of a motive which at the instant prompts the denial but let us dear julia exchange the word vanity for a less odious word selfcomplacency let us acknowledge that we wish to please because the success raises our selfcomplacency if you ask why raising our selfapprobation gives us pleasure i must answer that i do not know yet i see and feel that it does i observe that the voice of numbers is capable of raising the highest transport or the most fatal despair the eye of man seems to possess a fascinating power over his fellowcreatures to raise the blush of shame or the glow of pride i look around me and i see riches titles dignities pursued with such eagerness by thousands only as the signs of distinction nay are not all these things sacrificed the moment they cease to be distinctions the moment the prize of glory is to be won by other means do not millions sacrifice their fortunes their peace their health their lives for fame then amongst the highest pleasures of human beings i must place selfapprobation with this belief let us endeavour to secure it in the greatest extent and to the longest duration then julia the wish to please becomes only a secondary motive subordinate to the desire i have to secure my own selfcomplacency we will examine how far they are connected in reflecting upon my own mind i observe that i am flattered by the opinion of others in proportion to the opinion i have previously formed of their judgment or i perceive that the opinion of numbers merely as numbers has power to give me great pleasure or great pain i would unite both these pleasures if i could but in general i cannotthey are incompatible the opinion of the vulgar crowd and the enlightened individual the applause of the highest and the lowest of mankind cannot be obtained by the same means another question then ariseswhom shall we wish to please we must choose and be decided in the choice you say that you are proud i am prouderyou will be content with indiscriminate admirationnothing will content me but what is select as long as i have the use of my reasonas long as my heart can feel the delightful sense of a wellearned praise i will fix my eye on the highest pitch of excellence and steadily endeavour to attain it conscious of her worth and daring to assert it i would have a woman early in life know that she is capable of filling the heart of a man of sense and merit that she is worthy to be his companion and friend with all the energy of her soul with all the powers of her understanding i would have a woman endeavour to please those whom she esteems and loves she runs a risk you will say of never meeting her equal hearts and understandings of a superior order are seldom met with in the world or when met with it may not be a particular good fortune to win themtrue but if ever she wins she will keep them and the prize appears to me well worth the pains and difficulty of attaining i julia admire and feel enthusiasm but i would have philosophy directed to the highest objects i dread apathy as much as you can and i would endeavour to prevent it not by sacrificing half my existence but by enjoying the whole with moderation you ask why exercise does not increase sensibility and why sympathy with imaginary distress will not also increase the disposition to sympathize with what is realbecause pity should i think always be associated with the active desire to relieve if it be suffered to become a passive sensation it is a useless weakness not a virtue the species of reading you speak of must be hurtful even in this respect to the mind as it indulges all the luxury of woe in sympathy with fictitious distress without requiring the exertion which reality demands besides universal experience proves to us that habit so far from increasing sensibility absolutely destroys it by familiarizing it with objects of compassion let me my dear friend appeal even to your own experience in the very instance you mention is there any pathetic writer in the world who could move you as much at the twentieth reading as at the first speak naturally and at the third or fourth reading you would probably say it is very pathetic but i have read it beforei liked it better the first time that is to say it did touch me oncei know it ought to touch me now but it does not beware of this do not let life become as tedious as a twicetold tale farewell dear julia this is the answer of fact against eloquence philosophy against enthusiasm you appeal from my understanding to my hearti appeal from the heart to the understanding of my judge and ten years hence the decision perhaps will be in my favour yours sincerely caroline footnote hume said that parnells poems were as fresh at the twentieth reading as at the first letter iii caroline to julia on her intended marriage indeed my dear julia i hardly know how to venture to give you my advice upon a subject which ought to depend so much upon your own taste and feelings my opinion and my wishes i could readily tell you the idea of seeing you united and attached to my brother is certainly the most agreeable to me but i am to divest myself of the partiality of a sister and to consider my brother and lord v as equal candidates for your preferenceequal i mean in your regard for you say that your heart is not yet decided in its choiceif that oracle would declare itself in intelligible terms you would not hesitate a moment to obey its dictates but my dear julia is there not another a safer i do not say a better oracle to be consultedyour reason whilst the doubtful beam still nods from side to side you may with a steady hand weigh your own motives and determine what things will be essential to your happiness and what price you will pay for them for each pleasure has its price and they who pay too much of pain but squander life away do me the justice to believe that i do not quote these lines of dryden as being the finest poetry he ever wrote for poets you know as waller wittily observed never succeed so well in truth as in fiction since we cannot in life expect to realize all our wishes we must distinguish those which claim the rank of wants we must separate the fanciful from the real or at least make the one subservient to the other it is of the utmost importance to you more particularly to take every precaution before you decide for life because disappointment and restraint afterwards would be insupportable to your temper you have often declared to me my dear friend that your love of poetry and of all the refinements of literary and romantic pursuits is so intimately interwoven in your mind that nothing could separate them without destroying the whole fabric your tastes you say are fixed if they are so you must be doubly careful to ensure their gratification if you cannot make them subservient to external circumstances you should certainly if it be in your power choose a situation in which circumstances will be subservient to them if you are convinced that you could not adopt the tastes of another it will be absolutely necessary for your happiness to live with one whose tastes are similar to your own the belief in that sympathy of souls which the poets suppose declares itself between two people at first sight is perhaps as absurd as the late fashionable belief in animal magnetism but there is a sympathy which if it be not the foundation may be called the cement of affection two people could not i should think retain any lasting affection for each other without a mutual sympathy in taste and in their diurnal occupations and domestic pleasures this you will allow my dear julia even in a fuller extent than i do now my brothers tastes character and habits of life are so very different from lord vs that i scarcely know how you can compare them at least before you can decide which of the two would make you the happiest in life you must determine what kind of life you may wish to lead for my brother though he might make you very happy in domestic life would not make the countess of v happy nor would lord v make mrs percy happy they must be two different women with different habits and different wishes so that you must divide yourself my dear julia like araspes into two selves i do not say into a bad and a good self choose some other epithets to distinguish them but distinct they must be so let them now declare and decide their pretensions and let the victor have not only the honours of a triumph but all the prerogatives of victory let the subdued be subdued for lifelet the victor take every precaution which policy can dictate to prevent the possibility of future contests with the vanquished but without talking poetry to you my dear friend let me seriously recommend it to you to examine your own mind carefully and if you find that public diversions and public admiration dissipation and all the pleasures of riches and high rank are really and truly essential to your happiness direct your choice accordingly marry lord v he has a large fortune extensive connexions and an exalted station his own taste for show and expense his family pride and personal vanity will all tend to the end you propose your house table equipages may be all in the highest style of magnificence lord vs easiness of temper and fondness for you will readily give you that entire ascendancy over his pleasures which your abilities give you over his understanding he will not control your wishes you may gratify them to the utmost bounds of his fortune and perhaps beyond those bounds you may have entire command at home and abroad if these are your objects julia take them they are in your power but remember you must take them with their necessary concomitantsthe restraints upon your time upon the choice of your friends and your company which high life imposes the ennui subsequent to dissipation the mortifications of rivalship in beauty wit rank and magnificence the trouble of managing a large fortune and the chance of involving your affairs and your family in difficulty and distress these and a thousand more evils you must submit to you must renounce all the pleasures of the heart and of the imagination you must give up the idea of cultivating literary taste you must not expect from your husband friendship and confidence or any of the delicacies of affectionyou govern him he cannot therefore be your equal you may be a fond mother but you cannot educate your children you will neither have the time nor the power to do it you must trust them to a governess in the selection of your friends and in the enjoyment of their company and conversation you will be still more restrained in short you must give up the pleasures of domestic life for that is not in this case the life you have chosen but you will exclaim against me for supposing you capable of making such a choicesuch sacrificesi am sure next to my brother i am the last person in the world who would wish you to make them you have another choice my dear julia domestic life is offered to you by one who has every wish and every power to make it agreeable to you by one whose tastes resemble your own who would be a judge and a fond admirer of all your perfections you would have perpetual motives to cultivate every talent and to exert every power of pleasing for his sakefor his sake whose penetration no improvement would escape and whose affection would be susceptible of every proof of yours am i drawing too flattering a picturea sisters hand may draw a partial likeness but still it will be a likeness at all events my dear julia you would be certain of the mode of life you would lead with my brother the regulation of your time and occupations would be your own in the education of your family you would meet with no interruptions or restraint you would have no governess to counteract no strangers to intrude you might follow your own judgment or yield to the judgment of one who would never require you to submit to his opinion but to his reasons all the pleasures of friendship you would enjoy in your own family in the highest perfection and you would have for your sister the friend of your infancy caroline letter iv caroline to lady v upon her intended separation from her husband you need not fear my dear lady v that i should triumph in the accomplishment of my prophecies or that i should reproach you for having preferred your own opinion to my advice believe me my dear julia i am your friend nor would the name of sister have increased my friendship five years have made then so great a change in your feelings and views of life that a few days ago when my letter to you on your marriage accidentally fell into your hands you were struck with a species of astonishment at your choice and you burst into tears in an agony of despair on reading the wretched doom foretold to the wife of lord v a doom you add which i feel hourly accomplishing and which i see no possibility of averting but by a separation from a husband with whom i now think it was madness to unite myself your opinion i must already know upon this subject as the same arguments which should have prevented me from making such a choice ought now to determine me to abjure it you say dear julia that my letter struck you with despairdespair is either madness or folly it obtains it deserves nothing from mankind but pity and pity though it be akin to love has yet a secret affinity to contempt in strong minds despair is an acute disease the prelude to great exertion in weak minds it is a chronic distemper followed by incurable indolence let the crisis be favourable and resume your wonted energy instead of suffering the imagination to dwell with unavailing sorrow on the past let us turn our attention towards the future when an evil is irremediable let us acknowledge it to be such and bear itthere is no power to which we submit so certainly as to necessity with our hopes our wishes cease imagination has a contracting as well as an expansive faculty the prisoner who deprived of all that we conceive to constitute the pleasures of life could interest or occupy himself with the labours of a spider was certainly a philosopher he enjoyed all the means of happiness that were left in his power i know my dear lady v that words have little effect over grief and i do not i assure you mean to insult you with the parade of stoic philosophy but consider your error is not perhaps so great as you imagine certainly they who at the beginning of life can with a steady eye look through the long perspective of distant years who can in one view comprise all the different objects of happiness and misery who can compare accurately and justly estimate their respective degrees of importance and who after having formed such a calculation are capable of acting uniformly in consequence of their own conviction are the wisest and as far as prudence can influence our fortune the happiest of human beings next to this favoured class are those who can perceive and repair their own errors who can stop at any given period to take a new view of life if unfortunate circumstances have denied you a place in the first rank you may dear julia secure yourself a station in the second is not the conduct of a woman after her marriage of infinitely more importance than her previous choice whatever it may have been then now consider what yours should be you say that it is easier to break a chain than to stretch it but remember that when broken your part of the chain julia will still remain with you and fetter and disgrace you through life why should a woman be so circumspect in her choice is it not because when once made she must abide by it she sets her life upon the cast and she must stand the hazard of the die from domestic uneasiness a man has a thousand resources in middling life the tavern in high life the gamingtable suspends the anxiety of thought dissipation ambition business the occupation of a profession change of place change of company afford him agreeable and honourable relief from domestic chagrin if his home become tiresome he leaves it if his wife become disagreeable to him he leaves her and in leaving her loses only a wife but what resource has a womanprecluded from all the occupations common to the other sex she loses even those peculiar to her own she has no remedy from the company of a man she dislikes but a separation and this remedy desperate as it is is allowed only to a certain class of women in society to those whose fortune affords them the means of subsistence and whose friends have secured to them a separate maintenance a peeress then probably can leave her husband if she wish it a peasants wife cannot she depends upon the character and privileges of a wife for actual subsistence her domestic care if not her affection is secured to her husband and it is just that it should he sacrifices his liberty his labour his ingenuity his time for the support and protection of his wife and in proportion to his protection is his power in higher life where the sacrifices of both parties in the original union are more equal the evils of a separation are more nearly balanced but even here the wife who has hazarded least suffers the most by the dissolution of the partnership she loses a great part of her fortune and of the conveniences and luxuries of life she loses her home her rank in society she loses both the repellant and the attractive power of a mistress of a family her occupation is gone she becomes a wanderer whilst her youth and beauty last she may enjoy that species of delirium caused by public admiration fortunate if habit does not destroy the power of this charm before the season of its duration expire it was said to be the wish of a celebrated modern beauty that she might not survive her nineandtwentieth birthday i have often heard this wish quoted for its extravagance but i always admired it for its good sense the lady foresaw the inevitable doom of her declining years her apprehensions for the future embittered even her enjoyment of the present and she had resolution enough to offer to take a bond of fate to sacrifice onehalf of her life to secure the pleasure of the other but dear lady v probably this wish was made at some distance from the destined period of its accomplishment on the eve of her nineandtwentieth birthday the lady perhaps might have felt inclined to retract her prayer at least we should provide for the cowardice which might seize the female mind at such an instant even the most wretched life has power to attach us none can be more wretched than the old age of a dissipated beautyunless lady v it be that of a woman who to all her evils has the addition of remorse for having abjured her duties and abandoned her family such is the situation of a woman who separates from her husband reduced to go the same insipid round of public amusements yet more restrained than an unmarried beauty in youth yet more miserable in age the superiority of her genius and the sensibility of her heart become her greatest evils she indeed must pray for indifference avoided by all her family connexions hated and despised where she might have been loved and respected solitary in the midst of society she feels herself deserted at the time of life when she most wants social comfort and assistance dear julia whilst it is yet in your power secure to yourself a happier fate retire to the bosom of your own family prepare for yourself a new society perform the duties and you shall soon enjoy the pleasures of domestic life educate your children whilst they are young it shall be your occupation as they grow up it shall be your glory let me anticipate your future success when they shall appear such as you can make them when the world shall ask who educated these amiable young women who formed their character who cultivated the talents of this promising young man why does this whole family live together in such perfect union with one voice dear julia your children shall name their mother she who in the bloom of youth checked herself in the career of dissipation and turned all the ability and energy of her mind to their education such will be your future fame in the mean time before you have formed for yourself companions in your own family you will want a society suited to your taste disgusted as you have been with frivolous company you say that you wish to draw around you a society of literary and estimable friends whose conversation and talents shall delight you and who at the same time that they are excited to display their own abilities shall be a judge of yours but dear lady v the possibility of your forming such a society must depend on your having a home to receive a character and consequence in life to invite and attach friends the opinion of numbers is necessary to excite the ambition of individuals to be a female mecaenas you must have power to confer favours as well as judgment to discern merit what castles in the air are built by the synthetic wand of imagination which vanish when exposed to the analysis of reason then julia supposing that lord v as your husband becomes a negative quantity as to your happiness yet he will acquire another species of value as the master of your family and the father of your children as a person who supports your public consequence and your private selfcomplacency yes dear lady v he will increase your selfcomplacency for do you not think that when your husband sees his children prosper under your care his family united under your managementwhilst he feels your merit at home and hears your praises abroad do you not think he will himself learn to respect and love you you say that he is not a judge of female excellence that he has no real taste that vanity is his ruling passion then if his judgment be dependent on the opinions of others he will be the more easily led by the public voice and you will command the suffrages of the public if he has not taste enough to approve he will have vanity enough to be proud of you and a vain man insensibly begins to love that of which he is proud why does lord v love his buildings his paintings his equipages it is not for their intrinsic value but because they are means of distinction to him let his wife become a greater distinction to him and on the same principles he will prefer her set an example then dear lady v of domestic virtue your talents shall make it admired your rank shall make it conspicuous you are ambitious julia you love praise you have been used to it you cannot live happily without it praise is a mental luxury which becomes from habit absolutely necessary to our existence and in purchasing it we must pay the price set upon it by society the more curious the more avaricious we become of this aerial coin the more it is our interest to preserve its currency and increase its value you my dear julia in particular who have amassed so much of it should not cry down its price for your own sakedo not then say in a fit of disgust that you are grown too wise now to value applause if during youth your appetite for applause was indiscriminate and indulged to excess you are now more difficult in your choice and are become an epicure in your taste for praise adieu my dear julia i hope still to see you as happy in domestic life as your ever affectionate and sincere friend caroline letter v caroline to lady v on her conduct after her separation from her husband a delicacy of which i now begin to repent has of late prevented me from writing to you i am afraid i shall be abrupt but it is necessary to be explicit your conduct ever since your separation from your husband has been anxiously watched from a variety of motives by his family and your ownit has been blamed reflect upon your own mind and examine with what justice last summer when i was with you i observed a change in your conversation and the whole turn of your thoughts i perceived an unusual impatience of restraint a confusion in your ideas when you began to reasonan eloquence in your language when you began to declaim which convinced me that from some secret cause the powers of your reason had been declining and those of your imagination rapidly increasing the boundaries of right and wrong seemed to be no longer marked in your mind neither the rational hope of happiness nor a sense of duty governed you but some unknown wayward power seemed to have taken possession of your understanding and to have thrown every thing into confusion you appeared peculiarly averse to philosophy let me recall your own words to you you asked of what use philosophy could be to beings who had no free will and how the ideas of just punishment and involuntary crime could be reconciled your understanding involved itself in metaphysical absurdity in conversing upon literary subjects one evening in speaking of the striking difference between the conduct and the understanding of the great lord bacon you said that it by no means surprised you that to an enlarged mind accustomed to consider the universe as one vast whole the conduct of that little animated atom that inconsiderable part self must be too insignificant to fix or merit attention it was nothing you said in the general mass of vice and virtue happiness and misery i believe i answered that it might be nothing compared to the great whole but it was every thing to the individual such were your opinions in theory you must know enough of the human heart to perceive their tendency when reduced to practice speculative opinions i know have little influence over the practice of those who act much and think little but i should conceive their power to be considerable over the conduct of those who have much time for reflection and little necessity for action in one case the habit of action governs the thoughts upon any sudden emergency in the other the thoughts govern the actions the truth or falsehood then of speculative opinions is of much greater consequence to our sex than to the other as we live a life of reflection they of action retrace then dear julia in your mind the course of your thoughts for some time past discover the cause of this revolution in your opinions judge yourself and remember that in the mind as well as in the body the highest pitch of disease is often attended with an unconsciousness of its existence if then lady v upon receiving my letter you should feel averse to this selfexamination or if you should imagine it to be useless i no longer advise i command you to quit your present abode come to me fly from the danger and be safe dear julia i must assume this peremptory tone if you are angry i must disregard your anger it is the anger of disease the anger of one who is roused from that sleep which would end in death i respect the equality of friendship but this equality permits nay requires the temporary ascendancy i assume in real friendship the judgment the genius the prudence of each party become the common property of both even if they are equals they may not be so always those transient fits of passion to which the best and wisest are liable may deprive even the superior of the advantage of their reason she then has still in her friend an impartial though perhaps an inferior judgment each becomes the guardian of the other as their mutual safety may require heaven seems to have granted this double chance of virtue and happiness as the peculiar reward of friendship use it then my dear friend accept the assistance you could so well return obey me i shall judge of you by your resolution at this crisis on it depends your fate and my friendship your sincere and affectionate caroline letter vi caroline to lady v just before she went to france the time is now come lady v when i must bid you an eternal adieu with what deep regret i need not julia i cannot tell you i burned your letter the moment i had read it your past confidence i never will betray but i must renounce all future intercourse with you i am a sister a wife a mother all these connexions forbid me to be longer your friend in misfortune in sickness or in poverty i never would have forsaken you but infamy i cannot share i would have gone i went to the brink of the precipice to save you with all my force i held you back but in vain but why do i vindicate my conduct to you now accustomed as i have always been to think your approbation necessary to my happiness i forgot that henceforward your opinion is to be nothing to me or mine to you oh julia the idea the certainty that you must if you live be in a few years in a few months perhaps reduced to absolute want in a foreign countrywithout a frienda protector the fate of women who have fallen from a state as high as yours the names of l of g the horror i feel at joining your name to theirs impels me to make one more attempt to save you companion of my earliest years friend of my youth my beloved julia by the happy innocent hours we have spent together by the love you had for me by the respect you bear to the memory of your mother by the agony with which your father will hear of the loss of his daughter by all that has power to touch your mindi conjure you i implore you to pausefarewell caroline letter vii caroline to lord v written a few months after the date of the preceding letter my lord though i am too sensible that all connexion between my unfortunate friend and her family must for some time have been dissolved i venture now to address myself to your lordship on wednesday last about half after six oclock in the evening the following note was brought to me it had been written with such a trembling hand that it was scarcely legible but i knew the writing too well if you ever loved me caroline read thisdo not tear it the moment you see the name of julia she has sufferedshe is humbled i left france with the hope of seeing you once more but now i am so near you my courage fails and my heart sinks within me i have no friend upon earthi deserve none yet i cannot help wishing to see once more before i die the friend of my youth to thank her with my last breath but dear caroline if i must not see you write to me if possible one line of consolation tell me is my father livingdo you know any thing of my childreni dare not ask for my husband adieu i am so weak that i can scarcely writei hope i shall soon be no more farewell julia i immediately determined to follow the bearer of this letter julia was waiting for my answer at a small inn in a neighbouring village at a few miles distance it was night when i got there every thing was silentall the houses were shut up excepting one in which we saw two or three lights glimmering through the windowthis was the inn as your lordship may imagine it was a very miserable place the mistress of the house seemed to be touched with pity for the stranger she opened the door of a small room where she said the poor lady was resting and retired as i entered upon a low matted seat beside the fire sat lady v she was in black her knees were crossed and her white but emaciated arms flung on one side over her lap her hands were clasped together and her eyes fixed upon the fire she seemed neither to hear nor see any thing round her but totally absorbed in her own reflections to have sunk into insensibility i dreaded to rouse her from this state of torpor and i believe i stood for some moments motionless at last i moved softly towards hershe turned her headstarted upa scarlet blush overspread her faceshe grew livid again instantly gave a faint shriek and sunk senseless into my arms when she returned to herself and found her head lying upon my shoulder and heard my voice soothing her with all the expressions of kindness i could think of she smiled with a look of gratitude which i never shall forget like one who had been long unused to kindness she seemed ready to pour forth all the fondness of her heart but as if recollecting herself better she immediately checked her feelingswithdrew her hand from minethanked mesaid she was quite well againcast down her eyes and her manner changed from tenderness to timidity she seemed to think that she had lost all right to sympathy and received even the common offices of humanity with surprise her high spirit i saw was quite broken i think i never felt such sorrow as i did in contemplating julia at this instant she who stood before me sinking under the sense of inferiority i knew to be my equalmy superior yet by fatal imprudence by one rash step all her great and good and amiable qualities were irretrievably lost to the world and to herself when i thought that she was a little recovered i begged of her if she was not too much fatigued to let me carry her home at these words she looked at me with surprise her eyes filled with tears but without making any other reply she suffered me to draw her arm within mine and attempted to follow me i did not know how feeble she was till she began to walk it was with the utmost difficulty i supported her to the door and by the assistance of the people of the house she was lifted into the carriage we went very slowly when the carriage stopped she was seized with an universal tremor she started when the man knocked at the door and seemed to dread its being opened the appearance of light and the sound of cheerful voices struck her with horror i could not myself help being shocked with the contrast between the dreadful situation of my friend and the happiness of the family to which i was returning oh said she what are these voiceswhither are you taking mefor heavens sake do not let any body see me i assured her that she should go directly to her own apartment and that no human being should approach her without her express permission alas it happened at this very moment that all my children came running with the utmost gaiety into the hall to meet us and the very circumstance which i had been so anxious to prevent happenedlittle julia was amongst them the gaiety of the children suddenly ceased the moment they saw lady v coming up the stepsthey were struck with her melancholy air and countenance she leaning upon my arm with her eyes fixed upon the ground let me lead her in and sunk upon the first chair she came to i made a sign to the children to retire but the moment they began to move lady v looked upsaw her daughterand now for the first time burst into tears the little girl did not recollect her poor mother till she heard the sound of her voice and then she threw her arms round her neck crying is it you mammaand all the children immediately crowded round and asked if this was the same lady v who used to play with them it is impossible to describe the effect these simple questions had on julia a variety of emotions seemed struggling in her countenance she rose and made an attempt to break from the children but could notshe had not strength to support herself we carried her away and put her to bed she took no notice of any body nor did she even seem to know that i was with her i thought she was insensible but as i drew the curtains i heard her give a deep sigh i left her and carried away her little girl who had followed us up stairs and begged to stay with her mother but i was apprehensive that the sight of her might renew her agitation after i was gone they told me that she was perfectly still with her eyes closed and i stayed away some time in hopes that she might sleep however about midnight she sent to beg to speak to me she was very illshe beckoned to me to sit down by her bedsideevery one left the room and when julia saw herself alone with me she took my hand and in a low but calm voice she said i have not many hours to livemy heart is brokeni wished to see you to thank you whilst it was yet in my power she pressed my hand to her trembling lips your kindness added she touches me more than all the rest but how ashamed you must be of such a friend oh caroline to die a disgrace to all who ever loved me the tears trickled down her face and choked her utterance she wiped them away hastily but it is not now a time said she to think of myselfcan i see my daughter the little girl was asleep she was awakened and i brought her to her mother julia raised herself in her bed and summoning up all her strength my dearest friend said she putting her childs hand into mine when i am gone be a mother to this childlet her know my whole history let nothing be concealed from her poor girl you will live to blush at your mothers name she paused and leaned back i was going to take the child away but she held out her arms again for her and kissed her several times farewell said she i shall never see you again the little girl burst into tears julia wished to say something moreshe raised herself againat last she uttered these words with energymy love be good and happy she then sunk down on the pillow quite exhaustedshe never spoke afterwards i took her handit was coldher pulse scarcely beather eyes rolled without meaningin a few moments she expired painful as it has been to me to recall the circumstances of her death to my imagination i have given your lordship this exact and detailed account of my unfortunate friends behaviour in her last moments whatever may have been her errors her soul never became callous from vice the sense of her own ill conduct was undoubtedly the immediate cause of her illness and the remorse which had long preyed upon her mind at length brought her to the grave i have the honour to be my lord c caroline written in published in
