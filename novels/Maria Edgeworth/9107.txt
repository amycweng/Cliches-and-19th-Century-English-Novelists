xxviii chapter xxix chapter xxx chapter xxxi chapter xxxii to the reader in my seventyfourth year i have the satisfaction of seeing another work of my daughter brought before the public this was more than i could have expected from my advanced age and declining health i have been reprehended by some of the public critics for the notices which i have annexed to my daughters works as i do not know their reasons for this reprehension i cannot submit even to their respectable authority i trust however the british public will sympathize with what a father feels for a daughters literary success particularly as this father and daughter have written various works in partnership the natural and happy confidence reposed in me by my daughter puts it in my power to assure the public that she does not write negligently i can assert that twice as many pages were written for these volumes as are now printed the first of these tales harrington was occasioned by an extremely wellwritten letter which miss edgeworth received from america from a jewish lady complaining of the illiberality with which the jewish nation had been treated in some of miss edgeworths works the second tale ormond is the story of a young gentleman who is in some respects the reverse of vivian the moral of this tale does not immediately appear for the author has taken peculiar care that it should not obtrude itself upon the reader public critics have found several faults with miss edgeworths former worksshe takes this opportunity of returning them sincere thanks for the candid and lenient manner in which her errors have been pointed out in the present tales she has probably fallen into many other faults but she has endeavoured to avoid those for which she has been justly reproved and now indulgent reader i beg you to pardon this intrusion and with the most grateful acknowledgments i bid you farewell for ever richard lovell edgeworth edgeworthstown may notemr edgeworth died a few days after he wrote this prefacethe th june harrington chapter i when i was a little boy of about six years old i was standing with a maidservant in the balcony of one of the upper rooms of my fathers house in londonit was the evening of the first day that i had ever been in london and my senses had been excited and almost exhausted by the vast variety of objects that were new to me it was dusk and i was growing sleepy but my attention was awakened by a fresh wonder as i stood peeping between the bars of the balcony i saw star after star of light appear in quick succession at a certain height and distance and in a regular line approaching nearer and nearer i twitched the skirt of my maids gown repeatedly but she was talking to some acquaintance at the window of a neighbouring house and she did not attend to me i pressed my forehead more closely against the bars of the balcony and strained my eyes more eagerly towards the object of my curiosity presently the figure of the lamplighter with his blazing torch in one hand and his ladder in the other became visible and with as much delight as philosopher ever enjoyed in discovering the cause of a new and grand phenomenon i watched his operations i saw him fix and mount his ladder with his little black pot swinging from his arm and his red smoking torch waving with astonishing velocity as he ran up and down the ladder just when he reached the ground being then within a few yards of our house his torch flared on the face and figure of an old man with a long white beard and a dark visage who holding a great bag slung over one shoulder walked slowly on repeating in a low abrupt mysterious tone the cry of old clothes old clothes old clothes i could not understand the words he said but as he looked up at our balcony he saw mesmiledand i remember thinking that he had a goodnatured countenance the maid nodded to him he stood still and at the same instant she seized upon me exclaiming time for you to come off to bed master harrington i resisted and clinging to the rails began kicking and roaring if you dont come quietly this minute master harrington said she ill call to simon the jew there pointing to him and he shall come up and carry you away in his great bag the old mans eyes were upon me and to my fancy the look of his eyes and his whole face had changed in an instant i was struck with terrormy hands let go their graspand i suffered myself to be carried off as quietly as my maid could desire she hurried and huddled me into bed bid me go to sleep and ran down stairs to sleep i could not go but full of fear and curiosity i lay pondering on the thoughts of simon the jew and his bag who had come to carry me away in the height of my joys his face with the light of the torch upon it appeared and vanished and flitted before my eyes the next morning when daylight and courage returned i asked my maid whether simon the jew was a good or a bad man observing the impression that had been made upon my mind and foreseeing that the expedient which she had thus found successful might be advantageously repeated she answered with oracular duplicity simon the jew is a good man for naughty boys the threat of simon the jew was for some time afterwards used upon every occasion to reduce me to passive obedience and when by frequent repetition this threat had lost somewhat of its power she proceeded to tell me in a mysterious tone stories of jews who had been known to steal poor children for the purpose of killing crucifying and sacrificing them at their secret feasts and midnight abominations the less i understood the more i believed above all others there was one storyhorrible most horriblewhich she used to tell at midnight about a jew who lived in paris in a dark alley and who professed to sell pork pies but it was found out at last that the pies were not porkthey were made of the flesh of little children his wife used to stand at the door of her den to watch for little children and as they were passing would tempt them in with cakes and sweetmeats there was a trapdoor in the cellar and the children were dragged down andoh how my blood ran cold when we came to the terrible trapdoor were there i asked such things in london now oh yes in dark narrow lanes there were jews now living and watching always for such little children as me i should take care they did not catch me whenever i was walking in the streets and fowler that was my maids name added there was no knowing what they might do with me in our enlightened days and in the present improved state of education it may appear incredible that any nurserymaid could be so wicked as to relate or any child of six years old so foolish as to credit such tales but i am speaking of what happened many years ago nurserymaids and children i believe are very different now from what they were then and in further proof of the progress of human knowledge and reason we may recollect that many of these very stories of the jews which we now hold too preposterous for the infant and the nurserymaid to credit were some centuries ago universally believed by the english nation and had furnished more than one of our kings with pretexts for extortion and massacres but to proceed with my story the impression made on my imagination by these horrible tales was greater than my nurserymaid intended charmed by the effect she had produced she was next afraid that i should bring her into disgrace with my mother and she extorted from me a solemn promise that i would never tell any body the secret she had communicated from that moment i became her slave and her victim i shudder when i look back to all i suffered during the eighteen months i was under her tyranny every night the moment she and the candle left the room i lay in an indescribable agony of terror my head under the bedclothes my knees drawn up in a cold perspiration i saw faces around me grinning glaring receding advancing all turning at last into the same face of the jew with the long beard and the terrible eyes and that bag in which i fancied were mangled limbs of childrenit opened to receive me or fell upon my bed and lay heavy on my breast so that i could neither stir nor scream in short it was one continued nightmare there was no refreshing sleep for me till the hour when the candle returned and my tyrantmy protectress as i thought hercame to bed in due course she suffered in her turn for i could not long endure this state and instead of submitting passively or lying speechless with terror the moment she left the room at night i began to roar and scream till i brought my mother and half the house up to my bedside what could be the matter with the child faithful to my promise i never betrayed the secrets of my prisonhouse nothing could be learned from me but that i was frightened that i could not go to sleep and this indeed my trembling condition and convulsed countenance sufficiently proved my mother who was passionately fond of me became alarmed for my health and ordered that fowler should stay in the room with me every night till i should be quite fast asleep so fowler sat beside my bed every night singing caressing cajoling hushing conjuring me to sleep and when in about an hours time she flattered herself that her conjurations had succeeded when my relaxing muscles gave her hope that she might withdraw her arm unperceived and when slowly and dexterously she had accomplished this and watching my eyelashes and cautiously shading the candle with her hand she had happily gained the door some slipping of the lock some creaking of the hinge some parting sound startled me and bounce i was upright in my bed my eyes wide open and my voice ready for a roar so she was compelled instantly to return to replace the candle full in my view to sit down close beside the bed and with her arm once more thrown over me she was forced again to repeat that the jews bag could not come there and cursing me in her heart she recommenced her deceitful songs she was seldom released in less than two hours in vain she now tried by day to chase away the terrors of the night to undo her own work was beyond her power in vain she confessed that her threats were only to frighten me into being a good boy in vain she told me that i was too old now to believe such nonsense in vain she told me that simon was only an oldclothesman that his cry was only old clothes old clothes which she mimicked to take off its terror its terror was in that power of association which was beyond her skill to dissolve in vain she explained to me that his bag held only my old shoes and her yellow petticoat in vain she now offered to let me see with my own eyes my imagination was by this time proof against ocular demonstration one morning early she took me down stairs into the housekeepers room where simon and his bag were admitted she emptied the bag in my presence she laughed at my foolish fears and i pretended to laugh but my laugh was hysterical no power could draw me within armslength of the bag or the jew he smiled and smoothed his features and stroked his white beard and stooping low stretched out his inoffensive hand to me my maid placed sugared almonds on the palm of that hand and bid me approach and eat no i stood fixed and if the jew approached i ran back and hid my head in fowlers lap if she attempted to pull or push me forwards i screamed and at length i sent forth a scream that wakened my motherher bell rang and she was told that it was only master harrington who was afraid of poor simon the oldclothesman summoned to the side of my mothers bed i appeared nearly in hystericsbut still faithful to my promise i did not betray my maidnothing could be learned from me but that i could not bear the sight of old simon the jew my mother blamed fowler for taking me down to see such a sort of a person the equivocating maid replied that master harrington could not or would not be asy unless she did and that indeed now it was impossible to know how to make him asy by day or by night that she lost her natural rest with him and that for her part she could not pretend to stand it much longer unless she got her natural rest heaven knows my natural rest was gone but besides she could not even get her cup of tea in an evening or stir out for a mouthful of fresh air now she was every night to sing master harrington to sleep it was but poetical justice that she who had begun by terrifying me in order to get me to bed and out of her way should end by being forced to suffer some restraint to cure me of my terrors but fowler did not understand or relish poetical justice or any kind of justice besides she had heard that lady de brantefield was in want of a nurserymaid for the little lady anne mowbray who was some years younger than master harrington and fowler humbly represented to my mother that she thought master harrington was really growing too stout and too much of a man and she confessed quite above and beyond her management and comprehension for she never pretended to any thing but the care of young children that had not arrived at the years of discretion this she understood to be the case with the little lady anne mowbray therefore a recommendation to lady de brantefield would be very desirable and she hoped but justice to her the very desirable recommendation was given by my mother to lady de brantefield who was her particular friend nor was my mother in the least to blame on this occasion for she truly thought she was doing nothing but justice had it been otherwise those who know how these things are usually managed would i trust never think of blaming my mother for a sort of thing which they would do and doubtless have done themselves without scruple for a favourite maid who is always a faithful creature so fowler departed happy but i remained unhappynot with her departed my fears after she was gone i made a sort of compromise with my conscience and without absolutely breaking my promise i made a half confession to my mother that i had somehow or other horrid notions about jews and that it was the terror i had conceived of simon the jew which prevented me from sleeping all night my mother felt for me and considered my case as no laughing matter my mother was a woman of weak health delicate nerves and a kind of morbid sensibility which i often heard her deplore as a misfortune but which i observed every body about her admire as a grace she lamented that her dear harrington her only son should so much resemble her in this exquisite sensibility of the nervous system but her physician and he was a man who certainly knew better than she did she confessed for he was a man who really knew every thing assured her that this was indisputably the genuine temperament of genius i soon grew vain of my fears my antipathy my natural positively natural antipathy to the sight or bare idea of a jew was talked of by ladies and by gentlemen it was exhibited to all my mothers acquaintance learned and unlearned it was a medical it was a metaphysical wonder it was an idiosyncrasy corporeal or mental or both it wasin short more nonsense was talked about it than i will repeat though i perfectly remember it all for the importance of which at this period i became to successive circles of visitors fixed every circumstance and almost every word indelibly in my memory it was a pity that i was not born some years earlier or later for i should have flourished a favourite pupil of mesmer the animal magnetizer or i might at this day be a celebrated somnambulist no to do myself justice i really had no intention to deceive at least originally but as it often happens with those who begin by being dupes i was in imminent danger of becoming a knave how i escaped it i do not well know for here a child scarce seven years old i saw myself surrounded by grownup wise people who were accounting different ways for that of which i alone knew the real secret simple cause they were all without my intending it my dupes yet when i felt that i had them in my power i did not deceive them much not much more than i deceived myself i never was guilty of deliberate imposture i went no farther than affectation and exaggeration which it was in such circumstances scarcely possible for me to avoid for i really often did not know the difference between my own feelings and the descriptions i heard given of what i felt fortunately for my integrity my understanding and my health people began to grow tired of seeing and talking of master harrington some new wonder came into fashion i think it was jedediah buxton the man of prodigious memory who could multiply in his head nine figures by nine and who the first time he was taken to the playhouse counted all the steps of the dancers and all the words uttered by garrick in richard the third after jedediah buxton or about the same time if i recollect rightly came george psalmanazar from his island of formosa who with his pretended dictionary of the pormosan language and the pounds of raw beef he devoured per day excited the admiration and engrossed the attention of the royal society and of every curious and fashionable company in london so that poor little i was forgotten as though i had never been my mother and myself were left to settle the affair with my nerves and the jews as we could between the effects of real fear and the exaggerated expression of it to which i had been encouraged i was now seriously ill it is well known that persons have brought on fits by pretending to have them and by yielding to feelings at first slight and perfectly within the command of the will have at last acquired habits beyond the power of their reason or of their most strenuous voluntary exertion to control such was my pitiable case and at the moment i was most to be pitied nobody pitied me even my mother now she had nobody to talk to about me grew tired of my illness she was advised by her physician on account of her own health by no means to keep so close to the house as she had done of late she went out therefore every night to refresh herself at crowded parties and as soon as she left the house the nurse and every body in the family left me the servants settled it in my hearing that there was nothing in life the matter with me that my mother and i were equally vapoursomeish and timersome and that there was no use in nursing and pampering of me up in them fantastical fancifulnesses so the nurse and ladys maid and housekeeper went down all together to their tea and the housemaid who was ordered by the housekeeper to stay with me soon followed charging the under housemaid to supply her place who went off also in her turn leaving me in charge of the cooks daughter a child of nine years old who soon stole out of the room and scampered away along the gallery out of the reach of my voice leaving the room to darkness and to meand there i lay in all the horrors of a low nervous fever unpitied and alone shall i be pardoned for having dwelt so long on this history of the mental and corporeal ills of my childhood such details will probably appear more trivial to the frivolous and ignorant than to the philosophic and well informed not only because the best informed are usually the most indulgent judges but because they will perceive some connexion between these apparently puerile details and subjects of higher importance bacon and one who in later days has successfully followed him on this ground point out as one of the most important subjects of human inquiry equally necessary to the science of morals and of medicine the history of the power and influence of the imagination not only upon the mind and body of the imaginant but upon those of other people this history so much desired and so necessary has been but little advanced one reason for this may be that both by the learned and the unlearned it is usually begun at the wrong end belier mon ami commences par le commencement is excellent advice equally applicable to philosophical history and to fairy tale we must be content to begin at the beginning if we would learn the history of our own minds we must condescend to be even as little children if we would discover or recollect those small causes which early influence the imagination and afterwards become strong habits prejudices and passions in this point of view if they might possibly tend to turn public attention in a new direction to an important subject my puerile anecdotes may be permitted these my experiments solitary and in concert touching fear and of and concerning sympathies and antipathies are perhaps as well worth noting for future use as some of those by which sir kenelm digby and others astonished their own generation and which they bequeathed to ungrateful posterity chapter ii my mother who had a great and perhaps not altogether a mistaken opinion of the sovereign efficacy of the touch of gold in certain cases tried it repeatedly on the hand of the physician who attended me and who in consequence of this application had promised my cure but that not speedily taking place and my mother naturally impatient beginning to doubt his skill she determined to rely on her own on sir kenelm digbys principle of curing wounds by anointing the weapon with which the wound had been inflicted she resolved to try what could be done with the jew who had been the original cause of my malady and to whose malignant influence its continuance might be reasonably ascribed accordingly one evening at the accustomed hour when simon the oldclothesmans cry was heard coming down the street i being at that time seized with my usual fit of nerves and my mother being at her toilette crowning herself with roses to go to a ball she ordered the man to be summoned into the housekeepers room and through the intervention of the housekeeper the application was made on the jews hand and it was finally agreed that the same should be renewed every twelvemonth upon condition that he the said simon should never more be seen or heard under our windows or in our square my evening attack of nerves intermitted as the signal for its coming on ceased for some time i slept quietly it was but a short interval of peace simon meanwhile told his part of the story to his compeers and the fame of his annuity ran through street and alley and spread through the whole tribe of israel the bounty acted directly as an encouragement to ply the profitable trade and old clothes old clothes was heard again punctually under my window and another and another jew each more hideous than the former succeeded in the walk jews i should not call them though such they appeared to be at the time we afterwards discovered that they were good christian beggars dressed up and daubed for the purpose of looking as frightful and as like the traditionary representations and vulgar notions of a malicious revengeful ominous looking shylock as ever whetted his knife the figures were well got up the tone accent and action suited to the parts to be played the stage effect perfect favoured as it was by the distance at which i saw and wished ever to keep such personages and as money was given by my mothers orders to these people to send them away they came the more if i went out with a servant to walk a jew followed me if i went in the carriage with my mother a jew was at the coachdoor when i got in or when i got out or if we stopped but five minutes at a shop while my mother went in and i was left alone a jews head was at the carriage window at the side next me if i moved to the other side it was at the other side if i pulled up the glass which i never could do fast enough the jews head was there opposite to me fixed as in a frame and if i called to the servants to drive it away i was not much better off for at a few paces distance the figure would stand with his eyes fixed upon me and as if fascinated though i hated to look at those eyes for the life of me i could not turn mine away the manner in which i was thus haunted and pursued wherever i went seemed to my mother something really extraordinary to myself something magical and supernatural the systematic roguery of beggars their combinations meetings signals disguises transformations and all the secret tricks of their trade of deception were not at this time as they have in modern days been revealed to public view and attested by indisputable evidence ignorance is always credulous much was then thought wonderful nay almost supernatural which can now be explained and accounted for by asy and very ignoble means my fatherfor all this time though i have never mentioned him i had a father livingmy father being in public life and much occupied with the affairs of the nation had little leisure to attend to his family a great deal went on in his house without his knowing any thing about it he had heard of my being ill and well at different hours of the day but had left it to the physicians and my mother to manage me till a certain age but now i was nine years old he said it was time i should be taken out of the hands of the women so he inquired more particularly into my history and with mine he heard the story of simon and the jews my mother said she was glad my fathers attention was at last awakened to this extraordinary business she expatiated eloquently upon the medical or as she might call them magical effects of sympathies and antipathies on the nervous system but my father was not at all addicted to a belief in magic and he laughed at the whole female doctrine as he called it of sympathies and antipathies so declaring that they were all making fools of themselves and a miss molly of his boy he took the business up short with a high hand there was some trick some roguery in it the jews were all rascals he knew and he would soon settle them so to work he set with the beadles and the constables and the overseers the corporation of beggars were not in those days so well grounded in the theory and so alert in the practice of evasion as by long experience they have since become the society had not then as they have now in a certain lane their regular rendezvous called the beggars opera they had not then as they have now in a certain cellar an established school for teaching the art of scolding kept by an old woman herself an adept in the art they had not even their regular nocturnal feasts where they planned the operations of the next days or the next weeks campaign so that they could not as they now do set at nought the beadle and the parish officers the system of signals was not then perfected and the means of conveying secret and swift intelligence by telegraphic science had not in those days been practised the art of begging was then only art without science the native genius of knavery unaided by method or discipline the consequence was that the beggars fled before my fathers beadles constables and overseers and they were dispersed through other parishes or led into captivity to roundhouses or consigned to places called asylums for the poor and indigent or lodged in workhouses or crammed into houses of industry or penitentiary houses where by my fathers account of the matter there was little industry and no penitence and from whence the delinquents issued after their seven days captivity as bad or worse than when they went in be that as it may the essential point with my father was accomplished they were got rid of that season and before the next season he resolved that i should be out of the hands of the women and safe at a public school which he considered as a specific for all my complaints and indeed for every disease of mind and body incident to childhood it was the only thing he said to make a man of me there was jack b and thomas d and dick c sons of gentlemen in our county and young lord mowbray to boot all at school with dr y and what men they were already a respite of a few months was granted in consideration of my small stature and of my mothers all eloquent tears meantime my father took me more to himself and mixed with men i acquired some manly or what were called manly ideas my attention was awakened and led to new things i took more exercise and less medicine and with my health and strength of body my strength of mind and courage increased my father made me ashamed of that nervous sensibility of which i had before been vain i was glad that the past should be past and forgotten yet a painful reminiscence would come over my mind whenever i heard or saw the word jew about this time i first became fond of reading and i never saw the word in any page of any book which i happened to open without immediately stopping to read the passage and here i must observe that not only in the old story books where the jews are as sure to be wicked as the bad fairies or bad genii or allegorical personifications of the devils and the vices in the old emblems mysteries moralities c but in almost every work of fiction i found them represented as hateful beings nay even in modern tales of very late years since i have come to mans estate i have met with books by authors professing candour and tolerationbooks written expressly for the rising generation called if i mistake not moral tales for young people and even in these wherever the jews are introduced i find that they are invariably represented as beings of a mean avaricious unprincipled treacherous character even the peculiarities of their persons the errors of their foreign dialect and pronunciation were mimicked and caricatured as if to render them objects of perpetual derision and detestation i am far from wishing to insinuate that such was the serious intention of these authors i trust they will in future benefit by these hints i simply state the effect which similar representations in the story books i read when i was a child produced on my mind they certainly acted most powerfully and injuriously strengthening the erroneous association of ideas i had accidentally formed and confirming my childish prejudice by what i then thought the indisputable authority of printed books about this time also i began to attend to conversationto the conversation of gentlemen as well as of ladies and i listened with a sort of personal interest and curiosity whenever jews happened to be mentioned i recollect hearing my father talk with horror of some young gentleman who had been dealing with the jews i asked what this meant and was answered tis something very like dealing with the devil my dear those who give a child a witty instead of a rational answer do not know how dearly they often make the poor child pay for their jest my father added it is certain that when a man once goes to the jews he soon goes to the devil so harrington my boy i charge you at your peril whatever else you do keep out of the hands of the jewsnever go near the jews if once they catch hold of you theres an end of you my boy had the reasons for the prudential part of this charge been given to me and had the nature of the disgraceful transactions with the hebrew nation been explained it would have been full as useful to me and rather more just to them but this was little or no concern of my fathers with some practical skill in the management of the mind but with shortsighted views as to its permanent benefit and without an idea of its philosophic moral cultivation he next undertook to cure me of the fears which he had contributed to create he took opportunities of pointing out how poor how helpless how wretched they are how they are abused continually insulted daily and mocked by the lowest of servants or the least of children in our streets their very name a byword of reproach he is a jewan actual jew being the expression for avarice hardheartedness and fraud of their frauds i was told innumerable stories in short the jews were represented to me as the lowest meanest vilest of mankind and a conversion of fear into contempt was partially effected in my mind partially i say for the conversion was not complete the two sentiments existed together and by an experienced eye could easily be detected and seen even one through the other now whoever knows any thing of the passionsand who is there who does notmust be aware how readily fear and contempt run into the kindred feeling of hatred it was about this time just before i went to school that something relative to the famous jew bill became the subject of vehement discussion at my fathers table my father was not only a member of parliament but a man of some consequence with his party he had usually been a staunch friend of government but upon one occasion when he first came into parliament nine or ten years before the time of which i am now writing in or i think he had voted against ministry upon this very bill for the naturalization of the jews in england government liberally desired that they should be naturalized but there was a popular cry against it and my father on this one occasion thought the voice of the people was right after the bill had been carried half through it was given up by ministry the opposition to it proving so violent my father was a great stickler for parliamentary consistency and moreover he was of an obstinate temper ten years could make no change in his opinions as he was proud to declare there was at this time during a recess of parliament some intention among the london merchants to send addresses to government in favour of the jews and addresses were to be procured from the country the county members and among them of course my father were written to but he was furiously against the naturalization he considered all who were for it as enemies to england and i believe to religion he hastened down to the country to take the sense of his constituents or to impress them with his sense of the business previously to some intended county meeting there were i remember various dinners of constituents at my fathers and attempts after dinner over a bottle of wine to convince them that they were or ought to be of my fathers opinion and that they had better all join him in the toast of the jews are down and keep em down a subject apparently less liable to interest a child of my age could hardly be imagined but from my peculiar associations it did attract my attention i was curious to know what my father and all the gentlemen were saying about the jews at these dinners from which my mother and the ladies were excluded i was eager to claim my privilege of marching into the diningroom after dinner and taking my stand beside my fathers elbow and then i would gradually edge myself on till i got possession of half his chair and established a place for my elbow on the table i remember one day sitting for an hour together turning from one person to another as each spoke incapable of comprehending their arguments but fully understanding the vehemence of their tones and sympathizing in the varying expression of passion as to the rest quite satisfied with making out which speaker was for and which against the jews all those who were against them i considered as my fathers friends all those who were for them i called by a common misnomer or metonymy of the passions my fathers enemies because my father was their enemy the feeling of party spirit which is caught by children as quickly as it is revealed by men now combined to strengthen still more and to exasperate my early prepossession astonished by the attention with which i had this day listened to all that seemed so unlikely to interest a boy of my age my father with a smile and a wink and a side nod of his head not meant i suppose for me to see but which i noticed the more pointed me out to the company by whom it was unanimously agreed that my attention was a proof of uncommon abilities and an early decided taste for public business young lord mowbray a boy two years older than myself a gawkee schoolboy was present and had during this long hour after dinner manifested sundry symptoms of impatience and made many vain efforts to get me out of the room after cracking his nuts and his nutshells and thrice cracking the crackedafter suppressing the thickcoming yawns that at last could no longer be suppressed he had risen writhed stretched and had fairly taken himself out of the room and now he just peeped in to see if he could tempt me forth to play no no cried my father youll not get harrington he is too deep here in politicsbut however harrington my dear boy tis not the thing for your young companiongo off and play with mowbray but stay first since youve been one among us so long what have we been talking of the jews to be sure papa right cried my father and what about them my dear whether they ought to be let to live in england or any where right again that is right in the main cried my father though that is a larger view of the subject than we took and what reasons did you hear said a gentleman in company reasons interrupted my father oh sir to call upon the boy for all the reasons he has heardbut youll not pose him speak up speak up harrington my boy ive nothing to say about reasons sir no that was not a fair question said my father but my boy you know on which side you are dont you to be sureon your side father thats rightbravo to know on which side one is is one great point in life and i can tell on which side every one here is then going round the table i touched the shoulder of each of the company saying a jewno jew and bursts of applause ensued when i came to my father again he caught me in his arms kissed me patted my head clapped me on the back poured out a bumper of wine bid me drink his toast no naturalization billno jews and while i blundered out the toast and tossed off the bumper my father pronounced me a clever fellow a spirited little devil who if i did but live to be a man would be hed engage an honour to my country my family and my party exalted not to say intoxicated by my fathers praise when i went to the drawingroom to the ladies i became rather more eloquent and noisy than my mother thought quite becoming she could not indeed forbear smiling furtively at my wit when in answer to some simple country ladys question of after all why should not the jews be naturalized i with all the pertness of ignorance replied why maam because the jews are naturally an unnatural pack of people and you cant naturalize whats naturally unnatural kisses and cake in abundance followedbut when the company was gone my mamma thought it her duty to say a few words to me upon politeness and a few words to my father upon the too much wine he had given me the reproach to my father being just he could not endure but instead of admitting the truth he vowed by jupiter ammon that his boy should never be made a miss molly and to school i should go by jupiter ammon next morning plump now it was well known in our house that a sentence of my fathers beginning and ending by jupiter ammon admitted of no reply from any mortalit was the stamp of fate no hope of any reversion of the decree it seemed to bind even him who uttered the oath beyond his own power of revocation my mother was convinced that even her intercession was vain so she withdrew weeping to the female apartments where surrounded by her maids the decree of fate was reported but not verbatim after the manner of the gods and goddesses the maids and the washerwoman however scolded one another very much after their manner in a council held at midnight about my clothes the result of the whole was that they must be found and packed and found and packed at last they were and the next morning as decreed early as aurora streaked the east to school i went very little thinking of her rosytipped fingers chapter iii my life at school was like that of any other schoolboy i shall not record even if i could remember how often i was flogged when i did not deserve it or how often i escaped when i did five years of my life passed away of which i have nothing to relate but that i learned to whip a top and to play at ball and marbles each in their season that i acquired in due course the usual quantity of greek and latin and perpetrated in my time i presume the usual quantity of mischief but in the fourth year of my schoolboy life an opportunity for unusual mischief occurred an accident happened which however trifling in itself can never be effaced from my memory every particular connected with it is indeed as fresh in my recollection as it was the day after it happened it was a circumstance which awakened long dormant associations and combined them with all the feelings and principles of party spirit which had first been inculcated by my father at home and which had been exercised so well and so continually by my companions at school as to have become the governing power of my mind schoolboys as well as men can find or make a party question and quarrel out of any thing or out of nothing there was a scotch pedlar who used to come every thursday evening to our school to supply our various wants and fancies the scotch pedlar died and two candidates offered to supply his place an english lad of the name of dutton and a jew boy of the name of jacob dutton was son to a man who had lived as butler in mowbrays family lord mowbray knew the boy to be a rogue but thought he was attached to the mowbrays and at all events was determined to support him as being somehow supposed to be connected with his family reminding me of my early declaration at my fathers table against the naturalization of the jews and the bonmot i had made and the toast i had drunk and the pledge i had given mowbray easily engaged me to join him against the jew boy and a zealous partisan against jacob i became canvassing as if my life had depended upon this point but in spite of all our zeal noise violence and cabal it was the least and the most simple child in the school who decided the election this youngster had in secret offered to exchange a silver pencilcase for a top or something of such inadequate value jacob instead of taking advantage of the child explained to him that his pencilcase was worth twenty tops on the day of election this little boy mounted upon the top of a stepladder appeared over the heads of the crowd and in a small clear voice and with an eagerness which fixed attention related the history of his pencilcase and ended by hoping with all his heart that his friend jacob his honest jacob might be chosen jacob was elected mowbray and i and all our party vexed and mortified became the more inveterate in our aversion to the successful candidate and from this moment we determined to plague and persecute him till we should force him to give up every thursday evening the moment he appeared in the schoolroom or on the playground our party commenced the attack upon the wandering jew as we called this poor pedlar and with every opprobrious nickname and every practical jest that mischievous and incensed schoolboy zealots could devise we persecuted and tortured him body and mind we twanged at once a hundred jewsharps in his ear and before his eyes we paraded the effigy of a jew dressed in a gabardine of rags and paper in the passages through which he was to pass we set stumblingblocks in his way we threw orangepeel in his path and when he slipped or fell we laughed him to scorn and we triumphed over him the more the more he was hurt or the more his goods were injured we laughed at his losses mocked at his gains scorned his nation thwarted his bargains cooled his friends heated his enemiesand what was our reason he was a jew but he was as unlike to shylock as it is possible to conceive without one thought or look of malice or revenge he stood before us thursday after thursday enduring all that our barbarity was pleased to inflict he stood patient and longsuffering and even of this patience and resignation we made a jest and a subject of fresh reproach and taunt how i who was not in other cases a cruel or an illnatured boy could be so inhuman to this poor unprotected unoffending creature i cannot conceive but such in man or boy is the nature of persecution at the time it all appeared to me quite natural and proper a just and necessary war the blame if blame there were was divided among so many that the share of each my share at least appeared to me so small as not to be worth a moments consideration the shame if we had any was carried away in the tide of popular enthusiasm and drowned and lost in the fury and noise of the torrent in looking back upon this disgraceful scene of our boyish daysboyish indeed i can scarcely call them for i was almost and mowbray in his own opinion was quite a mani say in looking back upon this time i have but one comfort but i have one and i will make the most of it i think i should never have done so much wrong had it not been for mowbray we were both horribly to blame but though i was full as wrong in action i flatter myself that i was wrong upon better or upon less bad motives my aversion to the jew if more absurd and violent was less interested and malignant than mowbrays i never could stand as he did to parley and barter and chaffer with himif i had occasion to buy any thing i was high and haughty and at a word he named his price i questioned not not idown was thrown my money my back was turnedand away as for stooping to coax him as mowbray would when he had a point to gain i could not have done it to ask jacob to lend me money to beg him to give me more time to pay a debt to cajole and bully him by turns to call him alternately usurer and my honest fellow extortioner and my friend jacobmy tongue could not have uttered the words my soul detested the thought yet all this and more could mowbray do and did lord mowbray was deeply in jacobs debt especially for two watches which he had taken upon trial and which he had kept three months making every thursday some fresh excuse for not paying for them at last jacob said that he must have the money that his employer could wait no longer and that he should himself be thrown into prison mowbray said this was only a trick to work upon his compassion and that the jew might very well wait for his money because he asked twice as much for the watches as they were worth jacob offered to leave the price to be named by any creditable watchmaker lord mowbray swore that he was as good a judge as any watchmaker in christendom without pretending to dispute that point jacob finished by declaring that his distress was so urgent that he must appeal to some of the masters you little jewish telltale what do you mean by that pitiful threat appeal to the higher powers if you dare and ill make you repent it you usurer only do if you dare cried he clenching his hand and opening it so as to present successively the two ideas of a box on the ear and a blow on the stomach that was logic and eloquence added mowbray turning to me some ancient philosopher you know or i know has compared logic to the closed fist and eloquence to the open palm see what it is harrington to make good use of ones learning this was all very clever at least our party thought so and at the moment i applauded with the rest though in my secret soul i thought jacob was ill used and that he ought to have had justice if he had not been a jew his fear of a prison proved to be no pretence for it surmounted his dread of mowbrays logic and eloquence and of all the unpopularity which he was well aware must be the consequence of his applying to the higher powers jacob appealed and lord mowbray was summoned to appear before the head master and to answer to the charge it was proved that the price set upon the two watches was perfectly fair as a watchmaker who was examined on this point declared the watches had been so damaged during the two months they had been in his lordships possession that jacob declined taking them back lord mowbray protested that they were good for nothing when he first had them then why did he not return them after the first weeks trial when jacob had requested either to have them back or to be paid for them his lordship had then as half a dozen of the boys on the jews side were ready to testify refused to return the watches declaring they went very well and that he would keep them as long as he pleased and pay for them when he pleased and no sooner this plain tale put down the lord mowbray his wit and his party now availed him not he was publicly reprimanded and sentenced to pay jacob for the watches in a week or to be expelled from the school mowbray would have desired no better than to leave the school but he knew that his mother would never consent to this his mother the countess de brantefield was a countess in her own right and had an estate in her own powerhis father a simple commoner was dead his mother was his sole guardian that mother of mine said he to us would not hear of her sons being turned outso i must set my head to work against the head of the head master who is at this present moment inditing a letter to her ladyship beginning no doubt with i am sorry to be obliged to take up my pen or i am concerned to be under the necessity of sitting down to inform your ladyship now i must make haste and inform my lady mother of the truth with my own pen which luckily is the pen of a ready writer you will see continued he how cleverly i will get myself out of the scrape with her i know how to touch her up theres a folio at home of old manuscript memoirs of the de brantefield family since the time of the flood i believe its the only book my dear mother ever looks into and she has often made me read it to her tillno offence to my long line of ancestryi cursed it and them but now i bless it and them for supplying my happy memory with a case in point that will just hit my mothers fancy and of course obtain judgment in my favour a case in the reign of richard the second between a jew and my great great great six times great grandfather whom it is sufficient to name to have all the blood of all the de brantefields up in arms for me against all the jews that ever were born so my little jacob i have you mowbray accordingly wrote to his mother what he called a chefdoeuvre of a letter and next post came an answer from lady de brantefield with the money to pay her sons debt and as desired and expected a strong reproof to her son for his folly in ever dealing with a jew how could he possibly expect not to be cheated as by his own confession it appeared he had been grossly it was the more extraordinary since he so well recollected the ever to be lamented case of sir josseline de brantefield that her son could with all his family experience be at this time of day a dupe to one of a race branded by the public history of england and private memoirs of the de brantefields to all eternity mowbray showed this letter in triumph to all his party it answered the double purpose of justifying his own bad opinion of the tribe of israel and of tormenting jacob the next thursday evening after that on which judgment had been given against mowbray when jacob appeared in the schoolroom the antijewish party gathered round him according to the instructions of their leader who promised to show them some good sport at the jews expense only give me fair play said mowbray and stick close and dont let him off for your lives dont let him break through you till ive roasted him well theres your money cried mowbray throwing down the money for the watchestake itay count itevery penny rightive paid you by the day appointed and thank heaven and my friends the pound of flesh next my heart is safe from your knife shylock jacob made no reply but he looked as if he felt much now tell me honest jacob pursued mowbray honest jacob patient jacob tell me upon your honour if you know what that word meansupon your conscience if you ever heard of any such thingdont you think yourself a most pitiful dog to persist in coming here to be made game of for twopence tis wonderful how much your thoroughbred jew will do and suffer for gain we poor good christians could never do as much nowcould we any soul of us think you jacob yes replied jacob i think you could i think you would loud scornful laughter from our party interrupted him he waited calmly till it was over and then continued every soul of you good christians would i think do as much for a father if he were in want and dying as mine is there was a silence for the moment we were all i believe struck or touched except mowbray who unembarrassed by feeling went on with the same levity of tone as before a father in want are you sure now he is not a father of straw jacob set up for the nonce to move the compassion of the generous public well ive little faith but ive some charityheres a halfpenny for your father to begin with whilst i live my father shall ask no charity i hope said the son retreating from the insulting alms which mowbray still proffered why now jacob thats bad acting out o character jacob my jew for when did any son of israel any one of your tribe or your twelve tribes despise a farthing they could get honestly or dishonestly now this is a halfpennya good halfpenny come jacob take itdont be too proudpocket the affrontconsider its for your father not for yourselfyou said youd do much for your father jacob jacobs countenance continued rigidly calm except some little convulsive twitches about the mouth spare him mowbray whispered i pulling back mowbrays arm jew as he is you see he has some feeling about his father jew as he is and fool as you are harrington replied mowbray aloud do you really believe that this hypocrite cares about his father supposing he has one do you believe boys that a jew pedlar can love a father gratis as we do as we do repeated some of the boys oh no for his father cant be as good as ourshe is a jew jacob is your father good to you said one of the little boys he is a good father sircannot be a better father sir answered jacob the tears started into his eyes but he got rid of them in an instant before mowbray saw them i suppose for he went on in the same insulting tone whats that he says does he say he has a good father if hed swear it i would not believe hima good father is too great a blessing for a jew oh for shame mowbray said i and for shame for shame mowbray echoed from the opposite or as mowbray called it from the jewish party they had by this time gathered in a circle at the outside of that which we had made round jacob and many had brought benches and were mounted upon them looking over our heads to see what was going on jacob was now putting the key in his box which he had set down in the middle of the circle and was preparing to open it stay stay honest jacob tell us something more about this fine father for example whats his name and what is he i cannot tell you what he is sir replied jacob changing colour nor can i tell you his name cannot tell me the name of his own father a precious fellow didnt i tell you twas a sham father so now for the roasting i owe you mr jew there was a large fire in the schoolroom mowbray by a concerted movement between him and his friends shoved the jew close to the fire and barricadoed him up so that he could not escape bidding him speak when he was too hot and confess the truth jacob was resolutely silent he would not tell his fathers name he stood it till i could stand it no longer and i insisted upon mowbrays letting him off i could not use a dog so said i a dog no nor i but this is a jew a fellowcreature said i a fine discovery and pray harrington what has made you so tenderhearted all of a sudden for the jews your being so hardhearted mowbray said i when you persecute and torture this poor fellow how can i help speaking and pray sir said mowbray on which side are you speaking on the side of humanity said i fudge on whose side are you on yours mowbray if you wont be a tyrant if if you have a mind to rat rat sans phrase and run over to the jewish side i always thought you were a jew at heart harrington no more a jew than yourself mowbray nor so much said i standing firm and raising my voice so that i could be heard by all no more a jew than myself pray how do you make that out by being more of a christianby sticking more to the maxim do as you would be done by that is a good maxim said jacob a cheer from all sides supported me as i advanced to liberate the jew but mowbray preventing me leaped upon jacobs box and standing with his legs stretched out colossuslike might makes right said he all the world over youre a mighty fine preacher master harrington lets see if you can preach me down lets see if i cant pull you down cried i springing forward indignation giving me strength i seized and with one jerk pulled the colossus forward and swung him to the ground well done harrington resounded from all sides mowbray the instant he recovered his feet flew at me furious for vengeance dealing his blows with desperate celerity he was far my overmatch in strength and size but i stood up to him between the blows i heard jacobs voice in tones of supplication when i had breath i called out to him jacob escape and i heard the words jacob jacob escape repeated near me but instead of escaping he stood stock still reiterating his prayer to be heard at last he rushed between uswe pausedboth parties called to us insisting that we should hear what the jew had to say young lord said he and dear young gentleman turning to me let poor jacob be no more cause now or ever of quarrel between you he shall trouble you never more this is the last day the last minute he will ever trouble you he bowed looking round to all twice to the upper circle where his friends stood he added much obligedfor all kindnessgrateful blessingsblessings on alland may he could say no more but hastily taking up his box he retired through the opening crowd the door closed after him both parties stood silent for a moment till mowbray exclaimed huzza dutton for ever weve won the day dutton for thursday huzza huzza adieu adieuwandering jew no one echoed his adieu or his huzzas i never saw man or boy look more vexed and mortified all further combat between us ceased the boys one and all taking my part and insisting upon peace the next day mowbray offered to lay any wager that jacob the jew would appear again on the ensuing thursday and that he would tell his fathers name or at least come provided as mowbray stated it with a name for his father these wagers were taken up and bets ran high on the subject thursday was anxiously expectedthursday arrived but no jacob the next thursday cameanother and anotherand no jacob when it was certain that poor jacob would appear no moreand when his motive for resigning and his words at taking leave were recollectedand when it became evident that his balls and his tops and his marbles and his knives had always been better and more reasonable than duttons the tide of popularity ran high in his favour poor jacob was loudly regretted and as long as schoolboys could continue to think about the same thing we continued conjecturing why it was that jacob would not tell us his fathers name we made many attempts to trace him and to discover his secret but all our inquiries proved ineffectual we could hear no more of jacob and our curiosity died away mowbray who was two or three years my senior left school soon afterwards we did not meet at the university he went to oxford and i to cambridge chapter iv when the mind is full of any one subject that subject seems to recur with extraordinary frequencyit appears to pursue or to meet us at every turn in every conversation that we hear in every book we open in every newspaper we take up the reigning idea recurs and then we are surprised and exclaim at these wonderful coincidences probably such happen every day but pass unobserved when the mind is not intent upon similar ideas or excited by any strong analogous feeling when the learned sir thomas browne was writing his essay on the gardens of cyrus his imagination was so possessed by the idea of a quincunx that he is said to have seen a quincunx in every object in nature in the same manner after a jew had once made an impression on my imagination a jew appeared wherever i went as i was on my road to cambridge travelling in a stagecoach whilst we were slowly going up a steep hill i looked out of the window and saw a man sitting under a hawthornbush reading very intently there was a pedlars box beside him i thought i knew the box i called out as we were passing and asked the man whats the milestone he looked up it was poor jacob the beams of the morning sun dazzled him but he recognized me immediately as i saw by the look of joy which instantly spread over his countenance i jumped out of the carriage saying that i would walk up the hill and jacob putting his book in his pocket took up his wellknown box and walked along with me i began not by asking any question about his father though curiosity was not quite dead within me but by observing that he was grown very studious since we parted and i asked what book he had been reading so intently he showed it to me but i could make nothing of it for it was german he told me that it was the life of the celebrated mendelssohn the jew i had never heard of this celebrated man he said that if i had any curiosity about it he could lend me a translation which he had in his pack and with all the alacrity of goodwill he set down the box to look for the book no dont trouble yourselfdont open it said i putting my hand on the box instantly a smile and a sigh and a look of ineffable kindness and gratitude from jacob showed me that all the past rushed upon his heart not trouble myself oh master harrington said he poor jacob is not so ungrateful as that would come to youre only too grateful said i but walk onkeep up with me and tell me how your affairs are going on in the world for i am much more interested about them than about the life of the celebrated mendelssohn is that possible said his looks of genuine surprised simplicity he thanked me and told me that he was much better in the world than formerly that a good friend of his a london jeweller of his own tribe who had employed him as a pedlar and had been satisfied with his conduct had assisted him through his difficulties this was the last time he should go his rounds in england as a pedlar he said he was going into another and a much better way of business his friend the london jeweller had recommended him to his brother a rich israelite who had a valuable store in gibraltar and who wanted a young man to assist him on whom he could entirely depend jacob was going out to gibraltar in the course of the next week and now mr harrington said he changing his tone and speaking with effort as if he were conquering some inward feeling now it is all over mr harrington and that i am leaving england and perhaps may never see you again i wish before i take leave of you to tell you sir who my father waswas for he is no more i did not make a mystery of his name merely to excite curiosity as some of the young gentlemen thought nor because i was ashamed of my low birth my father was simon the old clothesman i knew you would start mr harrington at hearing his name i knew all that you suffered in your childhood about him and i once heard you say to lord mowbray who was taunting you with something about old simon that you would not have that known upon any account to your schoolfellows for that they would plague you for ever from that moment i was determined that i would never be the cause of recalling or publishing what would be so disagreeable to you this was the reason why i persisted in refusing to tell my fathers name when lord mowbray pressed me so to declare it before all your schoolfellows and now i hope concluded he that mr harrington will not hate poor jacob though he is the son of he paused i assured him of my regard i assured him that i had long since got rid of all the foolish prejudices of my childhood i thanked him for the kindness and generosity he had shown in bearing mowbrays persecution for my sake and in giving up his own situation rather than say or do what might have exposed me to ridicule thanking me again for taking as he said such a kind interest in the concerns of a poor jew like him he added with tears in his eyes that he wished he might some time see me again that he should to the last day of his life remember me and should pray for my health and happiness and that he was sorry he had no way of showing me his gratitude again he recurred to his box and would open it to show me the translation of mendelssohns life or if that did not interest me he begged of me to take my choice from among a few books he had with him perhaps one of them might amuse me on my journey for he knew i was a reading young gentleman i could not refuse him as he opened the packet of books i saw one directed to mr israel lyons cambridge i told jacob that i was going to cambridge he said he should be there in a few days for that he took cambridge in his road and he rejoiced that he should see me again i gave him a direction to my college and for his gratification in truth more than for my own i borrowed the magazine containing the life of mendelssohn which he was so anxious to lend me we had now reached the coach at the top of the hill i got in and saw jacob trudging after me for some time but at the first turn of the road i lost sight of him and then as my two companions in the coach were not very entertaining one of them a great fat man being fast asleep and snoring the other a pale spare woman being very sick and very cross i betook myself to my magazine i soon perceived why the life of mendelssohn had so deeply interested poor jacob mendelssohn was a jew born like himself in abject poverty but by perseverance he made his way through incredible difficulties to the highest literary reputation among the most eminent men of his country and of his age and obtained the name of the jewish socrates in consequence of his early intense and misapplied application in his first jewish school he was seized at ten years old with some dreadful nervous disease this interested me and i went on with his history of his life i should probably have remembered nothing except what related to the nervous disorder but it so happened that soon after i had read this life i had occasion to speak of it and it was of considerable advantage in introducing me to good company at cambridge a few days after i arrived there jacob called on me i returned his book assuring him that it had interested me very much then sir said he since you are so fond of learning and learned men and so kind to the jews there is a countryman of mine now at cambridge whom it will be well worth your while to be acquainted with and who if i may be bold enough to say so has been prepossessed in your favour by hearing of your humanity to poor jacob touched as i was by his eagerness to be of use to me i could not help smiling at jacobs simplicity and enthusiasm when he proceeded to explain that this person with whom he was so anxious to make me acquainted was a learned rabbi who at this time taught hebrew to several of the gownsmen of cambridge he was the son of a polish jew who had written a hebrew grammar and was himself author of a treatise on fluxions since presented to and accepted by the university and moreover the author of a celebrated work on botany at the moment jacob was speaking certainly my fancy was bent on a phaeton and horses rather than on hebrew or fluxions and the contrast was striking between what he conceived my first objects at cambridge would be and what they really were however i thanked him for his good opinion and promised to make myself acquainted with his learned countryman to make the matter secure as jacob was to leave cambridge the next day and as the rabbi was at the house of one of his scholars in the country and was not to return to cambridge till the ensuing week jacob left with me a letter for him and the very parcel which i had seen directed to mr israel lyons these i engaged to deliver with my own hands jacob departed satisfiedhappy in the hope that he had done me a service and so in fact it proved every father and every son who has been at the university knows how much depends upon the college companions with whom a young man first associates there are usually two sets if he should join the dissipated set it is all over with him he learns nothing but if he should get into the set with whom science and literature are in fashion he acquires knowledge and a taste for knowledge with all the ardour inspired by sympathy and emulation with all the facility afforded by public libraries and public lecturesthe collected and combined information of the living and the deadhe pursues his studies he then fully enjoys the peculiar benefits of a university education the union of many minds intent upon the same object working with all the advantages of the scientific division of labour in a literary manufactory when i went to deliver my packet to mr lyons i was surprised by seeing in him a man as different as possible from my preconceived notion of a jewish rabbi i never should have guessed him to be either a rabbi or a jew i expected to have seen a man nearly as old as methuselah with a reverend beard dirty and shabby and with a blue pocket handkerchief instead of which i saw a gay looking man of middle age with quick sparkling black eyes and altogether a person of modern appearance both in dress and address i thought i must have made a mistake and presented my packet with some hesitation reading aloud the direction to mr israel lyonsi am the man sir said he our honest friend jacob has described you so well mr harringtonmr william harrington harrington you perceive that i am well informedthat i feel as if i had had the pleasure of being acquainted with you for some time i am very much obliged by this visit i should have done myself the honour to wait upon you but i returned only yesterday from the country and my necessary engagements do not leave as much time for my pleasures as i could wish i perceived by the tone of his address that though he was a hebrew teacher he was proud of showing himself to be a man of the world i found him in the midst of his hebrew scholars and moreover with some of the best mathematicians and some of the first literary men in cambridge i was awestruck and should have been utterly at a loss had it not been for a print of mendelssohn over the chimneypiece which recalled to my mind the life of this great man by the help of that i had happily some ideas in common with the learned jew and we entered immediately into conversation much to our mutual relief and delight dr johnson in one of his letters speaking of a first visit from a young gentleman who had been recommended to his acquaintance says that the initiatory conversation of two strangers is seldom pleasing or instructive but i am sure that i was both pleased and instructed during this initiatory conversation and mr lyons did not appear to be oppressed or encumbered by my visit i found by his conversation that though he was the son of a great hebrew grammarian and himself a great hebrew scholar and though he had written a treatise on fluxions and a work on botany yet he was not a mere mathematician a mere grammarian or a mere botanist nor yet a dull pedant in despite of the assertion that hebrew roots are always found to flourish best on barren ground this hebrew scholar was a man of a remarkably fertile genius this visit determined my course and decided me as to the society which i kept during the three happy and profitable years i afterwards spent at cambridge mr israel lyons is now no more i hope it is no disrespect to his memory to say that he had his foibles it was no secret among our contemporaries at cambridge that he was like too many other men of genius a little deficient in economyshall i say it a little extravagant the difficulties into which he brought himself by his improvidence were however always to him matters of jest and raillery and often indeed proved subjects of triumph for he was sure to extricate himself by some of his many talents or by some of his many friends i should be very sorry however to support the dangerous doctrine that men of genius are privileged to have certain faults i record with quite a different intention these facts to mark the effect of circumstances in changing my own prepossessions the faults of israel lyons were not of that species which i expected to find in a jew perhaps he was aware that the hebrew nation is in general supposed to be too careful and he might therefore be a little vain of his own carelessness about money matters be this as it may i confess that at the time i rather liked him the better for it his disregard on all occasions of pecuniary interest gave me a conviction of his liberal spirit i was never fond of money or remarkably careful of it myself but i always kept out of debt and my father gave me such a liberal allowance that i had it in my power to assist a friend mr lyons lively disposition and manners took off all that awe which i might have felt for his learning and genius i may truly say that these three years which i spent at cambridge fixed my character and the whole tone and colour of my future life i do not pretend to say that i had not during my time at the university and afterwards in london my follies and imprudences but my soul did not like many other souls of my acquaintance embody and embrute when the time for my quitting cambridge arrived i went to take leave of my learned friend mr israel lyons and to offer him my grateful acknowledgments in the course of the conversation i mentioned the childish terror and aversion with which i had been early taught to look upon a jew i rejoiced that even while a schoolboy i had conquered this foolish prejudice and that at the university during those years which often decide our subsequent opinions in life it had been my good fortune to become acquainted with one whose superior abilities and kindness of disposition had formed in my mind associations of quite an opposite nature pleased with this just tribute to his merit and with the disposition i showed to think candidly of persons of his persuasion mr lyons wished to confirm me in these sentiments and for this purpose gave me a letter of introduction to a friend with whom he was in constant correspondence mr montenero a jewish gentleman born in spain who had early in life quitted that country in consequence of his horror of tyranny and persecution he had been fortunate enough to carry his wealth which was very considerable safely out of spain and had settled in america where he had enjoyed perfect toleration and freedom of religious opinion and as according to mr lyons description of him this spanish jew must i thought be a most accomplished and amiable person i eagerly accepted the offered letter of introduction and resolved that it should be my first business and pleasure on arriving in london to find and make myself acquainted with mr montenero chapter v people like myself of lively imagination may have often felt that change of place suddenly extinguishes or gives a new direction to the ardour of their enthusiasm such persons may therefore naturally suspect that as my steps retired from cams smooth margin my enthusiasm for my learned rabbi might gradually fade away and that on my arrival in london i should forget my desire to become acquainted with the accomplished spanish jew but it must be observed that with my mothers warmth of imagination i also had i will not say i inherited some of my fathers intensity of willsome of that firmness of adhesion to a preconceived notion or purpose which in a good cause is called resolution in a bad cause obstinacy and which is either a curse or a blessing to the possessor according to the degree or habit of exercising the reasoning faculty with which he may be endowed on my arrival in london a variety of petty unforeseen obstacles occurred to prevent my accomplishing my visit to the spanish jew new and neverending demands upon my time arose both in and out of my own family so that there seemed a necessity for my spending every hour of the day and night in a manner wholly independent of my will there seemed to be some fatality that set at nought all my previous plans and calculations every morning for a week after my arrival i regularly put my letter of introduction to mr montenero into my pocket resolving that i would that day find him out and pay my visit but after walking all the morning to bear and to forbear various engagements to execute promised commissions and to fulfil innumerable duties i regularly came home as i went out with my letter in my pocket and with the sad conviction that it was utterly impossible to deliver it that day these obstacles and this contrariety of external circumstances instead of bending my will or making me give up my intention fixed it more firmly in my mind and strengthened my determination nor was i the least shaken from the settled purpose of my soul by the perversity with which every one in our house opposed or contemned that purpose one morning when i had my letter and my hat in my hand i met my father who after looking at the direction of the letter and hearing that i was going on a visit to a spanish jew asked what business upon earth i could have with a jewcursed the whole racerejoiced that he had fiveandtwenty years ago voted against their naturalization in england and ended as he began by wondering what in the name of heaven could make me scrape acquaintance with such fellows when in reply i mentioned my friend mr israel lyons and the high character he had drawn of mr montenero my father laughed saying that he would answer for it my friend israel was not an israelite without guile for that was a description of israelite he had never yet seen and he had seen a confounded deal of the world he decided that my accomplished spanish jew would prove an adventurer and he advised me a young man heir to a good english fortune to keep out of his foreign clutches in short he stuck to the advice he gave me and only wished i would stick to the promise i gave him when i was ten years old to have no dealings with the jews it was in vain that i endeavoured to give my explanation of the word dealings my fathers temper naturally positive had i observed become as he advanced in years much more dogmatic and intolerant i avoided contradicting his assertions but i determined to pursue my own course in a matter where there could be nothing really wrong or improper that morning however i must i perceived as in duty bound sacrifice to my father he took me under the arm and carried me away to introduce me to some commonplace member of parliament who as he assured me was a much fitter and more profitable acquaintance for me than any member of the synagogue could possibly be the next morning when firm to my purpose i was sallying forth my mother with a face of tender expostulation and alarm stopped me and entreated me to listen to her my mother whose health had always been delicate had within these three last years fallen into what is called a very nervous state and this with her natural timidity and sensibility inclined her now to a variety of superstitious feelingsto a belief in presentiments and presages omens and dreams added to her original belief in sympathies and antipathies some of these her peculiarities of opinion and feeling had perhaps at first only been assumed or yielded to in her season of youth and beauty to interest her admirers and to distinguish herself in society but as age advanced they had been confirmed by habit and weakness so that what in the beginning might have been affectation was in the end reality she was alarmed she said by the series of strange coincidences which from my earliest childhood had occurred seeming to connect my fate in some extraordinary manner with these jews she recalled all the circumstances of my illness when i was a child she confessed that she had retained a sort of antipathy to the idea of a jewa weakness it might bebut she had had dreams and presentiments and my fortune had been told her while i was at cambridge and some evil she had been assured hung over me within the five ensuing yearssome evil connected with a jew in short she did not absolutely believe in such prophecies but still it was extraordinary that the first thing my mind should be intent upon in coming to town should be a spanish jew and she earnestly wished that i would avoid rather than seek the connexion knowing my mothers turn for the romantic i had anticipated her delight at the idea of making acquaintance with a nobleminded travelled spaniard but unluckily her imagination had galloped off in a contrary direction to mine and now my only chance was to make her hear reason and a very bad chance i knew this to be i endeavoured to combat her presentiment and to explain whatever appeared extraordinary in my love and hatred of the jews by recalling the slight and natural circumstances at school and the university which had changed my early prejudice and i laboured to show that no natural antipathy could have existed since it had been completely conquered by humanity and reason so that now i had formed what might rather appear a natural sympathy with the race of israel i laboured these points in vain when i urged the literary advantages i had reaped from my friendship with mr israel lyons she besought me not to talk of friendship with persons of that sort i had now awakened another train of associations all unfavourable to my views my mother wonderedfor both she and my father were great wonderers as are all whether high or low who have lived only with one set of peoplemy mother wondered that instead of seeking acquaintance in the city with old jews and persons of whom nobody had ever heard i could not find companions of my own age and rank in life for instance my schoolfellow and friend lord mowbray who was now in town just returned from abroad a fine young officer much admired here by the ladies i can assure you harrington added my mother this as i had opportunity of seeing was perfectly true four nearly five years had made a great apparent change in mowbray for the better his manners were formed his air that of a man of fashiona military man of fashion he had served a campaign abroad had been at the siege of gibraltar had much to say and could say it well we all know what astonishing metamorphoses are sometimes wrought even on the most hopeless subjects by seeing something of the world by serving a campaign or two how many a light empty shell of a young man comes home full if not of sense at least of something bearing the semblance of sense how many a heavy lout a dull son of earth returns enlivened into a conversable being who can tell at least of what it has seen heard and felt if not understood and who for years perhaps for ever afterwards by the help of telling of other countries may pass in his own for a man of solid judgment such being the advantages to be derived by these means even in the most desperate cases we may imagine the great improvement produced in a young man of lord mowbrays abilities and with his ambition both to please and to shine in youth and by youth improvement in appearance and manner is easily mistaken for improvement in mind and principle all that i had disliked in the schoolboythe tyrannical dispositionthe cruel temperthe insolent tonehad disappeared and in their place i saw the deportment which distinguished a gentleman whatever remained of party spirit so different from the wrangling overbearing mischievous party spirit of the boy was in the man and the officer so happily blended with love of the service and with lesprit de corps that it seemed to add a fresh grace animation and frankness to his manner the evil spirit of persecution was dislodged from his soul or laid asleep within him and in its place appeared the conciliating spirit of politeness he showed a desire to cultivate my friendship which still more prepossessed me in his favour mowbray happened to call upon me soon after the conversation i had with my mother about the spanish jew i had not been dissuaded from my purpose by her representations but i had determined to pay my visit without saying any thing more about the matter and to form my own judgment of the man a new difficulty however occurred my letter of introduction had disappeared i searched my pockets my portfolios my lettercase every conceivable place but it was not to be found mowbray obligingly assisted me in this search but after emptying half a dozen times over portfolios pockets and desks i was ashamed to give him more trouble and i gave up the letter as lost when mowbray heard that this letter about which i was so anxious was an introduction to a jewish gentleman he could not forbear rallying me a little but in a very agreeable tone upon the constancy of my israelitish taste and the perfect continuance of my identity i left you harrington and i find you after four years absence intent upon a jew boy and man you are one and the same and in your case tis well that the boy and man should an individual make but for my part i am glad to change my identity like all other mortals once in seven years and i hope you think i have changed for the better it was impossible to think otherwise especially at that moment in a frank openhearted manner he talked of his former tyrannical nature and blamed himself for our schoolboy quarrel i was charmed with him and the more so when he entered so warmly or so politely into my present distress and sympathized with my madness of the moment he suggested all that was possible to be done to supply the loss of the letter could not i get another in its stead the same friend who gave me one letter of introduction could write another no mr israel lyons had left cambridge and i knew not where to direct to him could not i present myself to mr montenero without a letter that might be rather an awkward proceeding but i was not to be stopped by any nice observances now that i had set my mind upon the matter unluckily however i could by no means recollect the exact address of mr montenero i was puzzled among half a dozen different streets and numbers mowbray offered to walk with me and we went to each of these streets and to all the variety of numbers i suggested but in vain no mr montenero was to be found at last tired and disappointed as i was returning home mowbray said he thought he could console me for the loss of my chance of seeing my spanish jew by introducing me to the most celebrated jew that ever appeared in england then turning into a street near one of the playhouses he knocked at the door of a house where macklin the actor lodged lord mowbray was well acquainted with him and i was delighted to have an opportunity of seeing this celebrated man he was at this time past the meridian of ordinary life but he was in the zenith of his extraordinary course and in the full splendour and vigour of his powers here said mowbray presenting me to macklin is a young gentleman who is ambitious of being acquainted with the most celebrated jew that ever appeared in england allow me to introduce him to the real original jew of venice this is the jew that shakspeare drew whose lines are those harrington do you know yours i suppose mine you do me much honour no they are mr popes then you dont know the anecdote mr pope in the decline of life was persuaded by bolingbroke to go once more to the playhouse to see mr macklin in the character of shylock according to the custom of the time pope was seated among the critics in the pit he was so much struck and transported with admiration that in the middle of the play he started up and repeated that distich now was not i right when i told you harrington that i would introduce you to the most celebrated jew in all england in all christendom in the whole civilized world no one better than mowbray knew the tone of enthusiastic theatric admiration in which the heroes of the stage like or are supposed to like to be addressed macklin who was not asy to please was pleased the lines or as quin insisted upon their being called the cordage of his face relaxed he raised turned and settled his wig in sign of satisfaction then with a complacent smile gave me a little nod and suffered lord mowbray to draw him out by degrees into a repetition of the history of his first attempt to play the character of shylock a play altered from shakespeares and called the jew of venice had been for some time in vogue in this play the jew had been represented by the actors of the part as a ludicrous and contemptible rather than a detestable character and when macklin recurring to shakespeares original shylock proposed in the revived merchant of venice to play the part in a serious style he was scoffed at by the whole company of his brother actors and it was with the utmost difficulty he could screw the managers courage to the stickingplace and prevail upon him to hazard the attempt take the account in macklins own words footnote vide macklins life when the long expected night at last arrived the house was crowded from top to bottom with the first company in town the two front rows of the pit as usual were full of critics i eyed them said macklin i eyed them sir through the slit in the curtain and was glad to see them there as i wished in such a cause to be tried by a special jury when i made my appearance in the greenroom dressed for the part with my red hat on my head my piqued beard my loose black gown and with a confidence which i had never before assumed the performers all stared at one another and evidently with a stare of disappointment well sir hitherto all was right till the last bell rung then i confess my heart began to beat a little however i mustered up all the courage i could and recommending my cause to providence threw myself boldly on the stage and was received by one of the loudest thunders of applause i ever before experienced the opening scenes being rather tame and level i could not expect much applause but i found myself listened to i could hear distinctly in the pit the words very wellvery well indeed this man seems to know what he is about these encomiums warmed me but did not overset me i knew where i should have the pull which was in the third act and accordingly at this period i threw out all my fire and as the contrasted passions of joy for the merchants losses and grief for the elopement of jessica open a fine field for an actors powers i had the good fortune to please beyond my most sanguine expectations the whole house was in an uproar of applause and i was obliged to pause between the speeches to give it vent so as to be heard the trial scene wound up the fulness of my reputation here i was well listened to and here i made such a silent yet forcible impression on my audience that i retired from this great attempt most perfectly satisfied on my return to the greenroom after the play was over it was crowded with nobility and critics who all complimented me in the warmest and most unbounded manner and the situation i felt myself in i must confess was one of the most flattering and intoxicating of my whole life no money no title could purchase what i felt by g sir though i was not worth fifty pounds in the world at that time yet let me tell you i was charles the great for that night the emphasis and enthusiasm with which macklin spoke pleased meenthusiastic people are always well pleased with enthusiasm my curiosity too was strongly excited to see him play shylock i returned home full of the jew of venice but nevertheless not forgetting my spanish jewat last my mother could no longer bear to see me perplex and vex myself in my fruitless search for the letter and confessed that while we were talking the preceding day finding that no arguments or persuasions of hers had had any effect she had determined on what she called a pious fraud so while i was in the roombefore my facewhile i was walking up and down holding forth in praise of my jewish friend whom i did know and my jewish friend whom i did not know she had taken up mr israel lyons letter of introduction to mr montenero and had thrown it into the fire i was very much provoked but to my mother and a mother who was so fond of me what could i say after all i confessed there was a good deal of fancy in the case on my side as well as on hers i endeavoured to forget my disappointment my imagination turned again to shylock and macklin and to please me my mother promised to make a large party to go with me to see the merchant of venice the next night that macklin should act but unfortunately macklin had just now quarrelled with the manager and till this could be made up there was no chance of his condescending to perform meantime my mother having as she thought fairly got rid of the jews and mowbray having as he said cured me of my present fit of jewish insanity desired to introduce me to his mother and sister they had now just come to town from the priorybrantefield priory an ancient familyseat where much to her daughters discomfiture lady de brantefield usually resided eight months of the year because there she felt her dignity more safe from contact and herself of more indisputable and unrivalled consequence than in the midst of the jostling pretensions and modern innovations of the metropolis at the priory every thing attested recorded and flattered her pride of ancient and illustrious descent in my childhood i had once been with my mother at the priory and i still retained a lively recollection of the antique wonders of the place foremost in my memory came an old picture called sir josseline going to the holy land where sir josseline de mowbray stood in complete armour pointing to a horrid figure of a prostrate jew on whose naked back an executioner with uplifted whip was prepared to inflict stripes for some shocking crimethis picture had been painted in times when the proportions of the human figure were little attended to and when foreshortening was not at all understood this added to the horrible effect for the executioners arm and scourge were of tremendous size sir josseline stood miraculously tall and the jew crouching supplicating sprawling was the most distorted squalid figure eyes ever beheld or imagination could conceive after having once beheld it i could never bear to look upon it again nor did i ever afterwards enter the tapestry chamberbut there were some other of the antique rooms in which i delighted and divers pieces of old furniture which i reverenced there was an ancient bed with scolloped tester and tarnished quilt in which queen elizabeth had slept and a huge embroidered pincushion done by no hands as you may guess but those of the unfortunate mary queen of scots who during her captivity certainly worked harder than ever queen worked before or since then there was an old wormeaten chair in which john of gaunt had sat and i remember that while lady de brantefield expressed her just indignation against the worms for having dared to attack this precious relique i kneeling to the chair admired the curious fretwork the dusty honeycombs which these invisible little workmen had excavated but john of gaunts chair was nothing to king johns table there was a little black oak table too with broken legs which was invaluablefor as lady de brantefield confidently affirmed king john of france and the black prince had sat and supped at it i marvelled much in silencefor i had been sharply reproved for some observation i had unwittingly made on the littleness and crookedness of a dark cornerchimneyed nook shown us for the banquetingroom and i had fallen into complete disgrace for having called the winding staircases leading to the turretchambers back stairs of lady de brantefield the touchmenot mistress of the mansion i had retained a sublime but not a beautiful ideai now felt a desire to see her again to verify my old notion of lady anne mowbray who at the time i had been at the priory was a little child some years younger than myself i could recollect nothing except that she wore a pink sash of which she was very vain and that she had been ushered into the drawingroom after dinner by mrs fowler at the sight of whom my inmost soul had recoiled i remember indeed pitying her little ladyship for being under such dominion and longing to ask her whether fowler had told her the story of simon the jew but i could never commune with lady anne for either she was up in the nursery or fowler was at her back in the drawingroom or little lady anne was sitting upright on her stool at her mothers feet whom i did not care to approach and in whose presence i seldom ventured to speakconsequently my curiosity on this point had from that hour slumbered within me but it now wakened upon my mothers proposing to present me to lady anne and the pleasure of asking and the hope of obtaining an answer to my longmeditated question was the chief gratification i promised myself from the renewal of our acquaintance with her ladyship chapter vi my recollection of lady de brantefield proved wonderfully correct she gave me back the image i had in my minda stiff haughtylooking picture of a faded old beauty adhering religiously to the fashion of the times when she had been worshipped she made it a point to wear the old headdress exactly she was in black in a hoop of vast circumference and she looked and moved as if her being countess de brantefield in her own right and concentring in her person five baronies ought to be for ever present to the memory of all mankind as it was to her own my mother presented me to her ladyship the ceremony of introduction between a young gentleman and an old lady of those times performed on his part with a low bow and look of profound deference on hers with back steppingcurtsy and bridled head was very different from the nodding bobbing trick of the present day as soon as the finale of lady de brantefields sentence touching honour happiness and family connexion would permit i receded and turned from the mother to the daughter little lady anne mowbray a light fantastic figure bedecked with daisies pied covered with a profusion of tiny french flowers whose invisible wire stalks kept in perpetual motion as she turned her pretty head from side to side smiling sighing tittering flirting with the officers round her lady anne appeared and seemed as if she delighted in appearing as perfect a contrast as possible to her august and formidable mother the daughter had seen the ill effect of the mothers haughty demeanour and mistaking reverse of wrong for right had given reserve and dignity to the winds taught by the happy example of colonel topham who preceded me i learned that the low bow would have been here quite out of place the sliding bow was for lady anne and the way was to dash into nonsense with her directly and full into the midst of nonsense i dashed though her ladyships perfect accessibility seemed to promise prompt reply to any question that could be asked yet the single one about which i felt any curiosity i could not contrive to introduce during the first three hours i was in her ladyships company there was such a quantity of preliminary nonsense to get through and so many previous questions to be disposed of for example i was first to decide which of three colours i preferred all of them pronounced to be the prettiest in the universe boue de paris oeil de lempereur and a suppressed sigh at that moment lady anne wore the suppressed sigh but i did not know iti mistook it for boue de parisconceive my ignorance no two things in nature not a horsechestnut and a chestnuthorse could be more different conceive my confusion and colonels topham and beauclerk standing by but i recovered myself in public opinion by admiring the slipper on her ladyships little foot now i showed my taste for this slipper had but the night before arrived express from paris and it was called a venezy voir and how a slipper with a heel so high and a quarter so low could be kept on the foot or how the fair could walk in it i could not conceive except by the special care of her guardian sylph after the venezy voir had fixed all eyes as desired the lady turning alternately to colonels topham and beauclerk with rapid gestures of ecstasy exclaimed the pouf the pouf oh on wednesday i shall have the pouf now what manner of thing a pouf might be i had not the slightest conception it requireth said bacon great cunning for a man in discourse to seem to know that which he knoweth not warned by boue de paris and the suppressed sigh this time i found safety in silence i listened and learned first that un pouf was the most charming thing in the creation next that nobody upon earth could be seen in paris without one that one was coming from mademoiselle berlin per favour of miss wilkes for lady anne mowbray and that it would be on her head on wednesday and colonel topham swore there would be no resisting her ladyship in the pouf she would look so killing so killing was the colonels last i now thought that i had lady annes ear to myself but she ran on to something else and i was forced to follow as she skimmed over fields of nonsense at last she did stop to take breath and i did get in my one question to which her ladyship replied poor fowler frighten me lord no like her oh yesdote upon fowler didnt youno you hated her i remember well but i assure you shes the best creature in the world i could always make her do just what i pleased positively i must make you make it up with her if i can remember it when she comes up to townshe is to come up for my birthday mamma you know generally leaves her at the priory to take care of all the old trumpery and show the placeyou know its a show place but i tell colonel topham when ive a place of my own i positively will have it modern and all the furniture in the very newest style im so sick of old reliques natural you know when i have been having a surfeit all my life of old beds and chairs and john of gaunt and the black prince but the black prince i remember was always a vast favourite of yours well but poor fowler you must like her tooi assure you she always speaks with tenderness of you she is really the best old soul for shes growing oldish but so faithful and so sincere too only flatters mamma sometimes so i can hardly help laughing in her face but then you know mamma and old ladies when they come to that pass must be flattered to keep them uptis but charitablereally right poor fowlers daughter is to be my maid i did not know fowler had a daughter and a daughter grown up nancy fowler not know oh yes quite grown up fit to be marriedonly a year younger than i am and theres our old apothecary in the country has taken such a fancy to her but hes too old and wiggybut it would make a sort of lady of her and her mother will have it sobut she shantive no notion of compulsion nancy shall be my maid for she is quite out of the common style can copy verses for oneive no time you knowand draws patterns in a minute i declare i dont know which i love bestfowler or nancypoor old fowler i think do you know she says im so like the print of the queen of france it never struck me but ill go and ask topham i perceived that fowler wiser grown had learned how much more secure the reign of flattery is than the reign of terror she was now as i found supreme in the favour of both her young and old lady the specimen i have given of lady anne mowbrays conversation or rather of lady annes mode of talking will i fancy be amply sufficient to satiate all curiosity concerning her ladyships understanding and character she had indeed like most of the young ladies her companionsno character at all female conversation in general was at this time very different from what it is in our happier days a few bright stars had risen and shone and been admired but the useful light had not diffused itself miss talbots and miss carters learning and piety mrs montagues genius mrs veseys elegance and mrs boscawens footnote see basbleu polished ease had brought female literature into fashion in certain favoured circles but it had not as it has now become general in almost every rank of life young ladies had it is true got beyond the spectator and the guardian richardsons novels had done much towards opening a larger field of discussion one of miss burneys excellent novels had appeared and had made an era in london conversation but still it was rather venturing out of the safe course for a young lady to talk of books even of novels it was not as it is now expected that she should know what is going on in the literary world the edinburgh and quarterly reviews and varieties of literary and scientific journals had not allured to brighter worlds and led the way before there was a regular demand and an established market there were certain hawkers and pedlars of literature fetchers and carriers of bays and at every turn copies of impromptus charades and lines by the honourable miss c and the honourable mrs d were put into my hands by young ladies begging for praise which it was seldom in my power conscientiously to bestow i early had a forebodingone of my mothers presentimentsthat i should come to disgrace with lady anne mowbray about some of these cursed scraps of poetry her ladyship had oneshall i saypeculiarity she could not bear that any one should differ from her in matters of taste and though she regularly disclaimed being a reading lady she was most assured of what she was most ignorant with the assistance of fowlers flattery together with that of all the hangerson at brantefield priory her temper had been rendered incapable of bearing contradiction but this defect was not immediately apparent on the contrary lady anne was generally thought a pleasant goodhumoured creature and most people wondered that the daughter could be so different from the mother lady de brantefield was universally known to be positive and prejudiced her prejudices were all oldfashioned and ran directly counter to the habits of her acquaintance lady annes on the contrary were all in favour of the present fashion whatever it might be and ran smoothly with the popular stream the violence of her temper could therefore scarcely be suspected till something opposed the current a small obstacle would then do the businesswould raise the stream suddenly to a surprising height and would produce a tremendous noise it was my ill fortune one unlucky day to cross lady anne mowbrays humour and to oppose her opinion it was about a trifle but trifles indeed made with her the sum of human things she came one morning as it was her custom to loiter away her time at my mothers till the proper hour for going out to visit for five minutes she sat at some fashionable kind of workwafer work i think it was called a work which has been long since consigned to the mice then her ladyship yawned and exclaiming oh those lines of lord chesterfields which colonel topham gave me ill copy them into my album wheres my albummrs harrington i lent it to you oh here it is mr harrington you will finish copying this for me so i was set down to the album to copyadvice to a lady in autumn asses milk half a pint take at seven or before my mother who saw that i did not relish the asses milk put in a word for me my dear lady anne it is not worth while to write these lines in your album for they were in print long ago in every ladys old memorandumbook and in dodsleys collection i believe but still that was quite a different thing lady anne said from having them in her album so mr harrington must be so very good i did not understand the particular use of copying in my illegible hand what could be so much better read in print but it was allsufficient that her ladyship chose it when i had copied the verses i must lady anne said read the lines and admire them but i had read them twenty times before and i could not say that they were as fresh the twentieth reading as at the first lord mowbray came in and she ran to her brothermowbray can any thing in nature be prettier than these verses of lord chesterfield mowbray you who are a judge listen to these two lines the dews of the evening moat carefully shun those tears of the sky for the loss of the sun now heres your friend mr harrington says its only a prettiness and something about ovid im sure i wish youd advise some of your friends to leave their classics as you did at the musty university what have we to do with ovid in london you yourself mr harrington who set up for such a critic what fault can you find pray with keep all cold from your breast theres already too much by the ladys tone of voice raised complexion and whole air of the head i saw the danger was imminent and to avoid the coming storm i sheltered myself under the cover of modesty but mowbray dragged me out to make sport for himself oh harrington that will never do no critic no judge you with all your college honours fresh about you come come harrington pronounce you must is this poetry or not keep all cold from your breast theres already too much whether prose or poetry i pronounce it to be very good advice good advice the thing of all others i have the most detested from my childhood cried lady anne but i insist upon it it is good poetry mr harrington and equally good grammar and good english and good sense cried her brother in an ironical tone come harrington acknowledge it all manall equally never stop half way when a youngand such a young lady summons you to surrender to her your truth taste and common sense gi her a the plea or youll get na good of a womans hands so sirso my lord you are against me too and you are mocking me too i find i humbly thank you gentlemen cried lady anne in a high tone of disdain from a colonel in the army and a nobleman who has been on the continent i might have expected more politeness from a cambridge scholar no wonder my mother laid down her netting in the middle of a row and came to keep the peace but it was too late lady anne was deaf and blind with passion she confessed she could not see of what use either of the universities were in this world except to make bears and bores of young men her ladyship fluent in anger beyond conception poured as she turned from her brother to me and from me to her brother a flood of nonsense which when it had once broken bounds there was no restraining in its course amazed at the torrent my mother stood aghast mowbray burst into unextinguishable laughter i preserved my gravity as long as i possibly could i felt the risible infection seizing me and that malicious mowbray just when he saw me in the strugglethe agonysent me back such an image of my own length of face that there was no withstanding it i too breaking all bounds of decorum gave way to visible and audible laughter and from which i was first recovered by seeing the lady burst into tears and by hearing at the same moment my mother pronounce in a tone of grave displeasure very illbred harrington my mothers tone of displeasure affecting me much more than the young ladys tears i hastened to beg pardon and i humbled myself before lady anne but she spurned me and mowbray laughed the more mowbray i believe really wished that i should like his sister yet he could not refrain from indulging his taste for ridicule even at her expense my mother wondered how lord mowbray could tease his sister in such a manner and as for harrington she really thought he had known that the first law of goodbreeding is never to say or do any thing that can hurt another persons feelings never intentionally to hurt anothers feelings maam said i i hope you will allow me to plead the innocence of my intentions oh yes there was no malicious intent not guiltynot guilty cried mowbray anne you acquit him there dont you anne anne sobbed but spoke not it is little consolation and no compensation to the person who is hurt said my mother that the offender pleads he did not mean to say or do any thing rude a rude thing is a rude thingthe intention is nothingall we are to judge of is the fact well but after all in fact said mowbray there was nothing to make any body seriously angry of that every bodys own feelings must be the best judge said my mother the best and the sole judge thank heaven that is not the law of libel yet not the law of the land yet said mowbray no knowing what we may come to would it not be hard maam to constitute the feelings of one person always sole judge of the intentions of another though in cases like the present i submit let it be a ruled case that the sensibility of a lady shall be the measure of a gentlemans guilt i dont judge of these things by rule and measure said my mother try my smellingbottle my dear very few people especially women of delicate nerves and quick feelings could as my mother observed bear to be laughed at particularly by those they loved and especially before other people who did not know them perfectly my mother was persuaded she said that lord mowbray had not reflected on all this when he had laughed so inconsiderately mowbray allowed that he certainly had not reflected when he had laughed inconsiderately so come come anne sister anne be friends then playfully tapping his sister on the back the pretty but sullen back of the neck he tried to raise the drooping head but finding the chin resist the upward motion and retire resentfully from his touch he turned upon his heel and addressing himself to me well harrington said he the news of the day the news of the theatre which i was bringing you full speed when i stumbled upon this cursed halfpint of asses milk which mrs harrington was so angry with me for overturning but whats the news my lord said my mother news not for you maam only for harrington news of the jews the jews said my mother the jews said i both in the same breath but in very different tones jews did i say replied mowbray jew i should have said mr montenero cried i montenerocan you think of nothing but mr montenero whom youve never seen and never will see thank you for that my lord said my mother one touch from you is worth a hundred from me but of what jew then are you talking and whats your news my lord said i my news is onlyfor heavens sake harrington do not look expecting a mountain for tis only a mouse the news is that macklin the honest jew of venice has got the pound or whatever number of pounds he wanted to get from the managers heart the quarrels made up and if you keep your senses you may have a chance to see next week this famous jew of venice i am heartily glad of it cried i with enthusiasm and is that all said my mother coldly mr harrington said lady anne is really so enthusiastic about some things and so cold about others there is no understanding him he is very very odd notwithstanding all the pains my mother took to atone for my offence and notwithstanding that i had humbled myself to the dust to obtain pardon i was not forgiven lady de brantefield lady anne and some other company dined with us and mowbray who seemed to be really sorry that he had vexed his sister and that he had in the heyday of his spirit unveiled to me her defects of temper did every thing in his power to make up matters between us at dinner he placed me beside anne little sister anne but no caressing tone no diminutive of kindness in english or soft italian could touch her heart or move the gloomy purpose of her soul her sulky ladyship almost turned her back upon me as she listened only to colonel topham who was on the other side mowbray coaxed her to eat but she refused every thing he offeredwould not accept even his complimentshis compliments on her poufwould not allow him to show her off as he well knew how to do to advantage would not when he exerted himself to prevent her silence from being remarked smile at any one of the many entertaining things he said she would not in short even passively permit his attempts to cover her illhumour and to make things pass off well in the evening when the higher powers drew off to cards and when lady anne had her phalanx of young ladies round her and whilst i stood a defenceless young man at her mercy she made me feel her vengeance she talked at me continually and at every opening gave me sly cuts which she flattered herself i felt sorely mowbray turned off the blows as fast as they were aimed or treated them all as playful traits of loverlike malice tokens of a ladys favour ha a good cut harringtonhappy manup to you there harrington high favour when a lady condescends to remember and retaliate paid you for old scoressign youre in her books nowno more to say to you mr harringtona fair challenge to say a great deal more to her and all the time her ladyship was aiming to vex and hoping that i was heartily mortified as from my silence and melancholy countenance she concluded that i was in reality i stood deploring that so pretty a creature had so mean a mind the only vexation i felt was at her having destroyed the possibility of my enjoying that delightful illusion which beauty creates my mother who had been as she said quite nervous all this evening at last brought lady anne to terms and patched up a peace by prevailing on lady de brantefield who could not be prevailed on by any one else to make a party to go to some new play which lady anne was dying to see it was a sentimental comedy and i did not much like it however i was all complaisance for my mothers sake and she in return renewed her promise to go with me to patronize shylock by the extraordinary anxiety my mother showed and by the pains she took that there should be peace betwixt lady anne and me i perceived what had never before struck me that my mother wished me to be in love with her ladyship now i could sooner have been in love with lady de brantefield give her back a decent share of youth and beauty i think i could sooner have liked the mother than the daughter by the force and plastic power of my imagination i could have turned and moulded lady de brantefield with all her repulsive haughtiness into a clelia or a princess de cleves or something of the richardson fulldressed heroine with hoop and fan and stand off manand then there would be cruelty and difficulty and incomprehensibilitysomething to be conqueredsomething to be wooed and won but with lady anne mowbray my imagination had nothing to work upon no point to dwell on nothing on which a lovers fancy could feed there was no doubt no hope no fear no reserve of manner no dignity of mind my mother i believe now saw that it would not do at least for the present but she had known many of cupids capricious turns lady anne was extremely pretty and universally allowed to be so her ladyship was much taken notice of in public and my mother knew that young men are vain of having their mistresses and wives admired by our sex but my mother calculated ill as to my particular character to the opera and to ranelagh to the pantheon and to all the fashionable public places of the day i had had the honour of attending lady anne and i had had the glory of hearing beautiful who is sheand who is with her my vanity i own had been flattered but no further my imagination was always too powerful my passions too sincere and too romantic to be ruled by the opinions of others or to become the dupe of personal vanity my mother had fancied that a month or two in london would have brought my imagination down to be content with the realities of fashionable life my mother was right as to the fact but wrong in her conclusion this did not incline me more towards lady anne but it disinclined me towards marriage my exalted ideas of love were loweredmy morning visions of life fledi was dispirited mowbray had rallied me on my pining for cambridge and on preferring israel lyons the jew to him and all the best company in london he had hurried me about with him to all manner of gaieties but still i was not happy my mindmy heart wanted something more in this my london life i found it irksome that i could never as at dear cambridge pause upon my own reflections if i stopped awhile to plume contemplations wings so ruffled and impaired some of the low realities some of the impertinent necessities of fashionable life would tread on my heels the order of the day or night was for ever pressed upon meand the order of the day was now to go to this new sentimental comedymy mothers favourite actor the silvertoned barry was to play the lover of the piece so she was sure of as many fashionable young ladies as her box could possibly hold at this period in england every fashionable belle declared herself the partisan of some actor or actress and every fashionable beau aspired to the character of a dramatic critic mowbray of course was distinguished in that line and his pretty little sister lady anne was at least in face formed to grace the front box the hours of the great world were earlier then than they are now and nothing interfered indeed nothing would have been suffered to interfere with the hour for the play as a veteran wit described it there were at this time four estates in the english constitution kings lords commons and the theatre statesmen courtiers poets philosophers crowded pell mell with the whitegloved beaux to the stage box and the pit it was thought wellbred it was the thing to be in the boxes before the third act even before the second nay incredible as it may in these times appear before the first act began our fashionable party was seated some minutes before the curtain drew up chapter vii the beaux and belles in the boxes of the crowded theatre had bowed and curtsied for in those days beaux did bow and belles did curtsy the impatient sticks in the pit and shrill catcalls in the gallery had begun to contend with the music in the orchestra and thrice had we surveyed the house to recognize every body whom any body knew when the door of the box next to ours the only box that had remained empty was thrown open and in poured an overdressed party whom nobody knew lady de brantefield after one reconnoitring glance pronounced them to be city goths and vandals and without resting her glass upon them for half a moment turned it to some more profitable field of speculation there was no gentleman of this party but a portly matron towering above the rest seemed the principal mover and orderer of the group the awkward bustle they made facing and backing placing and changing of places and the difficulty they found in seating themselves were in striking contrast with the highbred ease of the ladies of our party lady anne mowbray looked down upon their operations with a pretty air of quiet surprise tinctured with horror while my mothers shrinking delicacy endeavoured to suggest some idea of propriety to the city matron who having taken her station next to us in the second row had at last seated herself so that a considerable portion of the back part of her headdress was in my mothers face moreover the citizens huge arm with its enormous gauze cuff leaning on the partition which divided or ought to have divided her from us considerably passed the line of demarcation lady de brantefield with all the pride of all the de brantefields since the norman conquest concentrated in her countenance threw an excommunicating withering look upon the armbut the elbow felt it notit never stirred the lady seemed not to be made of penetrable stuff in happy ignorance she sat fanning herself for a few seconds then suddenly starting and stretching forward to the front row where five of her young ladies were wedged she aimed with her fan at each of their backs in quick succession and in a more than audible whisper asked cecy issy henny queeney miss coates wheres berryall eyes turned to look for berryoh mercy behind in the back row miss berry that must not become forward heres my place or queeneys cried mrs coates stretching backwards with her utmost might to seize some one in the farthest corner of the back row who had hitherto been invisible we expected to see in miss berry another vulgarian produced but to our surprise we beheld one who seemed of a different order of beings from those by whom she was surrounded lord mowbray and i looked at each other struck by the same sentiment pained for this elegant timid young creature as we saw her all blushing and reluctant forced by the irresistible fat orderer of all things to step up on the seat to step forward from bench to bench and then wait in painful preeminence while issy and cecy and queeney and miss coates settled how they could make room or which should vacate her seat in her favour in spite of the awkwardness of her situation she stood with such quiet resigned yet dignified grace that ridicule could not touch her the moment she was seated with her back to us and out of hearing lady de brantefield turned to her son and asked who is she an east indian i should guess by her dark complexion whispered lady anne to me some feather or lappet intercepted my view of her face but from the glimpse i caught of it as she passed it struck me as uncommonly interesting though with a peculiar expression and foreign airwhether she was handsome or not though called upon to decide i could not determine but now our attention was fixed on the stage it was announced to the audience that owing to the sudden illness of the actor who was to have performed the principal part in the comedy advertised for this night there was a necessity for changing the play and they should give in its stead the merchant of venice the merchant of venice and macklin the jewmurmurs of discontent from the ladies in my box who regretted their sentimental comedy and their silvertoned barry were all lost upon me i rejoiced that i should see macklin in shylock before the performance began my attention was again caught by the proceedings of the persons in the next box there seemed to be some sudden cause of distress as i gathered from exclamations of how unluckyhow distressingwhat shall we dowhat can we dobetter go awaycarriage gonemust sit it outmay be she wont mindoh she willshylockjessicahow unfortunatepoor miss berry jessica whispered mowbray to me with an arch look let me pass added he just touching my shoulder he made his way to a young lady at the other end of the box and i occupying immediately the ceded place stationed myself so that i had a better view of my object and could observe her without being seen by any one she was perfectly still and took no notice of the whispering of the people about her though from an indescribable expression in the air of the back of her head and neck i was convinced that she heard all that passed among the young and old ladies in her box the play went onshylock appearedi forgot every thing but himsuch a countenancesuch an expression of latent malice and revenge of every thing detestable in human nature whether speaking or silent the jew fixed and kept possession of my attention it was an incomparable piece of acting much as my expectations had been raised it far surpassed any thing i had conceivedi forgot it was macklin i thought only of shylock in my enthusiasm i stood up i pressed forward i leaned far over towards the stage that i might not lose a word a look a gesture when the act finished as the curtain fell and the thunders of applause died away i heard a soft low sigh near me i looked and saw the jewess she had turned away from the young ladies her companions and had endeavoured to screen herself behind the pillar against which i had been leaning i had for the first time a full view of her face and of her countenance of great sensibility painfully proudly repressed she looked up while my eyes were fixed upon hera sudden and deep colour spread over her face and mounted to her temples in my confusion i did the very thing i should not have done and said the thing of all others i should not have said i expressed a fear that i had been standing in such a manner as to prevent her from seeing shylock she bowed mildly and was i believe going to speak you have indeed sir interrupted mrs coates stood so that nobody could see nothing but yourself so since you mention it and speak without an introduction excuse me if i suggest against the next act that this young lady has never been at a play before in her lifein lonon at least and though it int the play i should have chose for her yet since she is here tis better she should see something than nothing if gentlemen will give her leave i bowed in sign of submission and repentance and was retiring so as to leave my place vacant and a full opening to the stage but in a sweet gentlewomanlike voice seeming perhaps more delightful from contrast the young lady said that she had seen and could see quite as much as she wished of the play and she begged that i would not quit my place i should oblige her she added in a lower tone if i would continue to stand as i had done i obeyed and placed myself so as to screen her from observation during the whole of the next act but now my pleasure in the play was over i could no longer enjoy macklins incomparable acting i was so apprehensive of the pain which it must give to the young jewess at every stroke characteristic of the skilful actor or of the master poet i felt a strange mixture of admiration and regret i almost wished that shakspeare had not written or macklin had not acted the part so powerfully my imagination formed such a strong conception of the pain the jewess was feeling and my inverted sympathy if i may so call it so overpowered my direct and natural feelings that at every fresh development of the jews villany i shrunk as though i had myself been a jew each exclamation against this dog of a jew and still more every general reflection on jewish usury avarice and cruelty i felt poignantly no power of imagination could make me pity shylock but i felt the force of some of his appeals to justice and some passages struck me in quite a new light on the jewish side of the question many a time and oft in the rialto you have rated me about my moneys and my usances still have i borne it with a patient shrug for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe you call me misbeliever cutthroat dog and spit upon my jewish gabardine and all for use of that which is my own well then it now appears you need my help go to thenyou come to me and you say shylock we would have moneys you say so shall i bend low and in a bondsman key with bated breath and whispring humbleness say this fair sir you spit on me last wednesday you spurned me such a day another time you called me dog and for these courtesies ill lend you thus much moneys as far as shylock was concerned i was well content he should be used in such a sort but if it had been any other human creature any other jew evenif it had been poor jacob for instance whose image crossed my recollectioni believe i should have taken part with him again i was well satisfied that antonio should have hindered shylock of half a million should have laughed at his losses thwarted his bargains cooled his friends heated his enemies shylock deserved all this but when he came to i stylefontstyle italicwhats his reasoni am a

have a look at the jewess that i took an opportunity of changing my position the ladies in our box were now so happily occupied with some young officers of the guards that there was no farther danger of their staring at the jewess i was so placed that i could see her without being seen and during the succeeding acts my attention was chiefly directed to the study of all the changes in her expressive countenance i now saw and heard the play solely with reference to her feelings i anticipated every stroke which could touch her and became every moment more and more interested and delighted with her from the perception that my anticipations were just and that i perfectly knew how to read her soul and interpret her countenance i saw that the struggle to repress her emotion was often the utmost she could endure and at last i saw or fancied i saw that she grew so pale that as she closed her eyes at the same instant i was certain she was going to faint and quite forgetting that i was an utter stranger to her i started forwardand then unprovided with an apology could only turn to mrs coates and fear that the heat of the house was too much for this young lady mrs coates alarmed immediately wished they could get her out into the air and regretted that her gentlemen were not with their party tonightthere could be no getting servants or carriagewhat could be done i eagerly offered my services which were accepted and we conducted the young lady out she did not faint she struggled against it and it was evident that there was no affectation in the case but on the contrary an anxious desire not to give trouble and a great dread of exposing herself to public observation the carriage as mrs coates repeated twenty times was ordered not to come till after the farce and she kept on hoping and hoping that miss berry would be stout enough to go back to see the maid of the oaks miss berry did her utmost to support herself and said she believed she was now quite well and could return but i saw she wished to get away and i ran to see if a chair could be had lord mowbray who had assisted in conducting the ladies out now followed me he saw and called to one of his footmen and despatched him for a chair there now said mowbray we may leave the rest to mrs coates who can elbow her own way through it come back with memrs abingdon plays lady bab lardoon her favourite charactershe is incomparable and i would not miss it for the world i begged mowbray to go back for i could not leave these ladies well said he parting from me and pursuing his own way i see how it isi see how it will be these things are ruled in heaven above or hell beneath tis in vain struggling with ones destinyso you to your jewess and i to my little jessica we shall have her again i hope in the farce the prettiest creature i ever saw mowbray hastened back to his box and how long it might be between my return to the jewess and the arrival of the chair i do not know it seemed to me not above two minutes but mowbray insisted upon it that it was a full quarter of an hour he came to me again just as i had received one look of silent gratitude and while i was putting the young lady into the chair and bustling mrs coates was giving her orders and address to the servant mowbray whispered me that my mother was in an agony and had sent him out to see what was become of me mrs coates all thanks and apologies and hurry now literally elbowed her way back to her box expressing her reiterated fears that we should lose the best part of the maid of the oaks which was the only farce she made it a rule ever to stay for in spite of her hurry and her incessant talking i named the thing i was intent upon i said that with her permission i should do myself the honour of calling upon her the next morning to inquire after miss berrys health i am sure sir she replied mr alderman coates and myself will be particularly glad of the honour of seeing you tomorrow or any time and moreover sir the young lady added she with a shrewd and to me offensive smile the young lady no doubts well worth inquiring aftera great heiress as the saying is as rich as a jew shell be miss montenero miss montenero repeated lord mowbray and i in the same instant i thought said i this young ladys name was berry berry yesberry we call her we who are intimate i call her for shortthat is short for berenice which is her out o the way christian that is jewish name mr montenero the father is a spanish or american jew im not clear which but hes a charming man for a jew and the daughter most uncommon fond of him to a degree cant now bear any reflections the most distant now sir upon the jews which was what distressed me when i found the play was to be this jew of venice and i would have come away only that i couldnt possibly here mrs coates without any mercy upon my curiosity about mr montenero and his daughter digressed into a subject utterly uninteresting to me and would explain to us the reasons why mr alderman coates and mr peter coates her son were not this night of her party this lasted till we reached her box and then she had so much to say to all the miss issys cecys and hennys that it was with the utmost difficulty i could even by carefully watching my moment obtain a card with her own and another with miss monteneros address this time there was no danger of my losing it i rejoiced to see that miss montenero did not live with mrs coates for all further satisfaction of my curiosity i was obliged to wait till the next morning chapter viii during the whole of the night sleeping or waking the images of the fair jewess of shylock and of mrs coates were continually recurring and turning into one another in a most provoking manner at breakfast my mother did not appear my father said that she had not slept well and that she would breakfast in her own apartment this was not unusual but i was particularly sorry that it happened this morning because being left ttette with my father and he full of a debate on the malttax which he undertook to read to me from the rival papers and to make me understand its merits i was compelled to sit threequarters of an hour longer after breakfast than i had intended so that the plan i had formed of waiting upon mr montenero very early before he could have gone out for the day was disconcerted when at last my father had fairly finished when he had taken his hat and his cane and departing left me as i thought happily at liberty to go in search of my jewess another detainer came at the foot of the stairs my mothers woman appeared waiting to let me know that her lady begged i would not go out till she had seen meadding that she would be with me in less than a quarter of an hour i flung down my hat i believe with rather too marked an expression of impatience but five minutes afterwards came a knock at the door mr montenero was announced and i blessed my mother my father and the malttax for having detained me at home the first appearance of mr montenero more than answered my expectations he had that indescribable air which independently of the fashion of the day or the mode of any particular country distinguishes a gentlemandignified courteous and free from affectation from his features he might have been thought a spaniardfrom his complexion an east indian but he had a peculiar cast of countenance which seemed not to belong to either nation he had uncommonly black penetrating eyes with a serious rather melancholy but very benevolent expression he was past the meridian of life the lines in his face were strongly marked but they were not the commonplace wrinkles of ignoble age nor the contractions of any of the vulgar passions they seemed to be the traces of thought and feeling he entered into conversation directly and easily i need not say that this conversation was immediately interesting for he spoke of berenice his thanks to me were i thought peculiarly gentlemanlike neither too much nor too little of course i left him at liberty to attribute her indisposition to the heat of the playhouse and i stood prepared to avoid mentioning shylock to jewish ears but i was both surprised and pleased by the openness and courage with which he spoke on the very subject from which i had fancied he would have shrunk instead of looking for any excuse for miss monteneros indisposition he at once named the real cause she had been he said deeply affected by the representation of shylock that detestable jew whom the genius of the greatest poet that ever wrote and the talents of one of the greatest actors who had ever appeared had conspired to render an object of public execration but recently arrived in london continued mr montenero i have not had personal opportunity of judging of this actors talent but no englishman can have felt more strongly than i have the power of your shakspeares genius to touch and rend the human heart mr montenero spoke english with a foreign accent and something of a foreign idiom but his ideas and feelings forced their way regardless of grammatical precision and i thought his foreign accent agreeable to an englishman what accent that conveys the praise of shakspeare can fail to be agreeable the most certain method by which a foreigner an introduce himself at once to the goodwill and good opinion of an englishman is by thus doing homage to this national object of idolatry i perceived that mr monteneros was not a mere complimenthe spoke with real feeling in this instance resumed he we poor jews have felt your shakspeares power to our costtoo severely and considering all the circumstances rather unjustly you are aware considering all the circumstances i did not precisely understand but i endeavoured as well as i could to make some general apology for shakspeares severity by adverting to the time when he wrote and the prejudices which then prevailed true said he and as a dramatic poet it was his business i acknowledge to take advantage of the popular prejudice as a poweras a means of dramatic pathos and effect yet you will acknowledge that we jews must feel it peculiarly hard that the truth of the story on which the poet founded his plot should have been completely sacrificed to fiction so that the characters were not only misrepresented but reversed i did not know to what mr montenero meant to allude however i endeavoured to pass it off with a slight bow of general acquiescence and the hundredtimesquoted remark that poets always succeed better in fiction than in truth mr montenero had quick penetrationhe saw my evasion and would not let me off so easily he explained in the true story footnote see stevens life of sixtus v and malones shakspeare from which shakspeare took the plot of the merchant of venice it was a christian who acted the part of the jew and the jew that of the christian it was a christian who insisted upon having the pound of flesh from next the jews heart but as mr montenero repeated shakspeare was right as a dramatic poet in reversing the characters seeing me struck and a little confounded by this statement and even by his candour mr montenero said that perhaps his was only the jewish version of the story and he quickly went on to another subject one far more agreeable to meto berenice he hoped that i did not suspect her of affectation from any thing that had passed he was aware little as he knew of fine ladies that they sometimes were pleased to make themselves noticed perhaps rather troublesome by the display of their sensibility but he assured me that his berenice was not of this sort of this i was perfectly convinced the moment he pronounced the name of berenice he paused and looked as if he were afraid he should say too much of her and i suppose i looked as i feltafraid that he would not say enough he gently bowed his head and went on there are reasons why she was peculiarly touched and moved by that exhibition till she came to europeto englandshe was not aware at least not practically aware of the strong prepossessions which still prevail against us jews he then told me that his daughter had passed her childhood chiefly in america in a happy part of that country where religious distinctions are scarcely knownwhere characters and talents are all sufficient to attain advancementwhere the jews form a respectable part of the communitywhere in most instances they are liberally educated many following the honourable professions of law and physic with credit and ability and associating with the best society that country affords living in a retired village her fathers the only family of israelites who resided in or near it all her juvenile friendships and attachments had been formed with those of different persuasions yet each had looked upon the variations of the other as things of course or rather as things which do not affect the moral characterdifferences which take place in every societymy daughter was therefore ill prepared said mr montenero for european prepossessions and with her feeling heart and strong affection for those she loves no wonder that she has often suffered especially on my account since we came to england and she has become to a fault tender and susceptible on this point i could not admit that there was any fault on her part but i regretted that england should be numbered among the countries subject to such prejudices i hoped i added that such illiberality was now confined to the vulgar that is the illeducated and the illinformed the welleducated and wellinformed he answered were of course always the most liberal and were usually the same in all countries he begged pardon if he had expressed himself too generally with respect to england it was the common fault of strangers and foreigners to generalize too quickly and to judge precipitately of the whole of a community from a part the fact was that he had by the business which brought him to london been unfortunately thrown among some vulgar rich of contracted minds who though they were as he was willing to believe essentially good and goodnatured persons had made his berenice suffer sometimes more than they could imagine by their want of delicacy and want of toleration as mr montenero spoke these words the image of vulgar ordering mrs coatesthat image which had persecuted me half the night by ever obtruding between me and the fair jewessrose again full in my view i settled immediately that it was she and her tribe of issys and cecys and hennys and queeneys were the vulgar rich to whom mr montenero alluded i warmly expressed my indignation against those who could have been so brutal as to make miss montenero suffer by their vile prejudices brutal mr montenero repeated smiling at my warmth is too strong an expression there was no brutality in the case i must have expressed myself ill to give rise to such an idea there was only a little want of consideration for the feelings of othersa little want of liberality even so i could not bear the thought that miss montenero should have been on her first arrival in england thrown among persons who might give her quite a false idea of the english and a dislike to the country there is no danger of that sort he replied had she been disposed to judge so rashly and uncharitably the humane and polite attentions she met with last night from a gentleman who was an utter stranger to her and who could only know that she was a foreigner in want of assistance must have been to her at once conviction and reproof i bowed delighted with mr montenero and with myself but i hope and believe continued he that my berenice is not disposed to form uncharitable judgments either of individuals or nations especially not of the english of whom she has from their history and literature with which we are not wholly unacquainted conceived the highest ideas i bowed again though not quite so much delighted with this general compliment to my nation as by that peculiar to myself i expressed my hopes that the english would justify this favourable prepossession and that on farther acquaintance with different societies in london mr and miss montenero would find that among the higher classes in this country there is no want of liberality of opinion and certainly no want of delicacy of sentiment and mannerno want of attention to the feelings of those who are of a different persuasion from ourselves just at this moment my mother entered the room advancing towards mr montenero she said with a gracious smile you need not introduce us to each other my dear harrington for i am sure that i have the pleasure of seeing mr clive from india mr montenero from america maam mr montenero i am happy to have the honourthe pleasurei am very happy my mothers politeness struggled against truth but whilst i feared that mr monteneros penetration would discern that there was no pleasure in the honour a polite inquiry followed concerning miss monteneros indisposition then after an ineffectual effort to resume the ease and cordiality of her manner my mother leaned back languidly on the sofa and endeavoured to account for the cloud which settled on her brow by adverting to the sleepless night she had passed and to the fears of an impending headache assuring mr montenero at the same time that society and conversation were always of service to her i was particularly anxious to detain and to draw him out before my mother because i felt persuaded that his politeness of manner and his style of conversation would counteract any presentiment or prejudice she had conceived against him and his race he seemed to lend himself to my views and with benevolent politeness exerted himself to entertain my mother a don quixote was on the table in which there were some good prints and from these he took occasion to give us many amusing and interesting accounts of spain where he had passed the early part of his life from don quixote to gil blasto the duc de lermato the tower of segoviato the inquisitionto the spanish palaces and moorish antiquities he let me lead him backwards and forwards as i pleased my mother was very fond of some of the old spanish ballads and moorish romances i led to the rio verde and the fair zaida and the moor alcanzor with whom both in their moorish and english dress mr montenero was well acquainted and of whom he was enthusiastically fond my mother was fond of painting i asked some questions concerning the spanish painters particularly about murillo of one of his pictures we had a copy and my mother had often wished to see the original mr montenero said he was happy in having it in his power to gratify her wish he possessed the original of this picture but few of murillos paintings had at this time found their way out of spain national and regal pride had preserved them with jealous care but mr montenero had inherited some of murillos masterpieces these and a small but valuable collection of pictures which he had been many years in forming were now in england they were not yet arranged as he could wish but an apartment was preparing for them and in the mean time he should be happy to have the honour of showing them to us and to any of our friends he particularly addressed himself to my mother she replied in those general terms of acquiescence and gratitude which are used when there is no real intention to accept an invitation but yet a wish to avoid such an absolute refusal as should appear illbred i on the contrary sincerely eager to accept the offered favour fixed instantly the time and the soonest possible i named the next day at one oclock mr montenero then took his leave and as the door closed after him i stood before my mother as if waiting for judgment she was silent dont you think him agreeable maam very agreeable i knew you would think so my dear mother an uncommonly agreeable man but but what maam but so much the worse how so maam because he is a jew is he forbidden to be agreeable said i smiling pray be serious harringtoni say the more agreeable this man is the better his manner the more extensive his information the higher the abilities he possesses the greater are his means of doing mischief a conclusive argument said i against the possession of good manners information abilities and every agreeable and useful quality and an argument equally applicable to jews and christians argument repeated my mother i know my dear i am not capable of arguing with youindeed i am not fond of arguments they are so unfeminine i seldom presume to give even my opinion except on subjects of sentiment and feeling there ladies may venture i suppose to have a voice as well as gentlemen perhaps better sometimes in the present case it may be very ridiculous but i own that notwithstanding this mr montenero is what youd call an uncommonly agreeable man there is a something about himin short i feel something like an antipathy to himand in the whole course of my life i have never been misled by these antipathies i dont say they are reasonable i only say that i cant help feeling them and if they never mislead us you know they have all the force of instincts and in some cases instincts are superior even to that reason of which man is so proud i did not advert to the if on which this whole reasoning rested but i begged my mother would put herself out of the question for one moment and consider to what injustice and intolerance such antipathies would lead in society perhaps in general it might be so she said but in this particular instance she was persuaded she was right and correct and after all is there a human being living who is not influenced at first sight by countenance does not lavater say that even a cockchafer and a dish of tea have a physiognomy i could not go quite so far as to admit the cockchafers physiognomy in our judgment of characters but then maam concluded i before we can judge before we can decide we should see what is called the play of the countenancewe should see the working of the muscles now for instance when we have seen mr montenero two or three times when we have studied the muscles of his countenance i i study the muscles of the mans countenance interrupted my mother indignantly i never desire to see him or his muscles again jew turk or mussulman let me hear no more about him seriously my dear harrington this is the subject on which i wished to speak to you this morning to warn you from forming this dangerous acquaintance i dreamed last nightbut i know you wont listen to dreams i have a presentimentbut you have no faith in presentiments what shall i say to youoh my dear harrington i appeal to your own heartyour own feelings your own conscience must tell you all i at this moment foresee and dread oh with your ardent too ardent imaginationyour susceptibility surely surely there is an absolute fatality in these things at the very moment i was preparing to warn you mr montenero appears and strengthens the dangerous impression and after all the pains i took to prevent your ever meeting is it not extraordinary that you should meet his daughter at the playhouse promise me i conjure you cried she turning and seizing both my hands promise me my dear son that you will see no more of this jew and jewess it was a promise i could not would not makesome morning visitors came in and relieved me my mothers imagination was as vivacious but not as tenacious as my own there was in her a feminine mobility which to my masculine strength of passion and consequent tenacity of purpose appeared often inconceivable and sometimes provoking in a few minutes her fancy turned to old china and new lace and all the fears which had so possessed and agitated her mind subsided among the crowd of morning visitors lady anne mowbray ran in and ran out fortunately she could not stay one minute and still more fortunately my mother did not hear a word she said or even see her ladyships exit and entrance so many ladies had encompassed my mothers sofa displaying charming bargains of french lace the subject abstracted their attention and engrossed all their faculties lady anne had just called to tell me a secret that her mother had been saying all the morning to every body how odd it was of mr harrington to take notice whether a jewess fainted or not lady anne said for her part she had taken my part she did not think it so odd of me but she thought it odd and ridiculous of the jewess to faint about shylock but the reason she called was because she was dying with curiosity to know if i had heard any more about the jewess was she an heiress or not i must find out and tell she had heardbut she could not stay nowgoing to ride in the park i had often observed that my mothers presentiments varied from day to day according to the state of her nerves or of some slight external circumstances i was extremely anxious to prevail upon her to accompany me to see the spanish pictures and i therefore put off my visit for a day when i found my mother had engaged herself to attend a party of fair encouragers of smugglers to a cheap french lace shop i wrote an apology to mr montenero and heaven knows how much it cost me but my heroic patience was of no avail i could not persuade my mother to accompany me to all her former feelings the pride of opinion and the jealousy of maternal affection were now added she was piqued to prove herself in the right and vexed to see that right or wrong i would not yield to her entreaties i thought i acted solely from the dictates of pure reason and enlightened philanthropy chapter ix mowbray was curious he said to know how the jewess would look by daylight and he begged that he might accompany me to see the pictures as i had told him that i had permission to take with me any of my friends i could not refuse his request though i must own that i would rather have gone without him i was a little afraid of his raillery and of the quickness of his observation during our walk however he with addresswith that most irresistible kind of address which assumes an air of perfect frankness and cordiality contrived to dissipate my feelings of embarrassment and by the time we got to mr monteneros door i rejoiced that i had with me a friend and supporter a handsome housea splendid house this said mowbray looking up at the front as we waited for admission if the inside agree with the out faith harrington your jewish heiress will soon be heard of on change and at court too youll see make haste and secure your interest in her i advise you to our great disappointment the servant told us that neither mr nor miss montenero was at home but orders had been left with a young man of his to attend me and my company at this moment i heard a wellknown voice on the stairs and jacob poor jacob appeared joy flashed in his face at the sight of me he flew down stairs and across the hall exclaiming it isit is my own good mr harrington but he started back at the sight of mowbray and his whole countenance and manner changed in an embarrassed voice he began to explain why mr montenero was not at home that he had waited yesterday in hopes of seeing me at the appointed time till my note of apology had arrived i had not positively named any day for my visit and mr montenero had particular business that obliged him to go out this morning but that he would be back in an hour meantime sir as mr montenero has desired said jacob i shall have the honour of showing the pictures to you and your friend it was not till he came to the words your friend that jacob recollected to bow to lord mowbray and even then it was a stiffnecked bow mowbray contrary to his usual assurance looked a little embarrassed yet spoke to jacob as to an old acquaintance jacob led us through several handsome i might say splendid apartments to the pictureroom good good whispered mowbray as we went along till the moment we entered the pictureroom then making a sudden stop and start of recollection and pulling out his watch he declared that he had till that minute forgotten an indispensable engagementthat he must come some other day to see these charming pictures he begged that i would settle that for himhe was excessively sorry but go he mustand off he went immediately the instant he was out of sight jacob seemed relieved from the disagreeable constraint under which he laboured and his delight was manifest when he had me to himself i conceived that jacob still felt resentment against mowbray for the old quarrel at school i was surprised at this and in my own mind i blamed jacob i have always found it the best way to speak openly and to go to the bottom of mysteries and quarrels at once so turning to jacob i asked him whether in right of our former acquaintance i might speak to him with the freedom of one who heartily wished him well the tears came into his eyes and he could only say speak prayand thank you sir then jacob said i i thought you could not for such a number of years bear malice for a schoolboys offence and yet your manner just now to lord mowbrayam i mistakenset me right if i amdid i misinterpret your manner jacob no sir said he looking up in my face with his genuine expression of simplicity and openness no sir you do not mistake nor misinterpret jacobs manner you know him too well and his manner tells too plainly you do not misinterpret the feeling but you mistake the cause and since you are so kind as to desire me to set you right i will do so but it is too long a story to tell while you are standing not at alli am interestedgo on i should not said jacob be worthy of this interestthis regard which it is joy to my very heart to see that you still feel for mei should not be worthy in the least of it if i could bear malice so many years for a schoolboys offence no mr harrington the schoolboy young lord is forgotten but long since that time since this young lord has been grown into a man and an officerat gibraltar the recollection of whatever it was that happened at gibraltar seemed to come at this instant so full upon jacobs feelings that he could not go on he took up his story farther back he reminded me of the time when we had parted at cambridge he was then preparing to go to gibraltar to assist in keeping a store there for the brother and partner of his friend and benefactor the london jeweller mr manessa who had ventured a very considerable part of his fortune upon this speculation about that time many jews had enriched themselves at gibraltar by keeping stores for the troops and during the siege it was expected that it would be a profitable business mr manessas store under jacobs care went on prosperously till the day when lord mowbray arrived at gibraltar with a regiment of which young as he was he had been appointed lieutenantcolonel he recognized me the first time we met i saw he was grown into a finelooking officer and indeed mr harrington i saw him without bearing the least malice for any little things that had passed which i thought as you say were only schoolboy follies but in a few minutes i found to my sorrow that he was not changed in mind towards me his first words at meeting me in the public streets were so are you here young shylock what brings you to gibraltar you are of the tribe of gad i think thou wandering jew lord mowbrays servants heard and caught their lords witticism the serjeants and soldiers repeated the colonels words and the nicknames spread through the regiment and through the garrison wherever i turned i heard them echoed poor jacob was called young shylock by some and by others the wandering jew it was a bitter jest and soon became bitter earnest the ignorant soldiers really believed me to be that jew whom christians most abominate footnote see percys reliques of ancient poetry for the ballad of the wandering jew the common people felt a superstitious dread of me the mothers charged their children to keep out of my way and if i met them in the streets they ran away and hid themselves you may think sir i was not happy i grew melancholy and my melancholy countenance they said was a proof that i was what i was said to be i was ashamed to show my face i lost all relish for my food and began to pine away my master noticed it and he was sorry for me he took my part and spoke to the young lord who thereupon grew angry and high words passed the young lord cursed at my master for an insolent jew dog as to me his lordship swore that he knew me from a boy that he had known enough of my tricks and that of course for that i must bear him malice and he vowed i should not bear it to him for nothing from that day there was a party raised against us in the garrison lord mowbrays soldiers of course took his part and those who were most his favourites abused us the most they never passed our store any day without taunt and insult ever repeating the names their colonel had given me it was hard to stand still and mute and bear every thing without reply but i was determined not to bring my master into any quarrel so i bore all presently the time came when there was great distress for provisions in the garrison then the cry against the jews was terrible but i do not wish to say more of what followed than is necessary to my own story you must have heard sir of the riot at gibraltar the night when the soldiery broke into the spirit stores i had read accounts of some such thing in the newspapers of the day i had heard of excesses committed by the soldiery who were enraged against the jew merchants and i recollected some story footnote drinkwaters siege of gibraltar of the soldiers having roasted a pig before a jews door with a fire made of the jews own cinnamon that fire sir said jacob was made before our door it was kindled by a party of lord mowbrays soldiers who madly intoxicated with the spirits they had taken from the stores came in the middle of that dreadful night to our house and with horrible shouts called upon my master to give up to them the wandering jew my master refusing to do this they burst open his house pillaged wasted destroyed and burnt all before our eyes we lost every thing i do not mean to say wei poor jacob had little to lose it is not of that though it was my all it is not of that i speakbut my master from a rich man in one hour he became a beggar the fruit of all his labour lostnothing left for his wife or children i never can forget his face of despair by that firelight i think i see it now he did not recover it sirhe died of a broken heart he was the best and kindest of masters to me and can you wonder now mr harrington or do you blame jacob that he could not look upon that lord with a pleased eye nor smile when he saw him again i did not blame jacobi liked him for the warmth of his feeling for his master when he was a little composed however i represented that his affection and pity might have raised his indignation too strongly and might have made him impute to lord mowbray a greater share than he really had in their misfortunes lord mowbray was a very young officer at that time too young to be trusted with the command of men in such difficult circumstances his lordship had been exceedingly blamable in giving even in jest the nicknames which had prejudiced his soldiers against an innocent individual but i could not conceive that he had a serious design to injure nor could he as i observed possibly foresee the fatal consequences that afterwards ensued as to the excesses of his soldiers for their want of discipline he was answerable but jacob should recollect the distress to which the soldiers had been previously reduced and the general prejudice against those who were supposed to be the cause of the scarcity lord mowbray might be mistaken like others but as to his permitting their outrages or directing them against individual jews whom he disliked i told jacob it was impossible for me to believe it why did not the jew merchant state his complaint to the general who had as jacob allowed punished all the soldiers who had been convicted of committing outrages if lord mowbray had been complained of by mr manessa a courtmartial would have been held and if the charges had been substantiated his title of colonel or lord would have availed him nothinghe would have been broke jacob said his poor master who was ruined and in despair thought not of courtsmartialperhaps he had no legal proofsperhaps he dreaded with reason the popular prejudice in the garrison and dared not being a jew appear against a christian officer how that might have been jacob said he did not knowall he knew was that his master was very ill and that he returned to england soon afterwards but still argued i if lord mowbray had not been brought to a courtmartial if it had been known among his brother officers that he had been guilty of such unofficerlike conduct no british officer would have kept company with him i was therefore convinced that jacob must have been misinformed and deceived by exaggerated reports and prejudiced by the warmth of his own feelings for the loss of his master jacob listened to me with a look of incredulity yet as if with a wish to believe that i was right he softened graduallyhe struggled with his feelings he knew he said that it was our christian precept to forgive our enemiesa very good precept but was it easy did all christians find it easy to put it in practice and you mr harrington you who can have no enemies how can you judge jacob ended by promising with a smile that he would show me that a jew could forgive then eager to discard the subject he spoke of other things i thanked him for his having introduced me to mr israel lyonshe was delighted to hear of the advantage i had derived from this introduction at cambridge and of its having led to my acquaintance with mr montenero he had been informed of my meeting miss montenero at the theatre and he told me of his hopes and fears when he heard her say she had been assisted by a gentleman of the name of harrington i did not venture however to speak much of miss montenero but i expatiated on the pleasure i had in mr monteneros conversation and on the advantages i hoped to derive from cultivating his society jacob always more disposed to affection and gratitude than to suspicion or revenge seemed happy to be relieved from the thoughts of lord mowbray and he appeared inspired with fresh life and spirit when he talked of mr montenero and his daughter he mentioned their kindness to the widow and children of his deceased master and of mr monteneros goodness to the surviving brother and partner the london jeweller mr manessa jacobs first benefactor the manessas had formerly been settled in spain at the time mr montenero had lived there and when he was in some difficulties with the inquisition they had in some way essentially served him either in assisting his escape from that country or in transmitting his property jacob was not acquainted with the particulars but he knew that mr montenero was most grateful for the obligation whatever it had been and now that he was rich and the manessas in distress he seemed to think he could never do enough for them jacob became first acquainted as he told me with mr montenero in consequence of his connexion with this family the widow had represented him as being a faithful friend and the two children of his deceased master were fond of him mr monteneros attachment to the manessas immediately made him take notice of jacob jacob told me that he was to go to their house in the city and to take charge of their affairs as soon as they could be settled and that mr montenero had promised if possible to obtain for him a share in the firm of the surviving brother and partner in the mean time jacob was employed by mr montenero in making out catalogues of his books and pictures arranging his library and cabinet of medals c to all which he was fully competent jacob said he rejoiced that these occupations would keep him a little while longer at mr monteneros as he should there have more frequent opportunities of seeing me than he could hope for when he should be at the other end of the town besides added he i dont know how i shall ever be able to do without the kindness mr montenero shows me and as for miss montenero jacobs countenance expanded and his voice was by turns softened into tenderness and raised to enthusiasm as he again spoke of the father and daughter and when my mind was touched and warmed by his panegyric of berenicepronounced with the true eloquence of the heartshe leaning on her fathers arm entered the room the dignified simplicity the graceful modesty of her appearance so unlike the fashionable forwardness or the fashionable bashfulness or any of the various airs of affectation which i had seen in lady anne mowbray and her class of young ladies charmed me perhaps the more from contrast and from the novelty of the charm there was a timid sensibility in her countenance when i spoke to her which joined to the feminine reserve of her whole manner the tone of her voice and the propriety and elegance of the very little she said pleased me inexpressibly i wished only that she had said more however when her father spoke it seemed to be almost the same as if she spoke herselfher sympathy with him appeared so strongly he began by speaking of jacob he was glad to find that i was the mr harrington whom jacob had been so eager to see it was evident that they knew all the good that grateful young man could tell of me and the smile which i received from the father and daughter at this instant would have overpaid me for any obligations i could have conferred jacob retired observing that he had taken up all the time with the history of his own private affairs and that i had not yet seen any of the pictures mr montenero immediately led me to one of murillos regretting that he had not the pleasure of showing it to my mother i began to speak of her sorrow at not being able to venture out i made some apology but whatever it was i am sure i did not i could not pronounce it well mr montenero bowed his head courteously removed his eyes from my face and glanced for one moment at miss montenero with a look of regret quickly succeeded by an expression in his countenance of calm and proud independence he was sorry he said that he could not have the honour of seeing mrs harringtonthe pleasure of presenting his daughter to her i perceived that he was aware of what i had hoped had escaped his penetrationmy mothers prepossession against him and his daughter i saw that he attributed it to a general prejudice against his race and religion and i perceived that this hurt his feelings much though his pride or his philosophy quickly repressed his sensibility he never afterwards spoke of my mothernever hoped to see her another daynor hoped even that the cold which had prevented her from venturing out would be better i was the more vexed and ashamed that i had not been able to bring my mother with me i turned the conversation as quickly as i could to mr israel lyons i observed by what mr montenero said that from the information he had received from mr lyons and from jacob he was thoroughly aware of my early prejudices and antipathy to the jews he observed to his daughter that mr harrington had double merit in his present liberality since he had conquered what it is so difficult scarcely possible completely to conqueran early prepossession fostered perhaps by the opinion of many who must have had great influence on his mind through this compliment i thought i saw in mr monteneros and still more in the timid countenance of his daughter a fear that i might relapse and that these early prepossessions which were so difficult scarcely possible completely to conquer might recur i promised myself that i should soon convince them they were mistaken if they had formed any such notion and i was flattered by the fear as it implied that i had inspired some interest we went on with the pictures not being a connoisseur though fond of the arts i was relieved and pleased to find that mr montenero had none of the jargon of connoisseurship while his observations impressed me with a high idea of his taste and judgment they gave me some confidence in my own i was delighted to find that i understood and could naturally and truly agree with all he said and that my untutored preferences were what they ought to be according to the right rules of art and science in short i was proud to find that my taste was in general the same as his and his daughters what pleased me far more than mr monteneros taste was the liberality and the enlargement of mind i saw in all his opinions and sentiments there was in him a philosophic calmness and moderation his reason seemed to have worked against great natural sensibility perhaps susceptibility till this calm had become the unvarying temper of his mind i fancied also that i perceived a constant care in him to cultivate the same temper in his daughter and to fortify her against that extreme sensibility to the opinion of others and that diffidence of herself to which as i recollected he had formerly adverted after having admired some of murillos pictures we came to one which i unpractised as i was in judging of painting immediately perceived to be inferior you are quite right said mr montenero it is inferior to murillo and the sudden sense of this inferiority absolutely broke the painters heart this picture is by a painter of the name of castillo who had thought comfortably well of himself till he saw the masterpieces of murillos genius castillo surveyed them for some time in absolute silence then turning away exclaimed castillo is no more and soon castillo was no more from that moment he pined away and shortly afterwards died not from envy continued mr montenero no he was a man of mild amiable temper incapable of envy but he fell a victim to excessive sensibilitya dangerous though not a common vice of character weakness not vice i hope i heard miss montenero say in a low voice the father answered with a sigh that however cannot be called a virtue which incapacitates from the exercise of independent virtue and which as you find not only depresses genius but may extinguish life itself mr montenero then turned to me and with composure went on speaking of the pictures ever since i knew i was to see these i had been studying cumberlands lives of the spanish painters and this i honestly told mr montenero when he complimented me upon my knowing all the names and anecdotes to which he alluded he smiledso did his daughter and he was so good as to say that he liked me better for telling him this so candidly than if i had known all that the connoisseurs and anecdotemongers living or dead had ever said or written we came to a picture by alonzo cano who excelling in architecture statuary and painting has been called the michael angelo of spain he at least was not deficient in a comfortably good opinion of himself mr montenero said i is not it recorded of cano that having finished a statue of saint antonio de padua for a spanish counsellor the tasteless lawyer and niggardly devotee hesitated to pay the artist his price observing that cano by his own account had been only twentyfive days about it the counsellor sat down with stupid selfsufficiency to calculate that at a hundred pistoles divided by twentyfive days the artist would be paid at a higher rate than he was himself for the exercise of his talents wretch talk to me of your talents exclaimed the enraged artist i have been fifty years learning to make this statue in twentyfive days and as he spoke cano dashed his statue to pieces on the pavement of the academy the affrighted counsellor fled from the house with the utmost precipitation concluding that the man who was bold enough to destroy a saint would have very little remorse in destroying a lawyer happily for cano this story did not reach the ears of the inquisition said mr montenero or he would have been burnt alive mr montenero then pointed out some exquisite pieces by this artist and spoke with enthusiasm of his genius i perceived some emotion of which i could not guess the cause in the countenance of his daughter she seemed touched by what her father said about this painter or his pictures mr montenero concluded his panegyric on canos genius by saying besides being a great genius we are told that he was very religious and some few peculiarities excepted very charitable you are very charitable i am sure said miss montenero looking at her father and smiling i am not sure that i could speak so charitably of that man a sigh quickly followed her smile and i now recollected having heard or read that this painter bore such an antipathy to the jews that he considered every touch of theirs as contamination and if he accidentally came in contact with them would cast off and give away his clothes forbidding the servant to whom he gave them on any account to wear them miss montenero saw that i recollected to what she alludedthat i had a just feeling of the benevolent magnanimity of her fathers character this raised me i perceived in the daughters opinion though scarcely a word passed at the moment yet i fancied that we felt immediately better acquainted i ventured to go and stand beside her from doing which i had hitherto been prevented by i know not what insurmountable difficulty or strange spell we were both opposite to a spanish copy of guidos aurora surgens i observed that the flame of the torch borne by the winged boy representing lucifer points westward in a direction contrary to that in which the manes of the horses the drapery of apollo and that of the dancing hours are blown which seemed to me to be a mistake berenice said that guido had taken this picture from ovids description and that he had with great art represented by the very circumstance to which i objected the swiftness of the motion with which the chariot was driven forward the current of the morning wind blowing from the east was represented by the direction of the hair of lucifer and of the flame of his torch while the rapidity of the motion of the chariot was such that notwithstanding the eastern wind which would otherwise have blown them towards the west the manes of the horses and the drapery of the figures were driven backwards by the resistance of the air against which they were hurried she then repeated in a pleasing but timid manner in support of her opinion these two beautiful lines of addisons translation with winged speed outstrips the eastern wind and leaves the breezes of the morn behind i need not say that i was delighted with this criticism and with the modest manner in which it was spoken but i could not honestly help remarking that to the description immediately alluded to in ovid addison had added the second beautiful line and leaves the breezes of the morn behind mr montenero looked pleased and said to me it is very true in the immediate passage describing the chariot of the sun issuing from the gates of heaven this line is not in the original but if you look further back in the fable you will find that the idea is still more strongly expressed in the latin than in the english it was with the utmost difficulty that i at last forced myself away nor was i in the least aware of the unconscionable length of my visit what particularly pleased me in the conversation of miss montenero was that she had none of those fashionable phrases which fill each vacuity of sense and which level all distinctions of understanding there was none of that commonplace stuff which passes for conversation in the world and which we hear and repeat till we are equally tired of others and of ourselves there were besides in her manner and countenance indications of perfect sweetness of temper a sort of feminine gentleness and softness which art cannot feign nor affectation counterfeit a gentleness which while it is the charm of female manners is perfectly consistent with true spirit and with the higher or the stronger qualities of the mind all i had seen of miss montenero in this first visit inspired me with the most ardent desire to see more here was a woman who could fill my whole soul who could at once touch my heart and my imagination i felt inspired with new lifei had now a great object a strong and lively interest in existence at parting mr montenero shook hands with me which he said he knew was the english mode of showing kindness he expressed an earnest but proudly guarded wish that i might be so circumstanced and so inclined as to allow him the pleasure he much desired of cultivating my acquaintance chapter x the interest which berenice inspired so completely absorbed my mind that i never thought again of jacob and his story till i met lady anne and her brother the next morning when i went to take a ride in the park they were with colonel topham and some people of her ladyships acquaintance lady anne after the usual preliminary quantity of nonsense and after she had questioned and crossquestioned me to the best of her slender abilities about the jewess told me a long story about herself and her fears and the fears of her mare and a horselaugh of mowbrays which colonel topham said no horse could stand not much applause ensuing from me she returned to the witty colonel and left me to her brother mowbray directly began to talk about jacob he said he supposed jacob had not failed to make his gibraltar story good but that hear both sides was an indispensable maxim even where such a favourite as jacob was concerned but first let us take one other good gallop said mowbray anne i leave you here with mrs carrill and colonel topham and away he galloped when he thought as he said that he had shaken off some of my prejudices he drew up his horse and talked over the gibraltar affair his dashing jocular military mode of telling the thing so different from jacobs plain mercantile matteroffact method quite changed my view and opinion of the transaction mowbray blamed himself with such a good grace and wished so fervently that he could make any reparation to the poor devils who had suffered that i acquitted him of all malice and forgave his imprudence the frankness with which he spoke to jacob when they met was proof conclusive to me that he was incapable as he declared of harbouring any malice against jew or christian he inquired most particularly into jacobs own losses at gibraltar called for pen ink and paper and in his offhand manner wrote a draft on his banker and put it into jacobs hand here my honest jacob you are a jew whose accounts i can take at your word let this settle the balance between us no scruples jacobno present thisnothing but remuneration for your losses jacob accepted lord mowbrays apologies but could not by any means be prevailed upon to accept from him any present or remuneration he seemed willing to forgive but not to trust lord mowbray all trace of resentment was cleared from his countenance but no condescension of his lordship could move jacob to throw off his reserve beyond a certain point he conquered aversion but he would not pretend to like mr montenero came into the room while we were speaking and i presented lord mowbray to him there was as marked a difference as politeness would allow in mr monteneros manner towards his lordship and towards me which i justly attributed to jacobs previous representations we looked at the pictures and talked and loitered but i turned my eyes in vain to the door every time it openedno miss montenero appeared i was so much preoccupied with my object that i was silent and left mowbray to make his own way which no one was more capable of doing in a few minutes he was in full conversation he went over again without my attending to it his pice justificative about the riot at gibraltar and jacob and the manessas and between the fits of my reverie i perceived mowbray was talking of the due de crillon and general elliot and redhot balls but i took no interest in the conversation till i heard him speak of an officers ball at gibraltar and of dancing with a jewess the very night he had first landed at gibraltar there happened to be a ball to which he went with a friend who was also just landed and a stranger it was the custom to draw lots for partners his friend a trueborn englishman took fright at the foreignsounding name of the lady who fell to his lotmowbray changed tickets with him and had he said great reason to rejoice the lady with the foreign name was a jewess the handsomest the most graceful the most agreeable woman in the room he was the envy of every man and especially of his poor friend who too late repented his rash renunciation of his ticket lord mowbray by several other slight anecdotes which he introduced with happy effect contrived to please mr montenero and if any unfavourable prepossession had existed against him it was i thought completely removed for my own part i was delighted with his presence of mind in recollecting all that was best worth seeing in london and arranging parties in which we could have the honour of attending miss montenero and the pleasure of being of some use to her mr monteneros own acquaintance in london was chiefly with the families of some of the foreign ambassadors and with other foreigners of distinction but his daughter was not yet acquainted with any english ladies except the lady of general b with whom the monteneros had been intimate in america lady emily b was detained in the country by the illness of one of her family and miss montenero having declined going into public with mrs coates would wait quietly at home till her english friends should come to town again shame for my mothers remissness obliged me to cast down my eyes in awkward silence but mowbray heaven bless him for it went on fluently this was the moment he said before miss montenero should appear in public and get into the whirl of the great world before engagements should multiply and press upon her as inevitably they would as soon as she had made her dbutthis was the moment and the only moment probably she would ever have to herself to see all that was worth a strangers notice in london mr montenero was obliged to mowbray and i am sure so was i miss montenero infinitely more desirous to see than to be seen was pleased with the parties we arranged for her and from this time forward scarcely a day passed without our having the pleasure of attending the father and daughter my mother sighed and remonstrated in vain my father absorbed in the house of commons was satisfied with seeing me regularly at breakfast he usually dined at clubs and it was happily his principle to let his son amuse himself his own way but i assured her and truly that i was only amusing myself and that i had not formed any serious intentions i wished to see more of the lady mowbray with ready invention continually suggested something particularly well worth seeing or hearing some delightful pretext for our being together sometimes he accompanied us sometimes he excused himselfhe had indispensable engagements his indispensable engagements i knew were usually with ladies of a very different sort from miss montenero mowbray was desperately in love with the young actress who had played the part of jessica and to her he devoted every moment he could command i regretted for his sake his dissipated tastes but i felt the more obliged to him for the time he sacrificed to friendship and perhaps to tell things just as they were i was glad he was safely in love with a jessica of his own as it secured me from all apprehension of his rivalling or wishing to rival me miss montenero he confessed was not in the least to his taste in this instance i was quite satisfied that our tastes should completely differ i never liked him so wellwe went on most happily together i felt uncommonly benevolent towards the whole world my heart expanded with increased affection for all my friendsevery thing seemed to smile upon meeven the weather the most delicious morning i ever remember was that on which we rowed along the banks of the thames with miss montenero i always enjoyed every beautiful object in nature with enthusiasm but now with new delightwith all the enchantment of a first love and of hope that had never known disappointment i was almost angry with my dear friend mowbray for not being as enthusiastic this day as i was myself there were certain points of taste and character on which we never could agree my romantic imagination and enthusiastic manner of expressing myself were often in contrast with his worldly comic mode of seeing and talking he hurt sometimes my feelings by his railleryhe pulled me down too suddenly from my flights of imagination by the flashes of his wit he showed perhaps too clearly the danger of my fall from high sublime to deep absurd but after all i was satisfied that miss montenero preferred my style and in general i was content that he should enjoy his dear wit and gay rhetoriceven a little at my expense the morning we went to westminster abbey i own i was provoked with him for pointing out to my observation at the moment when my imagination was struck with the sense of sublimity at the sight of the awful pile the ridiculous contrast of the showman and his keys who was impatiently waiting till i had finished my exclamations but i soon forgot both the showman and the wit while at every step among the illustrious dead my enthusiasm was raised and some anecdote of their lives or some striking quotation from their works rushed upon my mind i was inspired and encouraged by the approbation of the father and the sympathy of the daughter as we were quitting the abbey mr montenero stopped turned to me and said you have a great deal of enthusiasm i see mr harrington so much the better in my opinioni love generous enthusiasm and at the moment i flattered myself that the eyes of his daughter repeated i love generous enthusiasm her father caught the expression and immediately with his usual care moderated and limited what he had said enthusiasm well governed of course i meanas one of your english noblemen lately said there is an enthusiasm of the head and that is geniusthere is an enthusiasm of the heart and that is virtuethere is an enthusiasm of the temper and that is miss montenero looked uneasy and her father perceiving this checked himself again and changing his tone added but with all its dangers and errors enthusiasm in either man or woman is more amiable and respectable than selfishness enthusiasm is not the vice of the young men or women of the present day certainly not said mowbray who was now very attentive to every thing that passed i forgave him the witticisms with which he had crossed my humour this morning for the kind sympathy he showed with the pleasure i felt at this moment afterwards when mowbray and i were alone together and compared notes as we were in the habit of doing upon all that had been said and had been looked during the day mowbray congratulated me upon the impression i had made by my eloquence enthusiasm you see is the thing both with father and daughter you succeed in that linefollow it up i was incapable of affecting enthusiasm or of acting any part to show myself off yet mowbrays opinion and my own observations coinciding unconsciously and involuntarily i afterwards became more at my ease in yielding to my natural feelings and habitual expressions miss montenero had not yet seen the tower and mowbray engaged himself to be of our party but at the same time he privately begged me to keep it a dead secret from his sister lady anne he said would never cease to ridicule him if she were to hear of his going to the tower after having been too lazy to go with her and all the fashionable world the night before to the fantoccini though i had lived in london half my childhood my nervous disease had prevented my being taken to see even the sights that children are usually shown and since my late arrival in town when i had been my own master engagements and emotions had pressed upon me too fast to leave time or inclination to think of such things my object of course was now merely to have the pleasure of accompanying berenice i was unexpectedly struck on entering the armoury at the tower the walls three hundred feet in length covered with arms for two hundred thousand men burnished arms glittering in fancy figures on the walls and ranged in endless piles from the ceiling to the floor of that long gallery then the apartment with the line of ancient kings clad in complete armour mounted on their steeds fully caparisonedthe deathlike stiffness of the figuresthe stillnessthe silence of the placealtogether awe the imagination and carry the memory back to the days of chivalry when among these forms of kings and heroes who had ceased to be i beheld the black prince lance couched vizor down with the arms he wore at cressy and poictiers my enthusiasm knew no bounds the black prince from my childhood had been the object of my idolatry i kneeledi am ashamed to confess itto do homage to the empty armour mr montenero past the age of romantic extravagance could not sympathize with this enthusiasm but he bore with it we passed on to dark gothic nooks of chambers where my reverence for the beds on which kings had slept and the tables at which kings had sat much increased by my early associations formed of brantefield priory was expressed with a vehemence which astonished mr montenero and i fear prevented him from hearing the answers to various inquiries upon which he with better regulated judgment was intent an orator is the worst person to tell a plain fact the very worst guide as mowbray observed that a foreigner can have still mr montenero had patience with me and supplied the elisions in my rhetoric by what information he could pick up from the guide and from mowbray with whom from time to time he stopped to see and hear after i had passed on with berenice to her quickness and sympathy i flattered myself that i was always intelligible we came at last to the chamber where clarence and the young princes had been murdered here i am conscious i was beyond measure exuberant in exclamations and in quotations from shakspeare mr montenero came in just as i was ranting from clarences dream seize on him furies take him to your torments with that methought a legion of foul fiends environd me and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i made i prevented poor mr montenero from hearing the answer to some historic question he was asking berenices eye warned me to lower my voice and i believe i should have been quiet but that unluckily mowbray set me off in another direction by reminding me of the tapestrychamber and sir josseline i remember covering my face with both my hands and shuddering with horror mr montenero asked what of the tapestrychamber and immediately recollecting that i should not to him and before his daughter describe the jew who had committed a deed without a name i with much embarrassment said that it was nothing of any consequenceit was something i could not explain i left it to mowbrays superior presence of mind and better address to account for it and i went on with berenice whenever my imagination was warmed verses poured in upon my memory and often without much apparent connexion with what went before i recollected at this moment the passage in akensides pleasures of the imagination describing the early delight the imagination takes in horrorsthe children closing round the village matron who suspends the infant audience with her tales breathing astonishment and i recited all i recollected of evil spirits of the deathbed call of him who robbd the widow and devourd the orphans portionof unquiet souls risn from the grave to ease the heavy guilt of deeds in life concealdof shapes that walk at dead of night and clank their chains and wave the torch of hell around the murderers bed mowbray and mr montenero who had stayed behind us a few minutes came up just as i was with much emphasis and gesticulation waving the torch of hell i am sure i must have been a most ridiculous figure i saw mowbray on the brink of laughter but mr montenero looked so grave that he fixed all my attention i suddenly stopped we were talking of the pleasures of imagination said berenice to her father mr harrington is a great admirer of akenside is he replied mr montenero coldly and with a look of absence but my dear we can have the pleasures of the imagination another time here are some realities worthy of our present attention he then drew his daughters arm within his i followed and all the time he was pointing out to her the patterns of the spanish instruments of torture with which her politic majesty queen elizabeth frightened her subjects into courage sufficient to repel all the invaders on board the invincible armadai stood silent pondering on what i might have said or done to displease him whom i was so anxious to please first i thought he suspected me of what i most detested the affectation of taste sensibility and enthusiasm next i fancied that mowbray in explaining about the tapestrychamber sir josseline and the bastinadoed jew had said something that might have hurt mr monteneros jewish pride from whichever of these causes his displeasure arose it had the effect of completely sobering my spirits my poetic fit was over i did not even dare to speak to his daughter during our drive home berenice apropos to something which mowbray had said but which i did not hear suggested to her father some lines of akenside which she knew he particularly admired on the nature and power of the early association of ideas mr montenero with all the warmth my heart could wish praised the poetic genius and the intimate and deep knowledge of the human mind displayed in this passage his gravity gradually wore off and i began to doubt whether the displeasure had ever existed at night before mowbray and i parted when we talked over the day he assured me that he had said nothing that could make mr montenero displeased with me or any living creature that they had been discussing some point of english history on which old montenero had posed him as to my fears mowbray rallied me out of them effectually he maintained that montenero had not been at all displeased and that i was a most absurd modern selftormentor could not a man look grave for two minutes without my racking my fancy for two hours to find a cause for it perhaps the man had the toothache possibly the headache but why should i therefore insist upon having the heartache chapter xi mowbrays indifference was often a happy relief to my anxiety of temper and i had surely reason to be grateful to him for the sacrifices he continued daily to make of his own tastes and pleasures to forward my views one morning in particular he was going to a rehearsal at drurylane where i knew his heart was but finding me very anxious to go to the mint and the bank with mr montenero and berenice mowbray who had a relation a bank director immediately offered to accompany us and procured us the means of seeing every thing in the best possible manner nothing could as he confessed be less to his taste and he was surprised that miss montenero chose to be of the party a day spent in viewing the mint and the bank it may perhaps be thought was a day lost to lovequite the contrary i had an opportunity of feeling how the passion of love can throw its enchantment over scenes apparently least adapted to its nature before this time i had twice gone over every part of these magnificent establishments i had seen at the bank the spirit of order operating like predestination compelling the will of man to act necessarily and continually with all the precision of mechanism i had beheld human creatures called clerks turned nearly into arithmetical machines but how new did it all appear in looking at it with berenice how would she have been delighted if she had seen those machines instinct with spirit which now perform the most delicate manoeuvres with more than human dexteritythe selfmoving balance which indefatigably weighs accepts rejects disposes of the coin which a mimic hand perpetually presents what chiefly pleased me in miss montenero was the composure the sincerity of her attention she was not anxious to display herself i was the more delighted when i discovered her quickness of comprehension i was charmed too by the unaffected pleasure she showed in acquiring new ideas and surprised by the judicious proportion of the admiration she expressed for all that was in various degrees excellent in arrangement or ingenious in contrivance in short in short man as mowbray would say in short man you were in love and theres an end of the matter if your berenice had hopped forty paces in the public streets it would have been the same with you that i denybut i will go on with my story as we were going away mr montenero after thanking lord mowbray and his cousin the bank director who had shown and explained every thing to us with polite and intelligent patience observed that the bank was to him a peculiarly interesting sight you know said he that we jews were the first inventors of bills of exchange and banknoteswe were originally the bankers and brokers of the world then as we walked to the carriage he continued addressing himself to his daughter in a lowered voice you see berenice here as in a thousand instances how general and permanent good often results from partial and temporary evil the persecutions even to which we jews were exposedthe tyranny which drove us from place to place and from country to country at a moments or without a moments warning compelled us by necessity to the invention of a happy expedient by which we could convert all our property into a scrap of paper that could be carried unseen in a pocketbook or conveyed in a letter unsuspected berenice thanked heaven that the times of persecution were over and added that she hoped any prejudice which still existed would soon die away mowbray exclaimed against the very idea of the existence of such prejudices at this time of day in england among the higher classes he did not recollect his own mother i believe when he said this but i know i had a twinge of conscience about mine and i did not dare to look at mr montenero nor did i know well which way to look when his lordship persisting in his assertion asked miss montenero if she could possibly imagine that any such vulgar prejudices existed among wellbred persons berenice mildly answered that she had really as yet enjoyed so few opportunities of seeing the higher classes of society in london that she could not form a judgment she was willing to take upon trust his lordships opinion who must have means of knowing i imagined that mr monteneros eye was upon me and that he was thinking of my mothers never having made the slightest advance towards an acquaintance with his daughter i recollected the speeches i had made on his first visit pledging my mother to that which she had never performed i felt upon the rackand a pause that ensued afterwards increased my misery i longed for somebody to say somethingany thing i looked for assistance to mowbray he repeated confidently that miss montenero might entirely rely upon what he said as to london and englandindeed he had been a good deal abroad too he seemed to be glad to get to the continent againi followed him as fast as i could and inquired whether he did not think that the french and germans were much improved in liberality and a spirit of toleration give me leave said mr montenero to answer for the improvement of the germans fifteen years ago i remember when i was travelling in germany i was stopped at a certain bridge over the rhine and being a jew was compelled to pay rather an ignominious toll the jews were there classed among clovenfooted beasts and as such paid toll but within these few years sixteen german princes enlightened and inspired by one great writer and one good minister have combined to abolish this disgraceful tax you see my dear berenice your hope is quickly fulfillingprejudices are dying away fast hope humbly but hope always the playful tone in which mr montenero spoke put me quite at my ease the next day i was determined on an effort to make my mother acquainted with miss montenero if i could but effect a meeting a great point i thought would be gained mowbray undertook to manage it and he as usual succeeded he persuaded his mother to go to an auction of pictures where he assured her she would be likely to meet with a vandyke of one of her ancestors of whose portrait she had long been in search lady de brantefield engaged my mother to be of the party without her having any suspicion that she would meet the monteneros we arrived in time to secure the best places before the auction began neither mr nor miss montenero were there but to my utter discomfiture a few minutes after we were seated vulgar mrs coates and all her tribe appeared she elbowed her difficult way onward towards us and nodding to me familiarly seated herself and her vandals on a line with us then stretching herself across the august lady de brantefield who drew back far as space would permit beg your pardon maam but i just want to say a word to this lady ant you the ladyyesthat sat beside me at the play the other nightthe merchant of venice and the maid of the oaks was not it izzy i hope you caught no cold maamyou look but poorly i am sorry to noticebut what i wanted to say maam heres an ivory fan miss montenero was in a pucker and quandary about pucker and quandaryoh how i groaned inwardly i was in such a fuss about her you know sir that i never found out till i got home i had pocketed a strange fanhere it is maam if it is yoursits worth any bodys owning i am sure the fan was my mothers and she was forced to be much obliged lady de brantefield still painfully holding back did not resume her position till some seconds had elapsed after mrs coates had withdrawn her fat busttill it might be supposed that the danger of coming into contact with her was fairly over my mother after a decent interval asked me if it were possible to move to some place where they could have more air as the crowd was increasing lord mowbray and i made way for her to a seat by an open window but the persevering mrs coates followed talking about the famous elbows of mr peter coates on whose arm she leaned when peter chooses theres not a man in lonon knows the use of his elbows better and if wed had him mr harrington with us at the play the other night we should not have given you so much trouble with miss montenero getting her out lord mowbray amused by my look of suffering could not refrain from diverting himself further by asking a question or two about the monteneros it was soon apparent from the manner in which mrs coates answered that she was not as well pleased with them as formerly it was her maxim she said to speak of the bridge as she went over it and for her part if she was to give her verdict she couldnt but say miss montenerofor they werent on terms to call her miss berry nowwas a little incomprehensible sometimes a look of surprise from lord mowbray without giving himself the trouble to articulate was quite sufficient to make the lady go on why if it concerned any gentleman glancing her illbred eye upon me if any gentleman was thinking of looking that way it might be of use to him to know the land miss montenero then if truth must be told is a little touchy on the jewish chapter lord mowbray urged mrs coates on with how for instance oh how why my lord a hundred times ive hurt her to the quick one cant always be thinking of peoples different persuasions you knowand if one asked a question just for informations sake or made a natural remark as i did tother day queeney you know just about jew butchers and pigeonsits a pity said i that jews must always have jew butchers miss berry and that there is so many things they cant touch one cant have pigeons nor hares at ones table said i thinking only of my second course as to pork henny says i thats a coarse butchers meat which i dont regret nor the alderman a pinch o snuffnow you know i thought that was kind of me but miss montenero took it all the wrong way quite to heart so youve no idear after all she may say what she pleases but its my notion the jews is both a very unsocial and a very revengeful people for do you know my lord they wouldnt dine with us next day though the alderman called himself my mother was so placed that she could not avoid hearing all that mrs coates said to lord mowbray and though she never uttered a syllable or raised her eyes or moved the fan she held in her hand i knew by her countenance the impression that was made on her mind she would have scorned on any other subject of human life or manners to have allowed the judgment of mrs coates to weigh with her in the estimation of a single hair yet here her opinion and idears were admitted to be decisive such is prejudice thought i prejudice even in the proudest people will stoop to accept of nourishment from any hand prejudice not only grows on what it feeds upon but converts every thing it meets with into nourishment how clearsighted i was to the nature of prejudice at this moment and how many reflections passed in one instant which i had never made before in the course of my lifemeantime mrs coates had beckoned to her son peter and peter had drawn near and was called upon by his mother to explain to my lord the cause of the coolness betwixt the alderman and mr montenero it was she said about the manessas and a young man called jacob peter was not as fluent as his mother and she went on it was some money matter mr montenero had begun by acting a very generous part she understood at first by way of being the benevolent jew but had not come up to the aldermans expectations latterly and had shown a most illiberal partiality to the manessas and this jacob only because they was jews which you know said mrs coates was very ungentlemanlike to the alderman after all the civilities we had shown the monteneros on their coming to lononas peter if he could open his mouth could tell you peter had just opened his mouth when mr montenero appearing he closed it again to my inexpressible disappointment miss montenero was not with her father mr montenero smiled the instant he caught my eye but seeing my mother as he approached he bowed gravely and passed on and never noticed me i declare said mrs coates thats too good but miss montenero i thought she was to be here cried mowbray mrs coates after her fashion stretching across two of her daughters whispered to the third loud enough for all to hear queeney this comes of airsthis comes of her not choosing for to go abroad with me i suppose if people doesnt know their friends when they has em replied queeney they may go farther and fare worse thats all i have to say hush said peter giving his sister a monitory pinchcant you say your say under your breath hes within seven of you and he has ears like the devil all them jews has and jewesses too they think ones always talking of them theyre so suspicious said mrs coates i am told moreover that theyve ways and means of hearing to my great relief she was interrupted by the auctioneer and the sound of his hammer the auction went on and nothing but who bids more goinggoingwho bids more was heard for a considerable time not being able to get near mr montenero and having failed in all my objects i grew excessively tired and was going away leaving my mother to the care of mowbray but he stopped me stay stay said he drawing me aside behind two connoisseurs who were babbling about a titian you will have some diversion by and by i have a picture to sell and you must see how it will go off there is a painting that i bought at a stall for nothing upon a speculation that my mother who is a judge will pay dear for and what do you think the picture is dont look so stupidit will interest you amazingly and mr montenero too and tis a pity your jewess is not here to see it did you ever hear of a picture called the dentition of the jew not i youll see presently said mowbray but tell me now said i only the drawing the teeth of the jew by order of some one of our most merciful lords the kingsjohn richard or edward it will be a companion to the old family picture of the jew and sir josseline continued mowbray and this will make the vile daub which ive had the luck to pick up invaluable to my mother and i trust very valuable to me there christie has it up the dear rascal hear him puff it lady de brantefield put up her glass but neither she nor i could distinguish a single figure in the picture the light so glared upon it christie caught her ladyships eye and addressed himself directly to her but her ladyship was deaf mowbray pressed forward to her ear and repeated all christie roared no sooner did she understand the subject of the picture than she turned to her son to desire him to bid for her but mowbray substituted topham in his stead topham obeyed who bids more a bidder started up who seemed very eager he was we were told an engraver who bids more to our surprise mr montenero was the person to bid moreand more and more and more the engraver soon gave up the contest but her ladyships pride and passions rose when she found mr montenero continued to bid against her and she persisted till she came up to an extravagant sum and still she desired colonel topham to bid on beyond my expectation faith both mad whispered mowbray i thought so too still mr montenero went higher ill go no higher said lady de brantefield you may let it be knocked down to that person colonel then turning to her son who is the man that bids against me a jewish gentleman maam i believe a jew perhapsgentleman i deny no jew ever was or ever will be a gentleman i am sure our family since the time of sir josseline have had reason enough to know that very true maamill call for your carriage for i suppose you have had enough of this mowbray carried me with him come off said he i long to hear montenero descant on the merits of the dentition do you speak for you can do it with a better face mowbray seemed to be intent merely upon his own diversion he must have seen and felt how reluctant i was but taking my arm he dragged me on to mr montenero who was standing near a window with the picture in his hand examining it attentively mowbray pushed me on close behind mr montenerothe light now falling on the picture i saw it for the first time and the sight struck me with such associated feelings of horror that i started back exclaiming with vehement gestures i cannot bear it i cannot bear that picture mr montenero turned and looked at me with surprise i beg pardon sir said i but it made me absolutely sick said mr montenero opening the window as i leaned back against the wall and the eyes of all present were fixed upon me ashamed of the exaggerated expression of my feelings i stood abashed mr montenero with the greatest kindness of manner and with friendly presence of mind said he remembered well having felt actually sick at the sight of certain pictures for instance my lord said he addressing himself to lord mowbray the famous picture of the flaying the unjust magistrate i never could look at steadily i recovered myselfand squeezing mr monteneros hand to express my sense of his kind politeness i exerted myself to talk and to look at the picture afraid of mowbrays ridicule i never once turned my eyes towards himi fancied that he was laughing behind me i did him injustice he was not laughinghe looked seriously concerned he whispered to me forgive me my dear harringtoni aimed at mammai did not mean to hurt you before we quitted the subject i expressed to mr montenero my surprise at his having purchased at an extraordinary price a picture apparently of so little merit and on such a disgusting subject abuse the subject as much as you please interrupted mowbray but as to the merit of the painting have the grace harrington to consider that mr montenero must be a better judge than you or i you are too good a judge yourself my lord replied mr montenero in a reserved tone not to see this picture to be what it really is a very poor performance then turning to me in a cordial manner be assured mr harrington that i am at least as clearsighted in every point of view as you can possibly be to its demerits then why did you purchase it was the question which involuntarily recurred to mowbray and to me but we were both silent and stood with our eyes fixed upon the picture gentlemen if you will do me the honour to dine with me tomorrow said mr montenero you shall know the purpose for which i bought this picture we accepted the invitation mowbray waited for tomorrow with all the eagerness of curiosity and i with the eagerness of a still more impatient passion i pass over my mothers remonstrances against my dining at the monteneros remonstrances strengthened as they were in vehemence if not in reason by all the accession of force gathered from the representations and insinuations of mrs coates the next day came now we shall hear about the dentition of the jew said mowbray as we got to mr monteneros door and now we shall see berenice thought i we found a very agreeable company assembled mixed of english and foreigners there was the spanish ambassador and the russian envoywho bytheby spoke english better than any foreigner i ever heard a polish count perfectly well bred and his lady a beautiful woman with whom mowbray of course was half in love before dinner was over the only english present were general and lady emily b we soon learned by the course of the conversation that mr montenero stood high in the estimation of every individual in the company all of whom had known him intimately at different times of his life and in different countries the general had served in america during the beginning of the war he had been wounded there and in great difficulties and distress he and his lady under very trying circumstances had been treated in the most kind and hospitable manner by mr montenero and his family with that true english warmth of gratitude which contrasts so strongly and agreeably with the natural reserve of english manner and habits the general and his wife lady emily expressed their joy at having mr montenero in england in london among their own friends my dear mr montenero must let us introduce him to your brother and our other friendshow delighted they will be to see him and bereniceshe was such a little creature general at the time you saw her lastbut such a kind sweet little creatureyou remember her scraping the lint remember it certainly they spoke of her and looked at her as if she was their own child and for my part i could have embraced both the old general and his wife i only wished that my mother had been present to receive an antidote to mrs coates oh please heaven we will make londonwell make england agreeable to youtwo years no that wont dowe will keep you with us for everyou shall never go back to america then in a low voice to mr montenero the general added do you think we have not an englishman good enough for her i felt the blood rush into my face and dreaded that every eye must see it when i had the courage to raise my head and to look round i saw that i was perfectly safe and that no creature was thinking about me not even mowbray who was gallanting the polish lady i ventured then to look towards berenice but all was tranquil thereshe had not i was sure heard the whisper mr montenero had his eye upon her the fathers eye and mine metand such a penetrating yet such a benevolent eye i endeavoured to listen with composure to whatever was going on the general was talking of his brotherinlaw lord charles a panic seized me and a mortal curiosity to know what sort of a man the brotherinlaw might be i was not relieved till the dessert came on the table when apropos to something a swedish gentleman said about linnaeus strawberries and the gout it appeared to my unspeakable satisfaction that lord charles had the gout at this instant and had been subject to it during the last nine years i had been so completely engrossed by my own feelings and imaginations that i had never once thought of that which had previously excited our curiositythe picture till as we were going into another room to drink coffee mowbray said to me we hear nothing of the dentition of the jew i cant put him in mind of it certainly not said i there is a harp i hope miss montenero will play on it added i after coffee we had some good music in different styles so as to please and interest and join in one common sympathy all the company many of whom had never before heard each others national music berenice was asked to play some hebrew music the good general reminding her that he knew she had a charming ear and a charming voice when she was a child she had not however been used to sing or play before numbers and she resisted the complimentary entreaties but when the company were all gone except the general and his lady mowbray and myself her father requested that berenice would try one song and that she would play one air on the harp to oblige her old friends she immediately complied with a graceful unaffected modesty that interested every heart in her favouri can answer for my own though no connoisseur i was enthusiastically fond of good music miss monteneros voice was exquisite both the poetry and the music were sublime and touching no compliments were paid but when she ceased all were silent in hopes that the harp would be touched again by the same hand at this moment mr montenero turning to lord mowbray and to me said gentlemen i recollect my promise to you and will perform iti will now explain why i bought that painting which you saw me yesterday so anxious to obtain he rang the bell and desired a servant to bring in the picture which he had purchased at the auction and to desire jacob to come with it as soon as it was brought in i retired to the farther end of the room in mowbrays countenance there was a strange mixture of contempt and curiosity mr montenero kindly said to me i shall not insist mr harrington on your looking at it i know it is not to your taste i immediately approached resolved to stand the sight that i might not be suspected of affectation berenice had not yet seen the painting she shrunk back the moment she beheld it exclaiming oh father why purchase such a horrible picture to destroy it said mr montenero and deliberately he took the picture out of its frame and cut it to pieces repeating to destroy it my dear as i would were it in my power every record of cruelty and intolerance so perish all that can keep alive feelings of hatred and vengeance between jews and christians amen said the good old general and all present joined in that amen i heard it pronounced by miss montenero in a very low voice but distinctly and fervently while i stood with my eyes fixed on berenice and while mowbray loudly applauded her fathers liberality mr montenero turned to jacob and said i sent for my friend jacob to be present at the burning of this picture because it was he who put it in my power to prevent this horrid representation from being seen and sold in every printshop in london jacob who goes every where and sees wherever he goes observed this picture at a brokers shop and found that two persons had been in treaty for it one of them had the appearance of an amateur the other was an artist an engraver the engraver was i suppose the person who bid against colonel topham and me who the other gentleman was and why he bought in to sell it again at that auction perhaps jacob knows but i have never inquired then with jacobs assistance mr montenero burned every shred of this abominable picture to my inexpressible satisfaction during this autodaf jacob cast a glance at mowbray the meaning of which i could not at first comprehend but i supposed that he was thinking of the fire at which all he had in the world had been consumed at gibraltar i saw or thought i saw that jacob checked the feeling this recollection excited he turned to me and in a low voice told me that mr montenero had been so kind as to obtain for him a lucrative and creditable situation in the house of manessa the jeweller and the next day he was to go to mr manessas and to commence business so mr harrington you see that after all my misfortunes i am now established in a manner far above what could have been expected for poor jacobfar above his most sanguine hopes thanks to my good friends and to your good self said i i was much pleased with mowbray at this instant for the manner in which he joined in my praise of jacob and in congratulations to him his lordship promised that he would recommend his house to all his family and friends what a contrast said mowbray as soon as jacob had left the room there is between jacob and his old rival dutton that fellow has turned out very illdrunken idle dogis reduced to an oldiron shop i believealways plaguing me with begging letters certainly harrington you may triumph in your election of jacob i never saw berenice and her father look so much pleased with mowbray as they did at this instant of the remainder of the evening i recollect nothing but berenice and of my staying later than i ought to have done even after the general and his wife had departed some time i lingered i was to go home in mowbrays carriage and twice he had touched my shoulder telling me that i was not aware how late it was i could not conceive how he could think of going so early early he directed my eye to the clock on the chimneypiece i was ashamed to see the hour i apologized to mr montenero he replied in a manner that was more than politethat was quite affectionate and his last words repeated at the head of the stairs expressed a desire to see me again frequently i sprang into mowbrays carriage one of the happiest men on earth full of love hope and joy chapter xii all gone to bed but you said i to the footman who opened the door no sir said the drowsy fellow my lady is sitting up for you i believe then mowbray come income up with me to my mother pray do for one instant before she slept i said he must administer an antidote to coatess poison while the impression was still fresh in his mind i entreated he would say what a delightful party we had had my mother i knew had such a high idea of his lordships judgment in all that concerned gentility and fashion that a word from him would be decisive but let it be tomorrow morning said mowbray tis shamefully late tonight tonighttonightnow now persisted i he complied any thing to oblige you remember said i as we ran up stairs spanish ambassador russian envoy polish count and countess and an english general and his ladystrong in rank well burst upon the enemy i flung open the door but my spirits were suddenly checked i saw it was no time for jest and merriment dead silencesolemn stillnesscandles with unsnuffed wicks of portentous length my father and mother were sitting with their backs half turned to each other my mother leaning her head on her hand with her elbow on the table her salts before her my father sitting in his armchair legs stretched out feet upon the bars of the grate back towards usbut that back spoke anger as plainly as a back could speak neither figure moved when we entered i stood appalled mowbray went forward though i caught his arm to pull him back but he did not understand me and with illtimed gaiety and fluency that i would have given the world to stop he poured forth to my mother in praise of all we had seen and heard and then turning to my father who slowly rose shading his eyes from the candle and looking at me under the hand lord mowbray went on with a rapturous eulogium upon harringtons jew and jewess then it is all true said my father it is all very well harringtonbut take notice and i give you notice in time in form before your friend and counsellor lord mowbray that by jupiterby jupiter ammon i will never leave one shilling to my son if he marry a jewess every inch of my estate shall go from him to his cousin longshanks in the north though i hate him like sin but a jewess for my daughterinlaw i will never haveby jupiter ammon so snatching up a bougie the wick of which scattered fire behind him he left the room good heavens what have i done cried mowbray what you can never undo said i my mother spoke not one word but sat smelling her salts never fear man whispered mowbray he will sleep it off or by tomorrow we shall find ways and means he left me in despair i heard his carriage roll awayand then there was silence again i stood waiting for some explanation from my mothershe saw my despairshe dreaded my anger in broken and scarcely intelligible contradictory phrases she declared her innocence of all intention to do me mischief and acknowledged that all was her doing but reminded me that she had prophesied it would come to thisit would end illand at last trembling with impatience as i stood she told me all that had happened the fact was that she had talked to her friend lady de brantefield and some other of her dear friends of her dread that i should fall in love with miss montenero and the next person said i had fallen in love with her and under the seal of secresyit was told that i had actually proposed for her but that my father was to know nothing of the matter this story had been written in some young ladys letter to her correspondent in the country and miss in the country had told it to her brother who had come to town this day dined in company with my father got drunk and had given a bumper toast to miss montenero the jewish heiressmrs harrington jun that is to be my father had come home foaming with rage my mother had done all she could to appease him and to make him comprehend that above half what he had heard was false but it had gone the wrong way into his head and there was no getting it out again my father had heard it at the most unlucky time possible just after he had lost a good place and was driven to the necessity of selling an estate that had been in his family since the time of richard the second my mother farther informed me that my father had given orders in his usual sudden way when angry for going into the country immediately while she was yet speaking the door opened and my father with his nightcap on put his head in saying remember maam you are to be off at seven tomorrowand you sir continued he advancing towards me if you have one grain of sense left i recommend it to you to come with us but no i see it written in your absurd face that you will notobstinate madman i leave you to your own discretion cried he turning his back upon me but by jupiter ammon ill do what i say by jupiter and carrying my mother off with him he left me to my pleasing reflections all was tumult in my mind one moment i stood motionless in utter despair the next struck with some bright hope i walked up and down the room with hasty stridesthen stopped short again and stood fixed as some dark reality some sense of improbabilityof impossibility crossed my mind and as my fathers denunciation recurred to my ear a jewessher religionher principlesmy principlesand can a jewess marry a christian and should a christian marry a jewess the horrors of family quarrels of religious dissensions and disputes between father and child husband and wifeall these questions and fears and doubts passed through my imagination backwards and forwards with inconceivable rapiditystruck me with all the amazement of novelty though in fact they were not new to me the first moment i saw her i was told she was a jewess i was aware of the difficulties and yet i had never fixed my view upon them i had suffered myself to waive the consideration of them till this moment in the hope the joy the heaven of the first feelings of the passion of love i had lost sight of all difficulties human or divine and now i was called upon to decide in one hour upon questions involving the happiness of my whole life to be called upon before it was necessary toofor i was not in love not iat least i had formed no idea of marrying no resolution to propose then bitterly i execrated the reporters and the gossipers and the letterwriting misses whose tattling and meddling and idleness and exaggeration and absolute falsehood had precipitated me into this misery the drunken brute too who had blundered out to my father that fatal toast had his full share of my indignation and my mother with her presentimentsand mowbray with his inconceivable imprudenceand my father with his prejudices his violence and his jupiter ammonevery body and every thing i blamed except myself and when i had vented my rage still the question recurred what was to be done how should i resolve morning was come the grey light was peeping through the shutters i opened the window to feel the fresh calm air i heard the people beginning to stir in the house my father and mother were to be called at half after six six struck i must decide at least whether i would go with them or not no chance of my father sleeping it off obstinate beyond conception and by jupiter ammon once sworn never revoked but after all where was the great evil of being disinherited the loss of my paternal estate in this moment of enthusiasm appeared a loss i could easily endure berenice was an heiressa rich heiress and i had a small estate of my own left to me by my grandfather i could live with berenice upon any thingupon nothing her wishes were moderate i was surei should not however reduce her to poverty no her fortune would be sufficient for us both it would be mortifying to my prideit would be painful to receive instead of to givei had resolved never to be under such an obligation to a wife but with such a woman as berenicei would submitsubmit to accept her and her fortune then as to her being a jewesswho knows what changes love might produce voltaire and mowbray say quune femme est toujours de la religion de son amant at this instant i heard a heavy foot coming down the back stairs the door opened and a yawning housemaid appeared and started at the sight of me gracious i didnt think it was so late mistress bid me ask the first thing i didbut i didnt know it was so latemercy theres masters bellwhether you go or not sir certainly not said i and after having uttered this determination i was more at ease i sat down and wrote a note to my father in the most respectful and eloquent terms i could devise judging that it was better to write than to speak to him on the subject then i vacated the room for the housemaid and watched in my own apartment till all the noises of preparation and of departure were over and till i heard the sound of the carriage driving away i was surprised that my mother had not come to me to endeavour to persuade me to change my determination but my father i heard had hurried her into the carriagemy note i found on the table torn down the middle i concluded that my cousin longshanks was in a fair way to have the estate but i went to bed and to sleep and i was consoled with dreams of berenice mowbray was with me in the morning before i was dressed i had felt so angry with him that i had resolved a hundred times during the night that i would never more admit him into my confidencehowever he contrived to prevent my reproaches and dispel my anger by the great concern he expressed for his precipitation he blamed himself so much that instead of accusing i began to comfort him i assured him that he had in fact done me a service instead of an injury by bringing my affairs suddenly to a crisis i had thus been forced to come at once to a decision what decision he eagerly asked my heart was at this instant in such immediate want of sympathy that it opened to him i told him all that had passed between my father and me told him my fathers vow and my resolution to continue at all hazards my pursuit of berenice he heard me with astonishment he said he could not tell which was most rash my fathers vow or my resolution and your father is gone actually gone cried mowbray and in spite of his jupiter ammon you stand resolved to brave your fate and to pursue the fair jewess even so said i this day i will know my fatethis day i will propose for miss montenero against this mad precipitation he argued in the most earnest manner if you were the first duke in england harrington said he with the finest estate undipped unencumbered unentailed if consequently you had nothing to do but to ask and have any woman for a wife still i should advise you if you meant to secure the ladys heart as well as her hand not to begin in this novicelike manner by letting her see her power over you neither woman nor man ever valued an easy conquest no trust me keep your mind to yourself till the lady is dying to know itkeep your own counsel till the lady can no longer keep hers when you are sure of her not being able to refuse you then ask for her heart as humbly as you please to the whole of this doctrine i could not in honour generosity or delicacy accede of the wisdom of avoiding the danger of a refusal i was perfectly sensible but in declaring my attachment to miss montenero i meant only to ask permission to address her to win her heart i was well aware must be a work of time but the first step was to deserve her esteem and to begin by conducting myself towards her and her father with perfect sincerity and openness the more i was convinced of my fathers inflexibility the more desperate i knew my circumstances were the more i was bound not to mislead by false appearances they would naturally suppose that i should inherit my fathers fortunei knew that i should not if so then interrupted mowbray with your perfect openness and sincerity you will go to mr montenero and you will say sir that you are a jew i know that you are as rich as a jew i hope that you are a fool i take for granted at all events i am a madman and a beggar or about to be a beggar my father who is a good and a most obstinate christian swore last night by jupiter ammon the only oath which he never breaks that he will disinherit me if i marry a jewess therefore i come this morning to ask you sir for your daughter who is a jewess and as i am told a great heiresswhich last circumstance is in my opinion a great objection but i shall overcome it in favour of your daughter if you will be pleased to give her to me stay sir i beg your pardon sir excuse the hurry of the passions which probably you have long since forgotten the fact is i do not mean to ask you for your daughteri came simply to ask your permission to fall in love with her which i have already done without your permission and i trust she has on her part done likewise for if i had not a shrewd suspicion that your jessica was ready according to the custom of jews daughters to jump out of a twopair of stairs window into her lovers arms madman as i am i could not be such an idiot as to present myself before you as i now do sir suing in forma pauperis for the pleasure of becoming your soninlaw i must further have the honour to tell you and with perfect sincerity and consideration let me inform you sir that my christian father and mother having resolved never to admit a jewish daughterinlaw to the honours of the maternal or paternal embrace when your daughter shall do me the favour to become my wife she need not quit your house or family as she cannot be received into mine here sir i will rest my cause but i might farther plead plead no more for or against me mowbray interrupted i angrily turning from him for i could bear it no longer enthusiasm detests wit much and humour more enthusiasm fancying itself raised above the reach of ridicule is always incensed when it feels that it is not safe from its shafts mowbray changed his tone and checking his laughter said seriously and with an air of affectionate sympathy that at the hazard of displeasing me he had used the only means he had conceived to be effectual to prevent me from taking a step which he was convinced would be fatal i thanked him for his advice but i had previously been too much piqued by his raillery to allow his reasons even their due weight besides i began to have a secret doubt of the sincerity of his friendship in his turn he was provoked by my inflexible adherence to my own opinion and perhaps suspecting my suspicion he was the more readily displeased he spoke with confidence i thought with arrogance as a man notoriously successful in the annals of gallantry treating me as i could not bear to be treated like a novice i flatter myself no man is less a coxcomb with regard to women than i am lord mowbray modestly began but if i were inclined to boast i believe it is pretty generally allowed in town by all who know any thing of these things that my practice in gallantry has been somewhat successfulperhaps undeservedly so still in these cases the world judges by success i may therefore be permitted to think that i know something of women my advice consequently i thought might be of use but after all perhaps i am wrong often those who imagine that they know women best know them least i replied that i did not presume to vie with lord mowbray as a man of gallantry but i should conceive that the same precepts and the same arts which ensured success with women of a certain class might utterly fail with women of different habits and tastes if the question were how to win such and such an actress naming one who had sacrificed her reputation for mowbray and another for whom he was sacrificing his fortune i should i said implicitly follow his advice but that novice as i was in gallantry i should venture to follow my own judgment as to the mode of pleasing such a woman as miss montenero none but a novice mowbray answered laughing could think that there was any essential difference between woman and woman every woman was at heart the same of this he was so much convinced that though he had not he said any absurd confidence in his own peculiar powers of pleasing he was persuaded that if honour had not put the trial quite out of the question on his part he could as easily have won the fair jewess as any other of her sex my indignation rose honour and friendship to me my lord are out of the question forgive me if i own that i do not think your lordship would there have any chance of success at all events you know you are safe i cannot make the trial without your permission your lordship is perfectly at liberty if you think proper to make the trial indeedare you in earnestnow you have put it into my head i will think of it seriously then in a careless picktooth manner he stood as if for some moments debating the matter with himself i have no great taste for matrimony or for jewesses but a jewish heiress in the present state of my affairsharrington you know the pretty little gipsythe actress who played jessica that night so famous in your imagination so fatal to us bothwell my little jessica has since that time played away at a rare rate with my ready moneydipped me confoundedlytwould be poetic justice to make one jewess pay for another if one could two hundred thousand pounds miss montenero is i think they say pon my sincerity tis a temptation now it strikes meif i am not bound in honour i walked away in disgust while mowbray in the same tone continued let me see nowsupposeonly supposeany thing may be by suppositionsuppose we were rivals as rivals things would be wonderfully fair and even between us you harrington i grant have the advantage of first impressionsshe has smiled upon you while i bound in honour stood by like a mummybut unbound set at liberty by express permissiongive me a fortnights time and if i dont make her blush my names not mowbrayand no matter whom a woman smiles upon the man who makes her blush is the man but seriously harrington am i hurting your feelings if what is play to me is death to you i have done bind me over again to my good behaviour you may by a single word instead of defying me only swear or stayi wont put you to your oathsay candidly upon your honour lord mowbray puts you in fear of your love i neither defy you nor fear you my lord said i with a tone and look which at any other time lord mowbray who was prompt enough to take offence would have understood as it was meant but he was now determined not to be provoked by any thing i could say or look standing still at ease he continued not fear menot bind me in honourthen i have nobodys feelings to consult but my own so as i was considering things are marvellously nicely balanced between us in point of fortune both beggarsnearly for though my father did not disinherit me i have disinherited myself then our precious mothers will go mad on the spot in white satin if either of us marry a jewess well that is even between us then religious scruplesyou have some have not you i have my lord dry enoughthere i have the advantagei have none mosquehigh churchlow churchno churchdont let me shock you i thought you were for universal toleration i am for liberty of conscience in marriage at least you are very liberal i know youre in love and youd marry even a jewess would not you if you could not contrive to convert her i am not in love but shall be soon i feel and when once i am in lovei turn idolater plump now an idolaters worse than a jew so i should make it a point of conscience to turn jew to please the fair jewess if requisite my lord this trifling i can bear no longer i must beg seriously that we may understand each other triflingnever was more serious in my life id turn jewid turn any thing for a woman i loved have you or have you not my lord any intention of addressing miss montenero since i have your permissionsince you have put it in my headsince you have piqued mefranklyyes i thank you for your frankness my lord i understand you now we understand each other said i why yesand tis time we should said mowbray coolly knowing one another as we have done even from our boyish days you may remember i never could bear to be piqued en honneur especially by you my dear harrington it was written above that we were to be rivals but still if we could command our tempersi was the hottest of the two when we were boys but seeing something of the world abroad and at home has done wonders for me if you could coolly pursue this business as i wish in the comic rather than the heroic style we might still though rivals be friendsvery good friends no my lord no here all friendship between us ends be it so said lord mowbray then sworn foes instead of sworn friendsand open war is the word open waryesbetter than hollow peace then a truce for today tomorrow with your good leave i enter the lists when you please my lord fearful odds i own the first flourish of trumpets by that trumpeter of yours jacob has been in favour of the champion of the jew pedlars and the lady with bright jewish eyes has bowed to her knight and he has walked the field triumphantly alone but mowbraylord mowbray appears farewell harrington he bowed laughing and left me twas well he did i could not have borne it another second and i could not insult the man in my own houseanger disdainful anger possessed me my heart had in the course of a few hours been successively a prey to many violent conflicting passions and at the moment when i most wanted the support the sympathy of a friend i found myself duped deserted ridiculed i felt alone in the world and completely miserable a truce for this day was agreed upon i had a few hours time for reflectionmuch wanted during this interval which appeared to me a most painful suspense i had leisure to reconsider my difficulties now that i was left to my own will entirely should i decide to make an immediate declaration as i revolved this question in my thoughts my mind altered with every changing view which the hopes and fears of a lover threw upon the subject i was not perfectly well informed as to the material point whether the jewish religion and jewish customs permitted intermarriages with christians mowbrays levity had suggested alarming doubts perhaps he had purposely thrown them out be that as it would i must be satisfied i made general inquiries as to the jewish customs from jacob and he careful to answer with propriety kept also to general terms lest he should appear to understand my particular views he could tell me only that in some cases more frequently on the continent and in america than in england jews have married christian women and the wives have continued undisturbed in their faith whether such marriages were regularly permitted or not jacob could not sayno precedent that he could recollect was exactly a case in point this difficulty concerning religion increased instead of diminishing in magnitude and importance the more my imagination dwelt upon itthe longer it was considered by my reason i must take more time before i could determine besides i was curiousi would not allow that i was anxiousto see how miss montenero would conduct herself towards lord mowbraya man of ranka man of fashionsupposed to be a man of fortuneknown to be a man of wit and gallantry i should have an opportunity such as i had never before had of seeing her tried and i should be able to determine whether i had really obtained any interest in her heart on this last point particularly i could now without hazard of a mortifying refusal or of a precipitate engagement decide add to these distinct reasons many mixed motives which acted upon me without my defining or allowing them in words i had spoken and thought with contempt of lord mowbrays chance of success but in spite of my pride in my own superiority of principle and character in spite of my confidence in berenice and in myself i had my secret very secret quailings of the heart i thought when it came to the point that it would be best to wait a little longer before i hazarded that declaration which must bring her to direct acceptance or rejection in short i determined not to throw myself at her feet precipitately i took mowbrays advice after all but i took it when i had made it my own opinion and still i rejoiced that my resistance to the arrogant manner in which lord mowbray had laid down the law of gallantry had produced that struggle of the passions in the height of which his mask had fallen off i never could decide whether the thought of becoming my rival really struck him as he said it did from the pique of the moment or whether he only seized the occasion to declare a design he had previously formed no matterwe were now declared rivals chapter xiii after our declaration of hostilities lord mowbray and i first met on neutral ground at the operamiss montenero was there we were both eager to mark our pretensions to her publicly i appeared this night to great disadvantage i certainly did not conduct myself prudentlyi lost the command of my temper lord mowbray met me with the same selfpossession the same gay careless manner which had provoked me so much during our last interview to the bystanders who knew nothing of what had passed between us his lordship must have appeared the pink of courtesy the perfection of gentlemanlike ease and goodhumour whilst i unable to suppress symptoms of indignation of contempt and perhaps of jealousy appeared in striking contrast captious haughty and at best incomprehensible mr montenero looked at me with much surprise and some concern in miss monteneros countenance i thought i saw more concern than surprise she was alarmedshe grew pale and i repented of some haughty answer i had made to lord mowbray in maintaining a place next to her which he politely ceded to my impetuosity he seated himself on the other side of her in a place which if i had not been blinded by passion i might have seen and taken as quietly as he did i was more and more vexed by perceiving that mr montenero appeared to be with all his penetration duped this night by mowbrays show of kindness towards me he whispered once or twice to mr montenero and they seemed as if they were acting in concert both observing that i was out of temper and lord mowbray showing mr montenero how he bore with me in fact i desired nothing so much as an opportunity of quarrelling with him and he though determined to put me ostensibly and flagrantly in the wrong desired nothing better than to commence his operation by the eclat of a duel if miss montenero had understood her business as a heroine a duel as every body expected must have taken place between us in consequence of the happy dispositions in which we both were this night nothing but the presence of mind and unexpected determination of miss montenero could have prevented it i sat regretting that i had given a moments pain or alarm to her timid sensibility while i observed the paleness of her cheek and a tremor in her under lip which betrayed how much she had been agitated some talking lady of the party began to give an account soon afterwards of a duel in high life which was then the conversation of the day lord mowbray and i were both attentive and so was miss montenero when she observed that our attention was fixed and when there was a pause in the conversation in which her low voice could be distinctly heard she conquering her extreme timidity and with a calmness that astonished us all said that she did not pretend to be a judge of what gentlemen might think right or wrong about duels but that for her own part she had formed a resolutionan unalterable resolution never to marry a man who had fought a duel in which he had been the challenger her father who was behind her leaned forward and asked what his daughter saidshe deliberately repeated her words that instant i recovered perfect command of temperi resolved that at all events i never would be the person to give the challenge and lord mowbray at the same instant i believe resolved that i should if he could so manage it without appearing to be the aggressor we were both of us firmly convinced that miss montenero was in earnest the manner in which she spoke and the strong evidence of her power over herself at this moment impressed us completely with this conviction a young lady a stranger in london averse from appearing infinitely more averse from speaking before numbers who when all eyes and some of them no friendly eyes were fixed upon her could so far conquer her excessive susceptibility to the opinion of others as to pronounce in such circumstances such a new and extraordinary determination was certainly to be deemed capable of abiding by her resolution she was much blamed i heard afterwards for the resolution and more for the declaration it was said to be quite unfit for a lady and particularly for so young a lady till swords were actually drawn she should never have thought of such a thing then to presume that she or her fortune were of such consequence that her declaration could influence gentlemencould have any effect on lord mowbray he did her a vast deal too much honour in paying her any of those attentions which every body knew meant nothinga jewess too miss montenero never afterwards spoke on the subject the effect she desired was produced and no other power i am persuaded could have been sufficient to have made me preserve command of myself during my daily hourly trials of temper in those contentions for her favour which ensued lord mowbray by every secret art that could pique my pride my jealousy or my love endeavoured to provoke me to challenge him at first this struggle in my mind was violenti had reason to fear my rivals address and practised powers of pleasing he used his utmost skill and that skill was great he began by exerting all his wit humour and vivacity to entertain in conversation while i with a spell over my faculties could not produce to advantage any one thing i knew or had ever known what became of my ideas i know not but i was sensible of my being very stupid and disagreeable aware of the contrast aware that miss montenero saw and felt it i grew ten times worse more silent and more stupid mowbray happy and confident went on secure of victory he was an excellent actor and he was now to act falling in love which he did by such fine degrees and with a nicety of art which so exquisitely imitated nature that none but the most suspicious or the most practised could have detected the counterfeit from being the most entertaining lively man in london lord mowbray became serious grave and sentimental from being a gallant gay lothario he was reformed likely to make the best husband in the world provided he marry the woman he loves and who has influence over him sufficient to make his reformation last for life this lord mowbray in every possible form of insinuation gave miss montenero to understand was precisely her case and his she had first he said given him a taste for refined female society disgusted him with his former associates especially with the women of whom he could not now bear to think he had quarrelled withparted with all his mistresseshis jessica the best belovedparted from irrevocably this was dropped with propriety in conversation with mr montenero the influence of a virtuous attachment is well known the effects on lord mowbray were as he protested wonderful he scarcely knew himselfindeed i scarcely knew him though i had been as it were behind the scenes and had seen him preparing for his character though he knew that i knew that he was acting yet this never disconcerted him in the slightest degreenever gave him one twinge of conscience or hesitation from shame in my presence whenever i attempted openlyi was too honourable and he knew i was too honourable to betray his confidence or to undermine him secretlywhenever i attempted openly to expose him he foiled mehis cunning was triumphant and the utmost i could accomplish was in the acme of my indignation to keep my temper and recollect miss monteneros resolution though she seemed not at first in the least to suspect lord mowbrays sincerity she was as i rejoiced to perceive little interested by his professions she was glad he was reformed for his sake but for her own part her vanity was not flattered there seemed to be little chance on this plea of persuading her to take charge of him for life my heart beat again with hopehow i admired herand i almost forgave lord mowbray my indignation against him i must own was not always as steadily proportioned to his deserts as for the sake of my pride and consistency i could wish to represent it in recording this part of the history of my life truth obliges me to acknowledge that my anger rose or fell in proportion to the degree of fear i felt of the possibility of his success whenever my hope and my confidence in myself increased i found it wonderfully easy to command my temper but my rival was a man of infinite resource when one mode of attack failed he tried another vanity in some form he was from experience convinced must be the ruling passion of the female heartand vanity is so accessible so easily managed miss montenero was a stranger a jewess just entering into the fashionable worldjust doubting as he understood whether she should make london her future residence or return to her retirement in the wilds of america lord mowbray wished to make her sensible that his public attentions would bring her at once into fashion and though his mother the prejudiced lady de brantefield could not be prevailed upon to visit a jewess yet his lordship had a vast number of high connexions and relations to all of whom he could introduce mr and miss montenero lady anne mowbray indeed unaccountably persisted in saying every where that she was certain her brother had no more thought of the jewess than of the queen of the gipsies whenever she saw miss montenero in public her ladyship had among her own set a neverfailing source of sarcasm and ridicule in the spanish fashion of miss monteneros dress especially her long veilsveils were not then in fashion and lady anne of course pronounced them to be hideous it was at this time in england the reign of high heads a sort of triangular cushion or edifice of horsehair suppose nine inches diagonal three inches thick by seven in height called i believe a toque or a system was fastened on the female head i do not well know how with black pins a quarter of a yard long and upon and over this system the hair was erected and crisped and frizzed and thickened with soft pomatum and filled with powder white brown or red and made to look as like as possible to a fleece of powdered wool which battened down on each side of the triangle to the face then there were things called curlsnothing like what the poets understand by curls or ringlets but layers of hair first stiffened and then rolled up into hollow cylinders resembling sausages which were set on each side of the system artillery tier above tier two or three of the sausages dangling from the ear down the neck the hair behind natural and false plastered together to a preposterous bulk with quantum sufficit of powder and pomatum was turned up in a sort of great bag or club or chignonthen at the top of the mount of hair and horsehair was laid a gauze platform stuck full of little red daisies from the centre of which platform rose a plume of feathers a full yard highor in lieu of platform flowers and feathers there was sometimes a flycap or a wingcap or a pouf if any one happens to have an old pocketbook for a single glance at the plate of fashionable heads for that year will convey a more competent idea of the same than i unknowing in the terms of art can produce by the most elaborate description suffice it for me to observe that in comparison with this headdress to which in my liberality and respect for departed fashion i forbear to fix any of the many epithets which present themselves the spanish dress and veil worn by miss montenero associated as it was with painting and poetry did certainly appear to me more picturesque and graceful in favour of the veil i had all the poets from homer and hesiod downwards on my side and moreover i was backed by the opinion of the wisest of men who has pronounced that a veil addeth to beauty armed with such authority and inspired by love i battled stoutly with lady anne upon several occasions especially one night when we met at the pantheon i was walking between lady emily b and miss montenero and two or three times as we went round the room we met lady anne mowbray and her party and every time we passed i observed scornful glances at the veil berenice was too wellbred to suspect illbreeding in others she never guessed what was going forward till one of the youngest and boldest of these highborn vulgarians spoke so loud as she passed and pronounced the name of montenero and the word jewess so plainly that both miss montenero and lady emily b could not avoid hearing what was said lord mowbray was not with us i took an opportunity of quitting the ladies as soon as general b who had left us for a few minutes returned i went to pay my compliments to lady anne mowbray and as delicately as i could remonstrated against their proceedings i said that her ladyship and her party were not aware i was sure how loudly they had spoken lady anne defended herself and her companions by fresh attacks upon the veil and upon the lady who had done vastly well to take the veil in the midst of the nonsense which lady anne threw out there now and then appeared something that was a little like her brother mowbrays witlittle bits of sparkling things mica not ore i was in no humour to admire them and her ladyship took much offence at a general observation i made that people of sense submit to the reigning fashion while others are governed by it we parted this night so much displeased with each other that when we met again in public we merely exchanged bows and curtsiesin private we had seldom met of latei never went to lady de brantefields i was really glad that the battle of the veil had ended in this cessation of intercourse between us as soon as miss montenero found that her spanish dress subjected her to the inconvenience of being remarked in public she laid it aside i thought she was right in so doingand in three days time though i had at first regretted the picturesque dress i soon became accustomed to the change so easily does the eye adapt itself to the fashion so quickly do we combine the idea of grace and beauty with whatever is worn by the graceful and the beautiful and i may add so certainly do we learn to like whatever is associated with those we love the change of dress which berenice had so prudently adopted did not however produce any change in the manners of lady anne and of her party lady anne it was now evident had taken an unalterable dislike to miss montenero i am not coxcomb enough to imagine that she was jealous i know that she never had the slightest regard for me and that i was not the sort of man whom she could like but still i had been counted perhaps by others in the list of her admirers and i was a young man and an admirer the less was always to be regretteddeserting to a jewess as she said was intolerable but i believe she was also secretly afraid that her brother was more in earnest in his attentions to miss montenero than she affected to suppose possible from whatever cause she certainly hated berenice cordially and took every means of mortifying me by the display of this aversion i shall not be at the trouble of recording the silly and petty means she took to vex i was not surprised at any thing of this sort from her ladyship but i was much surprised by her brothers continuing to be absolutely blind and deaf to her proceedings it is true sometimes it happened that he was not present but this was not always the case and i was convinced that it could not be from accident or inadvertency that it must be from settled design that he persisted in this blindness combining my observations i discovered that he wanted to make miss montenero feel how impossible it was for her to escape the ridicule of certain fashionable impertinents and how impracticable it would be to get on among people of the ton in london without the aid of such a champion as himself one day he suddenly appeared to discover something of what was going forward and assumed great indignation then affecting to suppress that feeling wished to heaven he were authorized to speakand there he pausedbut no inclination to authorize him appeared i had sometimes seen miss montenero distressed by the rude manner in which she had been stared at i had seen her colour come and go but she usually preserved a dignified silence on such occasions once and but once i heard her advert to the subject in speaking to her father when lord mowbray was not present you see i hope my dear father said she that i am curing myself of that morbid sensibility that excessive susceptibility to the opinion of others with which you used to reproach me i have had some good lessons and you have had some good trials of me since we came to england how much i am obliged to those persons or those circumstances which have done what i thought was impossible which have raised my daughter in my opinion said her father the look of affectionate approbation with which these words were pronounced and the grateful delight with which berenice heard them convinced me that lord mowbray had completely mistaken his groundhad mistaken strong sensibility for weakness of mind it now appeared to my entire satisfaction that miss montenero was really and truly above the follies and the meanness of fashion she did not wish to be acquainted with these fine people nor to make a figure in public but she did wish to see the best society in london in order to compare it with what she had been accustomed to in other countries and to determine what would be most for her future happiness through the friendship of general b and his family she had sufficient opportunities of seeing in public and enjoying in private the best society in london lord mowbray therefore had no power over her as a leader of fashion his general character for being a favourite with the ladies and his gallant style of conversation did not make the impression upon her that he had expected he did not know how to converse with one who could not be answered by a play upon words nor satisfied by an appeal to precedents or the authority of numbers and of high names lord chesterfields style of conversation and that of any of the personages in xenophons cyropaedia could not be more different or less compatible than the simplicity of miss montenero and the wit of lord mowbray i never saw any one so puzzled and provoked as was this man of wit by a character of genuine simplicity he was as much out of his element with such a character as any of the french lovers in marmontels tales would be ttette with a roman or a grecian matronas much at a loss as one of the fine gentlemen in congreves plays might find himself if condemned to hold parley with a heroine of sophocles or of euripides lord mowbray a perfect proteus when he wished to please changed his manner successively from that of the sentimental lover to that of the polite gallant and accomplished man of the world and when this did not succeed he had recourse to philosophy reason and benevolence no hint which cunning and address could improve to his purpose was lost upon mowbray mrs coates had warned me that miss montenero was touchy on the jewish chapter and his lordship was aware it was as the champion of the jews that i had first been favourably represented by jacob and favourably received by mr montenero soon lord mowbray appeared to be deeply interested and deeply read in very thing that had been written in their favour he rummaged over tovey and ockley and priestleys letters to the jews and the letters of certain jews to m de voltaire were books which he now continually quoted in conversation with great address he wondered that he had never happened to meet with them till lately and confessed that he believed he never should have thought of reading them but that really the subject had of late become so interesting of voltaires illiberal attacks upon the jews and of the king of prussias intolerance towards them he could not express sufficient detestation nor could he ever adequately extol cumberlands benevolent jew or lessings nathan the wise quotations from one or the other were continually in readiness uttered with all the air of a man so deeply impressed with certain sentiments that they involuntarily burst from him on every occasion this i could also perceive to be an imitation of what he had seen suceed with me and i was not a little flattered by observing that berenice was unconsciously pleased if not caught by the counterfeit the affectation was skilfully managed with a dash of his own manner and through the whole preserving an air of nature and consistency so that he had all the appearance of a person whose understanding naturally liberal had on one particular subject been suddenly warmed and exalted by the passion of love it has often been said that liars have need of good memories mowbray had really an excellent memory but yet it was not sufficient for all his occasions he contradicted himself sometimes without perceiving it but not without its being perceived intent upon one point he laboured that admirably but he sometimes forgot that any thing could be seen beyond that pointhe forgot the bearings and connexions he never forgot his liberality about the jews and about every thing relative to hebrew ground but on other questions in which he thought mr montenero and his daughter had no concern his party spirit and his want of toleration for other sects broke out one day a rabbi came to mr monteneros while we were there to solicit his contribution towards the building or repairing a synagogue the priest was anxious to obtain leave to build on certain lands which belonged to the crown these lands were in the county where lord mowbrays or lady de brantefields property lay with the most engaging liberality of manner lord mowbray anticipated the wishes of the jewish priest declaring that he was happy on this occasion publicly and practically to show his principles of toleration he would immediately use whatever influence he might possess with government to obtain the desired grant and if that application should fail there was still a resource in future at present unfortunately his mothers opinions differing from his own nothing could be done but he could in future offer a site for a synagogue in the very part of the country that was desired on lands that must in time be his the priest was down to the ground bowing full of acknowledgments and admiration of his lordships generosity and liberality of principle a few minutes afterwards however his lordship undid all he had done with berenice and with her father by adding that he regretted that his mother had given a lease of a bit of land to some confounded dissenters he was determined he said whenever the estate should come into his own hands to break that leasehe would have no meetinghouse no dissenting chapel on his estatehe considered them as nuisanceshe would raze the chapel to the groundhe would much rather have a synagogue on that spot lord mowbray walked to the window with the jewish priest who was eager to press his own point while his lordship was in the humour mowbray looked back for mr montenero but to his evident mortification neither mr montenero nor berenice followed to this consultation mr montenero turned to me and with a peculiar look of his an expression of grave humour and placid penetration said did you ever hear mr harrington of a sect of jews called the caraites never sir the caraites are what we may call jewish dissenters lord mowbrays notions of toleration remind me of the extraordinary liberality of one of our rabbies who gave it as his opinion that if a caraites and a christian were drowning we jews ought to make a bridge of the body of the caraite for the purpose of saving the christian berenice smiled and i saw that my fears of her being duped by mock philanthropy were vain lord mowbray was soon tired of his colloquy with the priest and returned to us talking of the hebrew chanting at some synagogue in town which he had lately visited and which he said was the finest thing he had ever heard a jewish festival was in a few days to be celebrated and i determined i said to go on that day to hear the chanting and to see the ceremony in the countenance of berenice to whom my eyes involuntarily turned as i spoke i saw an indefinable expression on which i pondered and finished by interpreting favourably to my wishes i settled that she was pleased but afraid to show this too distinctly lord mowbray regretted what i certainly did not in the least regret that he should be on duty at windsor on the day of this festival i was the more determined to be at the synagogue and there accordingly i went punctually but to my disappointment berenice did not appear mr montenero saw me come in and made room for me near him the synagogue was a spacious handsome building not divided into pews like our churches but open like foreign churches to the whole congregation the women sat apart in a gallery the altar was in the centre on a platform raised several steps and railed round within this railed space were the highpriest and his assistants the highpriest with his long beard and sacerdotal vestments struck me as a fine venerable figure the service was in hebrew but i had a book with a translation of it all i recollect are the men and womens thanksgivings blessed art thou o everlasting king that thou hast not made me a woman the womans lowly response is blessed art thou o lord that thou hast made me according to thy will but of the whole ceremony i must confess that i have but a very confused recollection many things conspired to distract my attention whether it was that my disappointment at not seeing berenice indisposed me to be pleased or whether the chanting was not this day or at this synagogue as fine as usual it certainly did not answer my expectations however pleasing it might be to other ears to mine it was discordant and i was afraid that mr montenero should perceive this i saw that he observed me from time to time attentively and i thought he wanted to discover whether there was within me any remains of my old antipathies upon this subject i knew he was peculiarly susceptible under this apprehension i did my utmost to suppress my feelings and the constraint became mentally and corporeally irksome the ceremonials which were quite new to me contributed at once to strain my attention and to increase the painful confusion of my mind i felt relieved when the service was over but when i thought that it was finished all stood still as if in expectation and there was a dead silence i saw two young children appear from the crowd way was made for them to the altar they walked slowly hand in hand and when they had ascended the steps and approached the altar the priest threw over them a white scarf or vestment and they kneeled and raising their little hands joined them together in the attitude of supplication they prayed in silence they were orphans praying for their father and mother whom they had lately lost mr montenero told me that it is the jewish custom for orphans during a year after the death of their parents to offer up at the altar on every public meeting of their synagogue this solemn commemoration of their loss while the children were still kneeling a man walked silently round the synagogue collecting contributions for the orphans i looked and saw as he came nearer to me that this was jacob just as i had taken out my purse i was struck by the sight of a face and figure that had terrible power over my associationsa figure exactly resembling one of the most horrible of the jewish figures which used to haunt me when i was a child the face with terrible eyes stood fixed opposite to me i was so much surprised and startled by this apparition that a nervous tremor seized me in every limb i let the purse which i had in my hand fall upon the ground mr montenero took it up again and presented it to me asking me in a very kind voice if i was ill i recollected myselfwhen i looked again the figure had disappeared in the crowd i had no reason to believe that mr montenero saw the cause of my disorder he seemed to attribute it to sudden illness and hastened to get out of the synagogue into the fresh air his manner on this occasion was so kind towards me and the anxiety he showed about my health so affectionate that all my fears of his misinterpreting my feelings vanished and to me the result of all that had passed was a firmer conviction than i had ever yet felt of his regard it was evident i thought that after all the disadvantages i had had on some points and after all the pains that lord mowbray had taken to please mr montenero far preferred me and was interested in the highest degree about my health and about every thing that concerned me nevertheless lord mowbray persevered in showing the most profound respect for mr montenero by acting an increasing taste for his conversation deference for his talents and affection for his virtues this certainly succeeded better with berenice than any thing else his lordship had tried but when he found it please he overdid it a little the exaggeration was immediately detected by berenice the heart easily detects flattery once when lord mowbray praised her father for some accomplishment which he did not possessfor pronouncing and reading english remarkably wellhis daughters glance at the flatterer expressed indignation suddenly extinguished by contempt detected and baffled he did not well know how by a woman whom he considered as so much his inferior in ability and address lord mowbray found it often difficult to conceal his real feelings of resentment and then it was that he began to hate her i who knew his countenance too well to be deceived by his utmost command of face saw the evil turn of the eyesaw looks from time to time that absolutely alarmed melooks of hatred malice vengeance suddenly changed to smiles submission and softness of demeanour though extremely vain and possessed with an opinion that no woman could resist him yet with his understanding and his experience in gallantry i could not conceive it possible that after all the signs and tokens he had seen he should persist in the hope of succeeding he was certainly aware that i was preferred i knew it to be natural that jealousy and anger should increase with fears and doubts of success and yet there was something incomprehensible in the manner which before mr montenero he now adopted towards me he appeared at once to yield the palm to me and yet to be resolved not to give up the contest he seemed as if he was my rival against his will and my friend if i would but permit it he refrained with ostentatious care from giving me any provocation checking himself often and drawing back with such expressions as theseif it were any other man upon earthbut mr harrington might say and do what he pleasedin any other circumstances he could not hazard contradicting or quarrelling with him indeed he could never forget then he would look at berenice and at mr montenero and they would look as if they particularly approved of his conduct berenice softened towards him and i trembled as she softened towards him i fancied she became graver and more reserved towards me i was more provoked by the new tone of sentimental regret from mowbray than i had been by any of his other devices because i thought i saw that it imposed more than any thing else had done on berenice and mr montenero and because i knew it to be so utterly false once as we were going down stairs together after i had disdainfully expressed my contempt of hypocrisy and my firm belief that my plain truth would in the end prevail with berenice against all his address he turned upon me in sudden anger beyond his power to control and exclaimed nevershe never shall be yours it appeared as if he had some trick yet in storesome card concealed in his hand with which he was secure at last of winning the game i pondered and calculated but i could not make out what it could be one advantage as he thought it i was aware he had over mehe had no religious scruples he could therefore manage so as to appear to make a great sacrifice to love when in fact it would cost his conscience nothing one evening he began to talk of sir charles grandison and clementinahe blamed sir charles grandison he declared that for his part there was nothing he would not sacrifice to a woman he loved i looked at miss montenero at that instantour eyes metshe blushed deeplywithdrew her eyes from meand sighed during the remainder of the evening she scarcely spoke to me or looked toward me she appeared embarrassed and as i thought displeased lord mowbray was in high spiritshe seemed resolved to advancei retired earlier than usual lord mowbray stayed and seized the moment to press his own suit he made his proposalhe offered to sacrifice religionevery thing to love he was refused irrevocably i know nothing of the particulars nor should i have known the fact but for his own intemperance of resentment it was not only his vanityhis mortified exasperated vanitythat suffered by this refusal it was not only on account of his rivalship with me that he was vexed to the quick his interest as much as his vanity had suffered i did not know till this night how completely he was ruined he had depended upon the fortune of the jewess what resource for him nownone in this condition like one of the indian gamblers when they have lost all and are ready to run amuck on all who may fall in their way he this night late made his appearance at a club where he expected to find me fortunately i was not there but a gentleman who was gave me an account of the scene disappointed at not finding me with whom he had determined to quarrel he supped in absolute silencedrank hasty and deep draughts of winethen burst out into abuse of mr and miss montenero and challenged any body present to defend them he knew that several of their acquaintances were in company but all seeing that from the combined effects of passion and wine he was not in his senses suffered him to exhale his fury without interruption or contradiction then he suddenly demanded the reason of this silence and seemingly resolved to force some one into a quarrel footnote strange as it may appear this representation is true he began by the gentleman next to him and said the most offensive and provoking things he could think of to himand to each in turn but all laughed and told him they were determined not to quarrel with himthat he must take fourandtwenty hours to cool before they would take notice of any thing he should say his creditors did not give him fourandtwenty hours time a servant before whom he had vented his rage against the jewess comprehended that all his hopes of her were over and gave notice to the creditors who kept him in their pay for that purpose mowbray was obliged the next day to leave town or to conceal himself in london to avoid an arrest i heard no more of him for some timeindeed i made no inquiries i could have no farther interest concerning a man who had conducted himself so ill i only rejoiced that he was now out of my way and that he had by all his treachery and by all his artifices given me an opportunity of seeing more fully tried the excellent understanding and amiable disposition of berenice my passion was now justified by my reason my hopes were high not presumptuousnothing but the difficulty about her religion stood between me and happiness i was persuaded that the change by which i had been alarmed in miss monteneros manner towards me had arisen only from doubts of my love or from displeasure at the delay of an explicit declaration of my passion determined at all hazards now to try my fate i took my way across the square to mr montenerosacross the squareyes i certainly took the diagonal of the square chapter xiv when i arrived at mr monteneros i saw the windowshutters closed and there was an ominous stillness in the areano one answered to my knock i knocked louderi rang impatiently no footsteps were heard in the hall i pulled the bell incessantly during the space of three minutes that i was forced to wait on the steps i formed a variety of horrid imaginations at last i heard approaching sounds an old woman very deliberately opened the door lauk sir how you do ring theres not a body to be had but meall the servants is different ways gone to their friends but mr and miss montenero oh they was off by times this morningthey be gone gone i suppose my look and accent of despair struck the old woman with some pity for she added lauk sir they be only gone for a few days i recovered my breath and can you my good lady tell me where they are gone somewhere down in surreylord knowsi forget the namesbut to general somebodys general bs perhaps ay aythats it my imagination ran over in an instant all the generals family the gouty brother and the whitetoothed aidedecamp how long are they to stay at general bs can you tell me my good lady dear heart i cant tell not is how theyll cut and carve their visitingsall i know is they be to be back here in ten days or a fortnight or so i put a golden memorandum with my card into the old womans hand and she promised that the very moment mr and miss montenero should return to town i should have notice during this fortnight my anxiety was increased by hearing from mrs coates whom i accidentally met at a fruitshop that miss montenero was taken suddenly ill of a scarlet fever down in the country at general bs where as mrs coates added they could get no advice for her at all but a country apothecary which was worse than nobody mrs coates who was not an illnatured though a very illbred woman observing the terrible alarm into which she had thrown me by her intelligence declared she was quite sorry she had outed with the news so sudden upon me mrs coates now stood full in the doorway of the fruitshop so as to stop me completely from effecting my retreat and while her footman was stowing into her carriage the loads of fruit which she had purchased i was compelled to hear her go on in the following style now mr harringtonno offencebut i couldnt have conceived it was so relly over head and ears an affair with you as by your turning as pale as the tablecloth i see it relly is for there was my son peter he admired her and the alderman was not against it but then the jewess connexion was always a stumblingblock peter could not swallowand as for my lord mowbray that the town talked of so much as in love with the jewess heiressheiress says i very like but not jewess ill engage and said i from the first he is no more in love with her than i am so many of them young men of the ton is always following of them heiresses up and down for fashion or fortins sake without caring sixpence about them thati ask your pardon mr harringtonbut i thought you might in the aldermans phrase be of the same kidney but since i see tis a real downright affair of the heart i shall make it my business to call myself at your house tomorrow in my carriage nothat would look odd and you a bachelor and your people out otown but ill send my own footman with a message i promise you now let em be ever so busy if i hear any good news no need to send if it be bad for ill news flies apace evermore all the world over as peter says tom i say is the fruit all in tomoh mr harrington dont trouble yourselfyoure too polite but i always get into my coach best myself without hand or arm except it be toms a good morning siri shant forget tomorrow so live upon hopelovers farehome tom the next day mrs coates more punctual to her word than many a more polished person sent as early as it was possible to set my heart at ease about miss monteneros illness and other matters mrs coates enclosed in her note two letters which her maid had received that morning and last tuesday this was the way as mrs coates confessed that the report reached her ears the waitingmaids first letter had stated that her lady though she did not complain had a cold and sore throat coming down and this was alarming with a spotted fever in the neighbourhood mrs coatess maid had in repeating the news turned the sore throat into a spotted fever or a scarlet fever she did not rightly know which but both were said by the apothecary to be generally fatal where there was any jewish taint in the blood the waitingmaids second epistle on which mrs coates had written a sugar plum for a certain gentleman contained the good tidings that the first was all a mistake there was no spotted fever the generals own man would take his bible oath within ten miles roundand miss monteneros throat was gone offand she was come out of her room but as to spirits and good looks she had left both in st jamessquare lonon where her heart was fur certain for since she come to the country never was there such a change in any living lady young or oldquite mopedthe general and his aidedecamp and every body noticing it at dinner even to be sure if it did not turn out a match which there was some doubts of on account of the familys and the old gentlemans particular oaths and objections as she had an inkling of there would be two broken hearts lord forbidthough a jewish heart might be harder to break than anothers yet it looked likely the remainder of the letter mrs coates or her maid had very prudently torn off i was now relieved from all apprehensions of spotted fever and though i might reasonably have doubted the accuracy of all the intelligence conveyed by such a correspondent yet i could not help having a little faith in some of her observations my hopes at least rose delightfully and with my hope my ardent impatience to see berenice again at last the joyful notice of mr and miss monteneros return to town was brought to me by the old woman mr montenero admitted me the moment i called miss montenero was not at home or not visible i was shown into mr monteneros study the moment i entered the moment i saw him i was struck with some change in his countenancesome difference in his manner of receiving me in what the difference consisted i could not define but it alarmed me good heavens i exclaimed is miss montenero ill my daughter is perfectly well my dear sir thank heaven but you sir i said mr montenero am also in perfect health what alarms you i really dont well know said i endeavouring to laugh at myself and my own apprehensions but i thought i perceived some change in the expression of your countenance towards me my dear mr montenero you must know that all my life my quickness of perception of the slightest change in the countenance and manner of those i love has ever been a curse to me for my restless imagination always set to work to invent causesand my causes though ingenious unluckily seldom happened to be the real causes many a vain alarm many a miserable hour has this superfluous activity of imagination cost meso i am determined to cure myself at the moment i was uttering the determination i stopped short for i felt that i could not keep it on this occasion mr montenero sighed or i thought he sighed and there was such an unusual degree of gravity and deliberation in the mildness of his manner that i could not believe my alarm was without cause i took the chair which he placed for me and we both sat down but he looked so prepared to listen that i could not articulate there was a sudden revulsion in my spirits and all my ideas were in utter confusion mr montenero the kindness of whose manner was not changed towards me i saw pitied my confusion he began to talk of his excursion into the countryhe spoke of general b and of the whole county of surrey the words reached my ears but conveyed no ideas to my mind except the general notion that mr montenero was giving me time to recover myself i was grateful for the kind intention and somewhat encouraged by the softness of voice and look of pity but still there was something so measuredso guardedso preparedat last when he had exhausted all that he could say about the county of surrey and a dead silence threatened me i took courage and plunged into the middle of things at once i cannot remember exactly the words but what i said was to this effect mr montenero you know so much of the human heart and of my heart that you must be aware of the cause of my present embarrassment and emotion you must have seen my passion for your incomparable daughter i have seen it i owni am well aware of it mr harrington replied mr montenero in a mild and friendly tone but there was something of selfaccusation and repentance in the tone which alarmed me inexpressibly i hope my dear good sir that you do not repent of your kindness said i in having permitted me to cultivate your society in having indulged me in some hours of the most exquisite pleasure i ever yet enjoyed he sighed and i went on with vehement incoherence i hope you cannot suspect me of a design to abuse your confidence to win if it were in my power your daughters affections without your knowledge surreptitiously clandestinely she is an heiress a rich heiress i know and my circumstancesbelieve me sir i have never intended to deceive you but i waited tillthere i was wrong i wish i had abided by my own opinion i wish i had followed my first impulse believe me sir it was my first thought my first wish to speak to you of all the circumstances if i delayed it was from the fear that a precipitate declaration would have been imputed to presumption as heaven is my judge i had no other motive i abhor artifice i am incapable of the base treachery of taking advantage of any confidence reposed in me my good sir said mr montenero when at last i was forced to pause for breath why this vehemence of defence i do not accusei do not suspect you of any breach of confidence pray compose yourself calmed by this assurance i recovered some presence of mind and proceeded as i thought in a most tranquil manner to express my regret at all events that i should not have been the first person to have explained to him my unfortunate circumstances but this i said was like the rest of lord mowbrays treacherous conduct i was going on again in a tone of indignation when mr montenero again begged me to compose myself and asked to what unfortunate circumstances i alluded you do not know then you have not been informed then i did lord mowbray injustice i explained to mr montenero to what circumstances i had so unintelligibly alluded i gained courage as i went on for i saw that the history of my fathers vow of which mr montenero had evidently never heard till this moment did not shock or offend him as i had expected that it would with the most philosophic calmness and benevolence he said that he could forgive my father for his prejudices the more readily because he was persuaded that if he had ever become known to my father it would not have been impossible to conquer this prepossession i sighed for i was convinced this was a vain hope there was some confusion in the tenses in mr monteneros sentence too which i did not quite like or comprehend he seemed as if he were speaking of a thing that might have been possible at some time that was now completely past i recollect having a painful perception of this one instant and the next accounting for it satisfactorily by supposing that his foreign idiom was the cause of his confusion of speech after a pause he proceeded fortune said he is not an object to me in the choice of a soninlaw considering the very ample fortune which my daughter will possess i am quite at ease upon that point still though he had cleared away the two first great obstacles i saw there was some greater yet unnamed i thought it was the difference of our religion we were both silent and the difficulty seemed to me at this moment greater and more formidable than it had ever yet appeared while i was considering how i should touch upon the subject mr montenero turned to me and said i hate all mysteries and yet i cannot be perfectly explicit with you mr harrington as far as i possibly can however i will speak with opennesswith sincerity you may depend upon it i have always spoken and ever shall speak you must have perceived that your company is particularly agreeable to me your manners your conversation your liberal spirit and the predilection you have shown for my societythe politeness the humanity you showed my daughter the first evening you metand the partiality for her which a fathers eye quickly perceived that you felt altogether won upon my heart my regard for you has been strengthened and confirmed by the temper prudence and generosity i have seen you evince towards a rival i have studied your character and i think i know it as thoroughly as i esteem and value it if i were to choose a soninlaw after my own heart you should be the man spare me your thanksspare me this joy continued he i have now only said what it was just to sayjust to you and to myself he spoke with difficulty and great emotion as he went on to say that he feared he had acted very imprudently for my happiness in permitting in encouraging me to see so much of his daughter for an obstaclehe feared an obstacle thathis voice almost failed i am aware of it said i aware of it said he looking up at me suddenly with astonishment he repeated more calmly aware of it let us understand one another my dear sir i understand you perfectly cried i i am well aware of the nature of the obstacle at once i declare that i can make no sacrifice no compromise of my religious principles to my passion you would be unworthy of my esteem if you could said mr montenero i rejoice to hear this declaration unequivocally made this is what i expected from you but continued i eagerly miss montenero could be secure of the free exercise of her own religion you know my principles of tolerationyou know my habits and though between man and wife a difference of religion may be in most cases a formidable obstacle to happiness yet permit me to hope i cannot permit you to hope interrupted mr montenero you are mistaken as to the nature of the obstacle a difference of religion would be a most formidable objection i grant but we need not enter upon that subjectthat is not the obstacle to which i allude then of what nature can it be some base slanderlord mowbraynothing shall prevent me cried i starting up furiously gentlycommand yourself and listen to reason and truth said mr montenero laying his hand on my arm am i a man do you think to listen to base slander or if i had listened to any such could i speak to you with the esteem and confidence with which i have just spoken could i look at you with the tenderness and affection which i feel for you at this instant oh mr montenero said i you know how to touch me to the heart but answer me one only one questionhas lord mowbray any thing to do with this whatever it is i have not seen or heard from him since i saw you last your word is sufficient said i then i suspected him unjustly heaven forbid said mr montenero that i should raise suspicion in a mind which till now i have always seen and thought to be above that meanness the torture of suspense i must inflict but inflict not on yourself the still worse torture of suspicionask me no farther questionsi can answer nonetime alone can solve the difficulty i have now to request that you will never more speak to me on this subject as soon as my own mind is satisfied depend upon it i shall let you know it in the mean time i rely upon your prudence and your honour that you will not declare your attachment to my daughter that you will take no means direct or indirect to draw her into any engagement or to win her affections in short i wish to see you here as a friend of minenot a suitor of hers if you are capable of this necessary selfcontrol continue your visits but if this effort be beyond your power i charge you as you regard her happiness and your own see her no more consider well before you decide i had confidence in my own strength of mind and honour i knew that want of resolution was not the defect of my character difficult as the conditions were i submitted to themi promised that if mr montenero permitted me to continue my visits i would strictly comply with all he desired the moment i had given this promise i was in haste to quit the room lest berenice should enter before i had time to recover from the excessive agitation into which i had been thrown mr montenero followed me to the antechamber my daughter is not at homeshe is taking an airing in the park one word more before we partone word more before we quit this painful subject said he do not my dear young friend waste your time your ingenuity in vain conjecturesyou will not discover that which i cannot impart nor would the discovery if made diminish the difficulty or in the least add to your happiness though it might to your misery it depends not on your will to remove the obstacleby no talents no efforts of yours can it be obviated one thing and but one is in your powerto command your own mind command my own mind oh mr montenero how easy to sayhow difficult to command the passionssuch a passion i acknowledge it is difficult but i hope it is not impossible we have now an opportunity of judging of the strength of your mind the firmness of your resolution and your power over yourself of these we must see proofswithout these you never could be either with my consent or by her own choice accepted by my daughter even if no other obstacle intervenedadieu a bright idea a sudden ray of hope darted into my mind it might be all intended for a trial of methere was perhaps no real obstacle but this was only the hope of an instantit was contradicted by mr monteneros previous positive assertion i hurried home as fast as possible shut myself up in my own room and bolted the door that i might not be interrupted i sat down to thinki could not think i could only feel the first thing i did was as it were to live the whole of the last hour over againi recollected every word recalled every look carefully to impress and record them in my memory i felt that i was not at that moment capable of judging but i should have the means the facts safe for a calmer hour i repeated my recollections many times pausing and forming vague and often contradictory conjectures then driving them all from my mind and resolving to think no more on this mysterious subject but on no other subject could i thinki sat motionless how long i remained in this situation i have no means of knowing but it must have been for some hours for it was evening as i remember when i wakened to the sense of its being necessary that i should exert myself and rouse my faculties from this dangerous state of abstraction since my father and mother had been in the country i had usually dined at taverns or clubs so that the servants had no concern with my hours of meals my own man was much attached to me and i should have been tormented with his attentions but that i had sent him out of the way as soon as i had come home i then went into the park walking there as fast and as long as i possibly could i returned late quite exhausted hoped i should sleep and waken with a calmer mind but i believe i had overwalked myself or my mind had been overstrainedi was very feverish this night and all the horrors of early association returned upon me whenever i began to doze i felt the nervous oppression the dreadful weight upon my chesti saw beside my bed the old figure of simon the jew but he spoke to me with the voice and in the words of mr montenero the dreams of this night were more terrible than any reality that can be conceived and even when i was broad awake i felt that i had not the command of my mind my early prepossessions and antipathies my mothers presentiments and prophecies of evil from the connexion with the monteneros the prejudices which had so long so universally prevailed against the jews occurred to me i knew all this was unreasonable but still the thoughts obtruded themselves when the light of morning returned which i thought never would return i grew better mr monteneros impressive advice and all the kindness of his look and manner recurred to my mind the whole of his conductthe filial affection of berenicethe gratitude of jacobthe attachment of friends who had known him for years all assured me of his sincerity towards myself and the fancies i will not call them suspicions of the night were dispelled i was determined not to see either mr montenero or berenice for a few days i knew that the best thing i could do would be to take strong bodily exercise and totally to change the course of my daily occupations there was an excellent ridinghouse at this time in london and i had been formerly in the habit of riding there i was a favourite with the masterhe was glad to see me again i found the exercise and the immediate necessity of suspending all other thoughts to attend to the management of my horse of sovereign use i thus disciplined my imagination at the time when i seemed only to be disciplining an arabian horse i question whether reading seneca or epictetus or any moral or philosophic writer living or dead would have as effectually medicined my mind while i was at the ridinghouse general b came in with some young officers the general who had distinguished me with peculiar kindness left the young men who were with him and walked home with me i refrained from asking any questions about mr or miss monteneros visit at his house in surrey but he led to the subject himself and spoke of her having been less cheerful than usualdwelt on his wish that she and her father should settle in englandsaid there was a young american a relation of the manessas just come over he hoped there was no intention of returning with him to america i felt a terrible twinge like what i had experienced when the general had first mentioned his brotherinlawperhaps said i to myself it may be as vain general b was going to speak further on the subject but though my curiosity was much raised i thought i was bound in honour not to obtain intelligence by any secondary means i therefore requested the general to let us change the subject he tapped my shoulder you are right said he i understand your motivesyou are righti like your principles on returning from the ridinghouse i had the pleasure of hearing that mr montenero had called during my absence and had particularly inquired from my own man after my health i forgot to mention that in one of the young officers whom i met at the ridinghouse i recognized a schoolfellow that very little boy who mounted upon the stepladder on the day of jacobs election turned the election in his favour by the anecdote of the silver pencilcase my little schoolfellow now a lath of a young man six feet high was glad to meet me again and to talk over our schoolboy days he invited me to join him and some of his companions who were going down to the country on a fishing party they promised themselves great sport in dragging a fishpond i compelled myself to join this party for the mere purpose of changing the course of my thoughts for three days i was hurried from place to place and not a single thing that i liked to do did i doi was completely put out of my own waymy ideas were forced into new channels i heard of nothing but of fishing and fishingtackleof the pleasures there would be in the shooting seasonof shootingjackets and powderhorns and guns and proof guns all this was terribly irksome at the time and yet i was conscious that it was of service to me and i endured it with heroic patience i was heartily glad when i got back to town when i felt that i was able to bear the sight of berenice i went again to mr monteneros from that hour i maintained my resolution i strictly adhered to my promise and i felt that i was rewarded by mr monteneros increasing esteem and affection my conversation was now addressed chiefly to him and i remarked that i was always the chief object of his attention i observed that berenice was much paler and not in such good spirits as formerly she was evidently under great constraint and anxiety and the expression of her countenance towards me was changed there was an apprehensiveness which she in vain endeavoured to calmher attention to whatever i was saying or doing even when she appeared to be occupied with other things was constant i was convinced that i was continually in her thoughts i felt that i was not indifferent to her yet the expression of her countenance was changedit was not loveor it was love strongly repressed by fearby fearwas it of her fathers disapprobation i had been assured by mr montenero in whom i had perfect confidence that no power of mine could remove the obstacle if it existedthen his advice was wise not to waste my thoughts and spirits in vain conjectures as far as it was in human nature i took his advice repressed my curiosity and turned my thoughts from that too interesting subject i know not how long i should have maintained my fortitude in this passive state of forbearance events soon called me again into active exertion chapter xv party spirit in politics ran very high about this time in londonit was in the year the ill success of the american war had put the people in illhumour they were ready to believe any thing against the ministry and some who for party purposes desired to influence the minds of the people circulated the most ridiculous reports and excited the most absurd terrors the populace were made to believe that the french and the papists were secret favourites of government a french invasion the appearance of the french in london is an old story almost worn out upon the imaginations of the good people of england but now came a new if not a more plausible bugbearthe pope it was confidently affirmed that the pope would soon be in london he having been seen in disguise in a goldflowered nightgown on st jamess parade at bath a poor gentleman who appeared at his door in his nightgown had been actually taken by the bath mob for the pope and they had pursued him with shouts and hunted him till he was forced to scramble over a wall to escape from his pursuers ludicrous as this may appear the farce we all know soon turned to tragedy from the smallest beginnings the mischief grew and spread halfadozen people gathered in one street and began the cry of no poperyno papistsno frenchthe idle joined the idle and the discontented the discontented and both were soon drawn in to assist the mischievous and the cowardly surprised at their own prowess when joined with numbers and when no one opposed them grew bolder and bolder monday morning mr strachan was insulted lord mansfield treated it as a slight irregularity monday evening lord mansfield himself was insulted by the mob they pulled down his house and burnt his furniture newgate was attacked next the keeper went to the lord mayor and at his return he found the prison in a blaze that night the fleet and the kings bench prisons and the popish chapels were on fire and the glare of the conflagration reached the skies i was heartily glad my father and mother were safe in the country mr montenero and berenice were preparing to go to a villa in surrey which he had just purchased but they apprehended no danger for themselves as they were inoffensive strangers totally unconnected with party or politics the fury of the mob had hitherto been directed chiefly against papists or persons supposed to favour their cause the very day before mr montenero was to leave town without any conceivable reason suddenly a cry was raised against the jews unfortunately jews rhymed to shoes these words were hitched into a rhyme and the cry was no jews no wooden shoes thus without any natural civil religious moral or political connexion the poor jews came in remainder to the ancient antigallican antipathy felt by english feet and english fancies against the french wooden shoes among the london populace however the jews had a respectable body of friends female friends of noted influence in a mobthe orangewomenwho were most of them bound by gratitude to certain opulent jews it was then and i believe it still continues to be a customary mode of charity with the jews to purchase and distribute large quantities of oranges among the retail sellers whether jews or christians the orangewomen were thus become their staunch friends one of them in particular a warmhearted irishwoman whose barrow had during the whole season been continually replenished by mr monteneros bounty and by jacobs punctual care now took her station on the steps of mr monteneros house she watched her opportunity and when she saw the master appear in the hall she left her barrow in charge with her boy came up the steps walked in and addressed herself to him thus in a dialect and tone as new almost to me as they seemed to be to mr montenero never fear jeweljew as you have this day the misfortune to be youre the best christian any way ever i happened on so never fear honey for yourself nor your daughter god bless her not a soul shall go near yees nor a finger be laid on her good or bad sure i know them allnot a mothers son o the boys but i can call my frindnot a captain or lader thats in it but i can lade dear to the devil and back again if id but whistle so only you keep quite and dont be advertising yourself any way for a jew nor be showing your cloven fut with or without the wooden shoes keep ourselves to ourselves for ill tell you a bit of a sacretim a little bit of a catolic myself all as one as what they call a papish but i keep it to myself and nobodys the wiser nor the worsetheyd tear me to pieces may be did they suspect the like but i keep never minding and you jewel do the like they call you a levite dont they then i the widow levy has a good right to advise ye we were all brothers and sisters onceno offencein the time of adam sure and we should help one another in all times tis my turn to help yees now and by the blessing so i willaccordingly ill be sitting all day and night mounting guard on your steps there without and little as you may think of me the devil a guardian angel better than myself only just the widow levy such as ye see the widow levy took her stand and kept her word i stayed at mr monteneros all day saw every thing that passed and had frequent opportunities of admiring her address she began by making the footman take down the outlandish name from off the door for no name at all sure was better nor a foreign name these times she charged the footman to say sorrow word themselves to the mob for their lives in case they would come but to lave it all entirely to her that knew how to spake to them for see said she aside to mefor see them powdered numskulls would spoil alltheyd be taking it too high or too low and never hit the right kay nor mind when to laugh or cry in the right place moreover when theyd get frighted with a crossexamination theyd be apt to be cutting themselves now the ould one himself if he had me on the table even id defy to get the truth out of me if not convanient and i in the sarvice of a frind in the pleasure of telling a few superfluous lies it seemed to be necessary that our guardian angel should be indulged and there she sat on the steps quite at ease smoking her pipe or wiping and polishing her oranges as parties of the rioters came up she would parley and jest with them and by alternate wit and humour and blunder and bravado and flattery and fabling divert their spirit of mischief and forward them to distant enterprise in the course of the day we had frequent occasion to admire her intrepid ingenuity and indefatigable zeal late at night when all seemed perfectly quiet in this part of the town she who had never stirred from her post all day was taken into the kitchen by the servants to eat some supper while she was away i was standing at an open window of the drawingroom watching and listeningall was silence but suddenly i heard a shriek and two strange female figures appeared from the corner of the square hurrying as if in danger of pursuit though no one followed them one was in black with a hood and a black cloak streaming behind the other in white neck and arms bare head full dressed with high feathers blown upright as they came near the window at which i stood one of the ladies called out mr harrington mr harrington for heavens sake let us in lady anne mowbrays voice and lady de brantefield cried i swiftly before i could pass her berenice ran down stairs unlockedthrew open the halldoor and let them in breathless trembling so that they could not speak they sunk upon the first seat they could reach the servants hearing the halldoor unchained ran into the hall and when sent away for water the three footmen returned with each something in his hand and stood with water and salvers as a pretence to satisfy their curiosity along with them came the orangewoman who wiping her mouth put in her head between the footmens elbows and stood listening and looking at the two ladies with no friendly eye she then worked her way round to me and twitching my elbow drew me back and whisperedwhat made ye let em in take care but ones a mad woman and tother a bad woman lady anne who had by this time drank water and taken hartshorn and was able to speak was telling though in a very confused manner what had happened she said that she had been dressed for the operathe carriage was at the doorher mother who was to set her down at lady somebodys who was to chaperon her had just put on her hood and cloak and was coming down stairs when they heard a prodigious noise of the mob in the street the mob had seized their carriageand had found in one of the pockets a string of beads which had been left there by the portuguese ambassadors lady whom lady de brantefield had taken home from chapel the preceding day the mob had seen the carriage stop at the chapel and the lady and her confessor get into it and this had led to the suspicion that lady de brantefield was a catholic or in their language a concealed papist on searching the carriage farther they had found a breviary and one of them had read aloud the name of a priest written in the beginning of the booka priest whose name was peculiarly obnoxious to some of the leaders as soon as they found the breviary and the rosary and this priests name the mob grew outrageous broke the carriage smashed the windows of the house and were bursting open the door when as lady anne told us she and her mother terrified almost out of their senses escaped through the back door just in the dress they were and made their way through the stables and a back lane and a cross street still hearing or fancying they heard the shouts of the mob they had run on without knowing how or where till they found themselves in this square and saw me at the open window what is it tell me dear whispered the orangewoman drawing me back behind the footman tell me for i cant understand her for looking at the figure of her tell me plain or it may be the ruen of yees all before yed know it i repeated lady annes story and from me the orangewoman understood it and it seemed to alarm her more than any of us but are they romans roman catholics said she how is that when theyre not irishfor ill swear to their not being irish tongue or pluck i dont believe but theyre impostorsno right romans sorrow bit of the likes but howsomdever no signs of none following them yetthanks above get rid on em any way as smart as ye can dear tell mr montenero as all continued perfectly quiet both in the back and front of the house we were in hopes that they would not be pursued or discovered by the mob we endeavoured to quiet and console them with this consideration and we represented that if the mob should break into their house they would after they had searched and convinced themselves that the obnoxious priest was not concealed there disperse without attempting to destroy or pillage it then said lady de brantefield rising and turning to her daughter lady anne we had better think of returning to our own house though well aware of the danger of keeping these suspected ladies this night and though our guardian angel repeatedly twitched us reiterating ah let em godont be keeping em yet mr montenero and berenice pressed them in the kindest and most earnest manner to stay where they were safe lady anne seemed most willing lady de brantefield most unwilling to remain yet her fears struggled with her pride and at last she begged that a servant might be sent to her house to see how things were going on and to order chairs for her if their return was practicable stop cried the orangewoman laying a strong detaining hand on the footmans arm stop youtis ill go with more senseand speed what is that personthat woman cried lady de brantefield who now heard and saw the orangewoman for the first time womanis it me she manes said the orangewoman coming forward quite composedly shouldering on her cloak is it who i amim the widow levyany commands how did she get in continued lady de brantefield still with a look of mixed pride and terror how did she

bring ye word faithful how its going with ye at homewhich is her house and where on gods earth added she turning to the footmen if my satisfaction be the object sir or madam said lady de brantefield addressing herself with much solemnity to mr and miss montenero i must take leave to request that a fitter messenger be sent i should in any circumstances be incapable of trusting to the representations of such a person the fury of the orangewoman kindledher eyes flashed fireher arms akimbo she advanced repeating fitterfitterwhats that ye sayyoure not irishnot a bone in your skeleton lady anne screamed mr montenero forced the orangewoman back and berenice and i hurried lady de brantefield and her daughter across the hall into the eatingroom mr montenero followed an instant afterwards telling lady de brantefield that he had despatched one of his own servants for intelligence her ladyship bowed her head without speaking he then explained why the orangewoman happened to be in his house and spoke of the zeal and ability with which she had this day served us lady de brantefield continued at intervals to bow her head while mr montenero spoke and to look at her watch while lady anne simpering repeated dear how odd then placing herself opposite to a large mirror lady anne readjusted her dress that settled she had nothing to do but to recount her horrors over again her mother lost in reverie sat motionless berenice meantime while the messenger was away made the most laudable and kind efforts by her conversation to draw the attention of her guests from themselves and their apprehensions but apparently without effect and certainly without thanks at length berenice and her father being called out of the room i was left alone with lady de brantefield and lady anne the mother broke silence and turning to the daughter said in a most solemn tone of reproach anne lady anne mowbrayhow could you bring me into this house of all othersa jewswhen you know the horror i have always felt la mamma i declare i was so terrified i didnt know one house from another but when i saw mr harrington i was so delighted i never thought about its being the jews houseand what matter

old stuff at such a time as this im sure i was frightened out of my witsi forgot even my detestation ofbut i must not say that before mr harrington but now i see the house and all that i dont wonder at him so much i declare its a monstrous handsome houseas rich as a jew im sure i hope those wretches will not destroy our houseand oh the great mirror mamma mr and miss montenero returned with much concern in their countenances they announced that the messenger had brought word that the mob were actually pulling down lady de brantefields housethat the furniture had all been dragged out into the street and that it was now burning pride once more gave way to undisguised terror in lady de brantefields countenance and both ladies stood in speechless consternation before we had time to hear or to say more the orangewoman opened the door and putting in her head called out in a voice of authority jantlemen heres one wants yees admits of no delay lave all and come out whether you will or no the minute we went out and with an indescribable gesture and wink of satisfaction the moment she had mr montenero and me in the hall she said in a whisper tis only myself dears but tis i am glad i got yees out away from being bothered by the presence of them women whiles yed be settling all for life or death which we must now dofor dont be nursing and dandling yourselves in the notion that the boys

of his guests there goes as good a christian cried the widow levy holding up her forefinger and shaking it at mr montenero the moment his back was turned didnt i tell ye so from the first oh if he isnt a jewel of a jewand the daughter the same continued she following me as i walked up and down the hall the kindhearted cratur how tinder she looked at the fainting jezabelwhile the black woman

fire on the boysdisperse em with the horse asy ye can without a shot so bestill step down and feel the pulse of all below while mr montenero wrote berenice alarmed for her father stood leaning on the back of his chair in silence oh mr harrington mr harrington repeated lady anne what will become of us if colonel topham was but here do send to the opera pray pray with my complimentslady anne mowbrays complimentshell come directly im sure that my son lord mowbray should be out of town how extraordinary and how unfortunate cried lady de brantefield when we might have had his protection his regiment without applying to strangers she walked up and down the room with the air of a princess in chains the orangewoman bolted into the room and pushed past her ladyship while mr montenero was sealing his note give it jewelits ill be the bearer for all your powdered men below has taken fright by the dread the first messenger got and dares not be carrying a summons for the military through the midst of them but ill take it for yeesand which way will i go to get quickest to your generals and how will i know his housefor seven of them below bothered my brains mr montenero repeated the directionshe listened coolly then stowing the letter in her bosom she stood still for a moment with a look of deep deliberationher head on one side her forefinger on her cheekbone her thumb under her chin and the knuckle of the middlefinger compressing her lips see now theyll be apt to come up the stable lane for the back o the house and another party of them will be in the square in front so how will it be with me to get into the house to yees again without opening the doors for them in case they are wid ye afore id get the military upi have it cried she she rushed to the door but turned back again to look for her pipe which she had laid on the table wheres my pipelend it mewhat am i without my pipe the savage cried lady de brantefield the fool said lady anne the widow levy nodded to each of the two ladies as she lit the pipe again but without speaking to them turned to us and said if the boys would meet me without my pipe theyd not know me or smell something odd and guess i was on some unlawful errand as she passed berenice and me who were standing together she hastily added keep a good heart sweetestat the last push you have one will shed the hearts drop for ye a quick scarcely perceptible motion of her eye towards me marked her meaning and one involuntary look from berenice at that moment even in the midst of alarm spread joy through my whole frame in the common danger we were drawn closer togetherwe thought togetheri was allowed to help her in the midst of the general bustle it was necessary as quickly as possible to determine what articles in the house were of most value and to place these in security it was immediately decided that the pictures were inestimablewhat was to be done with them berenice whose presence of mind never forsook her and whose quickness increased with the occasion recollected that the unfinished picturegallery which had been built behind the house adjoining to the back drawingroom had no window opening to the street it was lighted by a skylight it had no communication with any of the apartments in the house except with the back drawingroom into which it was intended to open by large glass doors but fortunately these were not finished and at this time there was no access to the picturegallery but by a concealed door behind the gobelin tapestry of the back drawingrooman entrance which could hardly be discovered by any stranger in the gallery were all the plasterers trestles and the carpenters lumber however there was room soon made for the pictures all hands were in motion every creature busy and eager except lady de brantefield and her daughter who never offered the smallest assistance though we were continually passing with our loads through the front drawingroom in which the two ladies now were lady anne standing up in the middle of the room looked like an actress ready dressed for some character but without one idea of her own her mind naturally weak was totally incapacitated by fear she kept incessantly repeating as we passed and repassed bless me one would think the day of judgment was coming lady de brantefield all the time sat in the most remote part of the room fixed in a huge armchair the pictures and the most valuable things were by desperately hard work just stowed into our place of safety when we heard the shouts of the mob at once at the back and front of the house and soon a thundering knocking at the halldoor mr montenero and i went to the door of course without opening it and demanded in a loud voice what they wanted we require the papists one answered for the rest the two women papists and the priest youve got within to be given up for your lives there is no priest herethere are no papists heretwo protestant ladies strangers to me have taken refuge here and i will not give them up said mr montenero then well pull down the house the military will be here directly said mr montenero coolly you had better go away the militarythen make haste boys with the work and with a general cry of no papistsno priestsno jewsno wooden shoes they began with a volley of stones against the windows i ran to see where berenice was it had been previously agreed among us that she and her guests and every female in the house should on the first alarm retire into a back room but at the first shout of the mob lady de brantefield lost the little sense she ever possessed she did not faint but she stiffened herself in the posture in which she sat and with her hands turned down over the elbows of the huge chair on which her arms were extended she leaned back in all the frightful rigidity of a corpse with a ghastly face and eyes fixed berenice in vain tried to persuade her to move her ideas were bewildered or concentrated only the obstinacy of pride remained alive within her no she said she would never move from that spotshe would not be commanded by jew or jewess dont you hear the mobthe stones at the windows very well they would all pay for it on the scaffold or the gibbet but if they break in here you will be torn to pieces nothose only will be sacrificed who have sacrificed a de brantefieldthey dare noti shall not stir from this spot who will presume to touch lady de brantefield mr montenero and i lifted up the huge chair on which she sat and carried her and it into the back room the door of this room was scarcely shut and the tapestry covering but just closed over the entrance into the picturegallery when there was a cry from the hall and the servants came rushing to tell us that one of the windowshutters had given way mr montenero putting the pistols into my hand took the gun ran down stairs and stationed himself so as to defend the entrance to the window at which the people were pelting with stones declaring that he would fire on the first man who should attempt to enter a man leaped in and in the struggle mr monteneros gun was wrested from him on my presenting a pistol the man scrambled out of the window carrying away with him the prize he had seized at this moment the faithful jacob appeared amongst us as if by miracle master we are safe said he if we can defend ourselves for a few minutes the orangewoman delivered your letter and the military are coming she told me how to get in here through the house that is building next door from the leads of which i crept through a trapdoor into your garret with the pistols and with the assistance of the servants who were armed some of them with swords and others with whatever weapons came to hand we made such a show of resistance as to keep the mob at bay for some moments hark cried jacob thank heaven theres the military there was a sudden cessation of stones at the window we heard the joyful sound of the horses hoofs in the street a prodigious uproar ensued then gradually subsided the mob was dispersed and fled in different directions and the military followed we heard them gallop off we listened till not a sound either of human voice or of horses foot was to be heard there was perfect silence and when we looked as far as our eyes could reach out of the broken window there was not a creature to be seen in the square or in the line of street to which it opened we ran to let out our female prisoners i thought only of bereniceshe who had shown so much selfpossession during the danger seemed most overpowered at this moment of joy she threw her arms round her father and held him fast as if to convince herself that he was safe her next look was for me and in her eyes voice and manner when she thanked me there was an expression which transported me with joy but it was checked it was gone the next moment some terrible recollection seemed to cross her mind she turned from me to speak to that odious lady de brantefield i could not see mr monteneros countenance for he at the same instant left us to single out from the crowd assembled in the hall the poor irishwoman whose zeal and intrepid gratitude had been the means of our deliverance i was not time enough to hear what mr montenero said to her or what reward he conferred but that the reward was judicious and that the words were grateful to her feelings in the highest degree i had full proof for when i reached the hall the widow was on her knees with hands uplifted to heaven unable to speak but with tears streaming down her hard face she wiped them hastily away and started up its not a little thing brings me to this said she none ever drew a tear from my eyes afore since the boy i lost she drew the hood of her cloak over her head and pushed her way through the servants to get out of the halldoor i unbolted and unchained it for her and as i was unlocking it she squeezed up close to me and laying her iron hand on mine said in a whisper god bless yees and dont forget my thanks to the sweet jewishi cant speak em now tis you can best and joined in my prayers ye shall ever be said our guardian angel as i opened the door and as she passed out she added you are right jewelshes worth all the fine ladies in lonon feathers an all in a bag i had long been entirely of the widow levys opinion though the mode of expression would never have occurred to me what afterwards became of lady anne and of her mother this night i do not distinctly recollect lady de brantefield when the alarm was over i believe recovered her usual portion of sense and lady anne her silly spirits but neither of them i know showed any feeling except for themselves i have an image of lady de brantefield standing up and making at parting such ungracious acknowledgments to her kind hostess and generous protector as her pride and her prejudices would permit both their ladyships seemed to be in a hurry to get out of the house and i know that i rejoiced in their departure i was in hopes of one moment one explanatory word or look from berenice she was retiring to her own apartment as i returned with her father after putting those two women into their carriage i am now quite convinced said mr montenero smiling that mr harrington never could have been engaged or attached to lady anne mowbray is it possible you ever imagined i did not imagine i only heard and believedand now i have seen and i disbelieve and is this the obstacle the invincible obstacle cried i berenice sighed and walked on to her room i wish it were said mr montenero but i pray you sir do not speak do not think of this tonightfarewell we all want repose i did not think that i wanted repose till the moment i lay down in bed and then overpowered with bodily fatigue i fell into a profound sleep from which i did not awaken till late the next morning when my man drawing back my curtains presented to me a note fromi could hardly believe my eyesfrom miss montenerofrom berenice i started up and read these words written in pencil my father is in dangercome to us how quick i was in obeying may be easily imagined i went well armed but in the present danger arms were of no use i found that mr montenero was summoned before one of the magistrates on a charge of having fired from his window the preceding night before the riot act had been readof having killed an inoffensive passenger now the fact was that no shot had ever been fired by mr montenero but such was the rage of the people at the idea that the jew had killed a christian and one of their party that the voice of truth could not be heard they followed with execrations as he was carried before the magistrate and waited with impatience assembled round the house in hopes of seeing him committed to prison to take his trial for murder as i was not ignorant of the substantial nature of the defence which the spirit and the forms of english law provide in all cases for truth and innocence against false accusation and party prejudice i was not alarmed at the clamour i heard i was concerned only for the temporary inconvenience and mortification to mr montenero and for the alarm to berenice the magistrate before whom mr montenero appeared was an impartial and very patient man i shall not so far try the patience of others as to record all that was positively said but which could not be sworn toall that was offered in evidence but which contradicted itself or which could not be substantiated by any good witnessat length one creditablelooking man came forward against mr montenero he said he was an ironmongerthat he had been passing by at the time of the riot and had been hurried along by the crowd against his will to mr monteneros house where he saw a sailor break open the windowshutter of one of the lower roomsthat he saw a shot fired by mr montenerothat the sailor after a considerable struggle wrested the gun with which the shot had been fired from mr montenero and retreated with it from the windowthat hearing the cry of murder in the crowd he thought it proper to secure the weapon that it might be produced in evidenceand that the piece which he now produced was that which had been taken from mr montenero i perceived great concern in the countenance of the magistrate who addressing himself to mr montenero asked him what he had to say in his defence sir said mr montenero i acknowledge that to be the gun which was wrested from my hands by the sailor and i acknowledge that i attempted with that gun to defend my family and my house from immediate violence i am however continued he happy to have escaped having injured any person even in the most justifiable cause for the piece did not go off it only flashed in the pan if that be the case said the magistrate the piece is still loaded the gun was tried and it was found to be empty both of powder and ball as the magistrate returned the piece to the man i came forward and asked leave to examine it i observed to the magistrate that if the piece had been fired the inside of the barrel must retain marks of the discharge whereas on the contrary the inside of the barrel was perfectly smooth and clean to this the man replied that he had cleaned the piece when he brought it home which might indeed have been true at this moment i recollected a circumstance that i had lately heard from the officers in the country who had been talking about a fowlingpiece and of the careless manner in which firearms are sometimes proved footnote see manton on gunnery upon examination i found that what i suspected might be just possible was actually the case with respect to the piece in questionthe touchhole had never been bored through though the piece was marked as proof i never shall forget the satisfaction which appeared in the countenance of the humane magistrate who from the beginning had suspected the evidence whom he knew from former delinquency the man was indeed called an ironmonger but his was one of those old iron shops which were known to be receptacles of stolen goods of various descriptions to my surprise it now appeared that this mans name was dutton he was the very dutton who had formerly been jacobs rival and who had been under lord mowbrays protection time and intemperance had altered him so much that i had not till i heard his name the slightest recollection of his face what his motive for appearing against mr montenero might be whether it was hatred to him as being the patron of jacob whom dutton envied and detested or whether dutton was instigated by some other and higher person i shall not now stop to inquire as he had not been put upon his oath he had not been guilty of perjury he was discharged amidst the hootings of the mob notwithstanding their prejudice against the jews and their rage against a jew who had harboured as they conceived two concealed papists and a priest yet the moment an attempt to bear false witness against mr montenero appeared the people took his part in england the mob is always in favour of truth and innocence wherever these are made clearly evident to their senses pleased with themselves for their impartiality it was not difficult at this moment for me to convince them as i did that mr montenero had not harboured either papists or priest the mob gave us three cheers as we passed through the crowd i saw jacob and the orangewomanthe orangewoman with broad expanded face of joy stretched up her arms and shouted loud that all the mob might hear jacob little accustomed to sympathy and in the habit of repressing his emotions stood as one unmoved or dumb till his eyes met mine and then suddenly joy spread over his features and flashed from his dark eyesthat was a face of delight i never can forget but i could not stay i hastened to be the first to tell berenice of her fathers safety and of the proof which all the world had had of the falsehood of the charge against him i ran up to the drawingroom where she was alone she fainted in my arms and now you think that when she came to herself there was an end of all my fears all my suspenseyou think that her love her gratitude overcame the objection whatever it may be which has hitherto been called invinciblealas you are mistaken i was obliged to resign berenice to the care of her attendants a short time afterwards i received from her father the following note my obligations to you are great so is my affection for you but the happiness of my child as well as your happiness is at stake i dare not trust my gratitudemy daughter and you must never meet again or must meet to part no more i cannot yet decide if i shall be satisfied that the obstacle do not exist she shall be yours if it do exist we sail the first of next month for america and you mr harrington will not be the only or perhaps the most unhappy person of the three a montenero chapter xvi the sunday after the riots i happened to see mrs coates as we were coming out of st georges church she was not in fullblown happy importance as formerly she looked ill and melancholy or as one of her city neighbours who was following her out of church expressed it quite crestfallen i heard some whispering that things were going wrong at home with the coatessthat the world was going down hill with the alderman but a lady who was quite a stranger though she did me the honour to speak to me explained that it was no such thingworth a plum still if he be worth a farthing tis only that she was greatly put out of her way last week and frightened till well nigh beside herself by them rioters that came and set fire to one of the coatess mr peters warehouse now though poor mrs coates youd think is so plump and stout to look at she is as nervousyouve no notion sirshakes like an aspen leaf if she but takes a cup of green teaso i prescribe bohea but there shes curtsying and nodding and kissing hands to you sir seeand can tell you no doubt all about herself mrs coatess deplorably placid countenance tremulous muscles and lamentable voice and manner confirmed to me the truth of the assertion that she had been frightened nearly out of her senses why now sir after all said she i begin to find what fools we were when we made such a piece of work one election year and said that no soldiers should come into the town cause we were free britons why lord a mercy tis a great deal better maxim to sleep safe in our beds than to be free britons and burnt to death footnote vide mrs piozzis letters persons of higher pretensions to understanding and courage than poor mrs coates seemed at this time ready to adopt her maxim and patriots feared that it might become the national sentiment no sooner were order and tranquillity perfectly reestablished in the city than the public in general and party politicians in particular were intent upon the trials of the rioters and more upon the question whether the military had suppressed the riots constitutionally or unconstitutionally it was a question to be warmly debated in parliament and this after the manner in which great public and little private interests in the chain of human events are continually linked together proved of important consequence to me and my love affairs a call of the house brought my father to town contrary to his will and consequently in illhumour this illhumour was increased by the perplexing situation in which he found himself with his passions on one side of the question and his principles on the other hating the papists and loving the ministry in his secret soul my father cried with the rioters no papistsno frenchno jewsno wooden shoes but a cry against government was abhorrent to his very nature my conduct with regard to the riot at mr monteneros and towards the rioters by whom he had been falsely accused my father heard spoken of with approbation in the political circles which he most reverenced and he could not but be pleased he confessed to hear that his son had so properly conducted himself but still it was all in defence of the jews and of the father of that jewess whose very name was intolerable to his ear so harrington my boy youve gained great credit i find by your conduct last wednesday night very lucky too for your mothers friend lady de brantefield that you were where you were but after all sir what the devil business had you thereand again on thursday morningi acknowledge that was a good hit you made about the gunbut i wish it had been in the defence of some good christian what business has a jew with a gun at allgovernment knows best to be sure but i split against them once before threeandtwenty years ago on the naturalization bill what is this cry which the people set upno jewsno wooden shoesha ha hathe dogsbut they carried it too far the rascalswhen it comes to throwing stones at gentlemens carriages and pulling down gentlemens and noblemens dwellinghouses its a mob and a riot and the rioters deserve certainly to be hangedand im heartily glad my son has come forward mrs harrington and has taken a decided and distinguished part in bringing the offenders to justice but harrington pray tell me now young gentleman about that jewess before i opened my lips something in the turn of my physiognomy enraged my father to such a degree that all the blood in his body came into his face and starting up he cried dont answer me siri ask no questionsi dont want to hear any thing about the matter only ifif sirifthats all i have to sayifby jupiter ammonsir i wont hear a worda syllable you only wish to explaini wont have any explanationi have business enough on my hands without listening to a madmans nonsense my father began to open his mornings packet of letters and newspapers one letter which had been directed to his house in the country and which had followed him to town seemed to alarm him terribly he put the letter into my mothers hand cursed all the postmasters in england who were none of them to blame for its not reaching him sooner called for his hat and cane said he must go instantly to the city but feared all was too late and that we were undone with this comfortable assurance he left us the letter was from a broker in lombardstreet who did business for my father and who wrote to let him know that in consequence of the destruction of a great brewery in the late riots several mercantile houses had been injured alderman coates had died suddenly of an apoplexy it was said his house had closed on saturday and it was feared that baldwins bank would not stand the run made on it now in baldwins bank as my mother informed me my father had eight days before lodged the purchase money of that estate which he had been obliged to sell to pay for his three elections this sum was in fact every shilling of it due to creditors who had become clamorous and if this be gone said my mother we are lost indeedthis house must go and the carriages and every thing the essex estate is all we shall have left and live there as we canvery ill it must be to us who have been used to affluence and luxury your father who expects his table and every individual article of his establishment to be in the first style as if by magic without ever reflecting on the means but just inviting people and leaving it to me to entertain them properlyoh i know how bitterly he would feel even retrenchmentand this would be ruin and every thing that vexes him of late brings on directly a fit of the goutand then you know what his temper is heaven knows what i had to go through with my nerves and my delicate health during the last fit which came on the very day after we left you and lasted six weeks and which he sets down to your account harrington and to the account of your jewess i had too much feeling for my mothers present distress to increase her agitation by saying any thing on this tender subject i let her accuse me as she pleasedand she very soon began to defend me the accounts she had heard in various letters of the notice that had been taken of miss montenero by some of the leading persons in the fashionable world the proposals that had been made to her and especially the addresses of lord mowbray which had been of sufficient publicity had made i found a considerable alteration in my mothers judgment or feelings she observed that it was a pity my father was so violently prejudiced and obstinate for that after all it would not be an unprecedented marriage my mother after a pause went on to say that though she was not she hoped an interested person and should scorn the idea of her sons being a fortunehunterand indeed i had given pretty sufficient proof that i was not of that description of suitors yet if the jewess were really amiable and as capable of generous attachment it would be my mother at last acknowledged the best thing i could do to secure an independent establishment with the wife of my choice i was just going to tell my mother of the conversation that i had had with mr montenero and of the obstacle when her mind reverted to the lombardstreet letter and to baldwins bank and for a full hour we discussed the probability of baldwins standing or failing though neither of us had any means of judgingof this being perhaps the least anxious of the two i became sensible the first i finished by stationing myself at the window to watch for my fathers return of which i promised to give my mother notice if she would lie down quietly on the sofa and try to compose her spirits she had given orders to be denied to all visitors but every knock at the door made her start and theres your father theres mr harrington was fifty times repeated before the hour when it was even possible that my father could have returned from the city when the probable time came and passed when it grew later and later without my fathers appearing our anxiety and impatience rose to the highest pitch at last i gave my mother notice that i saw among the walkers at the end of the street which joined our square an elderly gentleman with a cane but there are so many elderly gentlemen with canes said my mother joining me at the window is it mr harrington it is very like my father maam now you can see him plainly picking his way over the crossing he is looking down said my mother that is a very bad signbut is he not looking up now no maam and now he is taking snuff taking snuff is he then there is some hope said my mother during the last forty yards of my fathers walk we each drew innumerable and often opposite conclusions from his slightest gestures and motions interpreting them all as favourable or unfavourable omens in the course of five minutes my mothers presentiments varied fifty times at length came his knock at the door my mother grew paleto her ear it said alls lost to mine it sounded like alls safe he stays to take off his great coat a good sign but he comes heavily up stairs our eyes were fixed on the doorhe opened it and advanced towards us without uttering one syllable alls lostand alls safe said my father my fortunes safe mrs harrington what becomes of your presentiments my dear mother said i thank heaven said my mother i was wrong for once you might thank heaven for more than once madam said my father but then what did you mean by alls lost mr harrington if alls safe how can all be lost my all mrs harrington is not all fortune there is such a thing as credit as well as fortune mrs harrington but if you have not lost your fortune you have not lost your credit i presume said my mother i have a character as a gentleman mrs harrington of course a character for consistency mrs harrington to preserve tis a hard thing to preserve no doubt said my mother but i wish youd speak plain for my nerves cant bear it then i can tell you mrs harrington your nerves have a great deal to bear yet what will your nerves feel madamwhat will your enthusiasm say sirwhen i tell you that i have lost my heart toa jewess berenice cried i impossible cried my mother how came you to see her thats not for you to know yet but first young gentleman you who are hanging on tenterhooks you must hang there a little longer as long as you please my dear father said i your dear fatheray im very dear to you now because you are in hopes sir i shall turn fool and break my vow into the bargain but i am not come to that yet my good siri have some consistency oh never mind your consistency for mercys sake mr harrington said my mother only tell us your story for i really am dying to hear it and i am so weak ring the bell for dinner said my father for mrs harringtons so weak ill keep my story till after dinner my mother protested she was quite strong and we both held my father fast insistinghe being in such excellent humour and spirits that we might insistinsisting upon his telling his story before he should have any dinner where was i said he you know best said my mother you said you had lost your heart to a jewess and harrington exclaimed berenice and thats all ive heard yet very well then let us leave berenice for the presenti groanedand go to her father mr montenero and to a certain mrs coates mrs coates did you see her too cried my mother you seem to have seen every body in the world this morning mr harrington how happened it that you saw vulgar mrs coates unless i shut my eyes how can i avoid seeing vulgar people madam and how can i tell my story mrs harrington if you interrupt me perpetually to ask how i came to see every soul and body i mention i will interrupt you no more said my mother submissively for she was curious i placed an armchair for my fatherin my whole life i never felt so dutiful or so impatient there now said my father taking his seat in the chair if you will promise not to interrupt me any more i will tell you my story regularly i went to baldwins bank i found a great crowd all pressing their demandsthe clerks as busy as they could be and all putting a good face upon the matter the headclerk i saw was vexed at the sight of mehe came out from behind his desk and begged i would go up stairs to mr baldwin who wished to speak to me i was shown up stairs to mr baldwin with whom i found a remarkably gentlemanlike foreignlooking man yes siryes maammr montenero it is well you did not either of you interrupt me to tell me his name for if you had i would not have told you a word more well mr baldwin evidently wishing me at the devil came forward to receive me and in great perplexity said he would be at my command he would settle my business immediately but must beg my pardon for five minutes while he settled with this gentleman mr montenero on hearing the name i am sure my look would have said plain enough to any man alive but baldwin that i did not choose to be introduced but baldwin has no breeding so it was mr montenero mr harringtonmr harrington mr montenero i bowed and wished the jew in the red sea and baldwin along with him i then took up a newspaper and retreated to the window begging that i might not be any interruption the cursed paper was four days old so i put it down and as i stood looking at nothing out of the window i heard baldwin going on with your jew they had a load of papers on the table which baldwin kept shuffling as he talked about the losses the house had sustained by the sudden death of alderman coates and the sad bankruptcy of the executors baldwin seasoned high with compliments to the jew upon his known liberality and generosity and was trying to get him to enter into some security which the jew refused saying that what he gave he gave willingly but he would not enter into security he added that the alderman and his family had been unjustifiably extravagant but on condition that all was given up fairly to the creditors and a new course entered upon he and his daughter would take care that the widow should be provided for properly as principal creditor mr baldwin would by this means be first satisfied i could not help thinking that all the jew said was fair enough and firm too but when he had said and done i wondered that he did not go away he and baldwin came to the window to which i had retreated and baldwin like a city bear as he is got in his awkward way between us and seizing one button of my coat and one of mr monteneros held us there face to face while he went on talking of my demand on the house you see mr harrington said he how we are circumstanced the property of the firm is able to answer all fair demands in due course but heres a set and a run made against us and no house could stand without the assistance that is the forbearance of friendsthats what we must look to some of our friends in particular mr montenero have been very friendly indeedvery handsome and liberaland we have nothing to say we cannot in reason expect him to do more for the coatess or for us and then came accounts of the executors c in his banking jargon what the deuce was all this to me you know and how awkward i felt held by the button there to rejudge mr monteneros acts i had nothing for it but my snuffbox but baldwins a mere clerkcannot guess at the feelings of a gentleman mr montenero i observed looked down upon baldwin all the time with so much the air of a highbred gentleman that i began to think he could not be the jewmontenero baldwin still thinking only of holding him up as an example to me went on saying mr montenero who is a foreigner and a stranger to the house has done so and so and we trust our old friends will do as muchmr harrington in particular theres our books on the table open to mr harringtonhe will see we shall be provided on the fifteenth instant but in short if mr harrington draws his today he drives us to pay in sixpencesso theres the case in short it came to this if i drew i certainly ruined them if i did not draw i ran a great hazard of being ruined myself no baldwin would not have it that wayso when he had stated it after his own fashion and put it into and out of his bankers jargon it came out to be that if i drew directly i was certain to lose the whole and if i did not draw i should have a good chance of losing a great part i pulled my button away from the fellow and without listening to any more of his jabbering for i saw he was only speaking against time and all on his own side of the question i turned to look at the books of which i knew i never should make head or tail being no auditor of accounts but a plain country gentleman while i was turning over their confounded daybooks and ledgers in despair your jew harrington came up to me and with such a manner as i did not conceive a jew could havebut he is a spanish jewthat makes all the difference i supposemr harrington said he though i am a stranger to you permit me to offer my services in this businessi have some right to do so as i have accepted of services and am under real obligations to mr harrington your son a young gentleman for whom i feel the highest attachment as well as gratitude but of whom i will now say only that he has been one of the chief means of saving my life and my character his father cannot therefore i think refuse to let me show at least some sense of the obligations i have willingly received my collection of spanish pictures which without your sons exertions i could not have saved on the night of the riot has been estimated by your best english connoisseurs at three english noblemen are at this moment ready to pay down for a few of these pictures this will secure mr harringtons demand on this house if you mr baldwin pay him before three hours are over the money shall be with you it is no sacrifice of my taste or of my pictures continued your noble jew in answer to my scruples i lodge them with three different bankers only for security for the money if mr baldwin stands the storm we are all as we weremy pictures into the bargain if the worst happen i lose only a few instead of all my collection this was very generousquite noble but you know i am an obstinate old fellow i had still the jewess the daughter running in my head and i thought perhaps i was to be asked for my consent you know harrington or some sly underplot of that kind mr montenero has a quick eyei perceived that he saw into my thoughts but we could not speak to our purpose before baldwin and baldwin would never think of stirring if one was dying to get him out of the room luckily however he was called away by one of the clerks then mr montenero who speaks more to the point than any man i ever heard spoke directly of your love for his daughter and said he understood that it would not be a match that i should approve i pleaded my principles and religious difficultieshe replied we need not enter into that for the present business i must consider as totally independent of any view to future connexionif his daughter was going to be married tomorrow to another man he should do exactly the same as he now proposed to do he did not lessen her fortunehe should say nothing of what her sense of gratitude was and ought to beshe had nothing to do with the business when i found that my jupiter amman was in no danger and that the love affair was to be kept clear out of the question i was delighted with your generous jew harrington and i frankly accepted his offer baldwin came in again was quite happy when he heard how it was settled gave me three drafts at thirtyone days for my money on the bankers mr montenero named here i have them safe in my pocket mr montenero then said he would go immediately and perform his part of the business and as he left the room he begged mr baldwin to tell his daughter that he would call for her in an hour i now for the first time understood that the daughter was in the house and i certainly felt a curiosity to see her baldwin told me she was settling some business signing some papers in favour of poor mrs coates the aldermans widow he added that the jewess was a charming creature and as generous as her fatherhe told all she had done for this widow and her children on account of some kindness her mother had received in early life from the coatess family and then there was a history of some other family of manessasi never heard baldwin eloquent but this day in speaking of your jewessharrington i believe he is in love with her himself i said i should like to see her if it could be managed nothing easier if i would partake of a cold collation just serving in the next room for the friends of the house you know the nearer a man is to being ruined the better he must entertain his friends i walked into the next room when collation time came and i saw miss montenero though i had given him a broad hintbut the fellow understands nothing but his ioushe fell to introducing of course she is a most interestinglooking creature i acknowledge my boy ifshe were not a jewess i thought she would have sunk into the earth when she heard my name i could not eat one morsel of the mans collationsoring for dinner and let us say no more about the matter at present there is my oath against it you knowthere is an end of the matterdont let me hear a word from you harringtoni am tired to death quite exhausted body and mind i refrained most dutifully and most prudently from saying one word more on the subject till my father after dinner and after being refreshed by a sound and longprotracted sleep began again to speak of mr and miss montenero this was the first time he omitted to call them the jew and jewess he condescended to say repeatedly and with many oaths that they both deserved to be christiansthat if there was any chance of the girls conversion even he would overlook the fathers being a jew as he was such a noble fellow love could do wondersas my father knew when he was a young manperhaps i might bring about her conversion and then all would be smooth and right and no oath against it i thanked my father for the kind concessions he now appeared willing to make for my happiness and from step to step at each step repeating that he did not want to hear a syllable about the matter he made me tell him every thing that had passed mowbrays rivalship and treachery excited his indignation in the highest degree he was heartily glad that fellow was refusedhe liked the girl for refusing himsome spirithe liked spiritand he should be glad that his son carried away the prize he interrupted himself to tell me some of the feats of gallantry of his younger days and of the manner in which he had at last carried off my mother from a rascal of a rivala lord mowbray of those times when my father had got to this point my mother ventured to ask whether i had ever gone so far as to propose actually to propose for miss montenero yes both father and mother turned about and asked what answer i repeated as nearly as i could mr monteneros wordsand i produced his note both excited surprise and curiosity what can this obstaclethis mysterious obstacle be said my mother an obstacle on their side exclaimed my father is that possible i had now at least the pleasure of enjoying their sympathy and of hearing them go over all the conjectures by which i had been bewildered i observed that the less chance there appeared to be of the match the more my father and mother inclined towards it at least said my mother i hope we shall know what the objection is it is very extraordinary after all that it should be on their side repeated my father my mothers imagination and my fathers pride were both strongly excited and i let them work without interruption chapter xvii the time appointed for mr monteneros final decision approached in a few days my fate was to be decided the vessel that was to sail for america was continually before my eyes it was more difficult to me to endure the suspense of these few days than all the rest my mothers sympathy and the strong interest which had been excited on the subject in my fathers mind were at first highly agreeable but there was so much more of curiosity and of pride in their feelings than in mine that at last it became irksome to me to hear their conjectures and reflections i did not like to answer any questionsi could not bear to speak of berenice or even of mr montenero i took refuge in silencemy mother reproached me for my silence i talked on fast of any thing but that which interested me most my mother became extremely alarmed for my health and i believe with more reason than usual for i could scarcely either eat drink or sleep and was certainly very feverish but still i walked about and to escape from the constraint to which i put myself in her company to avoid giving her painto relieve myself from her hourly fond inquiriesfrom the effort of talking when i wished to be silentof appearing well and in spirits when i was ill and when my heart was dying within me i escaped from her presence as much as possible to feed upon my thoughts in solitude i either shut myself up in my room or walked all day in those streets where i was not likely to meet with any one who knew me or whom i knew and there i was at least safe from all notice and secure from all sympathy i am sure i experienced at this time the truth of what some one has quaintly but justly asserted that an individual can never feel more completely alone than in the midst of a crowded metropolis one evening when i was returning homewards through the city fatigued but still prolonging my walk that i might not be at home too early for dinner i was met and stopped by jacob i had not thought of him lately and when i looked up in his face i was surprised by an appearance of great perturbation he begged pardon for stopping me but he had been to my househe had been all over the town searching for me to consult me about a sad affair in which he was unfortunately concerned we were not far from manessas the jewellers shop i went in there with jacob as he wished he said that i should hear mr manessas evidence on the business as well as his own the affair was this lady de brantefield had some time ago brought to mr manessas some very fine antique jewels to be reset for her daughter lady anne mowbray one day immediately after the riots both the ladies called at mr manessas to inquire if the jewels were ready they were finished the new setting was approved but lady de brantefield having suffered great losses by the destruction of her house and furniture in the riots and her son lord mowbray being also in great pecuniary difficulties it was suggested by lady anne mowbray that her mother would be glad if mr manessa could dispose of some of the jewels without letting it be known to whom they had belonged mr manessa willing to oblige promised secresy and offered immediately to purchase the jewels himself in consequence the jewels were all spread out upon a little table in the back parlourno one present but jacob mr manessa and the two ladies a great deal of conversation passed and the ladies were a long time settling what trinkets they would part with it was very difficult to accommodate at once the personal vanity of the daughter the family pride of the mother and their pecuniary difficulties there occurred in particular a question about a topaz ring of considerable value but of antique setting which lady anne mowbray wished her mother to part with instead of some more fashionable diamond ornament that lady anne wanted to keep for herself lady de brantefield had however resisted all her daughters importunitieshad talked a vast deal about the ringtold that it had been sir josseline de mowbraysthat it had come into his possession by ducal and princely descentthat it was one of four rings which had been originally a present from pope innocent to king john of which rings there was a full description in some old chronicle footnote rymers foedera and in mr humes history of england to which her ladyship referred mr manessa his curiosity footnote for the satisfaction of any readers who may have more curiosity upon the subject than mr manessa had but yet who would not willingly rise from their seats to gratify their curiosity the passage is here given gratis innocent wrote john a mollifying letter and sent him four golden rings set with precious stones and endeavoured to enhance the value of the present by informing him of the many mysteries which were implied by it he begged him to consider seriously the form of the rings their number their matter and their colour their form he said being round shadowed out eternity which has neither beginning nor end their number four being a square denoted steadiness of mind not to be subverted either by adversity or prosperity fixed for ever on the four cardinal virtues gold which is the matter signified wisdom the blue of the sapphire faith the verdure of the emerald hope the redness of the ruby charity and splendour of the topaz good works by these conceits continued the historian innocent endeavoured to repay john for one of the most important prerogatives of the crown however was perfectly satisfied upon the subject and he was with all due deference willing to take the whole upon her ladyships word without presuming to verify her authorities while she spoke she took the ring from her finger and put it into jacobs hand desiring to know if he could make it fit her finger better as it was rather too large jacob told her it could be easily lessened if her ladyship would leave it for an hour or two with him but her ladyship said she could not let sir josselines ring out of her own sight it was of such inestimable value the troublesome affair of satisfying both the vain daughter and the proud mother being accomplishedthe last bows were made at the doorthe carriage drove away and manessa and jacob thanked heaven that they had done with these difficult customers two hours had scarcely elapsed before a footman came from lady de brantefield with the following note lady de brantefield informs mr manessa that she is in the greatest anxietynot finding sir josseline de mowbrays ring on her finger upon her return home her ladyship now recollects having left it in the hands of one of mr manessas shopmen a young man she believes of the name of jacob the only person except mr manessa who was in the little parlour while her ladyship and lady anne mowbray were there lady de brantefield requests that mr manessa will bring the ring himself to lady warbecks hanoversquare where lady de brantefield is at present lady de brantefield desires mr m will make no delay as her ladyship must remain in indescribable anxiety till sir josselines ring shall be restored her ladyship could not answer for such a loss to her family and posterity hanoversquare tuesday jacob was perfectly certain that her ladyship had not left the ring with him nevertheless he made diligent search for it and afterwards accompanied mr manessa to lady warbecks to assure lady de brantefield that the ring was not in their house he endeavoured to bring to her recollection her having put it on her finger just before she got into the carriage but this her ladyship would not admit lady anne supported her mothers assertions and lady de brantefield ended by being haughtily angry declaring she would not be contradicted by a shopman and that she was positive the ring had never been returned to her within eightandforty hours the story was told by lady de brantefield and her friends at every cardtable at the polite end of the town and it was spread by lady anne through the park and the ballrooms and the ladiesmaids had repeated it with all manner of exaggerations through their inferior but not less extensive circles the consequence was that the character of mr manessas house was hurt and jacob who was the person accused as the cause of it was very unhappy the confidence mr manessa had in him and the kindness he showed him increased his regret lady de brantefield had in a high tone threatened a prosecution for the value of her inestimable ring this was what both jacob and mr manessa would have desireda public trial they knew would bring the truth to light but her ladyship was probably discouraged by her legal advisers from a prosecution so that mr manessa and jacob were still left to suffer by the injustice of private whisperings jacob offered to replace as far as he could the value of this ring but in lady de brantefields opinion nothing could compensate for its loss poor jacob was in despair before i heard this story i thought that nothing could have forced my attention from my own affairs but i could not be so selfish as to desert or neglect jacob in his distress i went with my mother this evening to see lady de brantefield her ladyship was still at her relations lady warbecks house where she had apartments to herself in which she could receive what company she pleased there was to be a ball in the house this evening but lady de brantefield never mixed in what she called idle gaieties she abhorred a bustle as it infringed upon her personal dignity and did not agree with her internal persuasion that she was or ought to be the first object in all company we found her ladyship in her own retired apartment her eyes were weak and the room had so little light in it that when we first went in i could scarcely distinguish any object i saw however a young woman who had been reading to her ladyship rise as we entered put down her book and prepare to retire my mother stopped her as she was passing and turning to me said that this was a young person she was sure i should be glad to see the daughter of an old friend of mine i looked and saw a face which awakened the most painful associations of my childhood did not i perceive any likeness my mother continued but it was so many years since i had seen poor fowler and i was so very young a child no wonder i should not in the least recollect i had some recollectionif i was not mistakeni stammeredi stopped in fact i recollected too well to be able to pay the expected compliment however after i had got over the first involuntary shudder i tried to say something to relieve the embarrassment which i fancied the girl must feel she in a mincing waitinggentlewomans manner and with a certain unnatural softness of voice which again brought all the mother to my mind assured me that if id forgot her mother she had not forgot me for that shed often and often heard her mother talk of me and she was morally confident her mother had never loved any child so doatingly except to be sure her own present ladys lady anne mowbray her mother had often and often regretted she could never get a sight or sentence of me since i grew up to be a great gentleman she always having been stationary down at my ladys in surrey at the prioryhousekeeperand i never there but if id have the condescension to wish to gratify her mother as it would be the greatest gratification in lifeif lady de brantefield presently perhapswhen i ring said lady de brantefield and you nancy fowler may come back yourself with my treble ruffles mrs harrington i know will have the goodness to permit i keep her as much under my own eye and suffer her to be as much even in the room with me as possible added lady de brantefield as nancy left the room for she is a young person quite out of the common line and her mother ibut you first recommended her to me mrs harrington i remember the most faithful creature said my mother in the very tone i had heard it pronounced twenty years before i was carried back so far so forcibly and so suddenly that it was some time before i could recover myself sufficiently to recollect what was the order of the day but no mattermy mother passed on quite easily to the jewels and my silence was convenient and had an air of perfect deference for lady de brantefields long story of sir josselines ring now told over i believe for the ninetyninth time this season she ended where she began with the conviction that if the secretary of state would as he ought on such an occasion grant a general searchwarrant as she was informed had been done for papers and things of much less value her ring would be found in that jacobs possessionthat jacob of whom she had a very bad opinion i took the matter up as quietly as was in my nature and did not begin with a panegyric on my friend jacob but simply asked what reason her ladyship had for her very bad opinion of him too good reason her ladyship emphatically said she had heard her son lord mowbray express a very bad opinion of him lord mowbray had known this jacob she believed when a boy and afterwards when a man at gibraltar and had always thought ill of him lord mowbray had said that jacob was avaricious and revengeful as you know jews always are added her ladyship i wondered she had trusted her jewels then in such hands there she owned she had for once been wrongoverruled by othersby her daughter lady anne who said the jewels could be more fashionably set at manessas than any where else she had never acted against her own judgment in her life without repenting of it another circumstance lady de brantefield said prepossessed her she owned against this jacob he was from the very dregs of the people the son absolutely of an old clothesman she had been informed what could be expected from such a person when temptation came in his way and could we trust to any thing such a low sort of person would say lady anne mowbray before i had time to answer entered dressed for the ball with her jewels in full blaze and for some time there was a suspension of all hope of coming to any thing like common sense when her mother appealed to her about jacob lady anne protested she took a horrid dislike to his face the moment she saw him she thought he had a shocking jewish sort of countenance and she was positive he would swear falsely because he was ready to swear that her mamma had the ring on her finger when she got into the carriagenow lady anne was clear she had not has your ladyship i asked any particular reason for remembering this fact oh yes several very particular reasons there is sometimes wisdom in listening to a fools reasons for ten to one that the reasons will prove the contrary to what they are brought to support or will at least bring out some fact the distant bearing of which on the point of question the fool does not perceive but when two fools pour out their reasons at once it is difficult to profit even by their folly the mothers authority at last obtaining precedency i heard lady de brantefields cause of belief first her ladyship declared that she never wore sir josselines ring without putting on after it a guard ring a ring which being tighter than sir josselines kept it safe on her finger she remembered drawing off the guard ring when she took off sir josselines and put that into jacobs hands her ladyship said it was clear to her mind that she could not have put on sir josselines again because here was the guard ring on her wrong fingera finger on which she never in her life wore it when she wore sir josselines for sir josselines was so loose it would drop off unless she had the guard on but was not it possible i asked that your ladyship might this once have put on sir josselines ring without recollecting the guard no absolutely impossible if jacob and all the jews upon earth swore it who bythebye would swear any thing she could not be convinced against her reasonshe knew her own habitsher private reasons to her were unanswerable lady annes private reasons to her were equally unanswerable but they were so confused and delivered with so much volubility as to be absolutely unintelligible all i could gather was that fowler and her daughter nancy were in the room when lady anne and her mother first missed the ringthat when her mother drew off her glove and exclaimed bless me sir josselines not here lady anne ran up to the dressingtable at which her mother was standing to try to find the ring thinking that her mother might have dropped it in drawing off her glove but it certainly was not drawn off with the glove but might not it be left in the glove i asked oh dear no i shook the glove myself and fowler turned every finger inside out and nancy moved every individual box upon the dressingtable we were all in such a fuss because you know mammas so particular about sir josseline and to tell you the truth i was uncommonly anxious because i knew if mamma was vexed and lost the ring she would not give me a certain diamond cross that makes me so particularly remember every circumstanceand i was in such a flurry that i know i threw down a bottle of aether that was on mammas toilette on her muffand it had such a horrid smell the muff i asked if the muff as well as the glove had been searched carefully la to be surei suppose soof course it was shaken as every thing else in the room was a hundred times over the toilette and mammas petticoats even and cloak and gloves as i told you yes but the muff did your ladyship examine it yourself did i examine it i dont recollect no indeed after the aether how could i touch it you know but of course it was shaken it was examined i am sure but really i know nothing about itbut this that it could not possibly be in it the ring i mean because mamma had her glove on i requested permission to see the muff oh mamma was forced to give it away because of the horrid smellshe bid fowler take it out of the room that minute and never let it come near her again but if you want to see it ring for fowler you can examine it as much as you please depend upon it the rings no more there than i amsend for fowler and nancy and they can tell you how we shook every thing to no purpose the rings gone and so am i for colonel tophams waiting and i must lead off and away her ladyship tripped flirting her perfumed fan as she went persisting in my wish to see the muff lady de brantefield desired me to ring for fowler her ladyship wondered she said how i could after the reasons she had given me for her being morally certain that she had left the ring with jacob and after lady anne had justly remarked that the ring could not get through her glove entertain a hope of finding it in such a ridiculous place as a muff but since i was so possessed with this idea the muff should be producedthere was nothing like ocular demonstration in these cases except internal conviction did you ring mr harrington i did and miss nancy with the treble ruffles in her hand now appeared tis your mother child i want said lady de brantefield yes my lady she is only just finished assisting to lay out the ball supper but i want herdirectly certainly my lady directly and bid her bring a whisper from me to my mother and from my mother to her ladyship failed of effect after turning half round as if to ask me what i saida look which did not pass unnoticed by miss nancyher ladyship finished her sentenceand tell fowler i desire she will bring me the muff that i gave her last weekthe day i lost my ring this message would immediately put fowler upon her guard and i was at first sorry that it had been so worded but i recollected having heard an eminent judge a man of great abilities and experience say that if he were called upon to form a judgment of any character or to discover the truth in any case he would rather that the persons whom he was to examine were previously put on their guard than that they were not for that he should know by what they guarded of what they were afraid fowler appearedtwenty years had so changed her face and figure that the sight of her did not immediately shock me as i feared it would the daughter who i suppose more nearly resembled what her mother had been at the time i had known her was of the two the most disagreeable to my sight and feelings fowlers voice was altered by the loss of a tooth and it was even by this change less odious to my ear the daughters voice i could scarcely endure i was somewhat relieved from the fear of being prejudiced against fowler by the perception of this change in her and while she was paying me her compliments i endeavoured to fortify the resolution i had made to judge of her with perfect impartiality her delight at seeing me however i could not believe to be sincere and the reiterated repetition of her sorrow for her never having been able to get a sight of me before i thought illjudged but no matter many people in her station make these sort of unmeaning speeches if i had suffered my imagination to act i should have fancied that under a sort of prepared composure there was constraint and alarm in her look as she spoke to me i thought she trembled but i resolved not to be prejudicedand this i repeated to myself many times well fowler but the muff said lady de brantefield the muffoh dear my lady im so sorry i cant have it for youits not in the house nowherei parted with it out of hand directly upon your saying my lady that you desired it might never be suffered to come nigh your ladyship again then says i to myself since my lady cant abide the smell i cant never wear it which it would have been my pride to do so i thought i could never get it fast enough out of the house and what did you do with it i made a present of it my lady to poor mrs baxter john duttons sister my lady who was always so much attached to the family and would have a regard for even the smallest relic vestige or vestment i knew above all things in nature poor old soulshe has what with the rheumatic pains and one thing or another lost the use of her right arm so it was particularly agreeable and appropriateand she kissed the muffoh my lady im sure i only wish your ladyship could have witnessed the poor souls veneration in reply to a question which made my mother ask about the poor soul i further learned that mrs baxter was wife to a pawnbroker in swallowstreet fowler added if my lady wished any way for the muff i can get it tomorrow morning by breakfast or by the time yous up my lady very well very well that will do i suppose will it not mr harrington i bowed and said not a word morefowler i saw was glad to get rid of the subject and to go on to the treble ruffles on which while she and my mother and lady de brantefield were descanting i made my exit and went to the ballroom i found lady anne mowbraytalked nonsense to her ladyship for a quarter of an hourand at last propos to her perfumed fan i brought in the old muff with the horrid smell on purpose to obtain a full description of it she told me that it was a gray foxskin lined with scarlet that it had great pompadourcoloured knots at each end and that it was altogether hideous lady anne declared that she was heartily glad it would never shock her eyes more it was now just nine oclock people then kept better hours than they do at present i was afraid that all the shops would be shut but i recollected that pawnbrokers shops were usually kept open late i lost no time in pursuing my object i took a hackney coach bribed the coachman to drive very fast to mr manessafound manessa and jacob going to bed sleepybut at sight of me jacob was alert in an instant and joyfully ready to go with me immediately to baxter the pawnbrokers i made jacob furnish me with an old surtout and slouched hat desiring to look as shabby as possible that the pawnbroker might take me for one of his usual nightly customers and might not be alarmed at the sight of a gentleman that wont do yet mr harrington said jacob when i had equipped myself in the old hat and coat mr baxter will see the look of a gentleman through all that it is not the shabby coat that will make the gentleman look shabby no more than the fine coat can ever make the shabby look like the gentleman the pawnbroker who is used to observe and find out all manner of people will know that as well as ibut now you shall see how well at one stroke i will disguise the gentleman jacob then twisted a dirty silk handkerchief round my throat and this did the business so completely that i defied the pawnbroker and all his penetration we drove as fast as we could to swallowstreetdismissed our hackney coach and walked up to the pawnbrokers light in the shopall aliveand business going on the shop was so full of people that we stood for some minutes unnoticed we had leisure to look about us as we had previously agreed to do for lady de brantefields muff i had a suspicion that notwithstanding the veneration with which it had been said to be treated it might have come to the common lot of cast clothes jacob at one side and i at the other took a careful survey of the multifarious contents of the shop of all that hung from the ceiling and all that was piled on the shelves and all that lay huddled in corners or crammed into dark recesses in one of the darkest and most ignominious of these beneath a heap of sailors old jackets and trowsers i espied a knot of pompadour riband i hooked it out a little with the stick i had in my hand but jacob stopped me and called to the shopboy who now had his eye upon us and with him we began to bargain hard for some of the old clothes that lay upon the muff the shopboy lifted them up to display their merits by the dimness of the candlelight and as he raised them up there appeared beneath the gray foxskin with its scarlet lining and pompadour knots the lady de brantefields much venerated muff i could scarcely refrain from seizing upon it that moment but jacob again restrained me he went on talking about the sailors jackets for which we had been in treaty and he insisted upon having the old muff into the bargain it actually was at last thrown in as a makeweight had she been witness to this bargain i believe lady de brantefield would have dropped down in a swoon the moment i got possession of it i turned it inside outthere were several small rents in the liningbut one in particular had obviously been cut open with scissars the shopboy who thought i was pointing out the rents to disparage my purchase assured me that any woman clever at her needle would with halfadozen stitches sew all up and make the muff as good again as new jacob desired the boy to show him some old seals rings and trinkets fit for a pedlar to carry into the country jacob was for this purpose sent to the most respectable place at the counter and promoted to the honour of dealing face to face with mr baxter himselfdrawers which had before been invisible were now produced and i stood by while jacob looked over all the new and old trinkets i was much surprised by the richness and value of various brooches picture settings watches and rings which had come to this fate at last in a drawer with many valuables which mr baxter told us that some great mans mistress had last week been obliged to leave with him jacob and i at the same moment saw the splendour of the topazlady de brantefields inestimable ring i must do myself the justice to say that i behaved incomparably welldid not make a single exclamation though i was sure it was the identical ring the moment i caught a glimpse of the topazand though a glance from jacob convinced me i was right i said i could wait no longer but would call again for him in half an hours time this was what we had agreed upon beforehand should be the signal for my summoning a bowstreet officer whom mr manessa had in readiness jacob identified and swore to the propertymr baxter was seized he protested he did not know the ring was stolen goodshe could not recollect who had sold it to him but when we mentioned fowlers name he grew pale was disconcerted and not knowing how much or how little we knew decided at once to get out of the scrape himself by giving her up and turning evidence against her he stated that she had found it in the old muff but that he never knew that this muff had belonged to lady de brantefield mrs fowler had assured him that it had been left to her along with the wardrobe of a lady with whom she had formerly lived as soon as baxter had told all the lies he chose to invent and confessed as much of the truth as he thought would serve his purpose his deposition was taken and sworn to this was all that could then be done as it was near twelve oclock poor jacobs joy at having his innocence proved and at being relieved from the fear of injuring the credit of his masters house raised his spirits higher than i ever saw them in my life before but still his joy and gratitude were more shown by looks than words he thanked me once and but once warmly and strongly ah mr harrington said he from the time you were master harrington at school you were my best friendalways my friend in most needi trusted in you and still i hopedhoped that the truth would stand and the lie fall see at last our hebrew proverb righta lie has no feet chapter xviii the next morning before i left my room to go down to breakfast my servant told me that lady de brantefields housekeeper mrs fowler begged to speak to meshe had been come some time i went into my mothers dressingroom where she was waiting alone i could not bear to fix my eyes upon her i advanced towards her wishing as i believe i said aloud that she had spared me the pain of this interview i waited in silence for her to speak but she did not say a wordi heard the unhappy woman sobbing violently suddenly she took her handkerchief from before her face and her sobs ceasing she exclaimed i know you hate me mr harrington and you have reason to hate memoremuch more than you know of but lord mowbray is the most to blame i stood in astonishment i conceived either that the woman was out of her senses or that she had formed the not unprecedented design of affecting insanity in hope of escaping the punishment of guilt she threw herself at my feetshe would have clasped my knees but i started back from her insufferable touch provoked by this she exclaimed in a threatening tone take care sirthe secret is still in my power then observing i believe that her threat made no impression her tone changed again to the whine of supplication oh mr harrington if i could hope for your forgiveness i could reveal such a secreta secret that so concerns you i retreated saying that i would not hear any secret from her but i stopped and was fixed to the spot when she added under her breath the name of montenero then in a hypocritical voice she went onoh mr harringtonoh sir i have been a great sinner led onled on by them that was worse than myself but if you will plead for me with my lady and prevail upon her not to bring me to public shame about this unfortunate affair of the ring i will confess all to youi will throw myself on your mercy i will quit the country if you will prevail on my ladyto let my daughters marriage go on and not to turn her out of favour i refused to make any terms but my mother whose curiosity could refrain no longer burst into the room and to her fowler did not plead in vain shocked as she was with the detection of this womans fraud my mother was so eager to learn the secret concerning me that she promised to obtain a pardon from lady de brantefield for the delinquent if she would immediately communicate the secret i left the room i met my father with letters and newspapers in his hand he looked in consternation and beckoned to me to follow him into his own room i was just going in search of you harrington said he heres a devil of a stroke for your mothers friend lady de brantefield the loss of her jewels do you mean sir said i they are found jewels said my father i dont know what you are talking of i dont know then what you mean sir said i no to be sure you do not how could you for the news is but this instant comein this letter which i was carrying to youwhich is addressed to you as i found when i got to the middle of it i beg your pardon for opening it stay staythis is not the right letter my father seemed much hurried and looked over his parcel of letters while he went on saying this is directed to william harrington instead of william harrington harrington never mind about that now only i dont like to open letters that dont belong to mehere it isrun your eye over it as fast as you can and tell mefor i stopped as soon as i saw it was not to metell me how it is with mowbrayi never liked the fellow nor his mother either but one cant help pityingand being shockedshocked indeed i was the moment i read the letter the letter which appeared to have been written in great perturbation and at two or three different times with different inks was from a brother officer of lord mowbrays it began in a tolerably composed and legible hand with an account of a duel in which the writer of the letter said that he had been second to lord mowbray his lordship had been wounded but it was hoped he would do well then came the particulars of the duel which the second stated of course as advantageously for himself and his principal as he could but even by his own statement it appeared that lord mowbray had been the aggressor that he had been intemperate and in short entirely in the wrong the person with whom he fought was a young officer who had been his schoolfellow the dispute had begun about some trivial old school quarrel on the most nonsensical subject something about a jew boy of the name of jacob and a pencilcase the young gentleman had appealed to the evidence of mr harrington whom he had lately met on a fishingparty and who he said had a perfect recollection of the circumstance lord mowbray grew angry and in the heat of contradiction which as his second said his lordship could never bear he gave his opponent the lie direct a duel was the necessary consequence lord mowbray insisted on their firing across the table his opponent was compelled to it they fired as it was agreed at the same instant lord mowbray fell so far was written while the surgeon was with his patient afterwards the letter went on in a more confused manner the surgeon begged that lord mowbrays friends might be informed to prepare them for the event but still there were hopes lord mowbray had begun to write a letter to mr harrington but could not go onhad torn it to bitsand had desired the writer of the present letter to say that he could not go out of the world easy without his forgivenessto refer him to a woman of the name of fowler for explanationa waitingmaida housekeeper now in his mothers family lord mowbray assured mr harrington that he did not mean to have carried the jest the word jest scratched out the thing farther than to show him his power to break off matters if he pleasedbut he now repented this dictated part of the letter was so confused and so much like the delirium of a man in a fever that i should certainly have concluded it to be without real meaning had it not coincided with the words which fowler had said to me on turning over the page i saw a postscriptlord mowbray at two oclock that morning had expired his brother officer gave no particulars and expressed little regret but begged me to represent the affair properly and added something about the lieutenantcolonelcy which was blotted so much either purposely or accidentally that i could not read it my father who was a truly humane man was excessively shocked by the letter and at first so much engrossed by the account of the manner of the young mans death and by the idea of the shock and distress of the mother and sister that he scarcely adverted to the unintelligible messages to me he observed indeed that the writer of the letter seemed to be a fool and to have very little feeling we agreed that my mother was the fittest person to break the matter to poor lady de brantefield if my mother should not feel herself equal to the task my father said he would undertake it himself though he had rather have a tooth pulled out than go through it we went together to my mother we found her in hysterics and fowler beside her my mother the moment she saw us recovered some recollection and pushing fowler from her with both her hands she cried take her awayout of my sightout of my sight i took the hartshorn from fowler and bid her leave the room ordering her at her peril not to leave the house why did you tell mrs harrington so suddenly mrs fowler my father began supposing that my mothers hysterics were the consequence of having been told too suddenly the news of lord mowbrays death i did not tell her sir i never uttered a sentence of his lordships death in her confusion the woman betrayed her knowledge of the circumstance though on her first speaking to me she had not mentioned it while i assisted and soothed my mother i heard my father questioning her she heard the news that morning early in a letter from lord mowbrays gentlemanhad not yet had the heart to mention it to her ladybelieved she had given a hint of it to lady annewas indeed so flurried and still was so flurried my father perceiving that fowler did not know what she was saying goodnaturedly attributed her confusion to her sorrow for her ladies and did not wonder he said she was flurried he was not nervous but it had given him a shock sit down poor fowler the words caught my mothers ear who had now recovered her recollection completely and with an effort which i had never before seen her make to command her own feelingsan effort for which i thank her as i knew it arose from her strong affection for me she calmly said i will bear that womanthat fiend in my sight a few minutes longer for your sake harrington till her confession be put in writing and signed this will i suppose be necessary i desire to know directly what all this means said my father speaking in a certain repressed tone which we and which fowler knew to be the symptom of his being on the point of breaking out into violent anger oh sir said fowler i have been a very sad sinner but indeed i was not so much to blame as them that knew better and ought to know betterthat bribed and deceived me and lured me by promises to do thatto say thatbut indeed i was made to believe it was all to end in no harmonly a jest a jest oh wretch cried my mother i was a wretch indeed maam but lord mowbray was youll allow the wickedest and at the moment he is dead said my father is this a time fowler terrified to her inmost coward soul at the sight of the powerful indignation which appeared in my fathers eyes made an attempt to throw herself at his feet but he caught strong hold of her arm tell me the plain fact at once woman now she literally could not speak she knew my father was violent and dreaded lest what she had to say should incense him beyond all bounds my mother rose and said that she would tell the plain fact fowler still more afraid that my mother should tell itas she thought i suppose she could soften it best herselfinterposed saying sir if you will give me a moments time for recollection sir i will tell all dear sir if one had committed murder and was going to be put to death one should have that much mercy shownhard to be condemned unheard my father let go her arm from his strong grasp and sat down resolved to be patient it was just he said that she that every human creature should be heard before they were condemned when she came to the facts i was so much interested that i cannot recollect the exact words in which the account was given but this was the substance lord mowbray when refused by miss montenero had sworn that he would be revenged on her and on me indeed from our first acquaintance with her he had secretly determined to supplant me and a circumstance soon occurred which served to suggest the means he had once heard miss montenero express strongly her terror at seeing an insane personher horror at the idea of a marriage which a young friend of hers had made with a man who was subject to fits of insanity upon this hint mowbray set to work before he opened his scheme to fowler he found how he could bribe her as he thought effectually and secure her secrecy by making her an accomplice fowler had a mind to marry her daughter to a certain apothecary who though many years older than the girl and quite old enough to be her father was rich and would raise her to be a lady this apothecary lived in a country town near the priory the house and ground belonging to it which the apothecary rented was on her ladyships estate and would be the inheritance of lord mowbray he promised that he would renew this lease to her future soninlaw provided she and the apothecary continued to preserve his good opinion his lordship had often questioned fowler as to the strange nervous fits i had had when a boy he had repeated all he had heard reported and certainly exaggerated stories in abundance had at the time been circulated lord mowbray affirmed that most people were of opinion it was insanity fowler admitted that was always her own opinionlord mowbray supposed that was the secret reason for her quitting my mothers serviceit certainly was though she was too delicate and afraid at the time to mention it by degrees he worked fowler partly to acquiesce in all he asserted and to assert all he insinuated the apothecary had been an apprentice to the london apothecary who attended me he had seen me often at the time i was at the worst he had heard the reports too and he had heard opinions of medical men and he was brought to assert whatever his future motherinlaw pleased for he was much in love with the young girl this combination was formed about the period when i first became attached to miss montenero the last stroke had been given at the time when mr montenero and berenice were at general bs in surrey the generals house was within a few miles of the country town in which the said apothecary lived it was ten or twelve miles from the priory where fowler was left at that time to take care of the place the apothecary usually attended the chief families in the neighbourhood and was recommended to general bs family miss montenero had a slight sore throat and no physician being near this apothecary was sent for he made use of this opportunity spoke of the friends he had formerly had in london in particular of mr harringtons family for whom he expressed much gratitude and attachment inquired anxiously and mysteriously about young mr harringtons state of health one day miss montenero and her father called at this apothecarys to see some curious things that had been found in a roman bath just dug up in the county of surrey fowler who had been apprised of the intended visit was found in the little parlour behind the shop talking to the apothecary about poor young mr harrington while mr and miss montenero were looking at the roman curiosities fowler contrived in half sentences to let out what she wished to be overheard about that poor young gentlemans strange fits and she questioned the apothecary whether they had come on ever very lately and hoped that for the familys sake as well as his own it would never break out publicly all which observations and questions the apothecary seemed discreetly and mysteriously to evade answering fowler confessed that she could not get out on this occasion the whole of what she had been instructed to say because miss montenero grew so pale they thought she would have dropped on the floor the apothecary pretended to think the young lady had been made sick by the smell of the shop it passed offnothing more was done at that time mr montenero before he left the house made inquiries who fowler waslearned that she had been for many years a servant in the harrington familychildrens maid her evidence and that of the apothecary who had attended me in my extraordinary illness agreed and there seemed no reason to suspect its truth mr and miss montenero went with a party from general bs to see brantefield priory fowler attended the company through the house mr montenero took occasion to question her most minutelyasked in particular about a tapestry rooma picture of sir josseline and the jewreceived such answers as lord mowbray had prepared fowler to give so artfully had he managed that his interference could not be suspected fowler pretended to know scarcely any thing of her young lordshe had always lived here at the prioryhis lordship had been abroadwas in the armyalways on the movedid not know where he was nowprobably in town her present ladies had her good wordbut her heart she confessed was always with her first mistress mrs harrington and poor master harringtonnever to be mentioned without a sighthat was noted in her instructions all that i or mowbray had mentioned before mr montenero of my aversion to fowler now appeared to be but the dislike which an insane person is apt to take against those about them even to those who treat them most kindly fowler was a good actress and she was well promptedshe produced in her own justification instructions in unsigned letters of lord mowbrays i knew his hand however disguised she was directed to take particular care not to go too farto let things be drawn from herto refuse to give further information lest she should do mischief when assured that the monteneros were friends then to tell circumstances agreed uponto end with a promise to produce a keeper who had attended the poor gentleman not long since who could satisfy all doubts lord mowbray noted that this must be promised to be done within the ensuing monthsomething about a ships sailing for america was scratched out in these last instructions i have calmly related the facts but i cannot give an idea of the transports of passion into which my father burst when he heard them it was with the utmost difficulty that we could restrain him till the woman had finished her confession lord mowbray was dead his deathhis penitencepity for his family quenched my fathers rage against mowbray all his fury rose with tenfold violence against fowler it was with the greatest difficulty that i got her out of the room in safetyhe followed raging and my mother seeing me put fowler into a parlour and turn the key in the door began beseeching that i would not keep her another instant in the house i insisted however upon being permitted to detain her till her confession should be put into writing or till mr montenero could hear it from her own lips i represented that if once she quitted the house we might never see her again she might make her escape out of town might for some new interest deny all she had said and leave me in as great difficulties as ever my father sudden in all his emotions snatched his hat from the halltable seized his cane and declared he would that instant go and settle the point at once with mr montenero and the daughter my mother and i one on each side of him pleaded that it would be best not to speak so suddenly as he proposed to do especially to berenice heaven bless my mother she called her berenice this did not escape my ear my father let us take off his hat and carry away his cane he sat down and wrote directly to mr montenero requesting to see him immediately on particular business my mothers carriage was at the door it was by this time the hour for visiting i will bring mr montenero back with me said my mother for i am going to pay a visit i should have paid long agoto miss montenero i kissed my mothers hand i dont know how many times till my father told me i was a fool but turning to me when the carriage had driven off though i am delighted that the obstacle will be removed on their part yet remember harrington i can go no farthernot an inchnot an inch sorry for itbut you know all i have saidby jupiter ammon i cannot eat my own words but you ought to eat your own words sir said i venturing to jest as i knew that i might in his present humour and while his heart was warmed your words were a libel upon jews and jewesses and the most appropriate and approved punishment invented for the libeller isto eat his own words chapter xix my mother returned almost as quickly as my impatience expected and from afar i saw that mr montenero was in the carriage with her my heart did certainly beat violently but i must not stop to describe if i could my various sensations my mother telling mr montenero all the time that she would tell him nothing had told him every thing that was to be told i was glad of itit spared me the task of detailing lord mowbrays villany he had once been my friend or at least i had once been hisand just after his death it was a painful subject besides on my own account i was heartily glad to leave it to my father to complete what my mother had so well begun he spoke with great vehemence i stood by proud all the time to show mr montenero my calmness and selfpossession while fowler who was under salutary terror of my father repeated without much prevarication all the material parts of her confession and gave up to him lord mowbrays letters astonishment and horror at the discovery of such villany were mr monteneros first feelingshe looked at lord mowbrays writing again and again and shuddered in silence as he cast his eyes upon fowlers guilty countenance we all were glad when she was dismissed mr montenero turned to me and i saw tears in his eyes there is no obstacle between us now i hope said i eagerly seizing the hand which he held out to me mr montenero pressed me in his arms with the affection of a parent heyday heyday said my father in a tone between pleasure and angerdo you at all know what you are about harringtonremember oh mr montenero said my mother speak for heavens sake and tell me that you are perfectly convinced that there was no shadow of truth nonsense my dear i beg your pardon mrs harrington said my fatherto be sure he is convinced he is not an idiotall my astonishment is how he could ever be made to believe such a thing mr montenero answered my mother and my father alternately assuring my mother that he was quite convinced and agreeing with my father that he had been strangely imposed upon he turned again to me and i believe at the same instant the same recollections occurred to us bothnew light seemed to break upon us and we saw in a different point of view a variety of past circumstances almost from the moment of my acquaintance with berenice i could trace lord mowbrays artifices even from the time of our first going out together at westminster abbey when mr montenero said he loved enthusiasm how mowbray encouraged excited me to follow that line at the tower my kneeling in raptures to the figure of the black princemy exaggerated expressions of enthusiasmmy poetic and dramatic declamation and gesturemy start of horror at mowbrays allusion to the tapestrychamber and the picture of sir josselinemy horror afterwards at the auction where mowbray had prepared for me the sight of the picture of the dentition of the jewand the appearance of the figure with the terrible eyes at the synagogue all i now found had been contrived or promoted by lord mowbray fowler had dressed up the figure for the purpose they had taken the utmost pains to work on my imagination on this particular point on which he knew my early associations might betray me to symptoms of apparent insanity upon comparing and explaining these circumstances mr montenero further laid open to me the treacherous ingenuity of the man who had so duped me by the show of sympathy and friendship by dexterous insinuations he had first excited curiositythen suggested suspicions worked every accidental circumstance to his purpose and at last rendered desperate by despair and determined that i should not win the prize which he had been compelled to resign had employed so boldly his means and accomplices that he was dreadfully near effecting my ruin while mr montenero and i ran over all these circumstances understanding each other perfectly but scarcely intelligible to either my father or mother they looked at us both with impatience and surprise and rejoiced when we had finished our explanationsand yet when we had finished an embarrassing minute of silence ensued my mother broke it by saying something about miss montenero i do not know whatnor did she my father stood with a sort of bravadoing look of firmness fixing himself opposite to me as though he were repeating to himself if sirifby jupiter ammon i must be consistent mr montenero appeared determined not to say any more but something seemed to be still in reserve in his mind i hope mr montenero said i that now no obstacle exists on my part none replied mr montenero but you recollect i recollect only your own words my dear sir cried i either my daughter and you must never meet again or must meet to part no morei claim your promise at all hazards said mr montenero no hazards with such a woman as berenice said i though her religion i would give exclaimed my father i would give one of my fingers this instant that she was not a jewess is your objection sir to her not being a christian or to her being the daughter of a jew can you conceive mr montenero cried my father that after all i have seen of youall you have done for mecan you conceive me to be such an obstinately prejudiced brute my prejudices against the jews i give upyou have conquered themall all but a difference of religion between man and wife is a very serious objection indeed said mr montenero but if that be the only objection left in your mind i have the pleasure to tell you mr harrington addressing himself to me that your love and duty are not at variance i have tried you to the utmost and am satisfied both of the steadiness of your principles and of the strength of your attachment to my daughterberenice is not a jewess not a jewess cried my father starting from his seat not a jewess then my jupiter ammon may go to the devil not a jewessgive you joy harrington my boygive me joy my dear mrs harringtongive me joy excellentjew he was on the point of saying excellent mr montenero but is not she your daughter she is i hope and believe my daughter said mr montenero smiling but her mother was a christian and according to my promise to mrs montenero berenice has been bred in her faitha christiana protestant a christian a protestant repeated my father an english protestant her mother was daughter of an english protestant interrupted my father english english do you hear that mrs harrington thank heaven i do hear it my dear said my mother but mr montenero we interruptdaughter of daughter of an english gentleman of good family who accompanied one of your ambassadors to spain of good family mr harrington said my mother raising her head proudly as she looked at me with a radiant countenance i knew she was of a good family from the first moment i saw her at the playso different from the people she was witheven lady de brantefield asked who she was from the first moment i thought you thought mrs harrington interposed my father you thought to be sure that miss montenero looked like a christian yes yes and no doubt you had presentiments plenty granted granted my dear but dont let us say any more about them now well my boy well harrington not a word noi am too happythe delight i feelbut my dear mr montenero said i whywhy did not you tell all this sooner what pain you would have spared me had i spared you the pain you would never have enjoyed the delight had i spared you the trial you would never have had the triumphthe triumph did i say better than all triumph this sober certainty of your own integrity if like lord mowbraybut peace be to the dead and forgiveness to his faults my daughter was determined never to marry any man who could be induced to sacrifice religion and principle to interest or to passion she was equally determined never to marry any man whose want of the spirit of toleration whose prejudices against the jews might interfere with the filial affection she feels for her fatherthough he be a jew thoughgratitude joy love so overwhelmed me at this moment that i could not say another syllable but it was enough for mr montenero deeply read as he was in the human heart why did not i spare you the pain repeated he and do you think that the trial cost me cost us no pain said mr montenero the time may come when as my son you may perhaps learn from berenice the time is comethis moment cried my father for you see the poor fellow is burning with impatiencehe would not be my son if he were not that is true indeed said my mother truevery likely said mr montenero calmly holding me fast but impetuous sir recollect that once before you were too sudden for berenice after you had saved my life you rushed in with the joyful news and oh no rushing for mercys sake harrington said my mother some consideration for miss monteneros nerves nerves nonsense my dear said my father what womans nerves were ever the worse for seeing her lover at her feet i moveand i am sure of one honourable gentleman to second my motioni move that we all adjourn forthwith to mr monteneros this evening perhaps miss montenero would allow us said my mother this instant said mr montenero if you will do me the honour mrs harrington the carriage said my mother ringing the carriage directly cried my father to the servant as he entered heres a fellow will certainly fly the moment you let him go said my father and away i flew with such swiftness that at the foot of the stairs i almost fell over jacob he not knowing any thing of what had happened this morning full of the events of the preceding night and expecting to find me the same began to say something about a ring which he held in his hand thats all settledall overlet me pass good jacob still he endeavoured to stop me i was not pleased with this interruption but there was something so beseeching and so kind in jacobs manner that i could not help attending to him had the poor fellow known the cause of my impatience he would not certainly have detained me he begged me with some hesitation to accept of a ring which mr manessa his partner and he took the liberty of offering me as a token of their gratitude it was not of any great value but it was finished by an artist who was supposed to be one of the best in the world willingly jacob said i and it comes at the happiest momentif you will allow me to present it to offer it to a lady who who will i hope said my father appearing at the top of the stairs soon be his bride his bride jacob saw mr monteneros face behind me and clasping his hands the very thing i wished cried he opening the housedoor follow us jacob i heard mr montenero say as we stepped into the carriage follow us to the house of joy you who never deserted the house of mourning the ring the history of it and the offering it to berenice prepared my way in the happiest manner and prevented the danger which mr montenero feared of my own or my fathers precipitation we told her in general the circumstances that had happened but spared her the detail and now my beloved daughter said mr montenero i may express to you all the esteem all the affection all the fulness of approbation i feel for your choice and i miss montenerolet me speak pray mrs harrington said my father by and by whispered my mother not yet my love ay put the ring on her fingerthats right boy cried my father as my mother drew him back berenice accepted of the ring in the most gracious the most graceful manner i accept this with pleasure said she i shall prize it more than ever lady de brantefield valued her ring as a token of goodness and gratitude it will be more precious to me than any jewel could be and it will ever be dear to me added she with a softened voice turning to her father very dear as a memorial of the circumstances which have removed the only obstacle to our happiness our repeated my father noble girl above all affectation boy a truce with your transports she is my own daughteri must have a kiss for shame my dear said my mother you make miss montenero blush blushes are very becomingi always thought yours so mrs harringtonthats the reason i have given you occasion to blush for me so often now you may take me out of the room madam i have some discretion though you think you have it all to yourself said my father i have some discretion too hereditary or acquired i am aware that the moment two lovers cease to be miserable they begin to be tiresome their best friends and the generous public are satisfied to hear as little as possible concerning their prosperous loves it was otherwise they say in the days of theagenes and chariclea how will you never be satisfied with hearing says their historian who when he came to a prosperous epoch in their history seems to have had a discreet suspicion that he might be too long is not my discourse yet tedious no the indefatigable auditor is made to reply and who is he unless he have a heart of adamant or iron that would not listen content to hear the loves of theagenes and chariclea though the story should last a year therefore continue it i beseech you continue i beseech you dear flattering words though perhaps no one at this minute says or feels this i must add a few lines morenot about myself but about mr montenero in the moment of joy when the heart opens you can see to the very bottom of it and whether selfish or generous revengeful or forgiving the real disposition is revealed we were all full of joy and congratulations when mr montenero at the first pause of silence addressed himself in his most persuasive tone to me mr harringtongood mr harringtoni have a favour to ask from you a favour from me oh name it cried i what pleasure i shall have in granting it perhaps not you will not have pleasureimmediate pleasurein granting it it will cost you present pain painimpossible but no matter how much pain if you desire it what can it be that wretched womanfowler i shuddered and started back yes fowleryour imagination revolts at the sound of her nameshe is abhorrent to your strongest your earliest associations but mr harrington you have given proofs that your matured reason and your humanity have been able to control and master your imagination and your antipathies to this power over yourself you owe many of your virtues and all the strength of character and i will say it the sanity of mind my son without which berenice i will seei will hear fowler this instant cried i so far i will conquer myself but you will allow that this is a just antipathy surely i have reason to hate her she is guilty but penitent she suffers and must suffer her mistress refuses ever to see her more she is abandoned by all her family all her friends she must quit her countrysails tomorrow in the vessel which was to have taken us to americaand carries with her in her own feelings her worst punishmenta punishment which it is not in our power to remit but it is in our power to mitigate her sufferingsi can provide her with an asylum for the remainder of her miserable old age and you my son before she goes from happy england see her and forgive her it is the glory of a man to pass by an offence let us see and forgive this woman how can we better celebrate our joyhow can we better fill the measure of our happiness than by the forgiveness of our enemies by jupiter ammon cried my father none but a good christian could do this and why said berenice laying her hand gently on my fathers arm and why not a good jew end of harrington thoughts on bores a bore is a biped but not always unplumed there be of both kindsthe female frequently plumed the malemilitary plumed helmed or crested and whiskerfaced hairy dandy bore ditto ditto dittothere are bores unplumed capped or hatted curled or uncurled bearded and beardless the bore is not a ruminating animalcarnivorous not sagaciousprosinglongwindedtenacious of life though not vivacious the bore is good for promoting sleep but though he causeth sleep in others it is uncertain whether he ever sleeps himself as few can keep awake in his company long enough to see it is supposed that when he sleeps it is with his mouth open the bore is usually considered a harmless creature or of that class of irrational bipeds who hurt only themselves to such however i would not advise trusting too much the bore is harmless no doubt as long as you listen to him but disregarded or stopped in midcareer he will turn upon you it is a fatal if not a vulgar error to presume that the bore belongs to that class of animals that have no gall of which pliny gives a list much disputed by sir thomas browne and others that bores have gall many have proved to their cost as some now living peradventure can attest the milk of human kindness is said to abound naturally in certain of the gentler bore kind but it is apt to grow sour if the animal be crossednot in love but in talk though i cannot admit to a certainty that all bores have not gall yet assuredly they have no tact and they are one and all deficient in sympathy a bore is a heavy animal and his weight has this peculiarity that it increases every moment he stays near you the french describe this property in one word which though french i may be permitted to quote because untranslatable il sappesantittouch and go it is not in the nature of a bore to dowhatever he touches turns to lead much learning might be displayed and much time wasted on an inquiry into the derivation descent and etymology of the animal under consideration suffice it to say that for my own part diligence hath not been wanting in the research johnsons dictionary and old bailey have been ransacked but neither the learned johnson nor the recondite bailey throw much light upon this matter the slang dictionary to which i should in the first place have directed my attention was unfortunately not within my reach the result of all my inquiries amounts to thisthat bore boor and boar are all three spelt indifferently and consequently are derived from one common stockwhat stock remains to be determined i could give a string of farfetched derivations each of them less to the purpose than the other but i prefer according to the practice of our great lexicographer taking refuge at once in the coptic of one point there can be little doubtthat bores existed in ancient as well as in modern times though the deluge has unluckily swept away all traces of the antediluvian borea creature which analogy leads us to believe must have been of formidable power we find them for certain in the days of horace that plague worse as he describes than asthma or rheumatism that prating praising thing which caught him in the street stuck to him wherever he wentof which stopping or running civil or rude shirking or cutting he could never rid himselfwhat was he but a bore in pope i find the first description in english poetry of the animalwhether imitated from horace or a drawing from life may be questioned but what could that creature be but a bore from whom he says no walls could guard him and no shades could hide who pierced his thickets glided into his grotto stopped his chariot boarded his barge from whom no place was sacrednot the church free and against whom john was ordered to tie up the knocker through the indexes to milton and shakspeare i have not neglected to hunt but unfortunately i have found nothing to my purpose in milton and in all shakspeare no trace of a bore except it be that thing that popinjay who so pestered hotspur that day when he faint with toil and dry with rage was leaning on his sword after the battleall that bald disjointed talk to which hotspur past his patience answered neglectingly he knew not what and that sticking to him with questions even when his wounds were cold it must have been a bore of foreign breed not the good downright english bore all the classes orders genera and species of the animal i pretend not to enumerate heaven forefendbut some of those most commonly met with in england i may mention and a few of the most curious describe in the first place there is the mortal great bore confined to the higher classes of society a celebrated wit who from his long and extensive acquaintance with the fashionable and political world has had every means of forming his opinion on this subject lays it down as an axiom that none but a rich man or a great man can be a great bore others are not endured long enough in society to come to the perfection of tiresomeness of these there is the travelled and the untravelled kind the travelled formerly rare is now dreadfully common in these countries the old travelling bore was as i find him aptly describeda pretender to antiquities roving majesticheaded and sometimes little better than crazed and being exceedingly credulous he would stuff his many letters with fooleries and misinformationsvide a life published by hearnethomas hearnehim to whom time said whatever i forget you learn the modern travelled bore is a garrulous creature his talk chiefly of himself of all that he has seen that is incredible and all that he remembers which is not worth remembering his tongue is neither english french italian or german but a leash and more than a leash of languages at once besides his having his quantum of the ills that flesh is subject to he has some peculiar to himself and rather extraordinary he is subject for instance to an indigestion of houses and churches pictures and statues moreover he is troubled with fits of what may be called the cold enthusiasm he babbles of mont blanc and the picturesque and when the fit is on he raves of raphael and correggio rome athens paestum and jerusalem he despises england and has no home or at least loves none but i have been already guilty of an error of arrangement i should have given precedence to the old original english bore which should perhaps be more properly spelt boor indeed it was so as late as the time of mrs cowley who in the belles stratagem talks of mans being boored the boor is now rare in england though there are specimens of him still to be seen in remote parts of the country he is untravelled always not apt to be found straying or stirring from home his covering is homespun his drink homebrewed his meat homefed and himself homebred in general he is a wonderfully silent animal but there are talking ones and their talk is of bullocks talking or silent the indigenous english bore is somewhat sulky surly seemingly morose yet really goodnatured inoffensive if kindly used and rightly taken convivial yet not social it is curious that though addicted to home he is not properly domesticbibuloussaid to be despotic with the female the parliamentary bore comes next in order fond of high places but not always found in them his civil life is but short never extending above seven years at the utmost seldom so long his dissolution often occurs we are told prematurely but he revives another and the samemode of lifeduring five or six months of the year these bores inhabit londonare to be seen every where always looking as if they were out of their element about june or july they migrate to the countryto watering placesor to their own places where they shoot partridges pheasants and wild ducks hunt hares and foxes cause men to be imprisoned or transported who do the same without licence and frank letterssome illegibly the parliamentary bore is not considered a sagacious animal except in one particular it is said that he always knows which way the wind blows quick as any of the fourfooted swinish multitude report says also that he has the instinct of a rat in quitting a falling house an incredible power was once attributed to him by one from ireland of being able at pleasure to turn his back upon himself but this may well be classed among vulgar errors of the common parliamentary bore there be two orders the silent and the speechifying the silent is not absolutely deprived of utterance he can say yes or nobut regularly in the wrong place unless well tutored and well paid the talking parliamentary bore can outwatch the bear he reiterates eternally with the art peculiar to the rational creature of using many words and saying nothing the following are some of the cries by which this class is distinguished hear hear

beginnings of speeches as followsfor a raw bore unused as i am to public speaking mr speaker i feel myself on the present occasion called upon not to give a silent vote for old stagers in the whole course of my parliamentary career never did i rise with such diffidence in reply the bore begins with it would be presumption in me mr speaker after the able luminous learned and eloquent speech you have just heard to attempt to throw any new light but c c for a premeditated harangue of four hours or upwards he regularly commences with at this late hour of the night i shall trouble the house with only a few words mr speaker the speaker of the english house of commons is a man destined to be bored doomed to sit in a chair all night longnight after nightmonth after monthyear after yearbeing bored no relief for him but crossing and uncrossing his legs from time to time no respite if he sleep it must be with his eyes open fixed in the direction of the haranguing bore he is not however bound bon fide to hear all that is said this happily was settled in the last century mr speaker it is your duty to hear meit is the undoubted privilege sir of every member of this house to be heard said a bore of the last century to the then speaker of the house of commons sir replied the speaker i know that it is the undoubted right of every member of this house to speak but i was not aware that it was his privilege to be always heard the courtierbore has sometimes crept into the english parliamentbut is common on the continent infinite varieties as le courtisan propre courtisan homme dtat and le courtisan philosophea curious but not a rare kind in france of which m de voltaire was one of the finest specimens attempts had been made to naturalize some of the varieties of the philanthropic and sentimental french and german bores in england but without success some ladies had them for favourites or pets but they were found mischievous and dangerous their morality was easybut difficult to understand compounded of threefourths sentimentninetenths selfishness twelveninths instinct selfdevotion metaphysics and cant twas hard to come at a common denominator john bull with his four rules of vulgar arithmetic could never make it out altogether he never could abide these foreign bores thought em confounded dull toocivilly told them so and half asleep bid them prythee begonethey not taking the hint but lingering with the women at last john wakening outright fell to in earnest and routed them out of the island they still flourish abroad often seen at the tables of the great the demiphilosophemodernepoliticolegislativometaphysicononlogicogrand philanthrope still scribbles by the ream pices justificatives projets de loi and volumes of metaphysical sentiment to be seen at the fair of leipzig or on ladies tables the greater bore the courtisan propre is still admired at little serene courts where welldressed and welldrilledhis back much bent with germanic bows not a dangerous creaturewould only bore you to death we come next to our own blue boresthe most dreaded of the speciesthe most abusedsometimes with reason sometimes without this species was formerly rare in britainindeed all over the worldlittle known from the days of aspasia and corinna to those of madame dacier and mrs montague mr jerninghams blue worsted stockings as all the world knows appearing at mrs montagues conversaziones had the honour or the dishonour of giving the name of blue stockings to all the race and never did race increase more rapidly than they have done from that time to this there might be fear that all the daughters of the land should turn bluebut as yet john bullthank heaven retains his good old privilege of choose a wife and have a wife the common female blue is indeed intolerable as a wifeopinionative and opinionated and her opinion always is that her husband is wrong john certainly has a rooted aversion to this whole class there is the deep blue and the light the light blues not esteemednot admitted at almacks the deepdyed in the nine times dyed blueis that with which no man dares contend the blue chatterer is seen and heard every where it no man will attempt to silence by throwing the handkerchief the next speciesthe mock blueis scarcely worth noticing gone to ladies maids dressmakers milliners c found of late behind counters and in the oddest places the blue mocking bird it must be noted though nearly allied to the last sort is found in high as well as in low company it is a provoking creature the only way to silence it and to prevent it from plaguing all neighbours and passengers is never to mind it or to look as if you minded it when it stares at you stare and pass on the conversazione blue or bureau desprit blue it is remarkable that in order to designate this order we are obliged to borrow from two foreign languagesa proof that it is not natural to england but numbers of this order have been seen of late years chiefly in london and bath during the season the bureau desprit or conversazione blue is a most hardworking creaturethe servant of the servants of the publicif a dinnergiving blue and none others succeed well or long champagne and ice and the best of fish are indispensable she may then be at home once a week in the evening with a chance of having her house fuller than it can hold of all the wouldbe wits and three or four of the leaders of london very thankful she must be for the honour of their company she had need to have all the superlatives in and out of the english language at her tongues end and when she has exhausted these then she must invent new she must have tones of admiration and looks of ecstasy for every occasion at reading partiesespecially at her own house she must crycharmingdelightful quite original in the right places even in her sleepawake or asleep she must read every thing that comes out that has a name or she must talk as if she hadat her perilto the authors themselvesthe irritable raceshe must know more especially every article in the edinburgh and quarterly reviews and at her peril too must talk of these so as not to commit herself so as to please the reviewer abusing and the author abused she must keep the peace between rival witsshe must swallow her own vanitymany fail in this last attemptchoke publicly and give it up i am sorry that so much has been said about the blues sorry i mean that such a hue and cry has been raised against them all good bad and indifferent john bull would have settled it best in his quiet way by just letting them alone leaving the disagreeable ones to die off in single blessedness but people got about john and made him set up one of his no popery cries and when becomes to that pitch be loses his senses and his common sense completely no blues down with the bluesnow what good has all that done only made the matter ten times worse in consequence of this universal hubbub a new order of things has arisen the blue bore disguised or the renegade blue these may be detected by their extraordinary fear of being taken for blues hold up the picture or even the sign of a blue bore before them and they immediately write under it tis none of me they spend their lives hiding their talent under a bushel all the time in a desperate fright lest you should see it a poor simple man does not know what to do about it or what to say or think in their company so as to behave himself rightly and not to affront them solomon himself would be put to it to make some of these authoresses unknown avow or give up their own progeny their affectation is beyond the affectation of woman and it makes all men sick others without affectation are only arrant cowards they are afraid to stand exposed on their painful preeminence some from pure goodnature make themselves ridiculous imagining that they are nine feet high at the least shrink and distort themselves continually in condescension to our inferiority or lest we should be blasted with excess of light come into company shading their farthing candleburning blue pale and faint it should be noticed that the bore condescending is peculiarly obnoxious to the proud man besides the bore condescending who whether goodnatured or illnatured is a most provoking animalthere is the bore facetious an insufferable creature always laughing but with whom you can never laugh and there is another exotic varietythe vive la bagatelle bore of the ape kindwho imitate men of genius having early been taught that there is nothing more delightful than the unbending of a great mind they set about continually to unbend the bow in company of the spring and fall the ebb and tide of genius we have heard much from milton dryden and others at ebb timea time which must come to all pretty or rich treasures are discovered upon some shores or golden sands are seen when the waters run low in others bare rocks slime or reptiles may i never be at low tide with a bore despising the bagatelle there is the serious regular conversation bore who listens to himself talks from notes and is witty by rule all rules for conversation were no doubt invented by bores and if followed would make all men and women bores either in straining to be witty or striving to be easy there is no more certain method even for him who may possess the talent in the highest degree to lose the power of conversing than by talking to support his character one eye to your reputation one on the company would never do were it with the best of eyes few people are of descartes mind that squinting is pretty it has been said that pleasure never comes if you send her a formal card of invitation to a conversazione certainly never whatever she might to a dinnerparty ease cannot stay wit flies away and humour grows dull if people try for them wellbred persons abhorring the pedantry of the blues are usually antiblues or ultraantis but though there exists in a certain circle a natural honest aversion to every thing like wit or learning is it absolutely certain that if taking thought wont do it taking none will do they are determined they declare to have easy conversation or none but let the ease be highbred and silent as possiblelet it be the repose of the transcendentalthe deathlike silence of the exclusive in the perfumed atmosphere of the exquisite then begins the danger of going to sleepdesperate danger in these high circles are to be found apparently the most sleepy of all animated beings apparently i say because on close observation it will usually be found that like the spider who from fear counterfeits death these from pride counterfeit sleep they will sometimes pretend to be asleep for hours together when any person or persons are near whom they do not choose to notice they lie stretched on sofas rolled up in shawls most part of the day quite empty at certain hours of the night found congregated sitting up dressed on beds of roses back to back with eyes scarce open they are observed to give sign of animation only on the approach of a bluetheir antipathy they then look at each other and shrink that the shamsleeping bore is a delicate creature i shall not dispute but they are intolerably tiresome for my own part i would rather give up the honour and the elegance and go to the antipodes at once and live with their antagonists the lionhuntersyea the lionloving bores their antipodes did i say that was going too far even the most exaggerated ultraantiblues upon occasion forget themselves strangely and have been seen to join the common herd in running after lions but they differ from the bluelionlovingbore proper by never treating the lion as if he were one of themselves they follow and feed and fall down and worship the lion of the season still unless he be a nobleman which but rarely occurs he is never treated as a gentleman quite there is always a difference made better understood than described i have heard lions of my acquaintance complain of showing themselves off to these ultraantis and have asked why they let themselves be made lions if they disliked it so much as no lion can well be led about i should have conceived quite against his will i never could obtain any answer but that indeed they could not help it they were very sorry but indeed they could not help being lions and the polite lionloving bore always echoed this and addressed them with some such speech as the followingmy dearest sir madam or miss as the case may be i know that of all things you detest being made a lion and that you cant bear to be worshipped yet my dear sir madam or miss you must let me kneel down and worship you and then you must stand on your hind legs a little for me only for one minute my dear sir and i really would not ask you to do it only you are such a lion but i have not yet regularly described the genus and species of which i am treating the great lionhunting bore and the little lionloving bore male and female of both kinds the male as eager as the female to fasten on the lion and as expert in making the most of him alive or dead as seen in the finest example extant bozzy and piozzi fairly pitted but the male beat the female hollow the common lionhunting bore is too well known to need particular description but some notice of their habitudes may not be useless for avoidance the whole class male subsists by fetching and carrying bays grasping at notes and scraps if any great name be to them run wild after verses in ms fond of autographs the females carry albums some learn bon mots by rote and repeat them like parrots others do not know a good thing when they meet with it unless they are told the name of the cook some relish them really but eat till they burst others after cramming to stupidity would cram you from their pouch as the monkey served gulliver on the housetop the whole tribe are foul feeders at best love trash and fatten upon scraps the worst absolutely rake the kennels and prey on garbage they stick with amazing tenacity almost resembling canine fidelity and gratitude to the remains of the dead lion but in fact their love is like that of the ghowl worse than ghowls they sell all which they do not destroy every scrap of the dead lion may turn to account it is wonderful what curious saleable articles they make of the parings of his claws and hairs of his mane the bear has been said to live at need by sucking his own paws the bore lives by sucking the paws of the lion on which he thrives apace and in some instances has grown to an amazing size the dead paws are as good for his purpose as the living and betterthere being no fear of the claws how he escapes those claws when the lion is alive is the wonder the winged lion however is above touching these creatures and the real gentleman lion of the true blood in whose nature there is nothing of the bear will never let his paws be touched by a bore his hair stands on end at the approach or distant sight of any of the kind lesser or greater but very difficult he often finds it to avoid them any other may more easily than a lion shirk a bore it is often attempted but seldom or never successfully he hides in his den but not at home will not always do the lion is too civil to shut the door in the bores very face though he mightily wishes to do so it is pleasant sport to see a great bore and lion opposed to each other how he stands or sits upon his guard how cunningly the bore tries to fasten upon him and how the lion tries to shake him offif the bore persists beyond endurance the lion roars and he flies or the lion springs and he dies a more extraordinary circumstance than any i have yet noted respecting the natural history of lions and bores remains to be told that the lion himself the greater kind as well as the lesser of him are apt sooner or later to turn into bores but the metamorphosis though the same in the result takes place in different circumstances and from quite different causes with the lesser lion and lioness often from being shown or showing themselves too frequently with the greater from very fear of being like the animal he detests i once knew a gentleman not a bore quite but a very clever man one of great sensibility and excessive sensitiveness who could never sit still a quarter of an hour together never converse with you comfortably or finish a good story but evermore broke off in the middle with i am boring youi must run away or i shall be a bore it ended in his becoming that which he most feared to be there are a few rare exceptions to all that has been said of the caprices or weaknesses of lions the greatest of lions known or unknown the most agreeable as well as the noblest of creatures is quite free from these infirmities he neither affects to show himself nor lies sullen in his den i have somewhere seen his picture sketched i should guess by himself at some moment i when the lion turned painter i pique myself upon being one of the best conditioned animals that ever was shown since the time of him who was in vain i defied by the knight of the woful figure for i get up at the first touch of the pole rouse myself shake my mane lick my chops turn round lie down and go to sleep again it was bad policy in me to let the words go to sleep sound upon the readers ear for i have not yet quite done i have one more class and though last not least were i to adopt that enigmatical style which made the fortune of the oracle of apollo i might addand though least greatest but this the oracular sublime has now gone to the gipsies and the conjurors and i must write plain english if i can i am come to the crass of the infant borethe infant reciting bore seemingly insignificant but exceedingly tiresome also exceedingly dangerous as i shall show the old of this class we meet wherever we goin the forum the temple the senate the theatre the drawingroom the boudoir the closet the young infest our homes pursue us to our very hearths our household deities are in league with them they destroy all our domestic comfort they become public nuisances widely destructive to our literature their mode of training will explain the nature of the danger the infant reciting bore is trained much after the manner of a learned pig before the quadruped are placed on certain bits of dirty greasy cards the letters of the alphabet or short nonsensical phrases interrogatory with their answers such as who is the greatest rogue in company which lady or gentleman in company will be married first by the alternate use of blows and bribes of such food as pleases the pig the animal is brought to obey certain signs from his master and at his bidding to select any letter or phrase required from amongst those set before him goes to his lessons seems to read attentively and to understand then by a motion of his snout or a welltimed grunt designates the right phrase and answers the expectations of his master and the company the infant reciter is in similar manner trained by alternate blows and bribes almonds and raisins and bumpers of sweet wine but mark the difference between him and the pig instead of greasy letters and old cards which are used for the learned pig before the little human animal are cast the finest morsels from our first authors selections from our poets didactic pathetic and sublimeevery creatures best sacrificed these are to be slowly but surely deprived of spirit sense and life by the deadly deadening power of iteration not only are they deprived of life but mangled by the infant borenot only mangled but pollutedleft in such a state that no creature of any delicacy taste or feeling can bear them afterwards and are immortal works or works which fond man thought and called immortal thus to perish thus are they doomed to destruction by a lilliputian race of vandals the curse of minerva be on the heads of those who train who incite them to such sacrilegious mischief the mischief spreads every day wide and more wide till of late years there had appeared bounds to its progress nature seemed to have provided against the devastations of the infant reciter formerly it seemed that only those whom she had blessed or cursed with a wonderful memory could be worth the trouble of training or by the successful performance of the feats desired to pay the labour of instruction but there has arisen in the land men who set at nought the decrees of nature who undertake to make artificial memories not only equal but superior to the best natural memory and who at the shortest notice engage to supply the brainless with brains by certain technical helps long passages whole poems may now be learnt by heart as they call it without any aid effort or cognizance of the understanding and retained and recited under the same circumstances by any irrational as well and better than by any rational being if to recite well mean to repeat without missing a syllable how far our literature may in future suffer from these blighting swarms will best be conceived by a glance at what they have already withered and blasted of the favourite productions of our most popular

a momentary effect though he knocked down the pair that had attempted to stand before him they got up again or one down another came on to this hour they are at it what can be done against a race of beings not capable of being touched even by ridicule what can we hope when the infant bore and his trainers have stood against the incomparable humour of thinks i to myself in timeand as certainly as

ladies sitting in a formal circle petrifying into perfect statues cried sir ulick oshane as he entered the drawingroom between ten and eleven oclock at night accompanied by what he called his rearguard veterans of the old school of good fellows who at those times in irelandtimes long since pastdeemed it essential to health happiness and manly character to swallow and show themselves able to stand after swallowing a certain number of bottles of claret per day or night now then continued sir ulick of all the figures in nature or art the formal circle is universally the most obnoxious to conversation and to me the most formidable all my faculties are spellboundhere i am like a bird in a circle of chalk that dare not move so much as its head or its eyes and cant for the life of it take to its legs a titter ran round that part of the circle where the young ladies satsir ulick was a favourite and they rejoiced when he came among them because as they observed he always said something pleasant or set something pleasant agoing lady oshane for mercys sake let us have no more of these permanent circle sittings at castle hermitage my dear sir ulick i am sure i should be very glad if it were possible replied lady oshane to have no more permanent sittings at castle hermitage but when gentlemen are at their bottle i really dont know what the ladies can do but sit in a circle cant they dance in a circle or any way or have not they an elegant resource in their music theres many here who to my knowledge can caper as well as they modulate said sir ulick to say nothing of cards for those that like them lady annaly does not like cards said lady oshane and i could not ask any of these young ladies to waste their breath and their execution singing and playing before the gentlemen came out these young ladies would not im sure do us old fellows the honour of waiting for us and the young beaux deserted to your teatable a long hour agoso why you have not been dancing is a mystery beyond my comprehension tea or coffee sir ulick oshane for the third time of asking cried a sharp female voice from the remote teatable wouldnt you swear to that being the voice of a presbyterian whispered sir ulick over his shoulder to the curate then aloud he replied to the lady miss black you are three times too obliging neither tea nor coffee ill take from you tonight i thank you kindly fortunate for yourself sirfor both are as cold as stonesand no wonder said miss black no wonder echoed lady oshane looking at her watch and sending forth an ostentatious sigh what oclock is it by your ladyship asked miss black i have a notion its tremendously late no matterwe are not pinned to hours in this house miss black said sir ulick walking up to the teatable and giving her a look which said as plainly as look could say you had better be quiet lady oshane followed her husband and putting her arm within his began to say something in a fondling tone and in a most conciliatory manner she went on talking to him for some moments he looked absent and replied coldly ill take a cup of coffee from you now miss black said he drawing away his arm from his wife who looked much mortified we are too long lady oshane added he standing here like lovers talking to no one but ourselvesawkward in company like lovers the sound pleased poor lady oshanes ear and she smiled for the first time this nightlady oshane was perhaps the last woman in the room whom a stranger would have guessed to be sir ulicks wife he was a fine gallant offhand looking irishman with something of dash in his tone and air which at first view might lead a common observer to pronounce him to be vulgar but at five minutes after sight a good judge of men and manners would have discovered in him the power of assuming whatever manner he chose from the audacity of the callous profligate to the deference of the accomplished courtierthe capability of adapting his conversation to his company and his views whether his object were to set the senseless table in a roar or to insinuate himself into the delicate female heart of this latter power his age had diminished but not destroyed the influence the fame of former conquests still operated in his favour though he had long since passed his splendid meridian of gallantry while sir ulick is drinking his cup of cold coffee we may look back a little into his family history to go no farther than his legitimate loves he had successively won three wives who had each in her turn been desperately enamoured the first he loved and married imprudently for love at seventeen the second he admired and married prudently for ambition at thirty the third he hated but married from necessity for money at fiveandforty the first wife miss annaly after ten years martyrdom of the heart sank childlessa victim it was said to love and jealousy the second wife lady theodosia struggled stoutly for power backed by strong and high connexions having moreover the advantage of being a mother and mother of an only son and heir the representative of a father in whom ambition had by this time become the ruling passion the lady theodosia stood her ground wrangling and wrestling through a fourteen years wedlock till at last to sir ulicks great relief not to say joy her ladyship was carried off by a bad fever or a worse apothecary his present lady formerly mrs scraggs a london widow of very large fortune happened to see sir ulick when he went to present some address or settle some point between the english and irish governmenthe was in deep mourning at the time and the widow pitied him very much but she was not the sort of woman he would ever have suspected could like himshe was a strict pattern lady severe on the times and not unfrequently lecturing young men gratis now sir ulick oshane was a sinner how then could he please a saint he did howeverbut the saint did not please himthough she set to work for the good of his soul and in her own person relaxed to please his taste even to the wearing of rouge and pearlpowder and false hair and false eyebrows and all the falsifications which the settersup could furnish but after she had purchased all of youth which age can purchase for money it would not do the widow scraggs might with her lack lustre eyes have speculated for ever in vain upon sir ulick but that fortunately for her passion at one and the same time the irish ministry were turned out and an irish canal burst sir ulick losing his place by the change of ministry and one half of his fortune by the canal in which it had been sunk and having spent in unsubstantial schemes and splendid living more than the other half now in desperate misery laid hold of the widow scraggs after a nine days courtship she became a bride and she and her plum in the stocksbut not her messuage house and lands in kentbecame the property of sir ulick oshane love was then lord of all with her and she was now to accompany sir ulick to ireland late in life she was carried to a new country and set down among a people whom she had all her previous days been taught to hold in contempt or aversion she dreaded irish disturbances much and irish dirt more she was persuaded that nothing could be right good or genteel that was not english her habits and tastes were immutably fixed her experience had been confined to a london life and in proportion as her sphere of observation had been contracted her disposition was intolerant she made no allowance for the difference of opinion customs and situation much less for the faults or foibles of people who were to her strangers and foreignersher ladyship was therefore little likely to please or be pleased in her new situation her husband was the only individual the only thing animate or inanimate that she liked in irelandand while she was desperately in love with an irishman she disliked ireland and the irish even the irish talents and virtues their wit humour generosity of character and freedom of manner were lost upon herher country neighbours were repelled by her air of taciturn selfsufficiencyand she for her part declared she would have been satisfied to have lived alone at castle hermitage with sir ulick but sir ulick had no notion of living alone with her or for any body his habits were all social and convivialhe loved show and company he had been all his life in the habit of entertaining all ranks of people at castle hermitage from his excellency the lordlieutenant and the commanderinchief for the time being to tim the gauger and honest tom kelly the stalko he talked of the necessity of keeping up a neighbourhood and maintaining his interest in the county as the first duties of man ostensibly sir ulick had no motive in all this but the hospitable wish of seeing castle hermitage one continued scene of festivity but under this good fellowship and apparent thoughtlessness and profusion there was an eye to his own interest and a keen view to the improvement of his fortune and the advancement of his family with these habits and views it was little likely that he should yield to the romantic jealous or economic tastes of his new ladya bride ten years older than himself lady oshane was soon after her arrival in ireland compelled to see her house as full of company as it could possibly hold and her ladyship was condemned eternally to do the honours to successive troops of friends of whom she knew nothing and of whom she disliked all she saw or heard her dear sir ulick was or seemed so engrossed by the business of pleasure so taken up with his guests that but a few minutes in the day could she ever obtain of his company she saw herself surrounded by the young the fair and the gay to whom sir ulick devoted his assiduous and gallant attentions and though his age and his being a married man seemed to preclude in the opinion of the cool or indifferent spectator all idea of any real cause for jealousy yet it was not so with poor lady oshanes magnifying imagination the demon of jealousy tortured her and to enhance her sufferings she was obliged to conceal them lest they should become subjects of private mockery or public derision it is the peculiar misfortune or punishment of misplaced and yet more of unseasonable passions that in their distresses they obtain no sympathy and while the passion is in all its consequence tragic to the sufferer in all its exhibitions it isludicrous to the spectator lady oshane could not be young and would not be old so without the charms of youth or the dignity of age she could neither inspire love nor command respect nor could she find fit occupation or amusement or solace or refuge in any combination of company or class of society unluckily as her judgment never discriminating was now blinded by jealousy the two persons of all his family connexions upon whom she pitched as the peculiar objects of her fear and hatred were precisely those who were most disposed to pity and befriend herto serve her in private with sir ulick and to treat her with deference in public these two persons were lady annaly and her daughter lady annaly was a distant relation of sir ulicks first wife during whose life some circumstances had occurred which had excited her ladyships indignation against him for many years all commerce between them had ceased lady annaly was a woman of generous indignation strong principles and warm affections her rank her high connexions her high character her having from the time she was left a young and beautiful widow devoted herself to the education and the interests of her children her having persevered in her lofty course superior to all the numerous temptations of love vanity or ambition by which she was assailed her long and able administration of a large property during the minority of her son her subsequent graceful resignation of power his affection gratitude and deference for his mother which now continued to prolong her influence and exemplify her precepts in every act of his own altogether placed this lady high in public considerationhigh as any individual could stand in a country where national enthusiastic attachment is ever excited by certain noble qualities congenial with the irish nature sir ulick oshane sensible of the disadvantage of having estranged such a family connexion and fully capable of appreciating the value of her friendship had of late years taken infinite pains to redeem himself in lady annalys opinion his consummate address aided and abetted and concealed as it was by his offhand manner would scarcely have succeeded had it not been supported also by some substantial good qualities especially by the natural candour and generosity of his disposition in favour of the originally strong and through all his errors wonderfully surviving taste for virtue some of his manifold transgressions might be forgiven there was much hope and promise of amendment and besides to state things just as they were he had propitiated the mother irresistibly by his enthusiastic admiration of the daughterso that lady annaly had at last consented to revisit castle hermitage her ladyship and her daughter were now on this reconciliation visit sir ulick was extremely anxious to make it agreeable besides the credit of her friendship he had other reasons for wishing to conciliate her his son marcus was just twentytwo years older than miss annalyin course of time sir ulick thought it might be a matchhis son could not possibly make a betterbeauty fortune family connexions every thing that the hearts of young and old desire besides for in sir ulicks calculations besides was a word frequently occurring besides miss annalys brother was not as strong in body as in mindin two illnesses his life had been despaired ofa third might carry him offthe estate would probably come to miss annaly besides be this hereafter as it might there was at this present time a considerable debt due by sir ulick to these annalys with accumulated interest since the time of his first marriage and this debt would be merged in miss annalys portion should she become his sons wife all this was well calculated but to say nothing of the character or affections of the son sir ulick had omitted to consider lady oshane or he had taken it for granted that her love for him would induce her at once to enter into and second his views it did not so happen on the contrary the dislike which lady oshane took at sight to both the mother and daughterto the daughter instinctively at sight of her youth and beauty to the mother reflectively on account of her matronly dress and dignified deportment in too striking contrast to her own frippery appearanceincreased every day and every hour when she saw the attentions the adoration that sir ulick paid to miss annaly and the deference and respect he showed to lady annaly all for qualities and accomplishments in which lady oshane was conscious that she was irremediably deficient sir ulick thought to extinguish her jealousy by opening to her his views on miss annaly for his son but the jealousy taking only a new direction strengthened in its course lady oshane did not like her stepsonhad indeed no great reason to like him marcus disliked her and was at no pains to conceal his dislike she dreaded the accession of domestic power and influence he would gain by such a marriage she could not bear the thoughts of having a daughterinlaw brought into the houseplaced in eternal comparison with her sir ulick oshane was conscious that his marriage exposed him to some share of ridicule but hitherto except when his taste for raillery and the diversion of exciting her causeless jealousy interfered with his purpose he had always treated her ladyship as he conceived that lady oshane ought to be treated naturally goodnatured and habitually attentive to the sex he had indeed kept up appearances better than could have been expected from a man of his former habits to a woman of her ladyships present age but if she now crossed his favourite scheme it would be all over with herher submission to his will had hitherto been a sufficient and a convenient proof and the only proof he desired of her love her ladyships evil genius in the shape of miss black her humble companion was now busily instigating her to be refractory miss black had frequently whispered that if lady oshane would show more spirit she would do better with sir ulick that his late wife lady theodosia had ruled him by showing proper spirit that in particular she should make a stand against the encroachments of sir ulicks son marcus and of his friend and companion young ormond in consequence of these suggestions lady oshane had most judiciously thwarted both these young men in trifles till she had become their aversion this aversion marcus felt more than he expressed and ormond expressed more strongly than he felt to sir ulick his son and heir was his first great object in life yet though in all things he preferred the interest of marcus he was not as fond of marcus as he was of young ormond young ormond was the son of the friend of sir ulick oshanes youthful and warmhearted daysthe son of an officer who had served in the same regiment with him in his first campaign captain ormond afterwards made an unfortunate marriagethat is a marriage without a fortunehis friends would not see him or his wifehe was soon in debt and in great distress he was obliged to leave his wife and go to india she had then one child at nurse in an irish cabin she died soon afterwards sir ulick oshane took the child that had been left at nurse into his own house from the time it was four years old little harry ormond became his darling and grew up his favourite sir ulicks fondness however had not extended to any care of his educationquite the contrary he had done all he could to spoil him by the most injudicious indulgence and by neglect of all instruction or discipline marcus had been sent to school and college but harry ormond meantime had been let to run wild at home the gamekeeper the huntsman and a cousin of sir ulick who called himself the king of the black islands had had the principal share in his education captain ormond his father was not heard of for many years and sir ulick always argued that there was no use in giving harry ormond the education of an estated gentleman when he was not likely to have an estate moreover he prophesied that harry would turn out the cleverest man of the two and in the progress of the two boys towards manhood sir ulick had shown a strange sort of double and inconsistent vanity in his sons acquirements and in the orphan harrys natural genius harrys extremely warm generous grateful temper delighted sir ulick but he gloried in the superior polish of his own son harry ormond grew up with all the faults that were incident to his natural violence of passions and that might necessarily be expected from his neglected and deficient education his devoted gratitude and attachment to his guardian father as he called sir ulick made him amenable in an instant even in the height and tempest of his passions to whatever sir ulick desired but he was ungovernable by most other people and rude even to insolence where he felt tyranny or suspected meanness miss black and he were always at open war to lady oshane he submitted though with an ill grace yet he did submit for his guardians sake where he himself only was concerned but most imprudently and fiercely he contended upon every occasion where marcus when aggrieved had declined contending with his motherinlaw upon the present occasion the two youths had been long engaged to dine with and keep the birthday of mr cornelius oshane the king of the black islandsnext to sir ulick the being upon earth to whom harry ormond thought himself most obliged and to whom he felt himself most attached this he had represented to lady oshane and had earnestly requested that as the day for the intended dance was a matter of indifference to her it might not be fixed on this day but her ladyship had purposely made it a trial of strength and had insisted upon their returning at a certain hour she knew that sir ulick would be much vexed by their want of punctuality on this occasion where the annalys were concerned though in general punctuality was a virtue for which he had no regard sir ulick had finished his cup of coffee miss black send away the teathingssend away all these things cried he young ladies better late than never you knowlets have dancing now clear the decks for action the young ladies started from their seats immediately all was now in happy motion the servants answered promptlythe teathings retired in hastetables rolled awaychairs swung into the backgroundthe foldingdoors of the dancingroom were thrown openthe pyramids of waxcandles in the chandeliers for this was ere argands were on earth started into lightthe musicians tuning screwing scraping sounded discordant as they were joyful notes of preparation but wheres my sonwheres marcus said sir ulick drawing lady oshane aside i dont see him any where no said lady oshane you know that he would go to dine today with that strange cousin of yours and neither he nor his companion have thought proper to return yet i wish you had given me a hint said sir ulick and i would have waited for marcus ought to lead off with miss annaly oughtto be sure said lady oshane but that is no rule for young gentlemens conduct i told both the young gentlemen that we were to have a dance tonight i mentioned the hour and begged them to be punctual young men are never punctual said sir ulick but marcus is inexcusable tonight on account of the annalys sir ulick pondered for a moment with an air of vexation then turning to the musicians who were behind him you fourandtwenty fiddlers all in a row you gentlemen musicians scrape and tune on a little longer if you please remember you are not ready till i draw on my gloves break a string or two if necessary we willwe shallplase your honour i wish lady oshane continued sir ulick in a lower tone i wish you had given me a hint of this truth to tell sir ulick i did i own conceive from your walk and way that you were not in a condition to take any hint i could give pshaw my dear after having known me i wont say loved me a calendar year how can you be so deceived by outward appearances dont you know that i hate drinking but when i have these county electioneering friends the worthy red noses to entertain i suit myself to the company by acting spirits instead of swallowing them for i should scorn to appear to flinch this was true sir ulick could and often did to the utmost perfection counterfeit every degree of intoxication he could act the rise decline and fall of the drunken man marking the whole progress from the first incipient hesitation of reason to the glorious confusion of ideas in the highest state of elevation thence through all the declining cases of stultified paralytic ineptitude down to the horizontal condition of preterpluperfect ebriety really sir ulick you are so good an actor that i dont pretend to judgei can seldom find out the truth from you so much the better for you my dear if you knew but all said sir ulick laughing if i knew but all repeated her ladyship with an alarmed look but thats not the matter in hand at present my dear sir ulick protracted the interval before the opening of the ball as long as he possibly couldbut in vainthe young gentlemen did not appear sir ulick drew on his gloves the broken strings of the violins were immediately found to be mended sir ulick opened the ball himself with miss annaly after making as handsome an apology for his son as the case would admitan apology which was received by the young lady with the most graceful goodnature she declined dancing more than one dance and sir ulick sat down between her and lady annaly exerting all his powers of humour to divert them at the expense of his cousin the king of the black islands whose tedious ferry or whose claret or more likely whose whiskeypunch he was sure had been the cause of marcuss misdemeanour it was now near twelve oclock lady oshane who had made many aggravating reflections upon the disrespectful conduct of the young gentlemen grew restless on another count the gates were left open for themthe gates ought to be locked there were disturbances in the country pshaw sir ulick said opposite directions were given at opposite doors to two servants dempsey tell them they need not lock the gates till the young gentlemen come home or at least till one oclock said sir ulick stone said lady oshane to her own man in a very low voice go down directly and see that the gates are locked and bring me the keys dempsey an irishman who was half drunk forgot to see or say any thing about it stone an englishman went directly to obey his ladys commands and the gates were locked and the keys brought to her ladyship who put them immediately into her worktable half an hour afterwards as lady oshane was sitting with her back to the glassdoor of the green house which opened into the ballroom she was startled by a peremptory tap on the glass behind her she turned and saw young ormond pale as death and stained with blood the keys of the gate instantly cried he for mercys sake chapter ii lady oshane extremely terrified had scarcely power to rise she opened the drawer of the table and thrust her trembling hand down to the bottom of the silk bag into which the keys had fallen impatient of delay ormond pushed open the door snatched the keys and disappeared the whole passed in a few seconds the music drowned the noise of the opening door and of the two chairs which ormond had thrown down those who sat near thought a servant had pushed in and gone out but however rapid the movement the full view of the figure had been seen by miss annaly who was sitting on the opposite side of the room sir ulick was sitting beside her talking earnestly lady annaly had just retired for heavens sake whats the matter cried he stopping in the middle of a sentence on seeing miss annaly grow suddenly pale as death her eyes were fixed on the door of the greenhouse his followed that direction yes said he we can get out into the air that waylean on me she did sohe pushed his way through the crowd at the bottom of the country dance and as he passed was met by lady oshane and miss black both with faces of horror sir ulick did you see pointing to the door did you see mr ormondtheres blood theres mischief certainly said miss black a quarrelmr marcus perhaps nonsense no such thing youll find said sir ulick pushing on and purposely jostling the arm of a servant who was holding a salver of ices overturning them all and whilst the surrounding company were fully occupied about their clothes and their fears and apologies he made his way onwards to the greenhouselady oshane clinging to one armmiss annaly supported by the othermiss black following repeating mischief mischief youll see sir miss black open the door and not another word he edged miss annaly on the moment the door opened dragged lady oshane after him pushed miss black back as she attempted to follow but recollecting that she might spread the report of mischief if he left her behind drew her into the greenhouse locked the door and led miss annaly out into the air bring salts water something miss blackfollow me lady oshane when im hardly ableyour wife sir ulick you might said lady oshane as she tottered on you might i should have thought no time for such thoughts my dear interrupted he sit down on the stepsthere she is better nownow what is all this i am not to speak said miss black lady oshane began to say how mr ormond had burst in covered with blood and seized the keys of the gates the keys but he had no time for that thought which way did he go i dont know i gave him the keys of both gates the two entrances were a mile asunder sir ulick looked for footsteps on the grass it was a fine moonlight night he saw footsteps on the path leading to the gardeners house stay here ladies and i will bring you intelligence as soon as possible this way sir ulickthey are coming said miss annaly who had now recovered her presence of mind several persons appeared from a turn in the shrubbery carrying some one on a handbarrowa gentleman on horseback with a servant and many persons walking sir ulick hastened towards them the gentleman on horseback spurred his horse and met him marcusis it youthank god but ormondwhere is he and what has happened the first sound of marcuss voice when he attempted to answer showed that he was not in a condition to give a rational account of any thing his servant followed also much intoxicated while sir ulick had been stopped by their ineffectual attempts to explain the people who were carrying the man on the handbarrow came up ormond appeared from the midst of them carry him on to the gardeners house cried he pointing the way and coming forward to sir ulick if he dies i am a murderer cried he who is he said sir ulick moriarty carroll please your honour answered several voices at once and how happened it said sir ulick the long and the short of it sir said marcus as well as he could articulate the fellow was insolent and we cut him downand if it were to do again id do it again with pleasure no no you wont say so marcus when you are yourself said ormond oh how dreadful to come to ones senses all at once as i didthe moment after i had fired that fatal shotthe moment i saw the poor fellow stagger and fall it was you then that fired at him interrupted sir ulick yes oh yes said he striking his forehead i did it in the fury of passion then ormond taking all the blame upon himself and stating what had passed in the strongest light against himself gave this account of the matter after having drunk too much at mr cornelius oshanes they were returning from the black islands and afraid of being late they were galloping hard when at a narrow part of the road they were stopped by some cars impatient of the delay they abused the men who were driving them insisting upon their getting out of the way faster than they could moriarty carroll made some answer which marcus said was insolent and inquiring the mans name and hearing it was carroll said all the carrolls were bad peoplerebels moriarty defied him to prove thatand added some expressions about tyranny which enraged ormond this part of the provocation ormond did not state but merely said he was thrown into a passion by some observation of moriartys and first he lifted his whip to give the fellow a horsewhipping moriarty seized hold of the whip and struggled to wrest it from his hand ormond then snatched a pistol from his holster telling moriarty he would shoot him if he did not let the whip go moriarty who was in a passion himself struggled still holding the whip ormond cocked the pistol and before he was aware he had done so the pistol accidentally went offthe ball entered moriartys breast this happened within a quarter of a mile of castle hermitage the poor fellow bled profusely and in assisting to lift him upon the handbarrow ormond was covered with blood as has been already described have you sent for a surgeon said sir ulick coolly certainlysent off a fellow on my own horse directly sir will you come on to the gardeners house i want you to see him to know what youll think if he die i am a murderer repeated ormond this horrible idea so possessed his imagination that he could not answer or hear any of the farther questions that were asked by lady oshane and miss black but after gazing upon them with unmeaning eyes for a moment in silence walked rapidly on as he was passing by the steps of the greenhouse he stopped short at the sight of miss annaly who was still sitting there whats the matter said he in a tone of great compassion going close up to her then recollecting himself he hurried forward again as i can be of no useunless i can be of any use said miss annaly i will now that i am well enough returnmy mother will wonder what has become of me sir ulick give me the key of the conservatory to let miss annaly into the ballroom miss annaly does not wish to dance any more tonight i believe said sir ulick danceoh no then without exciting observation you can all get in better at the back door of the house and miss annaly can go up the back stairs to lady annalys room without meeting any one and you lady oshane added he in a low voice order up supper and say nothing of what has passed miss black you hear what i desireno gossiping to get to the back door they had to walk round the house and in their way they passed the gardeners the surgeon had just arrived go on ladies pray said sir ulick what stops you tis i stop the way sir ulick said lady oshane to speak a word to the surgeon if you find the man in any dangerous way for pitys sake dont let him die at our gardenersindeed the bringing him here at all i think a very strange step and encroachment of mr ormonds it will make the whole thing so publicand the people hereabouts are so revengefulif any thing should happen to him it will be revenged on our whole familyon sir ulick in particular no dangernonsense my dear but now this idea had seized lady oshane it appeared to her a sufficient reason for desiring to remove the man even this night she asked why he could not be taken to his own home and his own people she repeated that it was very strange of mr ormond to take such liberties as if every thing about castle hermitage was quite at his disposal one of the men who had carried the handbarrow and who was now standing at the gardeners door observed that moriartys people lived five miles off ormond who had gone into the house to the wounded man being told what lady oshane was saying came out she repeated her words as he reappeared naturally of sudden violent temper and being now in the highest state of suspense and irritation he broke out forgetful of all proper respect miss black who was saying something in corroboration of lady oshanes opinion he first attacked pronouncing her to be an unfeeling canting hypocrite then turning to lady oshane he said that she might send the dying man away if she pleased but that if she did he would go too and that never while he existed would he enter her ladyships doors again ormond made this threat with the air of a superior to an inferior totally forgetting his own dependent situation and the dreadful circumstances in which he now stood you are drunk young man my dear ormond you dont know what you are saying interposed sir ulick at his voice and the kindness of his tone ormond recollected himself forgive me said he in a very gentle tone my head certainly is notoh may you never feel what i have felt this last hour if this man dieoh consider he will not diehe will not die i hopeat any rate dont talk so loud within hearing of these people my dear lady oshane this foolish boythis harry ormond is i grant a sad scapegrace but you must bear with him for my sake let this poor wounded fellow remain herei wont have him stirred tonightwe shall see what ought to be done in the morning ormond you forgot yourself strangely towards lady oshaneas to this fellow dont make such a rout about the business i dare say he will do very well we shall hear what the surgeon says at first i was horribly frightenedi thought you and marcus had been quarrelling miss annaly are not you afraid of staying out lady oshane why do you keep miss annaly let supper go up directly supper ay every thing goes on as usual said ormond and i i must follow them in and see how things are going on and prevent gossiping for your sake my boy resumed sir ulick after a moments pause you have got into an ugly scrape i pity you from my soulim rash myself send the surgeon to me when he has seen the fellow depend upon me if the worst come to the worst theres nothing in the world i would not do to serve you said sir ulick so keep up your spirits my boywell contrive to bring you throughat the worst it will only be manslaughter ormond wrung sir ulicks handthanked him for his kindness but repeated it will be murderit will be murdermy own conscience tells me so if he die give me up to justice youll think better of it before morning said sir ulick as he left ormond the surgeon gave ormond little comfort after extracting the bullet and examining the wound he shook his headhe had but a bad opinion of the case and when ormond took him aside and questioned him more closely he confessed that he thought the man would not livehe should not be surprised if he died before morning the surgeon was obliged to leave him to attend another patient and ormond turning all the other people out of the room declared he would sit up with moriarty himself a terrible night it was to him to his alarmed and inexperienced eyes the danger seemed even greater than it really was and several times he thought his patient expiring when he was faint from loss of blood the moments in which ormond was occupied in assisting him were the least painful it was when he had nothing left to do when he had leisure to think that he was most miserable then the agony of suspense and the horror of remorse were felt till feeling was exhausted and he would sit motionless and stupified till he was wakened again from this suspension of thought and feeling by some moan of the poor man or some delirious startings toward morning the wounded man lay easier and as ormond was stooping over his bed to see whether he was asleep moriarty opened his eyes and fixing them on ormond said in broken sentences but so as very distinctly to be understood dont be in such trouble about the likes of meill do very well youll seeand even suppose i wouldntnot a friend i have shall ever prosecuteill charge em notso be easyfor youre a good heartand the pistol went off unknownst to youim sure there was no malicelet that be your comfort it might happen to any man let alone gentlemandont take on so only think of young mr harry sitting up the night with meoh if youd go now and settle yourself yonder on tother bed sirid be a grate dale asier and i dont doubt but id get a taste of sleep myselfwhile now wid you standing over or forenent me i cant close an eye for thinking of you mr harry ormond immediately threw himself upon the other bed that he might relieve moriartys feelings the good nature and generosity of this poor fellow increased ormonds keen sense of remorse as to sleeping for him it was impossible whenever his ideas began to fall into that sort of confusion which precedes sleep suddenly he felt as if his heart were struck or twinged and he started with the recollection that some dreadful thing had happened and wakened to the sense of guilt and all its horrors moriarty now lying perfectly quiet and motionless and ormond not hearing him breathe he was struck with the dread that he had breathed his last a cold tremor came over ormondhe rose in his bed listening in acute agony when to his relief he at last distinctly heard moriarty breathing strongly and soon afterwards no music was ever so delightful to ormonds ear heard him begin to breathe loudly as if asleep the morning light dawned soon afterwards and the crowing of a cock was heard which ormond feared might waken him but the poor man slept soundly through all these usual noises the heaving of the bedclothes over his breast went on with uninterrupted regularity the gardener and his wife softly opened the door of the room to inquire how things were going on ormond pointed to the bed and they nodded and smiled and beckoned to him to come out whispering that a taste of the morning air would do him good he suffered them to lead him out for he was afraid of debating the point in the room with the sleeping patient the good people of the house who had known harry ormond from a child and who were exceedingly fond of him as all the poor people in the neighbourhood were said every thing they could think of upon this occasion to comfort him and reiterated about a hundred times their prophecies that moriarty would be as sound and good a man as ever in a fortnights time sure when hed take the soft sleep he couldnt but do well then perceiving that ormond listened to them only with faint attention the wife whispered to her husband come off to our work johnnyhed like to be alonehes not equal to listen to our talk yetits the surgeon must give him hopeand hell soon be here i trust they went to their work and left ormond standing in the porch it was a fine morningthe birds were singing and the smell of the honeysuckle with which the porch was covered wafted by the fresh morning air struck ormonds senses but struck him with melancholy every thing in nature is cheerful except myself every thing in this world going on just the same as it was yesterdaybut all changed for mewithin a few short hoursby my own folly my own madness every animal thought he as his attention was caught by the house dog who was licking his hand and as his eye fell upon the hen and chickens who were feeding before the door every animal is happyand innocent but if this man diei shall be a murderer this thought perpetually recurring so oppressed him that he stood motionless till he was roused by the voice of sir ulick oshane well harry ormond how is it with you my boythe fellows alive i hope alivethank heavenyes and asleep give ye joyit would have been an ugly thingnot but what we could have brought you through id go through thick and thin you know for you as if it were for my own son but lady oshane said sir ulick changing his tone and with a face of great concern i must talk to you about heri may as well speak now since it must be said i am afraid said ormond that i spoke too hastily last night i beg your pardon nay nay put me out of the question you may do what you please with mealways could from the time you were four years old but you know the more i love any body the more lady oshane hates them the fact is continued sir ulick rubbing his eyes that i have had a weary night of itlady oshane has been crying and whining in my ears she says i encourage you in being insolent and so forth in short she cannot endure you in the house any longer i suspect that sour one sir ulick among his intimates always designated miss black in this manner puts her up to it but i will not give up my own boyi will take it with a high hand separations are foolish things as foolish as marriages but id sooner part with lady oshane at once than let harry ormond think id forsake him especially in awkward circumstances that sir ulick is what harry ormond can never think of you he would be the basest the most suspicious the most ungratefulbut i must not speak so loud continued he lowering his voice lest it should waken moriarty sir ulick drew him away from the door for ormond was cool enough at this moment to have common sense my dear guardianfather allow me still to call you by that name continued ormond believe me your kindness is too fullyinnumerable instances of your affection now press upon me so thati cant express myself but depend upon it suspicion of your friendship is the last that could enter my mind i trust therefore you will do me the same sort of justice and never suppose me capable of ingratitudethough the time is come when we must part ormond could hardly pronounce the word part repeated sir ulick no by all the saints and all the devils in female form i am resolved said ormond firmly resolved on one pointnever to be a cause of unhappiness to one who has been the source of so much happiness to me i will no more be an object of contention between you and lady oshane give her up rather than meheaven forbid i the cause of separationnevernever i am determined let what will become of me i will no more be an inmate of castle hermitage tears started into ormonds eyes sir ulick appeared much affected and in a state of great embarrassment and indecision he could not bear to think of ithe swore it must not be then he gradually sunk to hoping it was not necessary and proposing palliatives and half measures moriarty must be moved todaysent to his own friends that point he had for peace sake conceded to her ladyship he said but he should expect on her part that after a proper a decent apology from ormond things might still be accommodated and go on smoothly if that meddling miss black would allow them in short he managed so that whilst he confirmed the young man in his resolution to quit castle hermitage he threw all the blame on lady oshane ormond never doubting the steadiness of sir ulicks affection nor suspecting that he had any secret motive for wishing to get rid of him but where can you go my dear boywhat will you do with yourselfwhat will become of you never mindnever mind what becomes of me my dear sir ill find meansi have the use of head and hands my cousin cornelius oshane he is as fond of you almost as i am and he is not cursed with a wife and is blessed with a daughter said sir ulick with a sly smile oh yes continued he i see it all now you have ways and meansi no longer objectill writeno youd write better yourself to king corny for you are a greater favourite with his majesty than i am fare ye wellheaven bless you my boy said sir ulick with warm emphasis remember whenever you want supplies castle hermitage is your bankyou know i have a bank at my back sir ulick was joined in a bankinghousecastle hermitage is your bank and heres your quarters allowance to begin with sir ulick put a purse into ormonds hand and left him chapter iii but is it natural is it possible that this sir ulick oshane could so easily part with harry ormond and thus whistle him down the wind to prey at fortune for harry ormond surely if for any creature living sir ulick oshanes affection had shown itself disinterested and steady when left a helpless infant its mother dead its father in india he had taken the child from the nurse who was too poor even to feed or clothe it as her own and he had brought little harry up at his castle with his own sonas his own son he had been his darlingliterally his spoiled child nor had this fondness passed away with the prattling playful graces of the childs first yearsit had grown with its growth harry became sir ulicks favourite companionhunting shooting carousing as he had been his plaything during infancy on no one occasion had harry violent and difficult to manage as he was to others ever crossed sir ulicks will or in any way incurred his displeasure and now suddenly without any cause except the aversion of a wife whose aversions seldom troubled him in any great degree is it natural that he should give up harry ormond and suffer him to sacrifice himself in vain for the preservation of a conjugal peace which sir ulick ought to have known could not by such a sacrifice be preserved is it possible that sir ulick should do this is it in human nature yes in the nature of sir ulick oshane long use had brought him to this though his affections perhaps were naturally warm he had on many occasions in his life sacrificed them to his scheming imaginations necessitythe necessity of his affairs the consequences of his extravagancehad brought him to this the first sacrifices had not been made without painful struggles but by degrees his mind had hardened and his warmth of heart had cooled when he said or swore in the most cordial manner that he would do any thing in the world to serve a friend there was always a mental reservation of any thing that does not hurt my own interest or cross my schemes and how could harry ormond hurt his interest or cross his schemes or how had sir ulick discovered this so suddenly miss annalys turning pale was the first cause of sir ulicks change of sentiments towards his young favourite afterwards during the whole that passed sir ulick had watched the impression made upon herhe had observed that it was not for marcus oshanes safety that she was anxious and he thought she had betrayed a secret attachment the commencement of an attachment he thought it of which she was perhaps herself unconscious were such an attachment to be confirmed it would disappoint sir ulicks schemes therefore with the cool decision of a practised schemer he determined directly to get rid of ormond he had no intention of parting with him for ever but merely while the annalys were at castle hermitage till his scheme was brought to bear he would leave harry at the black islands and he could he thought recal him from banishment and force a reconciliation with lady oshane and reinstate him in favour at pleasure but is it possible that miss annaly such an amiable and elegant young lady as she is described to be should feel any attachment any predilection for such a young man as ormond illeducated unpolished with a violent temper which had brought him early into life into the dreadful situation in which he now stands and at the moment when covered with the blood of an innocent man he stood before her an object of disgust and horror could any sentiment like love exist or arise in a wellprincipled mind certainly not sir ulicks acquaintance with unprincipled women misled him completely in this instance and deprived him of his usual power of discriminating character harry ormond was uncommonly handsome and though so young had a finelyformed manly graceful figure and his manner whenever he spoke to women was peculiarly prepossessing these personal accomplishments sir ulick thought were quite sufficient to win any ladys heartbut florence annaly was not to be won by such means no feeling of love for mr ormond had ever touched her heart nor even crossed her imagination none under such circumstances could have arisen in her innocent and wellregulated mind sudden terror and confused apprehension of evil made her grow very pale at the sight of his bloody apparition at the window of the ballroom bodily weakness for she was not at this time in strong health must be her apology if she need any for the faintness and loss of presence of mind which sir ulick construed into proofs of tender anxiety for the personal fate of this young man in the scene that followed horror of his crime pity for the agony of his remorse was what she feltwhat she strongly expressed to her mother the moment she reached her apartment that night nor did her mother who knew her thoroughly ever for an instant suspect that in her emotion there was a mixture of any sentiments but those which she expressed both mother and daughter were extremely shocked they were also struck with regret at the idea that a young man in whom they had seen many instances of a generous good disposition of natural qualities and talents which might have made him a useful amiable and admirable member of society should be thus early a victim to his own undisciplined passion during the preceding winter they had occasionally seen something of ormond in dublin in the midst of the dissipated life which he led upon one or two occasions of which we cannot now stop to give an account he had shown that he was capable of being a very different character from that which he had been made by bad education bad example and profligate indulgence or shameful neglect on the part of his guardian immediately after sir ulick had left ormond the surgeon appeared and a new train of emotions arose he had no time to reflect on sir ulicks conduct he felt hurried on rapidly like one in a terrible dream he returned with the surgeon to the wounded man moriarty had wakened much refreshed from his sleep and the surgeon confessed that his patient was infinitely better than he had expected to find him moriarty evidently exerted himself as much as he possibly could to appear better that he might calm ormonds anxiety who stood waiting with looks that showed his implicit faith in the oracle and feeling that his own fate depended upon the next words that should be uttered let no one scoff at his easy faith at this time ormond was very young not yet nineteen and had no experience either of the probability or of the fallacy of medical predictions after looking very grave and very wise and questioning and crossquestioning a proper time the surgeon said it was impossible for him to pronounce any thing decidedly till the patient should have passed another night but that if the next night proved favourable he might then venture to declare him out of immediate danger and might then begin to hope that with time and care he would do well with this opinion guarded and dubious as it was ormond was delightedhis heart felt relieved of part of the heavy load by which it had been oppressed and the surgeon was well feed from the purse which sir ulick had put into ormonds hands ormonds next business was to send a gossoon with a letter to his friend the king of the black islands to tell him all that had passed and to request an asylum in his dominions by the time he had finished and despatched his letter it was eight oclock in the morning and he was afraid that before he could receive an answer it might be too late in the day to carry a wounded man as far as the black islands he therefore accepted the hospitable offer of the village schoolmistress to give him and his patient a lodging for that night there was indeed no one in the place who would not have done as much for master harry all were in astonishment and sorrow when they heard that he was going to leave the castle and their hatred to lady oshane would have known no bounds had they learned that she was the cause of his banishment but this he generously concealed and forbade those of his followers or partisans who had known any thing of what had passed to repeat what they had heard it was late in the day before marcus rose for he had to sleep off the effects of his last nights intemperance he was in great astonishment when he learned that ormond was really going away and could scarcely believe as he said repeatedly that harry was so mad or such a fool as to moriarty a few guineas would have settled the business if no rout had been made about it sitting up all night with such a fellow and being in such agonies about himhow absurd what more could he have done if he had shot a gentleman or his best friend but harry ormond was always in extremes marcus though he had not a very clear recollection of the events of the preceding night was conscious however that he had been much more to blame than ormond had stated he had a remembrance of having been very violent and of having urged ormond to chastise moriarty it was not the first time that ormond had screened him from blame by taking the whole upon himself for this marcus was grateful to a certain degree he thought he was fond of harry ormond but he had not for him the solid friendship that would stand the test of adversity still less would it be capable of standing against any difference of party opinion marcus though he appeared a mild indolent youth was violent where his prejudices were concerned instead of being governed by justice in his conduct towards his inferiors he took strong dislikes either upon false informations or without sufficient examination of the facts cringing and flattery easily won his favour and on the other hand he resented any spirit of independence or even the least contradiction from an inferior these defects in his temper appeared more and more in him every year as he ceased to be a boy and was called upon to act as a man the consequences of his actions became of greater importance but in acquiring more power he did not acquire more reason or greater command over himself he was now provoked with ormond for being so anxious about moriarty carroll because he disliked the carrolls and especially moriarty for some slight cause not worth recording he went to ormond and argued the matter with him but in vain marcus resented this sturdiness and they parted displeased with each other though marcus expressed in words much regret at his companions adhering to the resolution of quitting his fathers house yet it might be doubted whether at the end of the conference these professions were entirely sincere whatever they might have been at the beginning he had not a large mind and perhaps he was not sorry to get rid of a companion who had often rivalled him in his fathers favour and who might rival him where it was still more his ambition to please the coldness of marcuss manner at parting and the little difficulty which he felt in the separation gave exquisite pain to poor ormond who though he was resolved to go did wish to be regretted especially by the companion the friend of his childhood the warmth of his guardians manner had happily deceived him and to the recollection of this he recurred for comfort at this moment when his heart ached and he was almost exhausted with the succession of the painful violently painful feelings of the last fourandtwenty hours the gossoon who had been sent with the despatch to the king of the black islands did not return this daydisappointment upon disappointment moriarty who had exerted himself too much that he might appear better than he really was suffered proportionably this night and so did ormond who never before having been with any person delirious from fever was excessively alarmed what he endured cannot be described it was however happy for him that he was forced to bear it allnothing less could have made a sufficient impression on his mindnothing less could have been a sufficient warning to set a guard upon the violence of his temper in the morning the fever abated about eight oclock the patient sunk into a sound sleep and ormond kneeling by his bedside ardent in devotion as in all his sentiments gave thanks to heaven prayed for moriartys perfect recovery and vowed with the strongest adjurations that if he might be spared for this offence if he might be saved from the horror of being a murderer no passion no provocation should ever during the whole future course of his life tempt him to lift his hand against a fellowcreature as he rose from his knees after making this prayer and this vow he was surprised to see standing beside him lady annalyshe had made a sign to the sick man not to interrupt ormonds devotion by any exclamation at her entrance be not disturbedlet me not feel that i embarrass you mr ormond said she i came here not to intrude upon your privacy be not ashamed young gentleman continued she that i should have witnessed feelings that do you honour and that interest me in your future fate interest lady annaly in my future fateis it possible exclaimed ormond is it possible that one of whom i stood so much in aweone whom i thought so much too good ever to bestow a thought onsuch a one as i amas i was even before this fatal his voice failed not fatal i hopei trust said lady annaly this poor mans looks at this moment assure me that he is likely to do well true for ye my lady said moriarty ill do my best surely id live through all if possible for his sake let alone my mudthers or shisters or my owntwould be too bad after all the trouble he got these two nights to be dying at last i and hanting him may be whether i would or nofor as to prosecuting that would never be any way if i died twenty times over i sint off that word to my mudthier and shister with my curse if theyd do otherand only that they were at the fair and did not get the word or the news of my little accident theyd have been here long ago and the minute they come ill swear em not to prosecute or harbour a thought of revenge again him who had no malice again me no more than a child and at anothers bidding more than his own he drew the trigger and the pistol went off unknownst in a passion so theres the case for you my lady lady annaly who was pleased with the poor fellows simplicity and generosity in this tragicomic statement of the case inquired if she could in any way afford him assistance i thank your ladyship but mr harry lets me want for nothing nor ever will while i have a farthing i can call my own cried ormond but i hope mr ormond said lady annaly smiling that when moriartyis not that his nameregains his strength to which he seems well inclined you do not mean to make him miserable and good for nothing by supporting him in idleness no he shant my ladyi would not let him be wasting his little substance on me and did ye hear my lady how he is going to lave castle hermitage well of all the surprises ever i got it come upon me like a shotmy shot was nothing to it it was necessary to insist upon moriartys submitting to be silent and quiet for not having the fear of the surgeon before his eyes and having got over his first awe of the lady he was becoming too full of oratory and action lady annaly took ormond out with her that she might speak to him of his own affairs you will not i hope mr ormond ascribe it to idle curiosity but to a wish to be of service if i inquire what your future plans in life may be ormond had never formed any distinctly he was not fit for any profession except perhaps the armyhe was too old for the navyhe was at present going he believed to the house of an old friend a relation of sir ulick mr cornelius oshane my son sir herbert annaly has an estate in this neighbourhood at which he has never yet resided but we are going there when we leave castle hermitage i shall hope to see you at annaly when you have determined on your plans perhaps you may show us how we can assist in forwarding them is it possible repeated ormond in unfeigned astonishment that your ladyship can be so very good so condescending to one who so little deserves it but i will deserve it in future if i get over thisinterested in my future fatelady annaly i knew your father many years ago said lady annaly and as his son i might feel some interest for you but i will tell you sincerely that on some occasions when we met in dublin i perceived traits of goodness in you which on your own account mr ormond have interested me in your fate but fate is an unmeaning commonplaceworse than commonplaceword it is a word that leads us to imagine that we are fated or doomed to certain fortunes or misfortunes in life i have had a great deal of experience and from all i have observed it appears to me that far the greatest part of our happiness or misery in life depends upon ourselves ormond stopped short and listened with the eagerness of one of quick feeling and quick capacity who seizes an idea that is new to him and the truth and value of which he at once appreciates for the first time in his life he heard good sense from the voice of benevolencehe anxiously desired that she should go on speaking and stood in such an attitude of attentive deference as fully marked that wish but at this moment lady oshanes footman came up with a message from his lady her ladyship sent to let lady annaly know that breakfast was ready repeating her good wishes to ormond she bade him adieu while he was too much overpowered with his sense of gratitude to return her thanks since there exists a being and such a being interested for me i must be worth somethingand i will make myself worth something more i will begin from this moment i am resolved to improve and who knows but in the end i may become every thing that is good i dont want to be great though this resolution was not steadily adhered to though it was for a time counteracted by circumstances it was never afterwards entirely forgotten from this period in consequence of the great and painful impression which had been suddenly made on his mind and from a few words of sense and kindness spoken to him at a time when his heart was happily prepared to receive them we may date the commencement of our heros reformation and improvementhero we say but certainly never man had more faults than ormond had to correct or to be corrected before he could come up to the received idea of any description of hero most heroes are born perfectso at least their biographers or rather their panegyrists would have us believe our hero is far from this happy lot the readers of his story are in no danger of being wearied at first setting out with the list of his merits and accomplishments nor will they be awed or discouraged by the exhibition of virtue above the common standard of humanitybeyond the hope of imitation on the contrary most people will comfort and bless themselves with the reflection that they never were quite so foolish nor quite so bad as harry ormond for the advantage of those who may wish to institute the comparison his biographer in writing the life of ormond deems it a point of honour to extenuate nothing but to trace with an impartial hand not only every improvement and advance but every deviation or retrograde movement chapter iv full of sudden zeal for his own improvement ormond sat down at the foot of a tree determined to make a list of all his faults and of all his good resolutions for the future he took out his pencil and began on the back of a letter the following resolutions in a sad scrawling hand and incorrect style harry osmonds good resolutions resolved stthat i will never drink more than blank number of glasses resolved ndlythat i will cure myself of being passionate resolved rdlythat i will never keep low company resolvedthat i am too fond of flatterywomens especially i like most to cure myself of that ormond here he was interrupted by the sight of a little gossoon with a short stick tucked under his arm who came pattering on barefoot in a kind of pace indescribable to those who have never seen itit was something as like walking or running as chanting is to speaking or singing the answer i am from the black islands master harry and would have been back wid you afore nightfall yesterday only heking cornywas at the fair of friskycould not write till this morning any waybut has his service to ye master harry will be in it for ye by half after two with a bed and blanket for moriarty he bid me say on account he forgot to put it in the note in the sally cove the boat will be there abow in the big lough forenent the spot where the fir dale was cut last seraph by them rogues the despatch from the king of the black islands was then produced from the messengers bosom and it ran as follows dear harry what the mischief has come over cousin ulick to be banishing you from castle hermitage but since he conformed he was never the same man especially since his last mismarriage but no use moralizinghe was always too much of a courtier for me come you to me my dear boy who is no courtier and youll be received and embraced with open armswas i briareus the same

you but am in the gout since four this morning held by the foot fastelse id not be writing but would have gone every inch of the way for you myself in style in lieu of sending which is all i can now do my sixoared boat streamers flying and piper playing like madfor i would not have you be coming like a banished man but in all glory to cornelius oshane commonly called king cornybut no king to you only your hearty old friend heaven bless cornelius oshane said harry ormond to himself as he finished this letter king or no king the most warmhearted man on earth let the other be who he will then pressing this letter to his heart he put it up carefully and rising in haste he dropped the list of his faults that train of associations was completely broken and for the present completely forgotten nor was it likely to be soon renewed at the black islands especially in the palace where he was now going to take up his residence moriarty was laid on a bed and was transported with ormond in the sixoared boat streamers flying and piper playing across the lake to the islands moriartys head ached terribly but he nevertheless enjoyed the playing of the pipes in his ear because of the air of triumph it gave master harry to go away in this grandeur in the face of the country king corny ordered the discharge of twelve guns on his landing which popped one after another gloriouslythe hospitable echoes as moriarty called them repeating the sound a horse decked with ribands waited on the shore with king cornys compliments for prince harry as the boy who held the stirrup for ormond to mount said he was instructed to call him and to proclaim him prince harry throughout the island which he did by sound of horn the whole way they proceeded to the palacevery much to the annoyance of the horse but all for the greater glory of the prince who managed his steed to the admiration of the shouting ragged multitude and of his majesty who sat in state in his gouty chair at the palace door he had had himself rolled out to welcome the coming guest by all thats princely cried he then that young harry ormond was intended for a prince he sits ahorse so like myself and that horse requires a master hand to manage him ormond alighted the gracious cordial fatherly welcome with which he was received delighted his heart welcome prince my adopted son welcome to corny castlepalace i would have said only for the constituted authorities of the postoffice that might take exceptions and not be sending me my letters right as i am neither bishop nor arch i have in their blind eyes or conceptions no rightlord help themto a temporal palace be that as it may come you in with me here into the big roomand see theres the bed in the corner for your first object my boyyour wounded chap and ill visit his wound and fix it and him the first thing for ye the minute he comes up his majesty pointed to a bed in the corner of a large apartment whose beautiful painted ceiling and cornice and fine chimneypiece with caryatides of white marble ill accorded with the heaps of oats and corn the thrashing cloth and flail which lay on the floor it is intended for a drawingroom understand said king corny but till it is finished i use it for a granary or a barn when it would not be a barrackroom or hospital which last is most useful at present to this hospital moriarty was carefully conveyed here notwithstanding his gout which affected only his feet king corny dressed moriartys wound with exquisite tenderness and skill for he had actually acquired knowledge and address in many arts with which none could have suspected him to have been in the least acquainted dinner was soon announced which was served up with such a strange mixture of profusion and carelessness as showed that the attendants who were numerous and illcaparisoned were not much used to galadays the crowd who had accompanied moriarty into the house were admitted into the diningroom where they stood round the king prince and father jos the priest as the courtiers during the kings supper at versailles surrounded the king of france but these poor people were treated with more hospitality than were the courtiers of the french king for as soon as the dishes were removed their contents were generously distributed among the attendant multitude the people blest both king and prince wishing them health and happiness long to reign over them and bowing suitably to his majesty the king and to his reverence the priest without standing upon the order of their going departed and now father jos said the king to the priest say grace and draw close and let me see you do justice to my claret or the whiskey punch if you prefer and you prince harry we will set to it regally as long as you please till teatime thought young harry till suppertime thought father jos till bedtime thought king corny at teatime young harry in pursuance of his resolution the first rose but he was seized instantly and held down to his chair the royal command was laid upon him to sit still and be a good fellow moreover the door was lockedso that there was no escape or retreat the next morning when he wakened with an aching head he recollected with disgust the figure of father jos and all the noisy mirth of the preceding night not without some selfcontempt he asked himself what had become of his resolution the wounded boy was axing for you master harry said the girl who came in to open the shutters how is he cried harry starting up he is but soberly footnote but soberlynot very well or in good spirits he got the night but middling he concaits he could not sleep becaase he did not get a sight of your honour afore hed settlei tell him tis the change of beds which always hinders a body to sleep the first night the sense of having totally forgotten the poor fellowthe contrast between this forgetfulness and the anxiety and contrition of the two preceding nights actually surprised ormond he could hardly believe that he was one and the same person then came excuses to himself gratitudecommon civilitythe peremptoriness of king cornyhis passionate temper when opposed on this tender pointthe locked doorand two to one in short there was an impossibility in the circumstances of doing otherwise than what he had done but then the same impossibilitythe same circumstancesmight recur the next night and the next and so on the peremptory temper of king corny was not likely to alter and the moral obligation of gratitude would continue the same so that at nineteen was he to become from complaisance what his soul and body abhorredan habitual drunkard and what would become of lady annalys interest in his fate or his improvement the two questions were not of equal importance but our hero was at this time far from having any just proportion in his reasoning it was well he reasoned at all the argument as to the obligation of gratitudethe view he had taken of the neverending nature of the evil which must be the consequence of beginning with weak complaisanceabove all the feeling that he had so lost his reason as not only to forget moriarty but to have been again incapable of commanding his passions if any thing had occurred to cross his temper determined ormond to make a firm resistance on the next occasion that should occur it did occur the very next night after a dinner given to his chief tenants and the genteel people of the islandsa dinner in honour and in introduction of his adopted son king corny gave a toast to the prince presumptive as he now styled hima bumper toast soon afterwards he detected daylight in harrys glass and cursing it properly he insisted on flowing bowls and full glasses what are you prince presumptuous cried he with a half angry and astonished look would you resist and contradict your father and king at his own table after dinner down with the glass farther and steady resistance changed the jesting tone and half angry look of king corny into sullen silence and a black portentous brow of serious displeasure after a decent time of sitting the bottle passing him without farther importunity ormond roseit was a hard struggle for in the face of his benefactor he saw reproach and rage bursting from every feature still he moved on towards the door he heard the words sneaking off soberlet him sneak ormond had his hand on the lock of the doorit was a bad lock and opened with difficulty theres gratitude for you no heart after alli mistook him ormond turned back and firmly standing and firmly speaking he said you did not mistake me formerly sir but you mistake me nowsneakingis there any man here sober or drunk continued be impetuously approaching the table and looking round full in every faceis there any man here dares to say so but yourselfyou you my benefactor my friend you have said itthink it you did notyou could not but say it you mayyou may say what you will to harry ormond bound to you as he isbound hand and foot and heart itrample on him as you willyou may no heart oblige me gentlemen some of you cried he his anger rising and his eyes kindling as he spoke some of you gentlemen if any of you think so oblige me by saying so no gratitude sir turning from them and addressing himself to the old man who held an untasted glass of claret as he listenedno gratitude have not itry me try me to the deathyou have tried me to the quick of the heart and i have borne it he could bear it no longer he threw himself into the vacant chair flung out his arms on the table and laying his face down upon them wept aloud cornelius oshane pushed the wine away ive wronged the boy grievously said he and forgetting the gout he rose from his chair hobbled to him and leaning over him harry tis ilook up my own boy and say you forgive me or ill never forgive myself thats well continued he as harry looked up and gave him his hand thats wellyouve taken the twinge out of my heart worse than the gout not a drop of gall or malice in your nature nor ever was more than in the child unborn but see ill tell you what youll do now harry to settle all thingsand lest the fit should take me ever to be mad with you on this score again you dont choose to drink more thans becomingwell youse right and im wrong twould be a burning shame of me to make of you what i have made of myself we must do only as well as we can but i will ensure you against the future and before we take another glasstheres the priestand you tom ferrally there step you for my swearing book harry ormond you shall take an oath against drinking more glasses than you please evermore and then youre safe from me but stayyou are a heretic phoo what am i saying twas seeing the priest put that word heretic in my headyoure not a catholic i mean but an oaths an oath taken before priest or parsonan oath taken how you will will operate but stay to make all easy tis ill take it against drinking you king corny said father jos stopping his hand and in case of the gout in your stomach against drinking do you think id perjure myself no but against pressing him to itill take my oath ill never ask him to drink another glass more than he likes the oath was taken and king corny concluded the ceremony by observing that after all there was no character he despised more than that of a sot but every gentleman knew that there was a wide and material difference betwixt a gentleman who was fond of his bottle and that unfortunate being an habitual drunkard for his own part it was his established rule never to go to bed without a proper quantity of liquor under his belt but he defied the universe to say he was ever known to be drunk at a court where such ingenious casuistry prevailed it was happy for our hero that an unqualifying oath now protected his resolution chapter v in the middle of the night our hero was wakened by a loud bellowing it was only king corny in a paroxysm of the gout his majesty was naturally of a very impatient temper and his maxims of philosophy encouraged him to the most unrestrained expression of his feelingsthe maxims of his philosophyfor he had read though in most desultory manner and he had thought often deeply and not seldom justly the turns of his mind and the questions he asked were sometimes utterly unexpected pray now said he to harry who stood beside his bed now that ive a moments easedid you ever hear of the stoics that the bookmen talk of and can you tell me what good any one of them ever got by making it a point to make no noise when theyd be punished and racked with pains of body or mind why i will tell you all they gotall they got was no pity who would give them pity that did not require it i could bleed to death in a bath as well as the best of them if i chose it or chew a bullet if i set my teeth to it with any man in a regimentbut wheres the use nature knows best and she says roar and he roaredfor another twinge seized him nature said sleep several times this night to harry and to every body in the palace but they did not sleep they could not while the roaring continued so all had reason to rejoice and moriarty in particular when his majestys paroxysm was past harry was in a sound sleep at twelve oclock the next day when he was summoned into the royal presence he found king corny sitting at ease in his bed and that bed strewed over with a variety of roots and leaves weeds and plants an old woman was hovering over the fire stirring something in a black kettle simples theseof wonderful unknown power said king corny to harry as he approached the bed and ill engage you dont know the name even of the half of them harry confessed his ignorance no shame for youwas you as wise as king solomon himself you might not know them for he did not nor couldnt he that had never set his foot a grousing on an irish bog sheelah come you over and say whats this the old woman now came to assist at this bed of botany and with spectacles slipping off and pushed on her nose continually peered over each green thing and named in irish every herb that sips the dew sheelah was deeper in irish lore than king corny could pretend to be but then he humbled her with the black hellebore of the ancients and he had in an unaccountable manner affected her imagination by talking of that famous howl of narcotic poisons which that great man socrates drank off sheelah would interrupt herself in the middle of a sentence and curtsy if she heard him pronounce the name of socratesand at the mention of the bowl she would regularly sigh and exclaim lord save usbut that was a wicked bowl then after a cast of her eyes up to heaven and crossing herself on the forehead she would take up her discourse at the word where she had left off king corny set to work compounding plasters and embrocations preparing all sorts of decoctions of roots and leaves famous through the country and while he directed and gesticulated from his bed the old woman worked over the fire in obedience to his commands sometimes however not with that prompt and mute obedience which the great require it was fortunate for moriarty that king corny not having the use of his nether limbs could not attend even in his gouty chair to administer the medicines he had made and to see them fairly swallowed sheelah whose conscience was easy on this point contented herself with giving him a strict charge to take every bottle to the last drop all she insisted upon for her own part was that she must tie the charm round his neck and arm she would fain have removed the dressings of the wound to substitute plasters of her own over which she had pronounced certain prayers or incantations but moriarty who had seized and held fast one good principle of surgery that the air must never be let into the wound held mainly to this maxim and all sheelah could obtain was permission to clap on her charmed plaster over the dressing in due time or as king corny triumphantly observed in a wonderful short period moriarty got quite well long before the kings gout was cured even with the assistance of the black hellebore of the ancients king corny was so well pleased with his patient for doing such credit to his medical skill that he gave him and his family a cabin and spot of land in the islandsa cabin near the palace and at harrys request made him his woodranger and his gamekeeperthe one a lucrative place the other a sinecure master harryprince harrywas now looked up to as a person allpowerful with the master and petitions and requests to speak for them to speak just one word came pouring from all sides but however enviable his situation as favourite and prince presumptive might appear to others it was not in all respects comfortable to himself formerly when a boy in his visits to the black islands he used to have a little companion of whom he was fonddoracornys daughter missing her much he inquired from her father where she was gone and when she was likely to return she is gone off to the continentto the continent of ireland that is but not banished for any misdemeanour you know said king corny tis generally considered as a punishment in the black islands to be banished to ireland a threat of that kind i find sufficient to bring the most refractory and illdisposed of my subjects if i had any of that description to rason in the last resort but to that ultimate law i have not recourse except in extreme cases i understand my business of king too well to wear out either shame or fear but you are no legislator yet prince harry so what was you asking me about dora she is only gone a trip to the continent to her aunts by the mothers side miss ofaley that you never saw to get the advantage of a dancingmaster which myself dont think she wantsa natural carriage with native graces being in my unsophisticated opinion worth all the dancingmasters positions contortions or drillings but her aunts of a contrary opinion and the women say it is essential so let em put dora in the stocks and punish her as they will shell be the gladder to get free and fly back from their continent to her own black islands and to you and methat is to mei ax your pardon harry ormond for you know or i should tell you in time she is engaged already to white connal of glynnfrom her birth that engagement i made with the father over a bowl of punchi promisedim afraid it was a foolish businessi promised if ever he old connal should have a son and i should have a daughter his son should marry my daughter i promised i sayi took my oath and then mrs connal that was had shortly after not one son but twoand twins they were and i hadunluckilyten years after the daughter which is doraand then as she could not marry both the one twin was to be fixed on for her and that was him they call white connalso there it was well it was altogether a rash act so youll consider her as a married woman though she is but a childit was a rash act between you and ifor connals not grown up a likely lad for the girl to fancy but thats neither here nor there no my word is passedwhen half drunk may bebut no matterit must be kept soberdrunk or sober a gentleman must keep his word fortiori a king fortiori king corny see was there this minute no such thing as parchment deed stamp signature or seal in the wide world when once corny has squeezed a friends hand on a bargain or a promise tis fast was it ever so much against metis as strong to me as if i had squeezed all the lawyers wax in the creation upon it ormond admired the honourable sentiment but was sorry there was any occasion for itand he sighed but it was a sigh of pity for dora not that he had ever seen white connal or known any thing of himbut white connal did not sound well and her fathers avowal that it had been a rash engagement did not seem to promise happiness to dora in this marriage from the time he had been a boy harry ormond had been in the habit of ferrying over to the black islands whenever sir ulick could spare him the hunting and shooting and the life of lawless freedom he led on the islands had been delightful king corny who had the command not only of boats and of guns and of fishingtackle and of men but of carpenters tools and of smiths tools and of a lathe and of brass and ivory and of all the things that the heart of boy could desire had appeared to harry when he was a boy the richest the greatest the happiest of menthe cleverest toothe most ingenious for king corny had with his own hands made a violin and a rattrap and had made the best coat and the best pair of shoes and the best pair of boots and the best hat and had knit the best pair of stockings and had made the best dunghill in his dominions and had made a quarter of a yard of fine lace and had painted a panorama no wonder that king corny had been looked up to by the imagination of childhood as a personage high as human veneration could look but now although our hero was still but a boy in many respects yet in consequence of his slight commerce with the world he had formed some comparisons and made some reflections he had heard accidentally the conversation of a few people of common sense besides the sly witty and satirical remarks of sir ulick upon cousin cornelius and it had occurred to harry to question the utility and real grandeur of some of those things which had struck his childish imagination for example he began to doubt whether it were worthy of a king or a gentleman to be his own shoemaker hatter and tailor whether it were not better managed in society where these things are performed by different tradesmen still the things were wonderful considering who made them and under what disadvantages they were made but harry having now seen and compared cornys violin with other violins and having discovered that so much better could be had for money with so much less trouble his admiration had a little decreased there were other points relative to external appearance on which his eyes had been opened in his boyish days king corny going out to hunt with hounds and horn followed with shouts by all who could ride and all who could run king corny hallooing the dogs and cheering the crowd appeared to him the greatest the happiest of mankind but he had since seen hunts in a very different style and he could no longer admire the rabble rout human creatures especially young human creatures are apt to swing suddenly from one extreme to the other and utterly to despise that which they had extravagantly admired from this propensity ormond was in the present instance guarded by affection and gratitude through all the folly of his kingship he saw that cornelius oshane was not a person to be despised he was indeed a man of great natural powers both of body and mindof inventive genius energy and perseverance which might have attained the greatest objects though from insufficient knowledge and selfsufficient perversity they had wasted themselves on absurd or trivial purposes there was a strong contrast between the characters of sir ulick and his cousin cornelius oshane they disliked and despised each other differing as far in natural disposition as the subtle and the bold their whole course through life and the habits contracted during their progress had widened the original difference the one living in the world and mixing continually with men of all ranks and character had by bending easily and being all things to all men won his courtierway onwards and upwards to the possession of a seat in parliament and the prospect of a peerage the other inhabiting a remote island secluded from all men but those over whom he reigned caring for no earthly consideration and for no human opinion but his own had for himself and by himself hewed out his way to his own objects and then rested satisfied lord of himself and all his little world his own chapter vi one morning when harry ormond was out shooting and king corny who had recovered tolerably from the gout was reinstated in his armchair in the parlour listening to father jos reading the dublin evening post a gossoon one of the runners of the castle opened the door and putting in his curly red head and bare feet announced in all haste that he just seen sir ulick oshane in the boat crossing the lake for the black islands well breathless blockhead and what of that said king cornydid you never see a man in a boat before i did plase your honour then what is there extraordinary nothing at all plase your honour onlythought your honour might like to know then you thought wrong for i neither like it nor mislike it i dont care a rush about the matterso take yourself down stairs tis a long time said the priest as the gossoon closed the door after him tis a longer time than he ought since sir ulick oshane paid his respects here even in the shape of a morning visit morning visit repeated mrs betty dunshaughlin the housekeeper who entered the room for she was a privileged person and had les grandes et les petites entres in this palacemorning visitare you sure father josare you clear he isnt come intending to stay dinner what in the devils name betty does it signify said the king about the dinner what about it said corny proudly whether he comes stays or goes ill not have a scrap or an iota of it changed added he in a despotic tone wheugh said betty one would not like to have a dinner of scrapsfor theres nothing else today for him then if there is nothing else there can be nothing else said the priest very philosophically but when strangers come to dine one would make a bit of an exertion if one could said betty its his own fault to be a stranger said father jos watching his majestys clouding countenance then whispering to betty that was a faulty string you touched upon mrs betty and cant you make out your dinner without saying any thing a person may speak in this house i suppose besides the clergy father jos said mrs betty under her breath then looking out of the window she added hes halfway over the lake and hell make his own apologies good ill engage when he comes in for he knows how to speak for himself as well as any gentlemanand i dont doubt but hell get my micky made an exciseman as he promised to and sure he has a good rightisnt he a cousin of king cornys wherefore id wish to have all things proper so ill step out and kill a couple of chickenswont i kill what you please said king corny but without my warrant nothing killed or unkilled shall come up to my table this dayand thats enough no more reasoningquit the subject and the room betty betty quitted the room but every stair as she descended to the kitchen could bear witness that she did not quit the subject and for an hour afterwards she reasoned against the obstinacy and folly of man and the chorus in the kitchen moralized in conformity and commiserationin vain meantime father jos though he regretted the exertions which mrs betty might discreetly have made in favour of a good dinner was by no means as he declared a friend or fauterer of sir ulick oshanehow could he when sir ulick had recantedthe priest looked with horror upon the apostasythe king with contempt upon the desertion of his party was he sincere any way id honour him said cornelius or forgive him but not to be ripping up old grievances when theres no occasion cant forgive the way he is at this present doubledealing with poor harry ormondcajoling the grateful heart and shirking the orphan boy that he took upon him to patronise why there i thought nobly of him and forgave him all his sins for the generous protection he afforded the son of his friend had captain ormond the father no fortune asked the priest only a trifle of three hundred a year and no provision for the education or maintenance of the boy ulicks fondness for him more than all showed him capable of the disinterested touch but then to belie his own heartto abandon him he bred a favourite just when the boy wants him mostoh how could he and all for what to please the wife he hates that cant bethats only the ostensiblebut what the raal rason is i cant guess no matterhell soon tell us tell us oh no said the priest hell keep his own secret hell let it out ill engage trying to hide it said corny like all cunning people he woodcockshides his head and forgets his body can be seen but hark he is coming up tommy said he turning to a little boy of five years old sheelahs grandchild who was playing about in the room hand me that whistle youre whistling with till i see whats the matter with it for you king corny seemed lost in examination of the whistle when sir ulick entered the room and after receiving and seating him with proud courtesy he again returned to the charge blowing through the whistle earnestly dividing his observation between sir ulick and little tommy and asking questions by turns about the whistle and about all at castle hermitage wheres my boy wheres harry ormond was the first leading question sir ulick asked harry ormonds out shooting i believe somewhere or somehow taking his pleasure as i hope he will long and always as long as he likes it at the black islands at least as long as i live sir ulick branched off into hopes of his cousin corneliuss living long very long and in general terms that were intended to avoid committing himself or pinning himself to any thing he protested that he must not be robbed of his boy that he had always with good reason been jealous of harrys affection for king corny and that he could not consent to let his term of stay at the black islands be either as long as harry himself should like or during what he hoped would be the life of his cousin cornelius oshane theres something wrong still in this whistle why if you loved him so did you let him go when you had him said corny he thought it necessary for domestic reasons replied sir ulick continental policy that is what i never understood nor never shall said corny but i dont inquire any farther if you are satisfied with yourself we are all satisfied i believe pardon me i cannot be satisfied without seeing harry this morning for ive a little business with himwill you have the goodness to send for him father jos who from the window saw harrys dog snuffing along the path to the wood thought he could not be far from the house and went to make inquiries and now when sir ulick and king corny were left alone together a dialoguea sort of single combat without any object but to try each others powers and temperensued between them in which the one on the offensive came on with a tomahawk and the other stood on the defensive parrying with a polished blade of damascus and sometimes when the adversary was off his guard making a sly cut at an exposed part what are you so busy about said sir ulick mending the childs toy said cornelius a man must be doing something in this world but a man of your ingenuity tis a pity it should be wasted as i have often said upon mere toys toys of one sort or other we are all taken up with through life from the cradle to the grave bythebye i give you joy of your baronetage i hope they did not make you pay now too much in conscience for that poor tag of nobility these things are not always matters of bargain and salemine was quite an unsolicited honour a mark of approbation and acceptance of my poor services and as such gratifyingas to the rest believe me it was not if i must use so coarse an expression paid for not paid forwhat then its owing for to be paid for still well thats too hard after all youve done for them but some men have no manner of conscience at least i hope you paid the fees the fees of coursebut we shall never understand one another said sir ulick now what will be the next title or string you look forward to ulysses may i ask is it to be baron castle hermitage or to get a riband or a garter or a thistle or whata thistle what asses some men are what savages some men are thought sir ulick he walked to the window and looking out hoped that harry ormond would soon make his appearance you are doing or undoing a great deal here cousin cornelius i see as usual yes but what i am doing stand or fall will never be my undoingi am no speculator how do your silver mines go on sir ulick i hear all the silver mines in ireland turn out to be lead i wish they did said sir ulick for then we could turn all our lead to gold those silver mines certainly did not payive a notion you found the same with your reclaimed bog here cousin corneliusi understand that after a short time it relapses and is worse than ever like most things pretending to be reclaimed speak for yourself there sir ulick said cornelius you ought to know certainly for some thirty years ago i think you pretended to be a reclaimed rake i dont remember it said sir ulick i do and so would poor emmy annaly if she was alive which its fortunate for her she is not brokenhearted angel if ever there was one by wedlock and the only one of the annalys i ever liked said cornelius to himself in a low leisurely voice of soliloquy then resuming his conversation tone and continuing his speech to sir ulick i say you pretended thirty years ago i remember to be a reformed rake and looked mighty smooth and plausibleand promised fair that the improvement was solid and was to last for ever and a day but six months after marriage comes a relapse and the reclaimed rakes worse than ever well to be sure thats in favour of your opinion against all things pretending to be reclaimed but see my poor bog without promising so well performs better for its six years instead of six months that ive seen no tendency to relapse see the cattle upon it speak for themselves an honest calf wont lie for any man i give you joy of the success of your improvements i admire too your ploughing team and ploughing tackle said sir ulick with an ironical smile you dont go into any indiscreet expense for farming implements or prize cattle no said cornelius i dont prize the prize cattle the best prize a man can get and the only one worth having is that which he must give himself or not get and of which he is the best judge at all sasons what prize may i ask you may ask and ill answerthe prize of success and success to myself i have it and succeeding in all your ends by such noble means must be doubly gratifyingand is doubly commendable and surprising said sir ulick may i askfor its my turn now to play ignoramusmay i ask what noble means excites this gratuitous commendation and surprise i commend in the first place the economy of your ploughing tacklehay ropes hay traces and hay haltersdoubly useful and convenient for harness and food corny replied some people i know think the most expensive harness and tackle and the most expensive ways of doing every thing the best but i dont know if that is the way for the poor to grow richit may be the way for the rich to grow poor we are all poor people in the black islands and i cant afford or think it good policy to give the example of extravagant new ways of doing old things tis a pity you dont continue the old irish style of ploughing by the tail said sir ulick that is against humanity to brute bastes which without any sickening palaver of sentiment i practise also its against an act of parliament which i regard sometimesthat is when i understand them which the way you parliament gentlemen draw them up is not always particularly intelligible to plain common sense and i have no lawyers here thank heaven to consult i am forced to be legislator and lawyer and ploughman and all you see the best i can for myself he opened the window and called to give some orders to the man or as he called him the boya boy of sixtywho was ploughing your team i see is worthy of your tackle pursued sir ulicka mule a bull and two lean horses i pity the foremost poor devil of a horse who must starve in the midst of plenty while the horse bull and even mule in a string behind him are all plucking and munging away at their hay ropes cornelius joined in sir ulicks laugh which shortened its duration tis comical ploughing i grant said he but still to my fancy any things better and more profitable nor the tragicomic ploughing you practise every sason in dublin i said sir ulick ay you and all your courtiers ploughing the half acre footnote ploughing the half acre the english reader will please to inquire the meaning of this phrase from any irish courtier continually pacing up and down that castleyard while youre waiting in attendance there every one to his taste but if theres a man on earth i hate attendance and dependence be his fate after all i have very good prospects in life said sir ulick ay youve been always living on prospects for my part id rather have a molehill in possession than a mountain in prospect cornelius what are you doing here to the roof of your house said sir ulick striking off to another subject what a vast deal of work you do contrive to cut out for yourself id rather cut it out for myself than have any body to cut it out for me said cornelius upon my word this will require all your extraordinary ingenuity cousin oh ill engage ill make a good job of it in my sense of the word though not in yours for i know in your vocabulary thats only a good job where you pocket money and do nothing now my good jobs never bring me in a farthing and give me a great deal to do into the bargain i dont envy you such jobs indeed said sir ulick and are you sure that at last you make them good jobs in any acceptation of the term sure a mans never sure of any thing in this world but of being abused but one comfort my own conscience for which ive a trifling respect cant reproach me since my jobs good or bad have cost my poor country nothing on this point sir ulick was particularly sore for he had the character of being one of the greatest jobbers in ireland with a face of much political prudery which he well knew how to assume he began to exculpate himself he confessed that much public money had passed through his hands but he protested that none of it had stayed with him no man who had done so much for different administrations had been so ill paid why the deuce do you work for them then you wont tell me its for lovehave you got any character by itif you havent profit what have you i would not let them make me a dupe or may be something worse if i was you said cornelius looking him full in the face savage said sir ulick again to himself the tomahawk was too much for himsir ulick felt that it was fearful odds to stand fencing according to rule with one who would not scruple to gouge or scalp if provoked sir ulick now stood silent smiling forced smiles and looking on while cornelius played quite at his ease with little tommy blew shrill blasts through the whistle and boasted that he had made a good job of that whistle any way harry ormond to sir ulicks great relief now appeared sir ulick advanced to meet him with an air of cordial friendship which brought the honest flush of pleasure and gratitude into the young mans face who darted a quick look at cornelius as much as to say you see you were wronghe is glad to see mehe is come to see me cornelius said nothing but stroked the childs head and seemed taken up entirely with him sir ulick spoke of lady oshane and of his hopes that prepossessions were wearing off if miss black were out of the way things would all go right but she is one of the mighty goodtoo good ladies who are always meddling with other peoples business and making mischief harry who hated her that is as much as he could hate any body railed at her vehemently saying more against her than he thought and concluded by joining in sir ulicks wish for her departure from castle hermitage but not with any view to his own return thither on that point he was quite resolute and steady he would never he said be the cause of mischief lady oshane did not like himwhy he did not know and had no right to inquireand was too proud to inquire if he had a right it was enough that her ladyship had proved to him her dislike and refused him protection at his utmost need he should never again sue for her hospitality he declared that sir ulick should no more be disquieted by his being an inmate at castle hermitage sir ulick became more warm and eloquent in dissuading him from this resolution the more he perceived that ormond was positively fixed in his determination the cool lookeron all the time remarked this and cornelius was convinced that he had from the first been right in his own opinion that sir ulick was shirking the boy and wheres marcus sir would not he come with you to see us said ormond marcus is gone off to england he bid me give you his kindest love he was hurried and regretted he could not come to take leave of you but he was obliged to go off with the annalys to escort her ladyship to england where he will remain this year i dare say i am much concerned to say that poor lady annaly and miss annaly sir ulick cleared his throat and gave a suspicious look at ormond this glance at harry the moment sir ulick pronounced the words miss annaly first directed aright the attention of cornelius lady annaly and miss annaly are they ill whats the matter for heavens sake exclaimed harry with great anxiety but pronouncing both the ladies names precisely in the same tone and with the same freedom of expression sir ulick took breath neither of the ladies are illabsolutely ill but they have both been greatly shocked by accounts of young annalys sudden illness it is feared an inflammation upon his lungs brought on by violent coldhis mother and sister left us this morningset off for england to him immediately lady annaly thought of you harry my boyyou must be a prodigious favouritein the midst of all her affliction and the hurry of this sudden departure this morning she gave me a letter for you which i determined to deliver with my own hands while he spoke sir ulick affecting to search for the letter among many in his pocket studied with careless intermitting glances our young heros countenance and cornelius oshane studied sir ulicks harry tore open the letter eagerly and coloured a good deal when he saw the inside i have no business here reading that boys secrets in his face cried cornelius oshane raising himself on his crutchesill step out and look at my roof will you come sir ulick and see how the job goes on his crutch slipped as he stepped across the hearthharry ran to him oh sir what are you doing you are not able to walk yet without mewhy are you going secrets did you say the words recurred to his ear i have no secretstheres no secrets in this letterits onlythe reason i looked foolish was that heres a list of my own faults which i made like a fool and dropped like a foolbut they could not have fallen into better or kinder hands than lady annalys he offered the letter and its enclosure to cornelius and sir ulick cornelius drew back i dont want to see the list of your faults man said he do you think i havent them all by heart already and as to the ladys letter while you live never show a ladys letter sir ulick without ceremony took the letter and in a moment satisfying his curiosity that it was merely a friendly note returned it and the list of his faults to harry saying if it had been a young ladys letter i am sure you would not have shown it to me harry nor of course would i have looked at it but i presumed that a letter from old lady annaly could only be what i see it is very edifying old lady annaly is it cried cornelius oh then theres no indiscretion young man in the case you might as well scruple about your mothers letter if you had one or your mothersinlaw which to be sure youll have i hope in due course of nature at the sound of the words motherinlaw a cloud passed over sir ulicks brow not unnoticed by the shrewd cornelius but the cloud passed away quickly after sir ulick had darted another reconnoitring glance on harrys open unconscious countenance alls safe said sir ulick to himself as he took leave woodcocked that he hasas i foresaw he would cried king corny the moment his guest had departed woodcocked if ever man did by all thats cunning chapter vii king corny sat for some minutes after sir ulicks departure perfectly still and silent leaning both hands and his chin on his crutch then looking up at harry he exclaimed what a dupe you are but i like you the better for it i am glad you like me the better at all events said harry but i dont think i am a dupe noif you did you would not be one so you dont see that it was and is sir ulick and not her ladyship that wanted and wants to get rid of you no harry did not see this and would not be persuaded of it he defended his guardian most warmly he was certain of sir ulicks affection he was sure sir ulick was incapable of acting with such duplicity his majesty repeated at every pause you are a dupe but i like you the better for it and added he you dontblind buzzard as your want of conceit makes you for which i like you the better tooyou dont see the reason why he banished you from castle hermitageyou dont see that he is jealous of your rivalling that puppy marcus his son rivalling marcus in what or how with whom boy is the question you should ask and in that case the answer isdunce cant you guess nowmiss annaly miss annaly repeated harry with genuine surprise and with a quick sense of inferiority and humiliation oh sir you would not be so illnatured as to make a jest of mei know how ignorant how uninformed what a raw boy i am marcus has been educated like a gentleman more shame for his father that couldnt do the same by you when he was about it but marcus sirthere ought to be a differencemarcus is heir to a large fortunei have nothing marcus may hope to marry whoever he pleases ay whoever he pleases and who will that be if women are of my mind muttered corny ill engage if you had a mind to rival him rival him the thought of rivalling my friend never entered my head but is he your friend said cornelius as to that i dont know he was my friend and i loved him sincerelywarmlyhe has cast me offi shall never complainnever blame him directly or indirectly but dont let me be accused or suspected unjustlyi never for one instant had the treachery presumption folly or madness to think of miss annaly nor she of you i suppose youll swear nor she of me assuredly not sir said harry with surprise at the idea do you consider what i amand what she is well i am glad they are gone to england out of the way said cornelius i am very sorry for that said harry for i have lost a kind friend in lady annalyone who at least i might have hoped would have become my friend if i had deserved it might have hopedwould have becomethats a friend in the air who may never be found on earth if you deserved itmurderwho knows how that might turn outifi dont like that kind of subjunctive mood tenure of a friend give me the good imperative mood which i understandbe my friendat onceor not at allthats my mood none of your if friends for me setting out with a proviso and an excuse to be off and may be when youd call upon em at your utmost need oh i said if you deserve itlie there like a dog now what kind of a friend is that if lady annaly is that sort no need to regret her my compliments to her and a good journey to englandireland well rid of her and so are you too my boy but dear sir how you have worked yourself up into a passion against lady annaly for nothing its not for nothingive good rason to dislike the woman what business had she because shes an old woman and you a young man to set up preaching to you about your faults i hate prachers feminine gender especially she is no preacher i assure you sir how dare you tell me thatwas not her letter very edifying sir ulick said no sir it was very kindwill you read it no sir i wont i never read an edifying letter in my life with my eyes open nor never willquite enough for me that impertinent list of your faults she enclosed you that list was my own not hers sir i dropped it under a tree well drop it into the fire now and no more about it pray after all harry for curiositys sake what faults have you dear sir i thought you told me you knew them by heart i always forget what i learn by heart put me in mind and may be ill recollect as you go on well sir in the first place i am terribly passionate passionate true that is moriarty you are thinking of and i grant you that had like to have been a sad jobyou had a squeak for your life there and i pitied you as if it had been myself for i know what it is after one of them blind rages is over and one opens ones eyes on the wrong one has doneand then such a cursed feel to be penitent in vainfor that sets no bones you were blind drunk that night and that was my fault but my late vow has prevented the future and moriartys better in the world than ever he was thanks to your goodness sir oh i wasnt thinking of my goodnesslittle enough that same but to ease your conscience it was certainly the luckiest turn ever happened him the shot he got and so he says himself never think of that more in the way of penitence in the way of reformation though i hope i shall all my life said harry one comforti have never been in a passion since but then a rasonable passions allowable i wouldnt give a farthing for a man that couldnt be in a passion on a proper occasion im passionate myself rasonably passionate and i like myself the better for it i thought you said just now you often repented oh never mind what i said just nowmind what im saying now isnt a red heat that you can see and that warms you better than a white heat that blinds you id rather a man would knock me down than stand smiling at me as cousin ulick did just now when i know he could have kilt me he is not passionatehe has the command of himselfevery feature under the courtiers regimen of hypocrisy harry ormond dont set about to cure yourself of your natural passionswhy this is rank methodism all methodism sir methodism sirdont contradict or repeat memethodism that the woman has brought you to the brink of and i warn you from it i did not know till now that your lady annaly was such a methodistno methodist shall ever darken my doors or lighten them either with their new lights new lights new nonsensefor man woman or beast but enough of this and too much harry prince harry pull that bell a dozen times for me this minute till they bring out my old horse before it was possible that any one could have come up stairs the impatient monarch pointing with his crutch added run to the head of the stairs prince harry dear and call and screech to them to make no delay and i want you out with me so get your horse harry but siris it possibleare you able i am able sir possible or not cried king corny starting up on his crutches dont stand talking to me of possibilities when tis a friend i am going to serve and that friend as dear as yourself arent you at the head of the stairs yet must i go and fall down them myself to prevent this catastrophe our young hero ran immediately and ordered the horses his majesty mounted or rather was mounted and they proceeded to one of the prettiest farms in the black islands as they rode to it he seemed pleased by harrys admiring as he could with perfect truth the beauty of the situation and the landwhich you are no judge of yet but you willis as good as it is pretty said king corny which i am glad of for your sake prince harry i wont have you like that donny english prince or king they nicknamed lacklandno you shant lack land while i have it to let or give i called you princeprince of the black islandsand heres your principality call out my prime minister pat moore i sent him across the bog to meet us at moriartys here he is and moriarty along with him to welcome you patrick give prince harry possessionwith sod and twig heres the kay from my own hand and i give you joy nay dont deny me the pleasureive a right to it no wrong to my daughter if thats what you are thinking ofa clear improvement of my ownand she will have enough without it besides her betrothed white connal is a fat grazier who will make her as rich as a jew and any way she is as generous as a princess herself but if it pains you so and weighs you down as i see it does to be under any obligationyou shall be under none in life you shall pay me rent for it and you shall give it up whenever you please well well settle that between ourselves continued his majesty only take possession thats all i ask but i hope added he before weve lived a year or whatever time it is till you arrive at years of discretion youll know me well enough and love me well enough not to be so stiff about a trifle thats nothing between friend and friendlet alone the joke of king and prince dear harry the gift of this principality proved a most pernicious nearly a fatal gift to the young prince the generosity the delicacy with which it was made a delicacy worthy of the most polished and little to have been expected from the barbarian mockmonarch so touched our young heros heart so subjected his grateful spirit to his benefactor that he thenceforth not only felt bound to king corny for life but prone to deem every thing he did or thought wisest fittest best when he was invested with his petty principality it was expected of him to give a dinner and a dance to the island so he gave a dinner and a dance and every body said he was a fine fellow and had the spirit of a prince king corny god bless him couldnt go astray in his choice of a favouritelong life to him and prince harry and no doubt thered be fine hunting and shooting and coursing continually well was not it a happy thing for the islands when harry ormond first set foot on them from a boy twas asy to see what a man hed be long may he live to reign over us the taste for vulgar praise grew by what it fed upon harry was in great danger of forgetting that he was too fond of flattery and too fond of companynot the best he excused himself to himself by saying that companions of some kind or other he must have and he was in a situation where good company was not to be had then moriarty carroll was gamekeeper and moriarty carroll was always out hunting or shooting with him and he was led by kind and good feelings to be more familiar and free with this man than he would have been with any other in the same rank of life the poor fellow was ardently attached to him and repeated with delight all the praises he heard of master harry through the islands the love of popularity seized himpopularity on the lowest scale to be popular among the unknown unheardof inhabitants of the black islandscould this be an object to any man of common sense any one who had lived in civilized society and who had had any thing like the education of a gentleman the fact argue about it as you willthe fact was as is here stated and let those who hear it with a disdainful smile recollect that whether in paris london or the black islands the mob are in all essential points pretty nearly the same it happened about this time that betty dunshaughlin was rummaging in her young ladys workbasket for some riband which she knew she might take to dress a cap that was to be hung upon a pole as a prize to be danced for at the pattern footnote patron probablyan entertainment held in honour of the patron saint a festive meeting similar to a wake in england to be given next monday at ormond vale by prince harry prince harry was now standing by giving some instructions about the ordering of the entertainment betty in the mean time pursued her own object of the riband and as she emptied the basket in haste threw out a book which harry though not much at this time addicted to reading snatched impatiently eager to know what book it was it was one he had often heard ofoften intended to read some time or other but somehow or other he had never had time and now he was in the greatest possible hurry for the hounds were out but when once he had opened the book he could not shut it he turned over page after page peeped at the end the beginning and the middle then back to the beginning was diverted by the humourevery irishman loves humour delighted with the witwhat irishman is not and his curiosity was so much raised by the story his interest and sympathy so excited for the hero that he read on standing for a quarter of an hour fixed in the same position while betty held forth unheard about cap supper and pattern at last he carried off the book to his own room that he might finish it in peace nor did he ever stop till he came to the end of the volume the story not finishing there and breaking off in a most interesting part he went in search of the next volume but that was not to be found his impatience was ravenous mercy master harry cried mrs betty dont eat one up i know nothing atallatall about the book and im very sorry i tumbled it out of the basket thats all there is of it to be had high or lowso dont be tormenting me any more out of my life for nothing but having seized upon her he refused to let her go and protested that he would continue to be the torment of her life till she should find the other volume betty when her memory was thus racked put her hand to her forehead and recollected that in the appleroom there was a heap of old books harry possessed himself of the key of the appleroom tossed over the heap of tattered mouldy books and at last found the precious volume he devoured it eagerlynor was it forgotten as soon as finished as the chief part of the entertainment depended on the characters it did not fade from his imagination he believed the story to be true for it was constructed with unparalleled ingenuity and developed with consummate art the character which particularly interested him was that of the hero the more peculiarly because he saw or fancied that he saw a resemblance to his own with some differences to be surebut young readers readily assimilate and identify themselves with any character the leading points of which resemble their own and in whose general feelings they sympathize in some instances harry as he read on said to himself i would noti could not have done so and so but upon the whole he was charmed by the characterthat of a warmhearted generous imprudent young man with little education no literature governed more by feeling than by principle never upon any occasion reasoning but keeping right by happy moral instincts or when going wrong very wrong forgiven easily by the reader and by his mistress and rewarded at the last with all that love and fortune can bestow in consideration of his being a very fine fellow closing the book harry ormond resolved to be what he admiredand if possible to shine forth an irish tom jones for this purpose he was not at all bound to be a moral gentleman nor as he conceived to be a gentleman at allnot at least in the commencement of his career he might become accomplished at any convenient period of his life and become moral at the end of it but he might begin by being an accomplishedblackguard blackguard is a harsh word but what other will express the idea unluckily the easiest points to be imitated in any character are not always the best and where any latitude is given to conscience or any precedents are allowed to the grosser passions for their justification those are the points which are afterwards remembered and applied in practice when the moral salvo sentences are forgotten or are at best but of feeble countervailing effect at six oclock on monday evening the capthe prize cap flaming with red ribands from the top of the pole streamed to the summer air and delighted the upturned eyes of assembled crowds upon the green below the dance began and our popular hero the delight of all the nymphs and the envy of all the swains danced away with one of the prettiest smartest most likelylooking lasses that ever appeared at any former patron she was a degree more refined in manner and polished in appearance than the fair of the black islands for she came from the continent of irelandshe had the advantage of having been sometimes at the big house at castle hermitageshe was the gardeners daughterpeggy sheridandistinguished among her fellows by a nosegay such as no other could have procureddistinguished more by her figure and her face than by her nosegay and more by her air and motions than even by her figure or her face she stepped well and stepped outshe danced an irish jig to admiration and she was not averse from admiration village prudes perhaps might call her a village coquette but let not this suggest a thought derogatory to the reputation of the lively peggy she was a wellbehaved wellmeaning innocent industrious girla good daughter a good sister and more than one in the neighbourhood thought she would make a good wife she had not only admirers but suitors in abundance harry ormond could not think of her as a wife but he was evidentlymore evidently this day than ever beforeone of peggys admirers his heart or his fancy was always warmly susceptible to the charms of beauty and never well guarded by prudence he was now with his head full of tom jones prone to run into danger himself and rashly ready to hurry on an innocent girl to her destruction he was not without hopes of pleasingwhat young man of nineteen or twenty is he was not without chance of success as it is called with peggywhat woman can be pronounced safe who ventures to extend to a young lover the encouragement of coquettish smiles peggy said innocent smiles sure meaning nothing but they were interpreted to mean something less would in his present dispositions have excited the hero who imitated tom jones to enterprise report says that about this time harry ormond was seen disguised in a slouched hat and trusty footnote great coat wandering about the grounds at castle hermitage some swear they saw him pretending to dig in the garden and even under the gardeners windows seeming to be nailing up jessamine some would not swear but if they might trust their own eyes they might verily believe and could only that they would not take their oath to having seen him once cross the lake alone by moonlight but without believing above half what the world says candour obliges us to acknowledge that there was some truth in these scandalous reports he certainly pursued most imprudently pursued the chase of youth and beauty nor would he we fear have dropped the chase till peggy was his prey but that fortunately in the full headlong career of passion he was suddenly startled and stopped by coming in view of an obstacle that he could not overleapa greater wrong than he had foreseen at least a different wrong and in a form that made his heart tremble he reined in his passion and stood appalled in the first hurry of that passion he had seen nothing heard nothing understood nothing but that peggy was pretty and that he was in love it happened one evening that he with a rose yet unfaded in his handa rose which he had snatched from peggy sheridantook the path towards moriarty carrolls cottage moriarty seeing him from afar came out to meet him but when he came within sight of the rose moriartys pace slackened and turning aside he stepped out of the path as if to let mr ormond pass how now moriarty said harry but looking in his face he saw the poor fellow pale as death what ails you moriarty a pain i just took about my heart said moriarty pressing both hands to his heart my poor fellowwaityoull be better just now i hope said ormond laying his hand on moriartys shoulder ill never be better of it i fear said moriarty withdrawing his shoulder and giving a jealous glance at the rose he turned his head away again ill thank your honour to go on and leave meill be better by myself it is not to your honour above all that i can open my heart a suspicion of the truth now flashed across ormonds mindhe was determined to know whether it was the truth or not ill not leave you till i know whats the matter said he then none will know that till i die said moriarty adding after a little pause theres no knowing whats wrong withinside of a man till he is opened but alive moriarty if the heart is in the case only said ormond a man can open himself to a friend ay if he had a friend said moriarty ill beg your honour to let me passi am able for it nowi am quite stout again then if you are quite stout again i shall want you to row me across the lake i am not able for that sir replied moriarty pushing past him but said ormond catching hold of his arm arent you able or willing to carry a note for me as he spoke ormond produced the note and let him see the directionto peggy sheridan sooner stab me to the heart again cried moriarty breaking from him sooner stab myself to the heart then cried ormond tearing the note to bits look moriarty upon my honour till this instant i did not know you loved the girlfrom this instant ill think of her no morenever more will i see her hear of her till she be your wife wife repeated moriarty joy illuminating but fear as instantly darkening his countenance how will that be now it will beit shall beas happily as honourably listen to me moriartyas honourably now as ever can you think me so wicked so base as to say wife ifno passion might hurry me to a rash but of a base action im incapable upon my soul upon the sacred honour of a gentleman moriarty sighed look continued ormond taking the rose from his breast this is the utmost that ever passed between us and that was my fault i snatched it and thusthus cried he tearing the rose to pieces i scatter it to the winds of heaven and thus may all trace of past fancy and folly be blown from remembrance amen said moriarty watching the roseleaves for an instant as they flew and were scattered out of sight then as ormond broke the stalk to pieces and flung it from him he asked with a smile is the pain about your heart gone now moriarty no plase your honour not gone but a quite differentbetterbut worse so strange with mei cant speak rightlyfor the pleasure has seized me stronger than the pain lean against me poor fellow oh if i had broken such a heart then how wrong i was when i said that word i did said moriarty i ask your honour your dear honours pardon on my knees for whatfor whatyou have done no wrong nobut i said wrongvery wrongwhen i said stab me to the heart again oh that word againit was very ungenerous noble fellow said ormond good night to your honour kindly said moriarty how happy i am now said our young hero to himself as he walked home which i never should have been if i had done this wrong a fortunate escapeyes but when the escape is owing to good fortune not to prudenceto good feeling not to principlethere is no security for the future ormond was steady to his promise toward moriarty to do him justice he was more than thishe was generous actively perseveringly generous in his conduct to him with open heart open purse public overture and private negotiation with the parents of peggy sheridan he at last succeeded in accomplishing moriartys marriage ormonds biographer may well be allowed to make the most of his persevering generosity on this occasion because no other scrap of good can be found of which to make any thing in his favour for several months to come whether tom jones was still too much and lady annaly too little in his headwhether it was that king cornys example and precepts were not always edifyingwhether this young man had been prepared by previous errors of example and educationor whether he fell into mischief because he had nothing else to do in these black islands certain it is that from the operation of some or all of these causes conjointly he deteriorated sadly he took to vagrant courses in which the muse forbears to follow him chapter viii it is said that the turks have a very convenient recording angel who without dropping a tear to blot out that which might be wished unsaid or undone fairly shuts his eyes and forbears to record whatever is said or done by man in three circumstances when he is drunk when he is in a passion and while he is under age what the under age or what the years of discretion of a turk may be we do not at this moment recollect we only know that our own hero is not yet twenty without being quite as accommodating as the mahometan angel we should wish to obliterate from our record some months of ormonds existence he felt and was ashamed of his own degradation but after having lost or worse than lost a winter of his life it was in vain to lament or rather it was not enough to weep over the losshow to repair it was the question whenever ormond returned to his better self whenever he thought of improving he remembered lady annaly and he now recollected with shame that he had never had the grace to answer or to thank her for her letter he had often thought of writing but he had put it off from day to day and now months had passed he wrote a sad scrawling hand and he had always been ashamed that lady annaly should see it but now the larger shame got the better of the lesser and he determined he would write he looked for her letter to read it over again before he answered itthe letter was very safe for he considered it as his greatest treasure on recurring to the letter he found that she had mentioned a present of books which she intended for him a set of books which belonged to her son sir herbert annaly and of which she found they had duplicates in their library she had ordered the box containing them to be sent to annaly and had desired her agent there to forward it but in case any delay should occur she begged mr ormond would take the trouble to inquire for them himself this whole affair about the books had escaped ormonds memory he felt himself blush all over when he read the letter again and sent off a messenger immediately to the agent at annaly who had kept the box till it was inquired for it was too heavy for the boy to carry and he returned saying that two men would not carry it nor foura slight exaggeration a car was sent for it and at last harry obtained possession of the books it was an excellent collection of what may be called the english and french classics the french books were at this time quite useless to him for he could not read french lady annaly however sent these books on purpose to induce him to learn a language which if he should go into the army as he seemed inclined to do would be particularly useful to him lady annaly observed that mr ormond wherever he might be in ireland would probably find even the priest of the parish a person who could assist him sufficiently in learning french as most of the irish parish priests were at that time educated at st omers or louvain father jos had been at st omers and harry resolved to attack him with a french grammar and dictionary but the french that father jos had learnt at st omers was merely from earhe could not bear the sight of a french grammar harry was obliged to work on by himself he again put off writing to thank lady annaly till he could tell her that he had obeyed her commands and that he could read at least a page of gil blas before this was accomplished he learnt from the agent that lady annaly was in great affliction about her son who had broken a bloodvessel he could not think of intruding upon her at such a timeand in short he put it off till it seemed too late to write at all among the english books was one in many volumes which did not seize his attention forcibly like tom jones at once but which won upon him by degrees drew him on against his will and against his taste he hated moralizing and reflections and there was here an abundance both of reflections and morality these he skipped over however and went on the hero and the heroine too were of a stiff fashion which did not suit his taste yet still there was something in the book that in spite of the terrible array of good people captivated his attention the heroines perpetual egotism disgusted himshe was always too good and too full of herselfand she wrote dreadfully long letters the heros dress and manner were too splendid too formal for every day use at first he detested sir charles grandison who was so different from the friends he loved in real life or the heroes he had admired in books just as in old portraits we are at first struck with the costume but soon if the picture be really by a master hand our attention is fixed on the expression of the features and the life of the figure sensible as ormond was of the power of humour and ridicule he was still more susceptible as all noble natures are of sympathy with elevated sentiments and with generous character the character of sir charles grandison in spite of his ceremonious bowing on the hand touched the nobler feelings of our young heros mind inspired him with virtuous emulation and made him ambitious to be a gentleman in the best and highest sense of the word in short it completely counteracted in his mind the effects of his late study all the generous feelings which were so congenial to his own nature and which he had seen combined in tom jones as if necessarily with the habits of an adventurer a spendthrift and a rake he now saw united with high moral and religious principles in the character of a man of virtue as well as a man of honour a man of cultivated understanding and accomplished manners in sir charles grandisons history he read that of a gentleman who fulfilling every duty of his station in society eminently useful respected and beloved as brother friend master of a family guardian and head of a large estate was admired by his own sex and what struck ormond far more forcibly was loved passionately loved by womennot by the low and profligate but by the highest and most accomplished of the sex indeed to him it appeared no fiction while he was reading it his imagination was so full of clementina and the whole porretta family that he saw them in his sleeping and waking dreams the deep pathos so affected him that he could scarcely recall his mind to the low concerns of life once when king corny called him to go out shootinghe found him with red eyes harry was ashamed to tell him the cause lest he should laugh at him but corny was susceptible of the same kind of enthusiasm himself and though he had as he said never been regularly what is called a reading man yet the books he had read left ineffaceable traces in his memory fictions if they touched him at all struck him with all the force of reality and he never spoke of the characters as in a book but as if they had lived and acted harry was glad to find that here again as in most things they sympathized and suited each other but corny if ready to give sympathy was likewise imperious in requiring it and harry was often obliged to make sudden transitions from his own thoughts and employments to those of his friend these transitions however difficult and provoking at the time were useful discipline to his mind giving him that versatility in which persons of powerful imagination accustomed to live in retirement and to command their own time and occupations are often most deficient at this period when our young hero was suddenly seized with a voracious appetite for books it was trying to his patience to be frequently interrupted come comeharry bookworm you are growingno goodcome out cried king corny lay down whatever you have in your hand and come off this minute till i show you a badger at bay with halfadozen dogs yes sirthis minutebe kind enough to wait one minute it has been hiding and skulking this week from mewe have got it out of its snug hole at last i bid them keep the dogs off till you came dont be waiting any longer come off harry come phoo phoo that book will keep cold and what is it oh the last volume of sir charlesnot worth troubling your eyes with the badger is worth a hundred of itnot a pins worth in that volume but worked stools and chairs and china jugs and mugs oh throw it from you come away another time at the very death of clarissa king corny would have harry out to see a solan goose oh let clarissa die another time come now you that never saw a solan gooseit looks for all the world as if it wore spectacles moriarty says so harry was carried off to see the goose in spectacles and was pressed into the service of king corny for many hours afterwards to assist in searching for its eggs one of the black islands was a bare high pointed desert rock in which the seafowl built and here in the highest point of rock this solan goose had deposited some of her eggs instead of leaving them in nests on the ground as she usually does the more dangerous it was to obtain the eggs which the bird had hidden in this pinnacle of the rock the more eager corny was to have them and he and ormond and moriarty were at this perilous work for hours king corny directing and bawling and moriarty and ormond with pole net and polehook swinging and leaping from one ledge of rock to another clambering clinging sliding pushing and pulling each other alternately from hold to hold with frightful precipices beneath them as soon as ormond had warmed to the business he was delighted with the dangerous pursuit but suddenly just as he had laid his hand on the egg and that king corny shouted in triumph harry leaping back across the cleft in the rock missed his footing and fell and must have been dashed to pieces but for a sort of projecting landingplace on which he was caught where he lay for some minutes stunned the terror of poor corny was such that he could neither move nor look up till moriarty called out to him that master harry was safe all to a sprained ankle the fall and the sprain would not have been deemed worthy of a place in these memoirs of our hero but from their consequencesthe consequences not on his body but on his mind he could not for some weeks afterwards stir out or take any bodily exercise confined to the house and forced to sit still he was glad to read during these long hours to amuse himself when he had read all the novels in the collection which were very few he went on to other books even those which were not mere works of amusement he found more entertaining than netting fishingnets or playing backgammon with father jos who was always cross when he did not win kindhearted king corny considering always that harrys sprain was incurred in his service would have sat with him all day long but this harry would not suffer for he knew that it was the greatest punishment to corny to stay within doors a whole day when corny in the evening returned from his various outofdoors occupations and amusements harry was glad to talk to him of what he had been reading and to hear his odd summary reflections well harry my boy now ive told you how it has been with me all day lets hear how you have been getting on with your bookmenhas it been a good day with you todaywere you with shakspeareworth all the restall the world in him corny was no respecter of authorities in hooks a great name went for nothing with himit did not awe his understanding in the slightest degree if it were poetry did it touch the heart or inflame the imagination if it were history was it true if it were philosophy was it sound reasoning these were the questions he asked no cramming any thing down his throat he said this daring temper of mind though it sometimes led him wrong was advantageous to his young friend it wakened ormonds powers and prevented his taking upon trust the assertions or the reputations even of great writers the spring was now returning and dora was to return with spring he looked forward to her return as to a new era in his existence then he should live in better company he should see something better than he had seen of latebe something better his chief his best occupations during this winter had been riding leaping and breaking in horses he had broken in a beautiful mare for dora dora when a child was very fond of riding and constantly rode out with her father at the time when harry ormonds head was full of tom jones dora had always been his idea of sophy western though nothing else that he could recollect in her person mind or manner bore any resemblance to sophia and now that tom jones had been driven out of his head by sir charles grandison now that his taste for women was a little raised by the pictures which richardson had left in his imagination dora with equal facility turned into his new idea of a heroinenot his heroine for she was engaged to white connalmerely a heroine in the abstract ormond had been warned that he was to consider dora as a married womanwell so he would of course she was to be mrs connalso much the betterhe should be quite at ease with her and she should teach him french and drawing and dancing and improve his manners he was conscious that his manners had since his coming to the black islands rusticated sadly and lost the little polish they had acquired at castle hermitage and during one famous winter in dublin his language and dialect he was afraid had become somewhat vulgar but dora who had been refined by her residence with her aunt and by her dancingmaster would polish him and set all to rights in the most agreeable manner possible in the course of these his speculations on his rapid improvements and his reflections on the perfectibility of mans nature under the tuition of woman some idea of its fallibility did cross his imagination or his memory but then he blamed most unjustly his imagination for the suggestion the danger would prove as he would have it to be imaginary what danger could there be when he knew as he began and ended by saying to himself that he was to consider dora as a married womanmrs connal doras aunt an aunt by the mothers side a maiden aunt who had never before been at the black islands and whom ormond had never seen was to accompany dora on her return to corny castle our young hero had settled it in his head that this aunt must be something like aunt ellenor in sir charles grandison a stiffbacked prim precise oldfashioned looking aunt never was mans astonishment more visible in his countenance than was that of harry ormond on the first sight of doras aunt his surprise was so great as to preclude the sight of dora herself there was nothing surprising in the lady but there was indeed an extraordinary difference between our heros preconceived notion and the real person whom he now beheld mademoiselleas miss ofaley was called in honour of her french parentage and education and in commemoration of her having at different periods spent above half her life in france looking for an estate that could never be foundmademoiselle was dressed in all the peculiarities of the french dress of that day she was of that indefinable age which the french describe by the happy phrase of une femme dun certain age and which miss ofaley happily translated a woman of no particular age yet though of no particular age in the eye of politeness to the vulgar eye she looked like what people who knew no better might call an elderly woman but she was as alert and lively as a girl of fifteen a little wrinkled but withal in fine preservation she wore abundance of rouge obviouslystill more obviously took superabundance of snuffand without any obvious motive continued to play unremittingly a pair of large black french eyes in a manner impracticable to a mere englishwoman and which almost tempted the spectator to beg she would let them rest mademoiselle or miss ofaley was in fact half french and half irishborn in france she was the daughter of an officer of the irish brigade and of a french lady of good family in her gestures tones and language there was a striking mixture or rapid succession of french and irish when she spoke french which she spoke well and with a true parisian accent her voice gestures air and ideas were all french and she looked and moved a wellborn wellbred woman the moment she attempted to speak english which she spoke with an inveterate brogue her ideas manner air voice and gestures were irish she looked and moved a vulgar irishwoman what do you see so wonderful in aunt ofaley said dora nothingonly the sentence was never finished and the young lady was satisfied for she perceived that the course of his thoughts was interrupted and all idea of her aunt effaced the moment he turned his eyes upon herself dora no longer a child and his playfellow but grown and formed was and looked as if she expected to be treated as a woman she was exceedingly pretty not regularly handsome but with most brilliant eyesthere was besides a childishness in her face and in her slight figure which disarmed all criticism on her beauty and which contrasted strikingly yet as our hero thought agreeably with her womanish airs and manner nothing but her external appearance could be seen this first eveningshe was tired and went to bed early ormond longed to see more of her on whom so much of his happiness was to depend chapter ix this was the first time mdlle ofaley had ever been at corny castle hospitality as well as gratitude determined the king of the black islands to pay her honour due now harry ormond said he i have made one capital good resolution here is my sisterinlaw mdlle ofaley coming to reside with me here and has conquered her antipathy to solitude and the black islands and all from natural love and affection for my daughter dora for which i have a respect for her notwithstanding all her eternal jabbering about politesse and all her manifold absurdities and infinite female vanities of which she has a double proportion being half french but so was my wife that i loved to distractionfor a wise man may do a foolish thing well on all those accounts i shall never contradict or gainsay this mademoisellein all things i shall make it my principle to give her her swing and her fling but now observe me harry i have no eye to her moneylet her leave that to dora or the cats whichever pleases heri am not looking to nor squinting at her succession i am a great hunter but not legacyhunterthat is a kind of hunting i despiseand i wish every hunter of that kind may be thrown out or thrown off and may never be in at the death cornys tirade against legacyhunters was highly approved of by ormond but as to the rest he knew nothing about miss ofaleys fortune he was now to learn that a rich relation of hers a merchant in dublin whom living she had despised because he was neither noble nor comme il faut dying had lately left her a considerable sum of money so that after having been many years in straitened circumstances she was now quite at her ease she had a carriage and horses and servants she could indulge her taste for dress and make a figure in a country place the black islands were to be sure of all places the most unpromising for her purpose and the first sight of corny castle was enough to throw her into despair as soon as breakfast was over she begged her brotherinlaw would show her the whole of the chateau from the top to the bottom with all the pleasure in life he said he would attend her from the attics to the cellar and show her all the additions improvements and contrivances he had made and all he intended to make if heaven should lend him life to complete every thing or any thingthere was nothing finished nor ever will be said dora looking from her father to her aunt with a sort of ironical smile why what has he been doing all this life said mademoiselle making a shift said dora i will show you dozens of them as we go over this house he calls them substitutesi call them makeshifts ormond followed as they went over the house and though he was sometimes amused by the smart remarks which dora made behind backs as they went on yet he thought she laughed too scornfully at her fathers oddities and he was often in pain for his good friend corny his majesty was both proud and ashamed of his palace proud of the various instances it exhibited of his taste originality and daring ashamed of the deficiencies and want of comfort and finish his ready wit had excuses reasons or remedies for all mademoiselles objections every alteration she proposed he promised to get executed and he promised impossibilities with the best faith imaginable as the frenchman answered to the queen of france said corny if it is possible it shall be done and if it is impossible it must be done mademoiselle who had expected to find her brotherinlaw as she owned a little more difficult to manage a little savage and a little restive was quite delighted with his politeness but presuming on his complaisance she went too far in the course of a week she made so many innovations that corny seeing the labour and ingenuity of his life in danger of being at once destroyed made a sudden stand this is corny castle mademoiselle said he and you are making it castle topsyturvy which must not be stop this work for ill have no more architectural innovations done herebut by my own orders paper and paint and furnish and finish you may if you willi give you a carteblanche but i wont have another wall touched or chimney pulled down so far shalt thou go but no farther mdlle ofaley mademoiselle was forced to submit and to confine her brilliant imagination to papering painting and glazing even in the course of these operations king corny became so impatient that she was forced to get them finished surreptitiously while he was out of the way in the mornings she made out who resided at every place within possible reach of morning or dinner visit every house on the opposite banks of the lake was soon known to her and she was current in every house the boat was constantly rowing backwards and forwards over the lake cars waiting or driving on the banks in short this summer all was gaiety at the black islands miss ofaley was said to be a great acquisition in the neighbourhood she was so gay so sociable so communicative and she certainly above all knew so much of the world she was continually receiving letters and news and patterns from dublin and the black rock and paris each of which places and all standing nearly upon the same level made a great figure in her conversation and in the imagination of the half or quarter gentry with whom she consorted in this remote place every thing is great or small by comparison and she was a great person in this little world it had been the report of the country that her niece was promised to the eldest son of mr connal of glynn but the aunt seemed so averse to the match and expressed this so openly that some people began to think it would be broken off others who knew cornelius oshanes steadiness to his word of honour were convinced that miss ofaley would never shake king corny and that dora would assuredly be mrs connal all agreed that it was a foolish promisethat he might do better for his daughter miss oshane with her fathers fortune and her aunts would be a great prize besides she was thought quite a beauty and remarkable elegant dora was just the thing to be the belle and coquette of the black islands the alternate scorn and familiarity with which she treated her admirers and the interest and curiosity she excited by sometimes taking delightful pains to attract and then capriciously repelling succeeded as miss ofaley observed admirably harry ormond accompanied her and her aunt on all their parties of pleasure miss ofaley would never venture in the boat or across the lake without him he was absolutely essential to their parties he was useful in the boat he was useful to drive the carmiss ofaley would not trust any body else to drive her he was an ornament to the ballmiss ofaley dubbed him her beau she undertook to polish him and to teach him to speak frenchshe was astonished by the quickness with which he acquired the language and caught the true parisian pronunciation she often reiterated to her niece and to others who repeated it to ormond that it was the greatest of pities he had but three hundred a year upon earth but that even with that pittance she would prefer him for a nephew to another with his thousands mr ormond was wellborn and he had some politesse and a winter at paris would make him quite another person quite a charming young man he would have great success she could answer for it in certain circles and salons that she could name only it might turn his head too much so far she said and more she thought it was a million of pities that such a woman as herself and such a girl as dora and such a young man as mr ormond might be made should be buried all their days in the black islands mdlle ofaleys heart still turned to paris in paris she was determined to livethere was no living what you call living any where elseelsewhere people only vegetate as somebody said miss ofaley nevertheless was excessively fond of her niece and how to make the love for her niece and the love for paris coincide was the question she long had formed a scheme of carrying her dear niece to paris and marrying her there to some m le baron or m le marquis but doras father would not hear of her living any where but in ireland or marrying any one but an irishman miss ofaley had lived long enough in ireland to know that the usual method in all disputes is to split the difference therefore she decided that her niece should marry some irishman who would take her to paris and reside with her there at least a great part of his timethe latter part of the bargain to be kept a secret from the father till the marriage should be accomplished harry ormond appeared to be the very man for this purpose he seemed to hang loosely upon the worldno family connexions seemed to have any rights over him he had no professionbut a very small fortune miss ofaleys fortune might be very convenient and doras person very agreeable to him and it was scarcely to be doubted that he would easily be persuaded to quit the black islands and the british islands for doras sake the petit menage was already quite arranged in mdlle ofaleys headeven the weddingdresses had floated in her fancy as to the promise given to white connal as she said to herself it would be a mercy to save her niece from such a man for she had seen him lately when he had called upon her in dublin and he was a vulgar person his hair looked as if it had not been cut these hundred years and he woreany thing but what he should wear therefore it would be a favour to her brotherinlaw for whom she had in reality a serious regardit would be doing him the greatest imaginable benefit to save him from the shame of either keeping or breaking his ridiculous and savage promise her plan was therefore to prevent the possibility of his keeping it by marrying her niece privately to ormond before white connal should return in october when the thing was done and could not be undone cornelius oshane she was persuaded would be very glad of it for harry ormond was his particular favourite he had called him his sonsoninlaw was almost the same thing thus arguing with happy female casuistry mademoiselle went on with the prosecution of her plan to the french spirit of intrigue and gallantry she joined irish acuteness and irish varieties of odd resource with the art of laying suspicion asleep by the appearance of an imprudent blundering good nature add to all this a degree of confidence that could not have been acquired by any means but one thus accomplished rarely did she manage matters by the very boldness and openness of her railing against the intended bridegroom she convinced her brotherinlaw that she meant nothing more than talk besides through all her changing varieties of objections there was one point on which she never variedshe never objected to going to dublin in september to buy the weddingclothes for dora this seemed to cornelius oshane perfect proof that she had no serious intention to break off or defer the match as to the rest he was glad to see his own harry such a favourite he deserved to be a favourite with every body cornelius thought the young people were continually together so much the better he would say all was aboveboard and there could be no harm going forward and no danger in life all was aboveboard on harry ormonds part he knew nothing of miss ofaleys designs nor did he as yet feel that there was for him much danger he was not thinking as a lover of dora in particular but he felt a new and extraordinary desire to please in general on every fair occasion he liked to show how well he could ride how well he could dance how gallant and agreeable he could be his whole attention was now turned to the cultivation of his personal accomplishments he succeeded he danced he rode to admirationhis glories of horsemanship and sportsmanship the birds that he shot and the fish that he caught and the leaps that he took are to this hour recorded in the tradition of the inhabitants of the black islands at that time his feats of personal activity and address made him the theme of every tongue the delight of every eye the admiration of every woman and the envy of every man not only with the damsels of peggy sheridans class was he the favourite but with all the young ladies the belles of the half gentry who filled the ballrooms and who made the most distinguished figure in the riding boating walking teadrinking parties to all or any of these belles he devoted his attention rather than to dora for he was upon honour and very honourable he was and very prudent moreover he thought himself he was at present quite content with general admiration there was or there seemed at this time more danger for his head than his heartmore danger that his head should be turned with the foolish attentions paid him by many silly girls than that he should be a dupe to a passion for any one of them there was imminent danger of his becoming a mere dancing driving country coxcomb chapter x one day when harry ormond was out shooting with moriarty carroll moriarty abruptly began with why then tis what i am thinking master harry that king corny dont know as much of that white connal as i do what do you know of mr connal said harry loading his piece i didnt know you had ever seen him oh but i did and no great sight to see unlike the father old connal of glynn who is the gentleman to the last every inch even with the coat dropping off his back and the son with the best coat in christendom has not the look of a gentleman atallatallnor hasnt it in him inside no more than outside you may be mistaken there as you have never been withinside of him moriarty said ormond oh faith and if i have not been withinside of him i have heard enough from them that seen him turned inside out hot and cold sure i went down there last summer to his country to see a shister of my own thats married in it and lives just by connals town as the man calls that sheep farm of his well let the gentleman call his own place what he will oh he may call it what he plases for mei know what the country calls him and lest your honour should not ax me ill tell you they call him white connal the negrethink of him that would stand browbating the butcher an hour to bate down the farthing a pound in the price of the worst bits of the mate which hed bespake always for the servants or stand he wouldive seen him with my own eyeshiggling with the poor child with the apron round the neck that was sent to sell him the eggs hush moriarty said ormond who did not wish to hear any farther particulars of mr connals domestic economy and he silenced moriarty by pointing to a bird but the bird flew away and moriarty returned to his point i wouldnt be telling the like of any jantleman but to show the nature of him the minute after he had screwed the halfpenny out of the child hed throw down may be fifty guineas in gould for the horse hed fancy for his own riding not that he rides better than the sack going to the mill nor so well but that he might have it to show and say he was better mounted than any man at the fair and the same hed throw away more guineas than i could tell at the head of a shorthorned bull or a longhorned bull or some kind of a bull from england may be just becaase hed think nobody else had one of the breed in all ireland but himself a very good thing at least for the country to improve the breed of cattle the countrytis little the man thinks of the country that never thought of any thing but himself since his mother sucked him suckled him you mean said harry no matterim no spakerbut i know that mans character nevertheless he is rich but a very bad character the poor gives him up and down perhaps because he is rich not at all the poor loves the rich that helps with the kind heart dont we all love king corny to the blacking of his shoesoh theres the differencewho could like the man thats always talking of the craturs and yet to save the life of the poorest cratur thats forced to live under him wouldnt forbear to drive and pound and process for the little con acre the potatoe ridge the cows grass or the trifle for the womans peck of flax was she dying and sell the womans last blanketwhite connal is a hard man and takes all to the uttermost farthing the law allows well even so i suppose the law does not allow him more than his due said ormond oh begging your pardon master harry said moriarty thats becaase you are not a lawyer and are you said harry only as we all are through the country and now ill only just tell you master harry how this white connal sarved my shisters husband who was an undertenant to himsee the case was this oh dont tell me a long case for pitys sake i am no lawyeri shall not understand a word of it but then sir through the whole consarning white connal what im thinking of master harry said moriarty is im grieving that a daughter of our dear king corny and such a pretty likely girl as miss dora say no more moriarty for theres a partridge oh is it so with you thought moriartythats just what i wanted to knowand ill keep your secret i dont forget peggy sheridanand his goodness moriarty said not a word more about white connal or miss dora and he and harry shot a great many birds this day it is astonishing how quickly and how justly the lower class of people in ireland discover and appreciate the characters of their superiors especially of the class just above them in rank ormond hoped that moriarty had been prejudiced in his account of white connal and that private feelings had induced him to exaggerate harry was persuaded of this because cornelius oshane had spoken to him of connal and had never represented him to be a hard man in fact oshane did not know him white connal had a property in a distant county where he resided and only came from time to time to see his father oshane had then wondered to see the son grown so unlike the father and he attributed the difference to white connals having turned grazier the having derogated from the dignity of an idle gentleman and having turned grazier was his chief fault in king cornys eyes so that the only point in connals character and conduct for which he deserved esteem was that for which his intended fatherinlaw despised him connal had early been taught by his fathers example who was an idle decayed good gentleman of the old irish stock that genealogies and old maps of estates in other peoples possessions do not gain quite so much respect in this world as solid wealth the son was determined therefore to get money but in his horror of his fathers indolence and poverty he ran into a contrary extremehe became not only industrious but rapacious in going lately to dublin to settle with a sales master he had called on dora at her aunts in dublin and he had been greatly struck as he said with miss oshane she was as fine a girl as any in irelandturn out who they could against her all her points good but better than beauty she would be no contemptible fortune with her aunts assistance she would cut up well she was certain of all her fathers black islandsfine improvable land if well managed these considerations had their full effect connal knowing that the young lady was his destined bride had begun by taking the matter coolly and resolving to wait for the properest time to wed yet the sight of doras charms had so wrought upon him that he was now impatient to conclude the marriage immediately directly after seeing dora in dublin he had gone home and put things in order and in train to bear his absence while he should pay a visit to the black islands business which must always be considered before pleasure had detained him at home longer than he had foreseen but now certain rumours he heard of gay doings in the black islands and a letter from his father advising him not to delay longer paying his respects at corny castle determined him to set out he wrote to mr oshane to announce his intention and begged to have the answer directed to his fathers at glynn one morning as miss ofaley mr oshane and ormond were at breakfast dora who was usually late not having yet appeared miss ofaley saw a little boy running across the fields towards the house that boy runs as if he was bringing news said she so he has a right to do said corny if i dont mistake thats the post that is it is not the post but a little special of my owna messenger i sent off to catch post to do what said mademoiselle why to catch post said corny i bid him gallop off for the life and put across lake understood to the next post town which is ballynaslugger and to put in the letters that were too late here at that office there and to bring back whatever he found with no delaybut gallop off for the bare life this was an operation which the boy performed whenever requisite at the imminent hazard of his neck every time to say nothing of his chance of drowning well catchpost my little rascal said king corny what have you for us the day i got nothing at all only a wetting for myself plase your honour and one bit of a note for your honour which i have here for you as dry as the bone in my breast he produced the bit of a note which king cornys hands being at that time too full of the eggs and the kettle to receive graciously was laid down on the corner of the table from which it fell and miss ofaley picking it up and holding it by one corner exclaimed is this what you call dry as a bone in this country and mighty clean toofaugh when will this entire nation leave off chewing tobacco i wonder this is what you style clean too in this country why then said the boy looking close at the letter i thought it was clane enough when i got itand give itbut tis not so clane now sure enough this cornerwhatever come over itwould it be the snuff my lady the mark of miss ofaleys thumb was so visible and the snuff so palpable and the effort to brush it from the wet paper so disastrous that miss ofaley let the matter rest where it was king corny put silver into the boys hand bidding him not be too much of a rogue the boy smiling furtively twitched the hair on his forehead bobbed his head in sign of thanks and drawing not shutting the door after him disappeared as sure as im cornelius oshane this is white connal in propria persona said he opening the note mon dieu bon dieu ah dieu cried mdlle ofaley hush whisht cried the fatherheres dora coming dora came in any letter for me ay darling one for you oh give it me im always in a desperate hurry for my letters where is it noyou need not hold out your pretty hand the letter is for you but not to you said king corny and now you knoway now you guessmy quick little blusher who tis from i guess not i indeednot worth my guessing cried dora throwing herself sideways into a chair my tea if you please aunt then taking the cup without adverting to harry who handed it to her she began stirring the tea as if it and all things shared her scorn ma chre mon chat said mdlle ofaley you are quite right to spare yourself the trouble of guessing for i give it you in two i give it you in four i give it you in eight and you would never guess right figure to yourself only that a man who has the audacity to call himself a lover of miss oshanes could fold could seal could direct a letter in such a manner as this which you here behold dora who during this speech had sat fishing for sugar in her teacup raised her long eyelashes and shot a scornful glance at the letter but intercepting a crossing look of ormonds the expression of her countenance suddenly changed and with perfect composure she observed a man may fold a letter badly and be nevertheless a very good man that nobody can possibly contradict said her father and on all occasions tis a comfort to be able to say what no one can contradict no wellbred person will never contradict nothing said miss ofaley but without contradicting you my child resumed miss ofaley i maintain the impossibility of his being a gentleman who folds a letter so but if folding a letter is all a man wants of being a gentleman said dora it might be learnt i should think it might be taught if you were the teacher dora it might surely said her father but heaven i trust will arrange that better said mademoiselle whatever heaven arranges must be best said dora heaven and your father if you please dora said her father put that and that together like a dutiful daughter as you must be must said dora angrily that offensive must slipped out by mistake darling i meant only being you you must be all thats dutiful and good oh said dora thats another view of the subject you have a very imperfect view of the subject yet said her father for you have both been so taken up with the manner that you have never thought of inquiring into the matter of this letter and what is the matter said miss ofaley form continued the father addressing himself to his daughter form i acknowledge is one thing and a great thing in a daughters eyes dora blushed but in a fathers eyes substance is apt to be more dora raised her cup and saucer together to her lips at this instant so that the substance of the saucer completely hid her face from her father but said miss ofaley you have not told us yet what the man says he says he will be here whenever we please thats never said miss ofaley never id give for answer if my pleasure is to be consulted luckily theres another persons pleasure to be consulted here said the father keeping his eyes fixed upon his daughter another cup of tea aunt if you please then the sooner the better i say continued her father for when a disagreeable thing is to be donethat is when a thing thats not quite agreeable to a young lady such as marriage dora took the cup of tea from her aunts hand harry not interferingi say persisted her father the sooner its done and over the better dora saw that ormonds eyes were fixed upon her she suddenly tasted and suddenly started back from her scalding tea harry involuntarily uttered some exclamation of pity she turned and seeing his eyes still fixed upon her said very rude sir to stare at any one so i only thought you had scalded yourself then you only thought wrong at any rate theres no great occasion to be angry with me dora and who is angry pray mr ormond what put it in your head that i was doing you the honour to be angry with you the cream the cream cried miss ofaley a sudden motion we must not say an angry motion of doras elbow had at this moment overset the cream ewer but harry set it up again before its contents poured on her new ridinghabit thank you said she thank you but added she changing the places of the cream ewer and cups and saucers before her id rather manage my own affairs my own way if youd let me mr ormondif youd leave mei can take care of myself my own way i beg your pardon for saving your habit from destruction for that is the only cause of offence that i am conscious of having given but i leave you to your own way as i am ordered said he rising from the breakfast table sparring sparring again you two said doras father but dora i wonder whether you and white connal were sparring that way when you met time enough for that sir after marriage said dora our hero who had stood leaning on the back of his chair fearing that he had been too abrupt in what he had said cast a lingering look at dora as her father spoke about white connal and as she replied but there was something so unfeminine so unamiable so decided and bold he thought in the tone of her voice as she pronounced the word marriage that he then without reluctance and with a feeling of disgust quitted the room and left her to manage her own affairs and to take her own way chapter xi our young hero herolike took a solitary walk to indulge his feelings and as he rambled he railed to his hearts content against dora here all my plans of happiness and improvement are again overturned dora cannot improve me can give me no motive for making myself any thing better than what i am polish my manners no when she has such rude odious manners herself much changed for the worsea hundred times more agreeable when she was a child lost to me she is every wayno longer my playfellowno chance of her being my friend her good father hoped she would be a sister to mevery sorry i should be to have such a sister then i am to consider her as a married womanpretty wife she will make i am convinced she cares no more for that man she is going to marry than i domarrying merely to be married to manage her own affairs and have her own wayso childishor marrying merely to get an establishmentso base how women and such young creatures can bring themselves to make these venal matchesi protest peggy sheridans worth a hundred of such moriarty may think himself a happy fellowsuzyjenny any bodyonly with dress and manner a little differentis full as good in reality i question whether theyd give themselves without liking to any white connal in their own rank at the first offer for a few sheep or a cow or to have their own way such was the summing up of the topics of invective which during a two hours walk had come round and round continually in ormonds indignant fancy he went plucking off the hawthorn blossoms in his path till at one desperate tug that he gave to a branch which crossed his way he opened to a bank that sloped down to the lake at a little distance below him he saw old sheelah sitting under a tree rocking herself backwards and forwards while dora stood motionless opposite to her with her hand covering her eyes and her head drooping they neither of them saw ormond and he walked on pursuing his own path it led close behind the hedge to the place where they were so close that the sounds willastrew willastrew from old sheelah in her funereal tone reached his ear and then the words oh my hearts darling so young to be a sacrificebut what next did he say ormonds curiosity was strongly excited but he was too honourable to listen or to equivocate with conscience so to warn them that some one was within hearing he began to whistle clear and strong both the old woman and the young lady started murder cried sheelah its harry ormond oh did he overhear any thingor all think ye not i answered ormond leaping over the hedge directly and standing firm before them i overheard nothingi heard only your last words sheelahyou spoke so loud i could not help it they are as safe with me as with yourselfbut dont speak so loud another time if you are talking secrets and whatever you do never suspect me of listeningi am incapable of that or any other baseness so saying he turned his back and was preparing to vault over the hedge again when he heard dora in a soft low voice say i never suspected you harry of that or any other baseness thank you dora said he turning with some emotion thank you dora for this first this only kind word youve said to me since you came home looking at her earnestly as he approached nearer he saw the traces of tears and an air of dejection in her countenance which turned all his anger to pity and tenderness in an instant with a soothing tone he said forgive my unseasonable reproachi was wrongi see you are not as much to blame as i thought you were to blame cried dora and pray howand whyand for what did you think me to blame sir the impossibility of explanation the impropriety of what he had said flashed suddenly on his mind and in a few moments a rapid succession of ideas followed was dora to blame for obeying her father for being ready to marry the man to whom her father had destinedpromised her hand and was he harry ormond the adopted child the trusted friend of the family to suggest to the daughter the idea of rebelling against her fathers will or disputing the propriety of his choice ormonds imagination took a rapid flight on doras side of the question and he finished with the conviction that she was a sacrifice a martyr and a miracle of perfection blame you dora cried he blame you noi admire i esteem i respect you did i say that i blamed you i did not know what i said or what i meant and are you sure you know any better what you say or what you mean now said dora the altered look and tone of tartness in which this question was asked produced as sudden a change in harrys conviction he hesitatingly answered i am he is said sheelah confidently i did not ask your opinion sheelah i can judge for myself said dora your words tell me one thing sir and your looks another said she turning to ormond which am i to believe pray oh believe the young man any way sure said sheelah silence speaks best for him best against him in my opinion said dora dora will you hear me ormond began no sir i will not interrupted dora whats the use of hearing or listening to a man who does not by the confession of his own eyes and his own tongue know two minutes together what he means or mean two minutes together the same thing a woman might as well listen to a fool or a madman too harsh too severe dora said he too true too sincere perhaps you mean since i am allowed dora to speak to you as a brother who allowed you sir interrupted dora your father dora my father cannot shall not nobody but nature can make any man my brothernobody but myself shall allow any man to call himself my brother i am sorry i presumed so far miss oshanei was only going to offer one word of advice i want no advicei will take none from you sir you shall have none madam henceforward from harry ormond tis well sir come away sheelah oh wait dearoch i am too old said sheelah groaning as she rose slowly im too slow entirely for these quick passions passions cried dora growing scarlet and pale in an instant what do you mean by passions sheelah i mean changes said sheelah changes dear i am ready nowwheres my stick thank you master harry only i say i cant change my quarters and march so quick as you dear well well lean on me said dora impatiently dont hurry poor sheelahno necessity to hurry away from me said ormond who had stood for a few moments like one transfixed tis for me to goand i will go as fast and as far as you please dora away from you and for ever for ever said dora what do you mean away from the black islands he cant mean that said sheelah why notdid not i leave castle hermitage at a moments warning warning nonsense cried dora lean on him sheelahhe has frightened you lean on him cant yousure hes better than your stick warningwhere did you find that pretty word is harry ormond then turned footman harry ormondand a minute ago she would not let memiss oshane i shall not forget myself againamuse yourself with being as capricious as you please but not at my expense little as you think of me i am not to be made your butt or your dupe therefore i must seriously beg at once that i may know whether you wish me to stay or to go to stay to be sure when my father invites you would you expose me to his displeasure you know he cant bear to be contradicted and you know that he asked you to stay and live here but without exposing you to any displeasure i can replied ormond contrive contrive nothing at alldo leave me to contrive for myself i dont mean to say leave meyou take up ones words so quickly and are so passionate mr ormond if you would have me understand you dora explain how you wish me to live with you lord bless me what a fuss the man makes about living with oneone would think it was the most difficult thing in the world cant you live on like any body else theres my aunt in the hedgerow walk all alonei must go and take care of her i leave you to take care of sheelahyou know you were always very goodnatured when we were children dora went off quick as lightning and what to make of her ormond did not well know was it mere childishness or affectation or coquetry no the real tears and real expression of look and word forbade each of these suppositions one other cause for her conduct might have been suggested by a vain man harry ormond was not a vain man but a little fluttering delight was just beginning to play round his head when sheelah leaning heavily on his arm as they ascended the bank reminding him of her existencemy poor old sheelah said he are you not tired not now thanks to your arm master harry dear that was always good to menot nowi am not a whit tired now i see all right again between my childerand happy i was these five minutes past watching you smiling to yourself and i dont doubt but all the world will smile on ye yet if it was my world it should but i can only wish you my best wish which i did long agomay you live to wonder at your own good luck ormond looked as if he was going to ask some question that interested him much but it ended by wondering what oclock it was sheelah wondered at him for thinking what the hour was when she was talking of miss dora after a silence which brought them to the chickenyard door where sheelah was to quit his arm she leaned heavily again the marriagethat they are all talking of in the kitchen and every where through the countrymiss doras marriage with white connal is reprieved for the season she axed time till shed be seventeenvery rasonable so its to be in octoberif we all live till those daysin the same mind lord he knowsi know nothing at all about it but i thank you kindly master harry and wish you well any way did you ever happen to see the bridegroom that is to be never harry longed to hear what she longed to say but he did not deem it prudent he did not think it honourable to let her enter on this topic the prudential consideration might have been conquered by curiosity but the honourable repugnance to obtaining secondhand information and encouraging improper confidence prevailed he deposited sheelah safe on her stone bench at the chickenyard door and much against her will he left her before she had told or hinted to him all she did knowand all she did not know the flattering delight that played about our young heros head had increased was increasing and ought to be diminished of this he was sensible it should never come near his heartof that he was determined he would exactly follow the letter and spirit of his benefactors commandshe would always consider dora as a married woman but the prospect of there being some temptation and some struggle was infinitely agreeable to our young heroit would give him something to do something to think of something to feel it was much in favour of his resolution that dora really was not at all the kind of woman he had pictured to himself either as amiable or charming she was not in the least like his last patterns of heroines or any of his approved imaginations of the beau ideal but she was an exceedingly pretty girl she was the only very pretty and tolerably accomplished girl immediately near him a dangerous propinquity chapter xii white connal and his fatherwe name the son first because his superior wealth inverting the order of nature gave him in his own opinion the precedency on all occasionswhite connal and his father arrived at corny castle king corny rejoiced to see his old friend the elder connal but through all the efforts that his majesty made to be more than civil to the son the degenerate grazier his future soninlaw it was plain that he was only keeping his promise and receiving such a guest as he ought to be received mademoiselle decided that old connal the father was quite a gentleman for he handed her about and in his way had some politeness towards the sex but as for the son her abhorrence must have burst forth in plain english if it had not exhaled itself safely in french in every exclamation of contempt which the language could afford she called him bte and grand bte by turns butor ne and grand butornigaud and grand nigaudpronounced him to be un homme qui ne dit riendailleurs un homme qui na pas lair comme il fautun homme enfin qui nest pas prsentablemme en fait de mari dora looked unutterable things but this was not unusual with her her scornful airs and short answers were not more decidedly rude to white connal than to others indeed she was rather more civil to him than to ormond there was nothing in her manner of keeping connal at a distance beyond what he who had not much practice or skill in the language of female coquetry might construe into maiden coyness to the acknowledged husband lover it seemed as if she had some secret hope or fear or reason for not coming to open war in short as usual she was odd if not unintelligible white connal did not disturb himself at all to follow her doublings his pleasure was not in the chasehe was sure the game was his own be bold but not too bold white connalbe negligent but not too negligent of the destined bride tis bad as you say to be spoiling a wife before marriage but what if she should never be your wife thought some that was a contingency that never had occurred to white connal had he not horses and saddles and bridles and bits finer than had ever been seen before in the black islands and had he not thousands of sheep and hundreds of oxen and had he not the finest pistols and the most famous fowlingpieces and had he not thousands in paper and thousands in gold and if he lived would he not have tens of thousands more and had he not brought with him a plan of connalstown the name by which he dignified a snug slated lodge he had upon one of his farmsan elevation of the house to be built and of the offices that had been built he had so but it happened one day when connal was going to ride out with dora that just as he mounted her veil fluttering before his horses eyes startled the animal and the awkward rider being unable to manage him king corny begged harry ormond to change horses with him that mr connal might go quietly beside dora who was a bit of a coward imprudent father harry obeyedand the difference between the riders and the gentlemen was but too apparent for what avails it that you have the finest horse if another ride him better what avails it that you have the finest saddle if another become it better what use to you your wogden pistols if another hit the mark you miss what avails the finest fowlingpiece to the worst sportsman the thousands upon thousands to him who says but little and says that little ill what avail that the offices at connals town be finished dogkennel and all or what boots it that the plan and elevation of connalstown be unrolled and submitted to the fair ones inspection and remarks if the fair disdain to inspect and if she remark only that a cottage and love are more to her taste white connal put none of these questions to himselfhe went on his own way faint heart never won fair lady then no doubt he was in a way to win for his heart never quailed his colour never changed when he saw his fair ones furtive smiles or heard her aunts open praises of the youth by whom riding dancing shooting speaking or silent he was always eclipsed connal of connalstown despised harry ormond of notownviewed him with scornful but not with jealous eyes idle jealousies were far from connals thoughtshe was intent upon the noble recreation of cockfighting cockfighting had been the taste of his boyish days before he became a moneymaking man and at every interval of business at each intermission of the passion of avarice when he had leisure to think of amusement this his first idea of pleasure recurred since he came to corny castle he had at sundry times expressed to his father his hope in heaven that before they would leave the black islands they should get some good fun cockfighting for it was a poor case for a man that is not used to it to be tied to a womans apronstrings twirling his thumbs all the mornings for forms sake there was a strolling kind of gentleman in the islands a mr otara who was a famous cockfighter otara came one day to dine at corny castle the kindred souls found each other out and an animated discourse across the table commenced concerning cocks after dinner as the bottle went round the rival cockfighters warmed to enthusiasm in praise of their birds each relating wonders they finished by proposing a match laying bets and despatching messengers and hampers for their favourites the cocks arrived and were put in separate houses under the care of separate feeders moriarty carroll who was curious and something of a sportsman had a mind to have a peep at the cocks opening the door of one of the buildings hastily he disturbed the cock who taking fright flew about the barn with such violence as to tear off several of his feathers and very much to deface his appearance unfortunately at this instant white connal and mr otara came by and finding what had happened abused moriarty with all the vulgar eloquence which anger could supply ormond who had been with moriarty but who had no share in the disaster endeavoured to mitigate the fury of white connal and apologized to mr otara otara was satisfiedshook hands with ormond and went off but white connals anger lasted longer for many reasons he disliked ormond and thinking from harrys gentleness that he might venture to insult him returned to the charge and becoming high and brutal in his tone said that mr ormond had committed an ungentlemanlike action which it was easier to apologize for than to defend harry took fire and instantly was much more ready than his opponent wished to give any other satisfaction that mr connal desired well name his hourhis place tomorrow morning six oclock in the east meadow out of reach and sight of all ormond said or he was ready at that instant if mr connal pleased he hated he said to bear malicehe could not sleep upon it moriarty now stepping up privately besought mr connals honour for heaven and earths sake to recollect if he did not know it what a desperate good shot mr harry notoriously was always what you rascal are you here still cried white connal hold your peace how dare you speak between gentlemen moriarty begged pardon and departed the hint he had given however operated immediately upon white connal this scatteredbrained young ormond said he to himself desires nothing better than to fight very naturalhe has nothing to lose in the world but his bare life neither money nor landed property as i have to quit in leaving the worldunequal odds not worth my while to stand his shot for the feather of a cock concluded connal as he pulled to pieces one of the feathers which had been the original cause of all the mischief thus cooled and suddenly become reasonable he lowered his tone declaring that he did not mean to say any thing in short that could give offence nothing but what it was natural for any man in the heat of passion to say and it was enough to put a man in a passion at first sight to see his favourite bird disfigured if he had said any thing too strong he hoped mr ormond would excuse it ormond knew what the heat of passion was and was willing to make all proper allowances white connal made more than proper apologies and ormond rejoiced that the business was ended but white connal conscious that he had first bullied then quailed and that if the story were repeated it would tell to his disadvantage made it his anxious request that he would say nothing to cornelius oshane of what had passed between them lest it should offend cornelius who he knew was so fond of mr ormond harry eased the gentlemans mind by promising that he would never say a word about the matter mr connal was not content till this promise was solemnly repeated even this though it seemed quite to satisfy him at the time did not afterwards relieve connal from the uneasy consciousness he felt in ormonds company he could bear it only the remainder of this day the next morning he left the black islands having received letters of business he said which required his immediate presence at connalstown many at corny castle seemed willing to dispense with his further stay but king corny true to his word and his character took leave of him as his soninlaw and only as far as hospitality required was ready to speed the parting guest at parting white connal drew his future fatherinlaw aside and gave him a hint that he had better look sharp after that youth he was fostering harry ormond do you mean said oshane i do said connal but mr oshane dont go to mistake me i am not jealous of the mannot capableof such a fellow as thata wild scatterbrains who is not worth a sixpence scarcei have too good an opinion of miss dora but if i was in your place her father just for the look of the thing in the whole country i should not like it not that i mind what people say a potato skin but still if i was her father id as soon have the devil an inmate and intimate in my house muzzling in my daughters ear behind backs cornelius oshane stoutly stood by his young friend he never saw harry ormond muzzlingbehind backs especiallydid not believe any such thing all harry said and did was always aboveboard and before faces any way in short said cornelius i will answer for harry ormonds honour with my own honour after that twould be useless to add with my life if requiredthat of course and this ought to satisfy any soninlaw who was a gentlemannone such could glance or mean to reflect on dora connal perceiving he had overshot himself made protestations of his innocence of the remotest intention of glancing at or reflecting upon or imagining any thing but what was perfectly angelic and proper in miss doramiss oshane then that was all as it should be mr oshane said so far but another point he would not concede to mortal man was he fifty times his soninlaw promised that was his own right to have who he pleased and willed to have at his own castle his inmate and his intimate no doubtto be sure connal said he did not meanhe only meanthe could not meanin short he meant nothing at all only just to put mr oshane on his guardthat was all he meant phoo said cornelius oshane but checking the expression of his contempt for the man he made an abrupt transition to connals horse which had just come to the door thats a handsome horse certainly you are well mounted mr connal oshanes elision of contempt was beyond mr connals understanding or feeling well mounted certainly i am that and ever will be while i can so well afford it said connal mounting his horse and identifying himself with the animal he sat proudly then bowing to the ladies who were standing at an open window good day to ye ladies till october when i hope but his horse who did not seem quite satisfied of his identity with the man would not permit him to say more and off he wenthalf his hopes dispersed in empty air i know i wish said cornelius oshane to himself as he stood on the steps looking after the man and horse i wish that that unlucky bowl of punch had remained for ever unmixed at the bottom of which i found this soninlaw for my poor daughter my innocent dora then unborn but she must make the best of him for me and herself since the fates and my word irrevocable as the styx have bound me to him the purseproud grazier and mean mannot a remnant of a gentleman as the father was oh my poor dora as king corny heaved a heartfelt sigh very difficult to force from his antisentimental bosom harry ormond with a plate of meat in his hand whistling to his dog to follow him ran down the steps leave feeding that dog and come here to me harry said oshane and answer me truly such questions as i shall ask trulyif i answer at all said harry answer you must when i ask you every man every gentleman must answer in all honour for what he does certainly answer for what he does said harry forphoo come none of your tricks upon prepositions to gain timei never knew you do the likeyoull give me a worse opinion im no schoolmaster nor you a grammarian i hope to be equivocating on monosyllables equivocate i never equivocated sir said harry dont begin now then said cornelius ive enough to put me out of humour alreadyso answer straight like yourself whats this youve done to get the illwill of white connal thats just gone surprised and embarrassed ormond answered i trust i have not his illwill sir you have sir said oshane is it possible cried harry when we shook hands you must have misunderstood or have been misinformed how do you know my dear sir i know it from the mans own lips see i can give you a straight answer at once now answer me was there any quarrel between you and what cause of offence did you give excuse me sirthose are questions which i cannot answer your blush young man answers me enough and too much mark me i thought i could answer for your honour with my own and i did so thank you sir and you shall never have reason dont interrupt me young man what reason can i have to judge of the future but from the past i am not an idiot to be bothered with fair words oh sir can you suspect i suspect nothing harry ormond i am i thank my god above suspicion listen to me you knowwhether i ever told it you before or not i cant rememberbut whether or not you know as well as if you were withinside of methat in my hearts core theres not a man alive i should have preferred for my soninlaw to the man i once thought harry ormond without a penny once thought interrupt me again and ill lave you sir in confidence between ourselves thinking as once i did that i might depend on your friendship and discretion equally with your honour i confessed i repented a rash promise and let you see my regret deep enough that my soninlaw will never be what dora deservesi said or let you see as much no matter which i am no equivocator nor do i now unsay or retract a word you have my secret but remember when first i had the folly to tell it you same time i warned youi warned you harry like the moth from the candlei warned you in vain in another tone i warn you now young man for the last timei tell you my promise to me is sacredshe is as good as married to white connalfairly tied up neck and heelsand so am i to all intents and purposes and if i thought it were possible you could consider her or make her by any means consider herself in any other light i will tell you what i would doi would shoot myself for one of us must fall and i wouldnt choose it should be you harry thats all oh hear me sir cried harry seizing his arm as he turned away kill me if you will but hear mei give you my word you are from beginning to end mistaken i cannot tell you the wholebut this much believe dora was not the cause of quarrel then there was a quarrel oh for shame for shameyou are not used to falsehood enough yetyou cant carry it throughwhy did you attempt it with me sir though i cant tell you the truth the foolish truth i tell you no falsehood doras name a thought of dora never came in question between mr connal and me upon my honour your honour repeated cornelius with a severe looksevere more in its sorrow than its anger o harry ormond what signifies whether the name was mentioned you know she was the thingthe cause of offence stop i charge youequivocate no more if a lies beneath a gentleman an equivocation is doubly beneath a man chapter xiii harry ormond thought it hard to bear unmerited reproach and suspicion found it painful to endure the altered eye of his once kind and always generous and to him always dear friend and benefactor but ormond had given a solemn promise to white connal never to mention any thing that had passed between them to oshane and he could not therefore explain these circumstances of the quarrel conscious that he was doing right he kept his promise to the person he hated and despised at the hazard at the certainty of displeasing the man he most loved in the world and to whom he was the most obliged while his heart yearned with tenderness towards his adopted father he endured the reproach of ingratitude and while he knew he had acted perfectly honourably he suffered under the suspicion of equivocation and breach of confidence he bore it all and in reward he had the conviction of his own firmness and an experience upon trial of his adherence to his word of honour the trial may seem but trivial the promise but weak still it was a great trial to him and he thought the promise as sacred as if it had been about an affair of state it happened some days after the conversation had passed between him and oshane that cornelius met otara the gentleman who had laid the bets about the cockfight with connal and chancing to ask him what had prevented the intended battle otara told all he knew of the adventure being a goodnatured and goodhumoured man he stated the matter as playfully as possibleacknowledged that they had all been foolish and angry but that harry ormond and moriarty had at last pacified them by proper apologies of what had passed afterwards of the bullying and the challenge and the submission otara knew nothing but king corny having once been put on the right scent soon made it all out he sent for moriarty and crossquestioning him heard the whole for moriarty had not been sworn to secrecy and had very good ears when he had been turned out of the stable he had retreated only to the harnessroom and had heard all that had passed king corny was delighted with harrys spiritand now he was prince harry again and the generous warmhearted cornelius went in impatience to seek him out and to beg his pardon for his suspicions he embraced him called him son and dear sonsaid he had now found out no thanks to him connals cause of complaint and it had nothing to do with dorabut why could not you say so man he had said so repeatedly well so i suppose it is to be made out clearly to be all my fault that was in a passion and could not hear understand or believe well be it so if i was unjust ill make it up to you for ill never believe my own ears or eyes against you harry while i live depend upon itif i heard you asking her to marry you i would believe my ears brought me the words wrong if i saw you even leading her into the church instead of the chapel and the priest himself warning me of it id say and think father jos tis a mistakea visionor a defect of vision in short i love and trust you as my own soul harry ormond for i did you injustice this full return of kindness and confidence besides the present delight it gave him left a permanent and beneficial impression upon our young heros mind the admiration he felt for oshanes generous conduct and the selfapprobation he enjoyed in consequence of his own honourable firmness had a great effect in strengthening and forming his character it also rendered him immediately more careful in his whole behaviour towards miss oshane he was prudent till both aunt and niece felt indignant astonishment there was some young lady with whom harry had danced and walked and of whom he had without any design spoken as a pleasing gentle girl dora recollected this praise and joining it with his present distant behaviour toward herself she was piqued and jealous and then she became what probably she would never otherwise have been quite decided in her partiality for harry ormond the proofs of this were soon so manifest that many thought and miss ofaley in particular that harry was grown stupid blind and deaf he was not stupid blind or deafhe had felt the full power of doras personal charms and his vanity had been flattered by the preference which dora showed for him where vanity is the ruling passion young men are easily flattered into being in love with any pretty perhaps with any ugly girl who is or who affects to be in love with them but harry ormond had more tenderness of heart than vanity against the suggestions of his vanity he had struggled successfully but now his heart had a hard trial doras spirits were failing her cheek growing pale her tone of voice was quite softened sighs would sometimes break forthpersuasive sighsdora was no longer the scornful lady in rude health but the interesting invalidthe victim going to be sacrificed doras aunt talked of the necessity of advice for her nieces health great stress was laid on air and exercise and exercise on horseback dora rode every day on the horse harry ormond broke in for her the only horse she could now ride and harry understood its ways and managed it so much better than any body else and dora was grown a coward so that it was quite necessary he should ride or walk beside her harry ormonds tenderness of heart increased his idea of the danger her personal charms became infinitely more attractive to him her defects of temper and character were forgotten and lost in his sense of pity and gratitude and the struggle of his feelings was now violent one morning our young hero rose early for he could no longer sleep and he walked out or more properly he rambled or he strolled or streamed out and he took his wayno his steps were irresistibly ledto his accustomed haunt by the water side under the hawthorn bank and there he walked and picked daisies and threw stones into the lake and he loitered on still thinking of dora and death and of the circles in the water and again of the victim and of the sacrifice when suddenly he was roused from his reverie by a shrill whistle that seemed to come from the wood above and an instant afterwards he heard some one shouting harry ormondharry ormond here answered harry and as the shouts were repeated he recognized the voice of otara who now came whip in hand followed by his dogs running down the bank to him oh harry ormond ive brought great news with me for all at corny castle but the ladies are not out of their nests and king cornys lord knows how far off not a soul or body to be had but yourself here by good luck and you shall have the first of the news and the telling of it thank you said ormond and what is the news first and foremost said otara you know birds of a feather flock together white connal though except for the cockfighting i never relished him was mighty fond of me and invited me down to connalstown where ive been with him this weekyou know that much i conclude harry owned he did not otara wondered how he could help knowing it but so it was we had a great cockfight and white connal who knew none of my secrets in the feeding line was bet out and out and angry enough he was and then i offered to change birds with him and beat him with his own ginger by my superiority o feeding which he scoffed at but lookup the bet ormond sighed with impatience in vainhe was forced to submit and to go through the whole detail of the cockfight the end of it was that white connal was worsted by his own bird and then mad angry was he so then continued otara to get the triumph again on his side one way or another was the thing i had the advantage of him in dogs too for he kept no houndsyou know he is close and hounds lead to a gentlemanlike expense but very fine horses he had ill acknowledge and harry ormond you cant but remember that one which he could not manage the day he was out riding here with miss dora and you changed with him i remember it well said ormond ay and he has got reason to remember it now sure enough has he had a fall said ormond stopping walk on cant yekeep up and ill tell you all regular there is king corny exclaimed ormond who just then saw him come in view come on then cried otara leaping over a ditch that was between them and running up to king corny great news for you king corny ive broughtyour soninlaw elect white connal is off offhow out of the world clean poor fellow broke his neck with that horse he could never manageon sunday last i left him for dead sunday nightfound him dead monday morningcame off straight with the news to you dead repeated corny and harry looking at one another heaven forbid said corny that i should heaven forbid repeated harry but but good morning to you both then said otara shake hands either way and ill condole or congratulate tomorrow as the case may be with more particulars if required otara ran off saying he would be back again soon but he had great business to do i told the father last night i am no hypocrite said corny rest to the dead and all their faults white connal is out of my poor doras way and i am free from my accursed promise then clasping his hands praised be heaven for thatheaven is too good to meoh my child how unworthy white connal of herthank heaven on my knees with my whole heart thank heaven that i am not forced to the sacrificemy child my darling dora she is freeharry ormond my dear boy im free cried oshane embracing harry with all the warmth of paternal affection ormond returned that embrace with equal warmth and with a strong sense of gratitude but was his joy equal to oshanes what were his feelings at this moment they were in such confusion such contradiction he could scarcely tell before he heard of white connals death at the time when he was throwing pebbles into the lake he desired nothing so much as to be able to save dora from being sacrificed to that odious marriage he thought that if he were not bound in honour to his benefactor he should instantly make that offer of his hand and heart to dora which would at once restore her to health and happiness and fulfil the wishes of her kind generous father but now when all obstacles seemed to vanishwhen his rival was no morewhen his benefactor declared his joy at being freed from his promisewhen he was embraced as oshanes son he did not feel joy he was surprised to find it but he could not now that he could marry dora now that her father expected that he should he was not clear that he wished it himself quick as obstacles vanished objections recurred faults which he had formerly seen so strongly which of late compassion had veiled from his view reappeared the softness of manner the improvement of temper caused by love might be transient as passion then her coquetryher frivolity she was not that superior kind of woman which his imagination had painted or which his judgment could approve of in a wife how was he to explain this confusion of feeling to corny leaning on his arm he walked on towards the house he saw corny smiling at his own meditations was settling the match and anticipating the joy to all he loved harry sighed and was painfully silent shoot across like an arrow to the house cried corny turning suddenly to him and giving him a kind pushshoot off harry and bring dora to meet me like lightning and the poor aunt tootwould be cruel else but what stops you son of my heart stay cried corny a sudden thought striking him which accounted for harry ormonds hesitation stop harry you are right and i am a fool there is black connal the twinbrotheroh mercyagainst us still may be old connal will keep me to it stillas he couldnt no more than i could foresee that when i promised dora that was not then born it would be twinsand as i said son and surely i meant the son that would be born thenand twins is all as one as one they say promise fettering still bad off as ever may be said cornelius his whole countenance and voice changed he sat down on a fallen tree and rested his hands on his knees what shall we do now harry with black connal he may be a very different man from white connalin every respect said ormond oshane looked up for a moment and then interpreting his own way exclaimed thats right harrythat thought is like yourself and the very thought i had myself we must make no declarations till we have cleared the point of honour not the most beautiful angel that ever took womans beautiful formand thats the greatest temptation man can meetcould tempt my harry ormond from the straight path of honour harry ormond stood at this moment abashed by praise which he did not quite deserve indeed sir said he you give me too much credit i cannot give you too much credit you are an honourable young man and i understand you through and through that was more than harry himself did corny went on talking to himself aloud black connal is abroad these great many years ever since he was a boynever saw him since a child that highan officer he is in the irish brigade nowblack eyes and hair that was why they called him black connalcaptain connal now and i heard the father say he was come to england and there was some report of his going to be married if i dont mistake cried corny turning again to harry pleasure rekindling in his eye if that should be theres hope for us still but i see you are right not to yield to the hope till we are clear my first step in honour no doubt must be across the lake this minute to the fatherconnal of glynn but the boat is on the other side the horn is with my fishingtackle harry down yonderrun for you can runhorn the boat or if the horn be not there sign to the boat with your handkerchiefbring it up here and i will put across before ten minutes shall be overmy horse i will have down to the waters edge by the time you have got the boat upwhen an honourable tough job is to be done the sooner the better the horse was brought to the waters edge the boat came across corny and his horse were in and corny with his own hands on the oar pushed away from land then calling to harry he bid him wait on the shore by such an hour and he should have the first news rest on your oars you while i speak to prince harry that you may know all harry sooner than i can tell you if all be safe or as we wish it see ill hoist my neckcloth white to the top of this oar if not the black flag or none at all shall tell you say nothing till thengod bless you boy harry was glad that he had these orders for he knew that as soon as mademoiselle should be up and hear of otaras early visit with the message he said he had left at the house that he brought great news mademoiselle would soon sally forth to learn what that news might be in this conjecture ormond was not mistaken he soon heard her voice mondieuing at the top of the bank he duckedhe divedhe darted through nettles and brambles and escaped seen or unseen he escaped nor stopped his flight even when out of reach of the danger as to trusting himself to meet doras eyes twas what he dared not he hid and wandered up and down till near dinnertime at last oshanes boat was seen returningbut no white flag the boat rowed nearer and nearer and reached the spot where harry stood motionless ay my poor boy i knew id find you so said oshane as he got ashore theres my hand you have my hearti wish i had another hand to give youbut its all over with us i fear oh my poor doraand here she is coming down the bank and the auntoh dora you have reason to hate me to hate you sir impossible said ormond squeezing his hand strongly as he felt impossibletruefor her to hate who is all love and lovelinessimpossible too for you harry ormond who is all goodness bon dieu cried mademoiselle who was now within exclamation distance what a course we have had after you gentlemen ladies looking for gentlemencest inouwhat is it all for i am dying with curiosity without answering mademoiselle the father and harrys eyes at the same moment were fixed on one who was some steps behind and who looked as if dying with a softer passion harry made a step forward to offer his arm but stopped short the father offered his in silence can nobody speak to mebien poli said mademoiselle if you please miss ofaley maam cried a hatless footman who had run after the ladies the wrong way from the house if you please maam will she send up dinner now oui quon serveyes she will let her dishby that time she is dished we shall be inand have satisfied our curiosity i hope added she turning to her brotherinlaw let us dine first said cornelius and when the cloth is removed and the waitingears out of hearing time enough to have our talk to ourselves bien singulier ces anglois muttered mademoiselle to herself as they proceeded to the house here is a young man and the most polite of the silent company who may well be in some haste for his dinner for to my knowledge he is without his breakfast harry had no appetite for dinner but swallowed as much as mademoiselle ofaley desired a remarkably silent meal it would have been but for her happy volubility equal to all occasions at last came the long expected words take away when all was taken away and all were gone but those who as oshane said would too soon wish unheard what they were dying to hear he drew his daughters chair close to him placed her so as to save her blushes and began his story by relating all that otara had told it was a sudden deathshocking mademoiselle repeated several times but both she and dora recovered from the shock or from the word shocking and felt the delight of doras being no longer a sacrifice after a general thanksgiving having been offered for her escape from the butor mademoiselle in transports was going on to say that now her niece was free to make a suitable match and she was just turning to wonder that harry ormond was not that moment at her nieces feet and doras eyes raised slowly towards him and suddenly retracted abashed and perplexed harry indescribably when corny continued thus dora is not free nor am i free in honour yet nor can i give any body freedom of tongue or heart until i know farther various exclamations of surprise and sorrow interrupted him am i never never to be free cried dora oh am not i now at liberty hear me my child said her father i feel it as you do and what is it nextquestce que cestthis new obstaclewhat can it be said mademoiselle the father then stated sorrowfully that old connal of glynn would by no means relinquish the promise but considered it equally binding for the twin born with white connal considering both twins as coming under the promise to his son that was to be born he said he would write immediately to his son who was now in england and now tell me what kind of a person is this new pretender this mr black connal cried mademoiselle of him we know nothing as yet said oshane but i hope in heaven that the man that is coming is as different from the man thats gone as black from white harry heard dora breathe quick and quicker but she said nothing then we shall get his answer to the fathers letter in eight days i count said mademoiselle and i have great hopes we shall never be troubled with him we shall know if he will come or not in eight days about that time said oshane but sister ofaley do not nurse my child or yourself up with deceitful hopes theres not a man alivenot a connal surely hearing what happiness he is heir to but would come flying over posthaste so you may expect his answer in eight daysdora my darling and god grant he may be no matter what he is sirill die before i will see him cried dora rising and bursting into tears oh my child you wont dieyou cantfrom me your father her father threw his arms round her and would have drawn her to him but she turned her face from him harry was on the other sideher eyes met his and her face became covered with blushes open the window harry said oshane who saw the conflict open the windowwe all want it harry opened the window and hung out of it gasping for breath shes gonethe aunt has taken her offits over for this fit said oshane oh my child i must go through with it my boy i honour as i love youi have a great deal to say about your own affairs harry my affairsoh what affairs have i never think of me dear sir i willbut cant nowi am spent for this dayleave out the bottle of claret for father jos and ill get to bedill see nobody tell father josim gone to my room the next morning otara came to breakfast every person had a different question to ask him except dora who was silent corny asked what kind of man black connal was mademoiselle inquired whether he was most french or english ormond whether he was going to be married to all these questions otara pleaded ignorance except with respect to the sports of the field he had very little curiosity or intelligence a ray of hope again darted across the mind of corny from his knowledge of the world he thought it very probable that a young officer in the french brigade would be well contented to be heir to his brothers fortune without encumbering himself with an irish wife taken from an obscure part of the country corny therefore eagerly inquired from otara what became of white connals property otara answered that the common cry of the country was that all white connals profitable farms were leasehold property and upon his own life poor cornys hopes were thus frustrated he had nothing left to do for some days but to pity harry ormond to bear with the curiosity and impatience of mademoiselle and with the froward sullenness of dora till some intelligence should arrive respecting the new claimant to her destined hand chapter xiv a few days afterwards sheelah bursting into doras room exclaimed miss dora miss dora for the love of god they are coming theyre coming down the avenue powdering along black connal himself flaming away with one in a gold hat this big galloping after and all gold over he is entirelyoh what will become of us master harry now oh it took the sight out of my eyesand yours as red as ferrets dearoh the cratur but come to the window and look outnobody will mindstretch out the body and ill hold ye fast never fearat the turn of the big wood do you see them behind the trees the fir dales glittering and flaming do you see them at all too plainly said dora sighing but i did not expect he would come in such a grand style i wonder oh so do i greatlymostly at the carriage never saw the like with the connals so grandbut the queer thing ah my dear dore un cabriolet cried mademoiselle entering in ecstacy here is monsieur de connal for you in a french cabriolet and a french servant riding on to advertise you and all oh what are you twisting your neck child i will have no toss at him nowhe is all the gentleman you shall see so let me set you all to rights while your father is receive i would not have him see you such a horrible figurenot presentable you look i do not care how i lookthe worse the better said dora i wish to look a horrible figure to himto black connal oh put your black connals out of your headthat is always in your mouth i tell you he is call m de connal now did i not hear him this minute announced by his own valetmonsieur de connal presents his complimentshe beg permission to present himselfand there was i luckily to answer for your father in french french sure black connals irish born said sheelah that much i know any way a servant knocked at the door with king cornys request that the ladies would come down stairs to see as the footman added to his masters message to see old mr connal and the french gentleman there french i told you said mademoiselle and quite the gentleman depend upon it my dearcome your ways no matter what he is said dora i shall not go down to see him so you had better go by yourself aunt not one step oh that would be the height of impolitesse and disobedienceyou could not do that my dear dore consider he is not a man that nobody knows like your old butor of a white connal not signify how bad you treat himlike the dog but here is a man of a certain quality who knows the best people in paris who can talk and tell every where oh in conscience my dear dore i shall not suffer these airs with a man who is somebody and if he were the king of france cried dora if he were alexander the great himself i would not be forced to see the man or marry him against my will marry who talk of marry not come to that yet ten to one he has no thought of you more than politeness require oh as to that said dora aunt you certainly are mistaken there what do you think he comes over to ireland what do you think he comes here for hark then said sheelah dont i hear them out of the window faith there they are walking and talking and laughing as if there was nothing at all in it just heavens what a handsome uniform said miss ofaley and a very properlooking man said sheelah well whod have thought black connal if its him would ever have turned out so fine a presence of a man to look at very cavalier indeed to go out to walk without waiting to see us said dora oh i will engage it was that dear father of yours hoisted him out hoisted him out well aunt you do sometimes speak the oddest english but i do think it strange that he should be so very much at his ease look at himhear himi wonder what he is sayingand harry ormondgive me my bonnet sheelahbehind you quick aunt let us go out of the garden door and meet them out walking by accidentthat is the best wayi long to see how somebody will look very goodnow you look all life and spiritperfectly charming look that manner and ill engage he will fall in love with you he had better not i can tell him unless he has a particular pleasure in being refused said dora with a toss of her head and neck and at the same time a glance at her lookingglass as she passed quickly out of the room dora and her aunt walked out and accidentally met the gentlemen in their walk as m de connal approached he gave them full leisure to form their opinions as to his personal appearance he had the air of a foreign officereasy fashionable and upon uncommonly good terms with himselfconscious but with no vulgar consciousness of possessing a fine figure and a good face his was the air of a french coxcomb who in unconstrained delight was rather proud to display than anxious to conceal his perfect selfsatisfaction interrupting his conversation only when he came within a few paces of the ladies he advanced with an air of happy confidence and parisian gallantry begging that mr oshane would do him the honour and pleasure to present him after a bow that said nothing to dora he addressed his conversation entirely to her aunt walking beside mademoiselle and neither approaching nor attempting to speak to dora he did not advert to her in the least and seemed scarcely to know she was present this quite disconcerted the young ladys whole plan of proceedingsno opportunity was afforded her of showing disdain she withdrew her arm from her aunts though mademoiselle held it as fast as she couldbut dora withdrew it resolutely and falling back a step or two took harry ormonds arm and walked with him talking with as much unconcern and as loudly as she could to mark her indifference but whether she talked or was silent walked on with harry ormond or stayed behind whispered or laughed aloud it seemed to make no impression no alteration whatever in monsieur de connal he went on conversing with mademoiselle and with her father alternately in french and english in english he spoke with a native irish accent which seemed to have been preserved from childhood but though the brogue was strong yet there were no vulgar expressions he spoke good english but generally with somewhat of french idiom whether this was from habit or affectation it was not easy to decide it seemed as if the person who was speaking thought in french and translated it into english as he went on the peculiarity of manner and accentfor there was french mixed with the irishfixed attention and besides dora was really curious to hear what he was saying for he was very entertaining mademoiselle was in raptures while he talked of paris and versailles and various people of consequence and fashion at the court the dauphinessshe was then but just marriedde connal had seen all the ftes and the fireworksbut the beautiful dauphinessin answering a question of mademoiselles about the colour of her hair he for the first time showed that he had taken notice of dora nearly the colour i think of that young ladys hair as well as one can judge but powder prevents the possibility of judging accurately dora was vexed to see that she was considered merely as a young lady she exerted herself to take a part in the conversation but mr connal never joined in conversation with herwith the most scrupulous deference he stopped short in the middle of his sentence if she began to speak he stood aside shrinking into himself with the utmost care if she was to pass he held the boughs of the shrubs out of her way but continued his conversation with mademoiselle all the time when they came in from their walk the same sort of thing went on it really is very extraordinary thought she he seems as if he was spellboundobliged by his notions of politeness to let me pass incognita mademoiselle was so fully engaged chattering away that she did not perceive doras mortification the less notice connal took of her the more dora wished to attract his attention not that she desired to please himno she only longed to have the pleasure of refusing him for this purpose the offer must be madeand it was not at all clear that any offer would be made when the ladies went to dress before dinner mademoiselle while she was presiding at doras toilette expressed how much she was delighted with m de connal and asked what her niece thought of him dora replied that indeed she did not trouble herself to think of him at allthat she thought him a monstrous coxcomband that she wondered what could bring so prodigiously fine a gentleman to the black islands ask your own sense what brought him here or ask your own lookingglass what shall keep him here said miss ofaley i can tell you he thinks you very handsome already and when he sees you dress really he does me honour he did not seem as if he had even seen me more than any of the trees in the wood or the chairs in the room chairsoh now you fish for complimens but i shall not tell you how like he thinks you if you were mise la franoise to la belle comtesse de barnac but is not it very extraordinary he absolutely never spoke to me said dora a very strange manner of paying his court mademoiselle assured dora that this was owing to m de connals french habits the young ladies in paris passing for nothing scarcely ever appearing in society till they are married the gentlemen have no intercourse with them and it would be considered as a breach of respect due to a young lady or her mother to address much conversation to her and you know my dear dore their marriages are all make up by the father the mother the friendsthe young people themselves never speak never know nothing at all about each one another till the contract is sign in fact the young lady is the little round what you call cipher but has no value in socit at all till the figure of de husband come to give it the value i have no notion of being a cipher said dora i am not a french young lady monsieur de connal ah but my dear dore consider what is de french wife ah then come her great glory then she reign over all hearts and is in full libert to dress to go to come to do what she like with her own carriage her own box at de opera andyou listen well and i shall draw all that out for you from m de connal dora languidly sullenly begged her aunt would not give herself the troubleshe had no curiosity but nevertheless she asked several questions about la comtesse de barnac and all the time saying she did not in the least care what he thought or said of her she drew from her aunt every syllable that m de connal had uttered and was secretly mortified and surprised to find he had said so little she could not dress herself to her mind today and protesting she did not care how she looked she resigned herself into her aunts hands whatever he might think she should take care to show him at dinner that young ladies in this country were not ciphers at dinner however as before all doras preconcerted airs of disdain and determination to show that she was somebody gave way she did not know how before m de connals easy assurance and polite indifference his knowledge of the world and his talents for conversation with the variety of subjects he had flowing in from all parts of the world gave him advantages with which there was no possibility of contending he talked and carvedall life and gaiety and fashion he spoke of battles of princes plays operas wine women cardinals religion politics poetry and turkeys stuffed with trufflesand paris for everdash on at every thinghit or misssure of the applause of mademoiselleand as he thought secure of the admiration of the whole company of natives from le beaupre at the foot of the table to the boy who waited or who did not wait opposite to him but who stood entranced with wonder at all that m de connal said and all that he dideven to the fashion in which he stowed trusses of salad into his mouth with a fork and talkedthrough it all and dora what did she thinkshe thought she was very much mortified that there was room for her to say so little the question now was not what she thought of m de connal but what he thought of her after beginning with various little mock defences avertings of the head and twists of the neck of the shoulders and hips compound motions resolvable into mauvaise honte and pride as dinner proceeded and monsieur de connals success was undoubted she silently gave up her resolution not to admire before the first course was over connal perceived that he had her eye before the second is over thought he i shall have her ear and by the time we come to the dessert i shall be in a fair way for the heart though he seemed to have talked without any design except to amuse himself and the company in general yet in all he had said there had been a prospective view to his object he chose his means well and in mademoiselle he found at once a happy dupe and a confederate without previous concert they raised visions of parisian glory which were to prepare the young ladys imagination for a french lover or a french husband m de connal was well aware that no matter who touched her heart if he could pique her vanity after dinner when the ladies retired old mr connal began to enter upon the question of the intended union between the familiesormond left the room and corny suppressed a deep sigh m de connal took an early opportunity of declaring that there was no truth in the report of his going to be married in england he confessed that such a thing had been in questionhe must speak with delicacybut the family and connexions did not suit him he had a strong prejudice he owned in favour of ancient familyirish family he had always wished to marry an irish womanfor that reason he had avoided opportunities that might have occurred of connecting himself perhaps advantageously in france he was really ambitious of the honour of an alliance with the oshanes nothing could be more fortunate for him than the friendship which had subsisted between his father and mr oshaneand the promiserelinquish itoh that he assured mr oshane was quite impossible provided the young lady herself should not make a decided objectionhe should abide by her decisionhe could not possibly think of pressing his suit if there should appear any repugnance in that case he should be infinitely mortifiedhe should be absolutely in despair but he should know how to submitcost him what it would he should think as a man of honour it was his part to sacrifice his wishes to what the young lady might conceive to be for her happiness he added a profusion of compliments on the young ladys charms with a declaration of the effect they had already produced on his heart this was all said with a sort of nonchalance which corny did not at all like but mademoiselle who was summoned to cornys private council gave it as her opinion that m de connal was already quite in lovequite as much as a french husband ever was she was glad that her brotherinlaw was bound by his promise to a gentleman who would really be a proper husband for her niece mademoiselle in short saw every thing couleur de rose and she urged that since m de connal had come to ireland for the express purpose of forwarding his present suit he ought to be invited to stay at corny castle that he might endeavour to make himself acceptable to dora to this corny acceded he left mademoiselle to make the invitation for he said she understood french politeness and all that better than he did the invitation was made and accepted with all due expressions of infinite delight well my dear harry ormond said corny the first moment he had an opportunity of speaking to harry in private what do you think of this man what miss oshane thinks of him is the question said harry with some embarrassment thats trueit was too hard to ask you but ill tell you what i think between ourselves black connal is better than white inasmuch as a puppy is better than a brute we shall see what dora will say or think soonthe aunt is over head and ears already women are mighty apt to be taken one way or other with a bit of a coxcomb vanityvanity but still i knowi suspect dora has a heart from me i hope she has a right to a heart but i will say no more till i see which way the heart turns and settles after all the little tremblings and variations when it points steady i shall know how to steer my course i have a scheme in my head but i wont mention it to you harry because it might end in disappointment so go off to bed and to sleep if you can you have had a hard day to go through my poor honourable harry and poor honourable harry had many hard days to go through he had now to see how doras mind was gradually worked upon not by a new passion for mr connal never inspired or endeavoured to inspire passion but by her own and her aunts vanity mademoiselle with constant importunity assailed her and though dora saw that her aunts only wish was to settle in paris and to live in a fine hotel and though dora was persuaded that for this her aunt would without scruple sacrifice her happiness and that of harry ormond yet she was so dazzled by the splendid representation of a parisian life as not to see very distinctly what object she had herself in view connals flattery too though it had scarcely any pretence to the tone of truth or passion yet contrasting with his previous indifference gratified her she was sensible that he was not attached to her as harry ormond was but she flattered herself that she should quite turn his head in time she tried all her power of charming for this purpose at first chiefly with the intention of exciting harrys jealousy and forcing him to break his honourable resolution harry continued her first object for some little time but soon the idea of piquing him was merely an excuse for coquetry she imagined that she could recede or advance with her new admirer just as she thought proper but she was mistaken she had now to deal with a man practised in the game he might let her appear to win but not for nothing would he let her win a single move yet he seemed to play so carelessly as not in the least to alarm or put her on her guard the bystanders began to guess how the game would terminate it was a game in which the whole happiness of doras life was at stake to say nothing of his own and ormond could not look on without anxietyand notwithstanding his outwardly calm appearance without strong conflicting emotions if said he to himself i were convinced that this man would make her happy i think i could be happy myself but the more he saw of connal the less he thought him likely to make dora happy unless indeed her vanity could quite extinguish her sensibility then monsieur de connal would be just the husband to suit her connal was exactly what he appeared to bea gay young officer who had made his own way up in the worlda petitmatre who had really lived in good company at paris and had made himself agreeable to women of rank and fortune he might perhaps as he said with his figure and fashion and connexions have made his fortune in paris by marriage had he had time to look about himbut a sudden run of illfortune at play had obliged him to quit paris for a season it was necessary to make his fortune by marriage in england or ireland and as expeditiously as possible in this situation dora with her own and her aunts property was as he considered it an offer not to be rashly slighted nor yet was he very eager about the matterif he failed here he should succeed elsewhere this real indifference gave him advantages with dora which a man of feeling would perhaps never have obtained or never have kept her father though he believed in the mutable nature of woman yet could scarcely think that his daughter dora was of this nature he could scarcely conceive that her passion for harry ormondthat passion which had but a short time before certainly affected her spirits and put him in fear for her healthcould have been conquered by a coxcomb who cared very little whether he conquered or not how was this possible good corny invented many solutions of the problem he fancied one hour that his daughter was sacrificing herself from duty to him or complaisance to her aunt the next hour he settled and with more probability that she was piqued by harry ormonds not showing more passion king corny was resolved to know distinctly how the matter really was he therefore summoned his daughter and aunt into his presence and the person he sent to summon them was harry ormond come back with them yourself harryi shall want you also harry returned with both the ladies by the countenance of cornelius oshane they all three augured that he had something of importance to say and they stood in anxious expectation he went to the point immediately dora i know it is the custom on some occasions for ladies never to tell the truththerefore i shall not ask any question that i think will put your truth to the test i shall tell you my mind and leave you to judge for yourself take as long or as short a time to know your own mind as you pleaseonly know it clearly and send me your answer by your aunt all i beg is that when the answer shall be delivered to me this young man may be by dont interrupt me dorai have a high opinion of him said he keeping his eye upon doras face i have a great esteem affection love for him he pronounced the words deliberately that he might see the effect on dora but her countenance was as undecided as her mindno judgment could be formed from its changes i wish harry ormond continued he to know all my conduct he knows that long ago i made a foolish promise to give my daughter to a man i knew nothing about mademoiselle was going to interrupt but cornelius oshane silenced her mademoisellesister ofaley i will do the best i can to repair that follyand to leave you at liberty dora to follow the choice of your heart he paused and again studied her countenance which was agitated her choice is your choiceher fathers choice is always the choice of the good daughter said mademoiselle i believe she is a good daughter and that is the particular reason i am determined to be as good a father as i can to her dora wept in silenceand mademoiselle a good deal alarmed wanted to remove harry ormond out of the young ladys sight she requested him to go to her apartment for a smellingbottle for her niece no no said king corny go yourself sister ofaley if you like it but ill not let harry ormond stirhe is my witness present dora is not faintingif you would only let her alone she would do well dora listen to me if you dont really prefer this black connal for a husband to all other men as you are to swear at the altar you do if you marry him dora was strongly affected by the solemn manner of her fathers appeal to her if continued her father you are not quite clear my dear child that you prefer him to other men do not marry him i have a notion i can bring you off without breaking my word listen i would willingly give half my fortune to secure your happiness my darling if i do not mistake him mr connal would for a less sum give me back my promise and give you up altogether my dear dora doras tears stopped mademoiselles exclamations poured forth and they both declared they were certain that mr connal would not for any thing upon earth that could be offered to him give up the match corny said he was willing to make the trial if they pleased mademoiselle seemed to hesitate but dora eagerly accepted the proposal thanked her father for his kindness and declared that she should be happy to have and to abide by this test of mr connals love if he were so base as to prefer half her fortune to herself she should she said think herself happy in having escaped from such a traitor doras pride was wakened and she now spoke in a high tone she always even in the midst of her weaknesses had an ambition to show spirit i will put the test to him myself within this hour said corny and before you go to bed this night when the clock strikes twelve all three of you be on this spot and i will give you his answer but stay harry ormond we have not had your opinionwould you advise me to make this trial certainly sir but if i should lose half of doras fortune you would think it well bestowed i am sure sir in securing her from an unhappy marriage but then she might not perhaps so easily find another lover with half a fortunethat might make a difference hey harry impossible i should think sir that it could make the least difference in the affection of any one who reallywho was really worthy of miss oshane the agitation into which harry ormond was thrown flattered and touched dora for the moment her aunt hurried her out of the room cornelius oshane rang and inquired where mr connal was in his own apartment writing letters his servant believed oshane sent to beg to see him as soon as he was at leisure at twelve oclock dora mademoiselle and ormond were all in the study punctually as the clock was striking well what is m de connals answer cried mademoiselle if he hesitate my dear dore give him up dat minute undoubtedly said dora i have too much spirit to do otherwise whats his answer father his answer my dear child has proved that you knew him better than i didhe scorns the offer of half your fortunefor your whole fortune he would not give you up i thought so cried dora triumphantly i thought so echoed mademoiselle i did him injustice cried ormond i am glad that m de connal has proved himself worthy of you dora since you really approve of himyou have not a friend in the world next to your father who wishes your happiness more sincerely than i do he hurried out of the room theres a heart for you said corny not for me said mademoiselle he has no passion in him i give you joy dora said her father i own i misjudged the manon account of his being a bit of a coxcomb but if you can put up with that so will iwhen i have done a man injustice i will make it up to him every way i can now let him he has my consent be as great a coxcomb as ever wore red heels ill put up with it all since he really loves my child i did not think he would have stood the test nor would he had not he been properly prepared by mademoiselleshe had before m de connal went to corny sent him a little billet which told him the test that would be proposed and thus prevented all possibility of her dear nieces being disappointed in her lover or her husband chapter xv vain of showing that he was not in the slightest degree jealous connal talked to ormond in the freest manner imaginable touching with indifference even on the very subject which ormond from feelings of delicacy and honour had anxiously avoided connal seemed to be perfectly aware how matters had stood before his arrival between dora and our young hero it was all very well he said quite naturalin the common course of thingsimpossible it should have been otherwise a young woman who saw no one else must inevitably fall in love with the first agreeable young man who made love to her or who did not make love to herit was quite equal to him which he had heard wonders from his fatherinlaw elect on that last topic and he was willing to oblige him or any other gentleman or lady by believing miracles ormond extremely embarrassed by the want of delicacy and feeling with which this polished coxcomb spoke had however sufficient presence of mind to avoid either by word or look making any particular application of what was said you have really prodigious presence of mind and discretion and tact for a young man who has i presume had so little practice in these affairs said connal but dont constrain yourself longer i speak frankly to take off all embarrassment on your partyou see there exists none on minenever for a moment no how can it possibly signify continued he to any man of common sense who or what a woman liked before she saw him you dont think a man who has seen any thing of the world would trouble himself to inquire whether he was or was not the first love of the woman he is going to marry to marryobserve the emphasisdistinguishdistinguish and seriously let us calculate ormond gave no interruption to his calculations and the petitmatre in a tone of philosophic fatuity asked of the numbers of your english or irish wivesall excellenthow many i pray you do you calculate are now married to the man they first fell in love with as they call it my good sir not five per cent depend on it the thing is morally impossible unless girls are married out of a convent as with us in france and very difficult even then and after all what are the french husbands the better for it i understand english husbands think themselves best off i dont pretend to judge but they seem to prefer what they call domestic happiness to the french esprit de socit still this may be prejudice of educationof country each nation has its taste every thing is for the best in this world for people who know how to make the best of it you would not think to look at me i was so philosophic but even in the midst of my military career i have thoughtthought profoundly every body in france thinks now said m de connal taking a pinch of snuff with a very pensive air every body in france thinks now repeated ormond every man of a certain rank that is to say that is to say of your rank said ormond nay i dont give myself as an example butyou may judgei own i am surprised to find myself philosophizing here in the black islandsbut one philosophizes every where and you would have more time for it here i should suppose than in paris time my dear sirno such thing time is merely in idea but taistoi jean jacques taistoi condillac to resume the chain of our reasoninglove and marriagei say it all comes to much the same thing in france and in these countriesafter all there is more gallantry perhaps before marriage in england more after marriage in francewhich has the better bargain i dont pretend to decide philosophic doubt for me especially in cases where tis not worth while to determine but i see i astonish you mr ormond you do indeed said ormond ingenuously i give you joyi envy you said m de connal sighing after a certain age if one lives in the world one cant be astonishedthats a lost pleasure to me who have lived out of the world it is a pleasure or rather a sensationi am not sure whether i should call it a pleasurethat is not likely to be soon exhausted said ormond a sensation and you are not sure whether you should call it a pleasure do you know youve a genius for metaphysics i exclaimed ormond ah now i have astonished you again good whether pleasurable or not trust me nothing is so improving to a young man as to be well astonished astonishment i conceive to be a sort of mental electric shockelectric fire it opens at once and enlightens the understanding and really you have an understanding so well worth enlighteningi do assure you that your natural acuteness will whenever and wherever you appear make you un homme marquant oh spare me mr connal said ormond i am not used to french compliment no upon my honour without compliment in all english bonhommie laying his hand upon his heartupon the honour of a gentleman your remarks have sometimes perfectly astonished me really said ormond but i thought you had lived so much in the world you could not be astonished i thought so i own said connal but it was reserved for m ormond to convince me of my mistake to revive an old pleasuremore difficult still than to invent a new one in recompense i hope i give you some new ideasjust throw out opinions for you acceptrejectreject nowaccept an hour a year hence perhapsjust as it strikesmerely materials for thinking i give you thank you said ormond and be assured they are not lost upon me you have given me a great deal to think of seriously seriouslyno thats your fault your national fault permit me what you want chiefly in conversationin every thing is a certain degree ofofyou have no english wordlightness lgret perhaps you mean said ormond precisely i forgot you understood french so well lgretuntranslatableyou seize my idea he left ormond as he fancied in admiration of the man who in his own opinion possessed the whole theory and practice of the art of pleasing and the science of happiness m de connals conversation and example might have produced a great effect on the mind of a youth of ormonds strong passions lively imagination and total ignorance of the world if he had met this brilliant officer in different society had he seen connal only as a man shining in company or considered him merely as a companion he must have been dazzled by his fashion charmed by his gaiety and imposed upon by his decisive tone had such a vision lighted on the black islands and appeared to our hero suddenly in any other circumstances but those in which it did appear it might have struck and overawed him and without inquiring whether from heaven or hell he might have followed wherever it led or pointed the way but in the form of a triumphant rivalwithout delicacy without feeling neither deserving nor loving the woman he had wonnot likely to make dora happyalmost certain to make her father miserablethere was no danger that black connal could ever obtain any ascendancy over ormond on the contrary connal was useful in forming our heros character the electric shock of astonishment did operate in a salutary manner in opening harrys understanding the materials for thinking were not thrown away he did thinkeven in the black islands and in judging of connals character he made continual progress in forming his own he had motive for exercising his judgmenthe was anxious to study the mans character on doras account seeing his unpolished friend old corny and this finished young man of the world in daily contrast ormond had occasion to compare the real and the factitious both in matter and manner he distinguished and felt often acutely the difference between that politeness of the heart which respects and sympathizes with the feelings of others and that conventional politeness which is shown merely to gratify the vanity of him by whom it is displayed in the same way he soon discriminated in conversation between cornys power of original thinking and m de connals knack of throwing old thoughts into new words between the power of answering an argument and the art of evading it by a repartee but it was chiefly in comparing different ideas of happiness and modes of life that our young heros mind was enlarged by connals conversationwhilst the comparison he secretly made between this polished gentlemans principles and his own was always more satisfactory to his pride of virtue than connals vanity could have conceived to be possible one day some conversation passed between connal and his fatherinlaw elect as he now always called him upon his future plans of life good corny said he did not know how to hope that during the few years he had to live connal would not think of taking his daughter from him to paris as from some words that had dropped from mademoiselle he had reason to fear no connal said he had formed no such cruel intention the irish half of mademoiselle must have blundered on this occasion he would do his utmost if he could with honour to retire from the service unless the service imperiously called him away he should settle in ireland he should make it a point even independently of his duty to his own father not to take miss oshane from her country and her friends the father openhearted and generous himself was fond to believe what he wished and confiding in these promises the old man forgave all that he did not otherwise approve of in his future soninlaw and thanked him almost with tears in his eyes still repeating as his natural penetration remonstrated against his credulity but i could hardly have believed this from such a young man as you captain connal indeed how you could ever bring yourself to think of settling in retirement is wonderful to me but love does mighty things brings about great changes french commonplaces of sentiment upon love and compliments on doras charms and his own sensibility were poured out by connal and the father left the room satisfied connal then throwing himself back in his chair burst out a laughing and turning to ormond the only person in the room said could you have conceived this conceived what sir said ormond conceived this king cornys capacity for belief whatbelieve that i will settle in his black islandsias well believe me to be half marble half man like the unfortunate in the black islands of the arabian tales settle in the black islandsno could you conceive a man on earth could be found so simple as to credit such a thing here is another man on earth who was simple enough to believe it said ormond and to give you credit for it you cried connalthats too muchimpossible but when you said itwhen i heard you promise it to mr oshane oh mercydont kill me with laughing said he laughing affectedly oh that face of yoursthere is no standing it you heard me promiseand the accent on promise why even women nowadays dont lay such an emphasis on a promise that i suppose depends on who gives it said ormond rather on who receives it said connal but look here you who understand the doctrine of promises tell me what a poor conscientious man must do who has two pulling him different ways a conscientious man cannot have given two diametrically opposite promises diametricallythank you for that wordit just saves my lost conscience commend me always to an epithet in the last resource for giving one latitude of conscience in these nice casesi have not given two diametrically oppositeno i have only given four that cross one another one to your king corny another to my angel dora another to the dear aunt and a fourth to my dearer self first promise to king corny to settle in the black islands a gratuitous promise signifying nothingread burlamaqui second promise to mademoiselle to go and live with her at paris with heron the face of it absurd a promise extorted too under fear of my life of immediate peril of being talked to deathsee vatel on extorted promisesvoid third promise to my angel dora to live wherever she pleases but thats a lovers promise made to be brokensee loves calendar or if you prefer the bookmens authority i dont doubt that under the head of promises made when a man is not in his right senses some of those learned fellows in wigs would bring me off sain et sauf but now for my fourth promisei am a man of honourwhen i make a promise intending to keep it no man so scrupulous all promises made to myself come under this head and i have promised myself to live and make my wife live wherever i please or not to live with her at all this promise i shall bold sacred oblige me with a smile mr ormonda smile of approbation excuse me mr connal that is impossiblei am sincere so am i and sincerely you are too romantic see things as they are as a man of the world i beseech you i am not a man of the world and i thank god for it cried ormond thank your god for what you please said connal but in disdaining to be a man of the world you will not i hope refuse to let me think you a man of common sense think what you please of me said ormond rather haughtily what i think of myself is the chief point with me you will lose this little brusquerie of manner said connal when you have mixed more with mankind providentially we are all made dependent on one anothers good opinion even i you see cannot live without yours whether from vanity from the habit of wishing to charm every body in every house he entered especially any one who made resistance or whether he was piqued and amused with ormonds frank and natural character and determined to see how far he could urge him connal went on though our young hero gave him no encouragement to hope that he should win his good opinion candidly said he put yourself in my place for a moment i was in england following my own projects i was not in love with the girl as youwell pardonas anybody might have beenbut i was at a distance that makes all the difference i am sent for over by two fathers and i am told that in consequence of my good or evil fortune in being born a twin and of some inconceivable promise between two irish fathers over a punchbowl i am to have the refusal i should rather say the acceptance of a very pretty girl with a very pretty fortune now except just at the moment when the overture reached me it could not have been listened to for a moment by such a man as i am insufferable coxcomb said ormond to himself but to answer a question which i omitted to answer just now to my fatherinlawwhat could induce me to come over and think of settling in the black islands i answerfor i am determined to win your confidence by my candouri answer in one word un billarda billiardtable to tell you all i confess confess nothing i beg mr connal to me that you do not wish to be known to mr oshane i am his friendhe is my benefactor you would not repeatyou are a gentleman and a man of honour i am and as such i desire on this occasion not to hear what i ought neither to repeat nor to keep secret it is my duty not to leave my benefactor in the dark as to any point oh comecome interrupted connal we had better not take it on this serious tone lest if we begin to talk of duty we should presently conceive it to be our duty to run one another through the body which would be no pleasure no pleasure said ormond but if it became a duty i hope on all occasions i should be able to do whatever i thought a duty therefore to avoid any misunderstanding mr connal let me beg that you will not honour me farther with your confidence i cannot undertake to be the confidant of any one of whom i have never professed myself to be the friend ca suffit said connal lightly we understand one another now perfectlyyou shall in future play the part of prince and not of confidant pardon me i forgot your highnesss pretensions so saying he gaily turned on his heel and left the room from this time forward little conversation passed between mr connal and ormondlittle indeed between ormond and dora with mademoiselle ormond had long ceased to be a favourite and even her loquacity now seldom addressed itself to him he was in a painful situationhe spent as much of his time as he could at the farm his friend had given him as soon as oshane found that there was no truth in the report of black connals intended marriage in england that he claimed in earnest his promise of his daughter and that dora herself inclined to the new love his kind heart felt for poor harry though he did not know all that had passed yet he saw the awkwardness and difficulty of ormonds present situation and whatever it might cost him to part with his young friend with his adopted son corny determined not to detain him longer harry ormond my boy said he to him one day time for you to see something of the world also for the world to see something of you ive kept you here for my own pleasure too long as long as i had any hope of settling you as i wished twas a sufficient excuse to myself but now i have none lefti must part with you and so by the blessing god helping me to conquer my selfishness and the yearnings of my heart towards you i will i mean continued he to send you far from meto banish you for your good from the black islands entirely nay dont you interrupt me nor say a word for if you do i shall be too soft to have the heart to do you justice you know you said yourself and i felt it for you that it was best you should leave this well i have been thinking of you ever since and licking different projects into shape for youlistening too to every thing connal threw out but all he says that way is in the airno substance when you try to have and to holdtoo full of himself that youngster to be a friend to another there is no reason why he should be my friend sir said ormondi do not pretend to be his and i rejoice in not being under any obligations to him rightand highjust as i feel for you after all i approve of your own wish to go into the british service in preference to any foreign service and you could not be of the irish brigadeharry indeed sir i infinitely prefer said ormond the service of my own countrythe service in which my fatheri know nothing of my father but i have always heard him spoken of as a good officer i hope i shall not disgrace his name the english service for me sir if you please why then im glad you see things as i do and are not run away with by uniform and all that i have lodged the needful in the bank to purchase a commission for you my son now no more go to thank me if you love me harry than you would your own father ive written to a friend to choose a regiment in which thered be as little danger as possible for you as little danger as possible repeated harry surprised phoo you dont think i mean as little danger of fighting i would not wrong you so nobut as little danger of gambling not that youre inclined to it or any thing else thats badbut there is no knowing what company might lead the best into and it is my duty and inclination to look as close to all these things as if for my own son my kind fatherno father could be kinder cried harry quite overpowered so then you go as soon as the commission comesthats settled and i hope i shall be able to bear it harry old as i am there may perhaps be a delay of a little time longer than you could wish oh sir as long as you wish me to stay with you not a minute beyond whats necessary i mention the cause of delay that you may not think im dallying for my own sake you remember general albemarle who came here one day last yearelection time canvassingthe general that had lost the arm perfectly sir i remember your answeri will give my interest to this empty sleeve thank younever a word lost upon you well now i have hopes that this manthis general will take you by the hand for he has a hand left yet and a powerful one to serve a friend and ive requested him to keep his eye upon you and i have asked his advice so we cant stir till we get it and that will be eight days or ten say my boy you must bear on as you arewe have the comfort of the workshop to ourselves and some rational recreation good shooting we will have soon too for the first time this season among the various circumstances which endeared harry to our singular monarch his skill and keenness as a sportsman were not inconsiderable he knew where all the game in the island was to be found so that when his good old patron was permitted by the gout to take the field harrys assistance saved him a vast deal of unnecessary toil and gratified him in his favourite amusement whilst he at the same time sympathized in the sport corny besides being a good shot was an excellent mechanic he beguiled the hours when there was neither hunting nor shooting in a workshop which was furnished with the best tools among the other occupations at the workbench he was particularly skilful in making and adjusting the locks of guns and in boring and polishing the inside of their barrels to the utmost perfection he had contrived and executed a tool for the enlarging the barrel of a gun in any particular part so as to increase its effect in adding to the force of the discharge and in preventing the shot from scattering too widely the hope of the success of his contrivance and the prospect of going out with harry on the approaching first of september solaced king corny and seemed to keep up his spirits through all the vexation he felt concerning connal and this marriage which evidently was not to his taste it was to doras however and was becoming more evidently so every hourand soon m connal pressed and mademoiselle urged and dora namedthe happy dayand mademoiselle in transports prepared to go to dublin with her niece to choose the weddingclothes and connal to bespeak the equipages mademoiselle was quick in her operations when dress was in question the preparations for the delightful journey were soon madethe morning for their departure camethe carriage and horses were sent over the water earlyand oshane and harry afterwards accompanied the party in the boat to the other side of the lake where the carriage waited with the door open connal after handing in mademoiselle turned to look for his destined bridewho was taking leave of her fatherharry ormond standing by the moment she quitted her fathers embrace father jos poured with both his hands on her head the benedictions of all the saints released from father jos captain connal hurried her on harry held out his hand to her as she passed good bye doraprobably i shall never see you again oh harry said she one touch of natural feeling stopping her shortoh harrywhy bursting into tears she drew her hand from connal and gave it to harry harry received the hand openly and cordially shook it heartily but took no advantage and no notice of the feelings by which he saw her at that moment agitated forgive she began good bye dear dora god bless youmay you be as happyhalf as happy as i wish you to be to be sure she willhappy as the day is long said mademoiselle leaning out of the carriage why will you make her cry mr ormond spoiling her eyes at parting come in to medora m de connal is waiting to hand you mon enfant is her dressingbox in and all right asked captain connal as he handed dora into the carriage who was still weeping bad compliment to m de connal mon amie vrai scandale said mademoiselle pulling up the glass while dora sunk back in the carriage sobbing without restraint good morning said connal who had now mounted his mr ormond adieu mr ormondcommand me in any way you please drive on chapter xvi the evening after the departure of the happy trio who were gone to dublin to buy weddingdresses the party remaining at castle corny consisted only of king corny ormond and father jos when the candles were lighted his majesty gave a long and loud yawn harry set the backgammon table for him and father jos as usual settled himself in the chimney corner and now mademoiselles gone said he i shall take leave to indulge myself in my pipe you were on the continent this morning father jos said cornelius did ye learn any news for us size ace that secures two points news i did said father jos why not tell it us then i was not asked you both seemed so wrapped up i waited my time and opportunity theres a new parson come to castle hermitage what new person said king corny doublets aces harry a new parson im talking of said father jos that has just got the living there and they say sir ulicks mad about it in dublin where he is still madthree men upand you cant enter harry well what is he mad about because of the presentation to the living replied the priest which government wouldnt make him a compliment of as he expected he is always expecting compliments from government said corny and always getting disappointments such throws as you have harrysixes againwell what luckall over with meit is only a hit at any rate but what kind of man continued he is this new clergyman oh them parsons is all one kind said father jos all one kind no no more than our own priests said corny theres good and bad and all the difference in life i dont know any thing at all about it said father jos sullenly but this i know that no doubt hell soon be over here or his proctor looking for the tithes i hope we will have no quarrels said corny they ought to be abolished said father jos the tithes that is i mean and the quarrels too i hope said ormond oh its not our fault if theres quarrels said father jos faults on both sides generally in all quarrels said corny in lay quarrels like enough said father jos in church quarrels it dont become a good catholic to say that what said corny that said the priest which said corny that which you said that theres faults on both sides sure theres but one side and thats our own side can be in the right there cant be two right sides can there and consequently there wont be two wrong sides will thereergo there cannot by a parity of rasoning be two sides in the wrong well harry ill take the black men now and gammon you said corny play away manwhat are you thinking of is it of what father jos said tis beyond the limits of the human understanding father jos puffed away at his pipe for some time i was tired and ashamed of all the wrangling for twopence with the last man said king corny and i believe i was sometimes too hard and too hot myself but if this mans a gentleman i think we shall agree did you hear his name or any thing at all about him father he is one of them refugee families the huguenots banished france by the adict of nantz they say and his names cambray cambray exclaimed ormond a very good name said oshane but what do you know of it harry only sir i happened to meet with a dr cambray the winter i was in dublin whom i thought a very agreeable respectable amiable manand i wonder whether this is the same person there is something more now harry ormond i know by your face said corny theres some story of or belonging to dr cambraywhat is it no story only a slight circumstancewhich if you please id rather not tell you sir said ormond that is something very extraordinary and looks mysterious said father jos nothing mysterious i assure you said ormonda mere trifle which if it concerned only myself i would tell directly let him alone father said king corny i am sure he has a good reasonand im not curious only let me whisper this in your ear to show you my own penetration harryid lay my life said he stretching over and whispering id lay my life miss annaly has something to do with it miss annalynothing in the worldonlyyes i recollect she was present there nowwould not any body think im a conjuror a physiognomist is cousin to and not twice removed from a conjuror but i assure you though you happened to guess right partly as to her being present you are totally mistaken sir as to the rest my dear harry totally means wholly if im right in a part i cant be mistaken in the whole i am glad to make you smile any wayand i wish i was right altogether and that you was as rich as croesus into the bargain but stay a bit if you come home a hero from the warsthat may doladies are mighty fond of heroes it was in vain that ormond assured his good old imaginative friend that he was upon a wrong scent cornelius stopped to humour him but was convinced that he was right then turned to the still smoking father jos and went on asking questions about dr cambray i know nothing at all about him said father jos but this that father mcormuck has dined with him if im not misinformed oftener than i think becoming in these timesmaking too free and in the chapel last sunday i hear he made a very extraordinary address to his flockthere was one took down the words and handed them to me after remarking on the great distress of the seasonfirst and foremost about the keeping of fast days the yearhe allowed the poor of his flock which is almost all to eat meat whenever offered to them because said he many would starvenow mark the obnoxious wordif it was not for their benevolent protestant neighbours who make soup and broth for them what is there obnoxious in that said cornelius wait till you hear the endand feed and clothe the distressed that is not obnoxious either i hope said ormond laughing young gentleman you belong to the establishment and are no judge in this case permit me to remark said father jos and i could wish mr oshane would hear to the end before he joins in a protestant laugh ive heard of a protestant wind before said harry but not of a protestant laugh well im serious father jos said corny let me hear to the end what makes your face so long and i am sorry to say show more charity to them than their own people the rich catholics sometimes do if that is not downright slander i dont know what is said father jos are you sure it is not truth father said corny and if it was even so much the worse to be telling it in the chapel and to his flockvery improper in a priest very extraordinary conduct father jos worked himself up to a high pitch of indignation and railed and smoked for some time while oshane and ormond joined in defending mcormuck and his address to his flockand even his dining with the new clergyman of the parish father jos gave up and had his punch the result of thewhole was that ormond proposed to pay his respects the next morning to dr cambray very proper said oshane do sofit you shouldyou are of his people and you are acquainted with the gentlemanand id have you go and show yourself safe to him that weve made no tampering with you father jos could not say so much therefore he said nothing oshane continued a very exact churchgoer at the little church there youve always been at the other side of the lakenever hinderedmake what compliment you will proper for mesay im too old and clumsy for morning visitings and never go out of my islands but still i can love my neighbour in or out of them and hope in the name of peace to be on good terms shant be my fault if them tithes come across then i wish that bone of contention was from between the two churches meantime im not snarling if others is not craving and id wish for the look of it for your sake harry that it should be all smooth so say any thing you will for me to this dr cambraythough we are of a different faith i should do any thing in rason rason whats that about rason said father jos i hope faith comes before rason and after it too i hope father said corny father jos finished his punch and went to sleep upon it ormond next morning paid his visitdr cambray was not at home but harry was charmed with the neatness of his house and with the amiable and happy appearance of his family he had never before seen mrs cambray or her daughters though he had met the doctor in dublin the circumstance which harry had declined mentioning when corny questioned him about his acquaintance with dr cambray was very slight though father jos had imagined it to be of mysterious importance it had happened that among the dissipated set of young men with whom marcus oshane and harry had passed that winter in dublin a party had one sunday gone to hear the singing at the asylum and had behaved in a very unbecoming manner during the service dr cambray preachedhe spoke to the young gentlemen afterwards with mild but becoming dignity harry ormond instantly sensible of his error made proper apologies and erred no farther but marcus oshane in particular who was not accustomed to endure anything much less any person that crossed his humour spoke of dr cambray afterwards with vindictive bitterness and with all his talents of mimicry endeavoured to make him ridiculous harry defended him with a warmth of ingenuous eloquence which did him honour and with truth courage and candour that did him still more corrected some of marcuss misstatements declaring that they had all been much to blame lady annaly and her daughter were present and this was one of the circumstances to which her ladyship had alluded when she said that some things had occurred that had prepossessed her with a favourable opinion of ormonds character dr cambray knew nothing of the attack or the defence till some time afterwards and it was now so long ago and harry was so much altered since that time that it was scarcely to be expected the doctor should recollect even his person however when dr cambray came to the black islands to return his visit he did immediately recognize ormond and seemed so much pleased with meeting him again and so much interested about him that cornys warm heart was immediately won independently of this the doctors persuasive benevolent politeness could not have failed to operate as it usually did even on a first acquaintance in pleasing and conciliating even those who were of opposite opinions there now said corny when the doctor was gone there now is a sincere minister of the gospel for you and a polite gentleman into the bargain now thats politeness that does not trouble methats not for showthats for us not himself markand conversation why that man has conversation for the prince and the peasantthe courtier and the anchorite did not he find plenty for me and got more out of me than i thought was in meand the same if id been a monk of la trappe he would have made me talk like a pie now theres a man of the high world that the low world can like very different from poor corny paused checked himself and then resumedprinciples religion and all no hinderanceliberal and sincere too well i only wishfather jos no offencei only wish for dr cambrays sake and the catholic churchs sake i was for one day archbishop of canterbury or primate of all ireland or whatever else makes the bishops in your church and id skip over dean and archdeacon and all and make that manclean a bishop before night harry smiled and wished he had the power as well as the goodwill father jos said a man ought to be ashamed not to think of his own first now harry dont think id make a bishop lightly continued king corny i would notive been a king too long for that and though only a king of my own fashion i know whats fit for governing a country observe mecousin ulick would make a job of a bishop but i would notnor i wouldnt to please my fancy now dont think id make that man a bishop just because he noticed and praised my gimcracks and inventions and substitutes father jos smiled and demurely abased his eye oh then you dont know me as well as you think you do father said oshane nor whats more harry not his noting down the two regiments to make inquiry for friends for you harry shouldnt have bribed me to partialitythough i could have kissed his shoeties for it mercy on you said father jos this doctor has bewitched you but did you mind then persisted corny the way he spoke of that cousin of mine sir ulick who he saw i did not like and who has been as you tell us bitter against him and even against his getting the living well the way this doctor cambray spoke then pleased megood morals without preachingtheres do good to your enemiesthe true christian doctrineand the hardest point oh let father jos say what he will theres the man will be in heaven before manyheretic or no heretic harry father jos shrugged up his shoulders and then fixing the glass in his spectacles replied we shall see better when we come to the tithes thats true said corny he walked off to his workshop and took down his fowlingpiece to put the finishing stroke to his work for the next day which was to be the first day of partridgeshooting he looked forward with delightanticipating the gratification he should have in going out shooting with harry and trying his new fowlingpiece but i wont go out tomorrow till the post has come in for my mind couldnt enjoy the sport till i was satisfied whether the answer could come about your commission harry my mind misgives methat is my calculation tells me that it will come tomorrow good cornys calculations were just the next morning the little postboy brought answers to various letters which he had written about ormondone to ormond from sir ulick oshane repeating his approbation of his wards going into the army approving of all the steps cornelius had takenespecially of his intention of paying for the commission alls well cornelius said the next letter was from corneliuss banker saying that the five hundred pound was lodged ready all well the armyagent wrote that he had commissions in two different regiments waiting mr oshanes choice and orders per return of post to purchase in conformitythats all well general albemarles answer to mr oshanes letter was most satisfactory in terms that were not merely officially polite but kind he assured mr oshane that he should as far as it was in his power pay attention to the young gentleman whom mr oshane had so strongly recommended to his care and by whose appearance and manner the general said he had been prepossessed when he saw him some months ago at corny castle there was a commission vacant in his sons regiment which he recommended to mr ormond the very thing i could have wished for you my dear boyyou shall go off the day after tomorrownot a moments delayill answer the letters this minute but harry reminded him that the post did not go out till the next day and urged him not to lose this fine daythis first day of the season for partridge shooting time enough for my business after we come homethe post does not go out till morning thats true come off thenlets enjoy the fine day sent us and my gun tooi forgot for i do believe harry i love you better even than my gun said the warmhearted corny call ormond moriarty let us have him with ushell enjoy it beyond all one of the last days shooting with his own prince harrybut poor fellow well not tell him that moriarty and the dogs were summoned and the fineness of the day and the promise of good sport put moriarty in remarkably good spirits by degrees king cornys own spirits rose and he forgot that it was the last day with prince harry and he enjoyed the sport after various trials of his new fowlingpiece both the king and the prince agreed that it succeeded to admiration but even in the midst of his pride in his success and his joy in the sport his superior fondness for harry prevailed and showed itself in little almost delicate instances of kindness which could hardly have been expected from his unpolished mind as they crossed a bog he stooped every now and then and plucked different kinds of bogplants and heaths here harry said he mind these for dr cambray remember yesterday his mentioning that a daughter of his was making a botanical collection and theres sheelah can tell you all the irish names and uses some i can note for you myself and here this minuteby great luck the very thing he wantedthe andromeda ill swear to it throw away all and keep thiscarry it to her tomorrowfor i will have you make a friend of that dr cambray and no way so sure or fair to the fathers heart as by proper attention to the daughteri know that by myself hush now till i have that partridgewhirrshot him clean my dear gunwas not that good harry thus they continued their sport till late and returning loaded with game had nearly reached the palace when corny who had marked a covey quitted harry and sent his dog to spring it at a distance much greater than the usual reach of a common fowlingpiece harry heard a shot and a moment afterwards a violent shout of despairhe knew the voice to be that of moriarty and running to the spot from whence it came he found his friend his benefactor weltering in his blood the fowlingpiece overloaded had burst and a large splinter of the barrel had fractured the skull and had sunk into the brain as moriarty was trying to raise his head oshane uttered some words of which all that was intelligible was the name of harry ormond his eye was fixed on harry but the meaning of the eye was gone he squeezed harrys hand and an instant afterwards oshanes hand was powerless the dearest the only real friend harry ormond had upon earth was gone for ever chapter xvii a boy passing by saw what had happened and ran to the house calling as he went to some workmen who hastened to the place where they heard the howling of the dogs ormond neither heard nor sawtill moriarty said he must be carried home and some one approaching to lift the body ormond started up pushed the man back without uttering a syllablemade a sign to moriarty and between them they carried the body home sheelah and the women came out to meet them wringing their hands and uttering loud lamentations ormond bearing his burden as if insensible of what he bore walked onward looking at no one answering none but forcing his way straight into the house and ontill they came to oshanes bedchamber which was upon the groundfloorthere laid him on his bed the women had followed and all those who had gathered on the way rushed in to see and to bewail ormond looked up and saw the people about the bed and made a sign to moriarty to keep them away which he did as well as he could but they would not be kept backsheelah especially pressed forward crying loudly till moriarty with whom she was struggling pointed to harry struck with his fixed look she submitted at once best leave him said she she put every body out of the room before her and turning to ormond said they would leave him a little space of time till the priest should come who was at a clergy dinner but was sent for when ormond was left alone he locked the door and kneeling beside the dead offered up prayers for the friend he had lost and there remained some time in stillness and silence till sheelah knocked at the door to let him know that the priest was come then retiring he went to the other end of the house to be out of the way the room to which he went was that in which they had been reading the letters just before they went out that morning there was the pen which harry had taken from his hand and the answer just begun dear general i hope my young friend harry ormond that hand could write no morethat warm heart was cold the certainty was so astonishing so stupifying that ormond having never yet shed a tear stood with his eyes fixed on the paper he knew not how long till he felt some one touch his hand it was the child little tommy of whom oshane was so fond and who was so fond of him the child with his whistle in his hand stood looking up at harry without speaking ormond gazed on him for a few instants then snatched him in his arms and burst into an agony of tears sheelah who had let the child in now came and carried him away god be thanked for them tears said she they will bring relief and so they did the necessity for manly exertionthe sense of dutypressed upon ormonds recovered reason he began directly and wrote all the letters that were necessary to his guardian and to miss ofaley to communicate the dreadful intelligence to dora the letters were not finished till late in the evening sheelah came for them and leaving the door and the outer door to the hall open as she came in ormond saw the candles lighted and smelt the smell of tobacco and whiskey and heard the sound of many voices the wake dear which is beginning said she hastening back to shut the doors as she saw him shudder bear with it master harry said she hard for youbut bear with us dear tis the custom of the country and what else can we do but what the forefathers didhow else for us to show respect only as it would be expected and has always beenand great comfort to think we done our best for him that is gone and comfort to know his wake will be talked of long hereafter over the fires at night of all the people that is there withoutand thats all we have for it now so bear with it dear this night and for two succeeding nights the doors of corny castle remained open for all who chose to come crowds as many and more than the castle could hold flocked to king cornys wake for he was greatly beloved there was as sheelah said plenty of cake and wine and tea and tobacco and snuffevery thing handsome as possible and honourable to the deceased who was always openhanded and openhearted and with open house too his praises from time to time were heard and then the common business of the country was talked ofand jesting and laughter went onand all night there were teadrinkings for the women and punch for the men sheelah who inwardly grieved most went about incessantly among the crowd serving all seeing that none especially them who came from a distance should be neglectedand that none should have to complain afterwards or to say that any thing at all was wanting or niggardly mrs betty sheelahs daughter sat presiding at the teatable giving the keys to her mother when wanted but never forgetting to ask for them again little tommy took his cake and hid himself under the table close by his mother mrs betty and could not be tempted out but by sheelah whom he followed watching for her to go in to mr harry when the door opened he held by her gown and squeezed in under her armand when she brought mr harry his meals she would set the child up at the table with him for companyand to tempt him to take something ormond had once promised his deceased friend that if he was in the country when he died he would put him into his coffin he kept his promise the child hearing a noise and knowing that mr harry had gone into the room could not be kept out the crowd had left that room and the child looked at the bed with the curtains looped up with blackand at the table at the foot of the bed with the white cloth spread over it and the seven candlesticks placed upon it but the coffin fixed his attention and he threw himself upon it clinging to it and crying bitterly upon king corny his dear king corny to come back to him it was all sheelah could do to drag him away ormond who had always liked this boy felt now more fond of him than ever and resolved that he should never want a friend you are in the mind to attend the funeral sir i think you told me said sheelah certainly replied ormond excuse me then said sheelah if i mentionfor you cant know what to do without there will be high mass may be you know in the chapel and as its a great funeral thirteen priests will be there attending and when the mass will be finished it will be expected of you as first of kin considered to walk up first with your offeringwhatsoever you think fit for the priestsand to lay it down on the altar and then each and all will follow laying down their offerings according as they can i hope im not too bold or troublesome sir ormond thanked her for her kindnessand felt it was real kindness he consequently did all that was expected from him handsomely after the masses were over the priests who could not eat any thing before they said mass had breakfast and dinner joined sheelah took care the clergy was well served then the prieststhough it was not essential that all should go did all to sheelahs satisfaction accompany the funeral the whole way three long miles to the buryingplace of the oshanes a remote old abbeyground marked only by some scattered trees and a few sloping gravestones king cornys funeral was followed by an immense concourse of people on horseback and on foot men women and children when they passed by the doors of cabins a set of the women raised the funeral crynot a savage howl as is the custom in some parts of ireland but chanting a melancholy kind of lament not without harmony simple and pathetic ormond was convinced that in spite of all the festivity at the wake which had so disgusted him the poor people mourned sincerely for the friend they had lost we forgot to mention that dr cambray went to the black islands the day after oshanes death and did all he could to prevail upon ormond to go to his house while the wake was going on and till the funeral should be over but ormond thought it right to stay where he was as none of the family were there and there was no way in which he could so strongly mark as sheelah said his respect for the dead now that it was all over he had at least the consolation of thinking that he had not shrunk from any thing that was or that he conceived to be his duty dr cambray was pleased with his conduct and at every moment he could spare went to see him doing all he could to console him by strengthening in ormonds mind the feelings of religious submission to the will of heaven and of pious hope and confidence ormond had no time left him for the indulgence of sorrowbusiness pressed upon him cornelius oshanes will which sir ulick blamed harry for not mentioning in the first letter was found to be at his bankers in dublin all his property was left to his daughter except the farm which he had given to ormond this was specially excepted with legal care also a legacy of five hundred pounds was left to harry a trifling bequest to sir ulick being his cousin and legacies to servants miss ofaley was appointed sole executrixthis gave great umbrage to sir ulick oshane and appeared extraordinary to many people but the will was in due form and nothing could be done against it however much might be said miss ofaley without taking notice of any thing ormond said of the money which had been lodged in the bank to pay for his commission wrote as executrix to beg of him to do various business for herall which he did and fresh letters came with new requests inventories to be taken things to be sent to dublin money to be received and paid stewards and agents accounts to be settled business of all kinds in short came pouring inupon him a young man unused to it and with a mind peculiarly averse from it at this moment but when he found that he could be of service to any one belonging to his benefactor he felt bound in gratitude to exert himself to the utmost these circumstances however disagreeable had an excellent effect upon his character giving him habits of business which were ever afterwards of use to him it was remarkable that the only point in his letters which had concerned his own affairs still continued unanswered another circumstance hurt his feelingsinstead of miss ofaleys writing to make her own requests mr connal was soon deputed by mademoiselle to write for her he spoke of the shock the ladies had felt and the distressing circumstances in which they were all in commonplace phrases which ormond despised and from which he could judge nothing of doras real feelings the marriage must of course mr connal said be put off for some time and as it would be painful to the ladies to return to corny castle he had advised their staying in dublin and they and he feeling assured that from mr ormonds regard for the family they might take the liberty of troubling him they requested so and so and the executrix begged he would see this settled and that settledat last with gradually forgotten apologies falling very much into the style of a person writing to an humble friend or dependent bound to consider requests as commands our young heros pride was piqued on the one side as much as his gratitude was alive on the other sir ulick oshane wrote to harry that he was at this time peculiarly engaged with affairs of his own he said that as to the material point of the money lodged for the commission he would see the executrix and do what he could to have that settled but as to all lesser points sir ulick said he really had not leisure to answer letters at present he enclosed a note to dr cambray whom he recommended it to his ward to consult and whose advice and assistance he now requested for him in pressing terms in consequence of this direct application from the young gentlemans guardian dr cambray felt himself authorized and called upon to interfere where otherwise delicacy might have prevented him it was fortunate for ormond that he had dr cambrays counsel to guide him or else he would in the first moments of feeling have yielded too much to the suggestions of both gratitude and pride in the first impulse of generous pride ormond wanted to give up the farm which his benefactor had left him because he wished that no possible suspicion of interested motives having influenced his attachment to cornelius oshane should exist especially with mr connal who as the husband of dora would soon be the lord of all in the black islands on the other hand when mr connal wrote to him that the executrix having no written order from the deceased to that effect could not pay the five hundred pounds lodged in the bank for his commission ormond was on the point of flying out with intemperate indignation was not his own word sufficient was not the intention of his benefactor apparent from the letters would not this justify any executor any person of common sense or honour dr cambray his experienced and placid counsellor brought all these sentiments to due measure by mildly showing what was law and justice and what was fit and proper in each case putting jealous honour and romantic generosity as they must be put out of the question in business he prevented ormond from embroiling himself with connal about the legacy and from giving up his farm he persuaded him to decline having any thing to do with the affairs of the black islands a proper agent was appointed who saw ormonds accounts settled and signed so that no blame or suspicion could rest upon him there seems no probability mr ormond said dr cambray of your commission being immediately purchased your guardian sir ulick oshane will be detained some time longer i understand in dublin you are in a desolate situation hereyou have now done all that you ought to doleave these black islands and come to vicars dale you will find there a cheerful family and means of spending your time more agreeably perhaps more profitably than you can have here i am sensible that no new friends can supply to you the place of him you have lost but you will find pleasure in the perception that you have by your own merit attached to you one friend in me who will do all in his power to soothe and serve youwill you trust yourself to me added he smiling you have already found that i do not flatter will you come to usthe sooner the bettertomorrow if you can it scarcely need be said that this invitation was most cordially accepted next day ormond was to leave the black islands sheelah was in despair when she found he was going the child hung upon him so that he could hardly get out of the house till moriarty promised to return for the boy and carry him over in the boat often to see mr ormond moriarty would not stay in the islands himself he said after harry went he let the cabin and little tenement which oshane had given him and the rent was to be paid him by the agent ormond went for the last time that morning to ormonds vale to settle his own affairs there he and moriarty took an unusual path across this part of the island to the waterside that they might avoid that which they had followed the last time they were out on the day of cornys death they went therefore across a lone tract of heathbog where for a considerable time they saw no living being on this bog of which cornelius oshane had given moriarty a share the grateful poor fellow had the year before amused himself with cutting in large letters of about a yard long the words long live king corny he had sowed the letters with broomseed in the spring and had since forgotten ever to look at them but they were now green and struck the eye think then of this being all the trace thats left of him on the face of the earth said moriarty im glad that i did even that same after crossing this lone bog when they came to the waterside they found a great crowd of people seemingly all the inhabitants of the islands assembled there waiting to take leave of master harry and each of them was cheered by a kind word and a look before they would let him step into the boat ay go to the continent said sheelah ay go to fifty continents and in all ireland youll not find hearts warmer to you than those of the black islands that knows you best from a child master harry dear chapter xviii ormond was received with much kindness in dr cambrays family in which he felt himself at ease and soon forgot that he was a stranger his mind however was anxious about his situation as he longed to get into active life every morning when the post came in he hoped there would be a letter for him with his commission and he was every morning regularly surprised and disappointed on finding that there was none in the course of each ensuing day however he forgot his disappointment and said he believed he was happier where he was than he could be any where else the regular morning question of any letters for me was at last answered by yes one franked by sir ulick oshane ah no commissioni feel no enclosuresingle letterno double double or single it was as follows dear harry at last i have seen the executrix and soninlaw whom that great genius deceased my wellbeloved cousin in folly king corny chose for himself as to that thing half mud half tinsel half irish half french miss or mademoiselle ofaley that jointed doll isall but the eyes which move of themselves in a very extraordinary waya mere puppet pulled by wires in the hands of another the master showman fully as extraordinary in his own way as his puppet kept while i was by as much as possible behind the scenes the hand and ruffle of the french petitmaitre and the prompters voice however were visible and audible enough for me in plain english i suppose it is no news to you to hear that mdlle ofaley is a fool and monsieur de connal captain oconnal black connal or by whatever other alias he is to be called is properly a puppy i am sorry my dear boy to tell you that the fool has let the rogue get hold of the five hundred pounds lodged in the bankso no hopes of your commission for three months or at the least two months to come my dear boy your muchlamented friend and benefactor is not that the style king corny who began i think by being years ago to your admiration his own tailor has ended i fear to your loss by being his own lawyer he has drawn his will so that any attorney could drive a coach and six through itso ends every man his own lawyer forgive me this laugh harry bythebye you my dear ward will be of age in december i thinkthen all my legal power of interference ceases meantime as i know you will be out of spirits when you read this i have some comfort for you and myself which i kept for a bonneboucheyou will never more see lady oshane nor i either articles of separationand i didnt trust myself to be my own lawyerhave been signed between us so i shall see her ladyship sail for england this nightwont let any one have the pleasure of putting her on board but myselfi will see her safe off and feel well assured nothing can tempt her to returneven to haunt meor scold you this was the business which detained me in dublinwell worth while to give up a summer to secure for the rest of ones days liberty to lead a bachelors merry life which i mean to do at castle hermitage or elsewhere now and from henceforthmiss black in no ways notwithstanding miss black it is but justice to tell you is now convinced of my conjugal virtues and admires my patience as much as she used to admire lady oshanes she has been very useful to me in arranging my affairs in this separationin consequence i have procured a commission of the peace for a certain mr mcrule a man whom you may remember to have seen or heard at the bottom or corner of the table at castle hermitage one of the cromwellians a fellow with the true drawdown of the mouth and who speaks or snorts through his nose i have caused him not without some difficulty to ask miss black to be his helpmate lord help him and forgive me and miss black preferring rather to stay in ireland and become mrs mcrule than to return to england and continue companion to lady oshane hath consented who can blame her to marry on the spur of the occasiontomorrowi giving her awayyou may imagine with what satisfaction what with marriages and separations the business of the nation my bank my canal and my coalmines you may guess my hands have been full of business now all for pleasure next week i hope to be down enjoying my liberty at castle hermitage where i shall be heartily glad to have my dear harry again marcus in england stillthe poor annalys in great distress about the son with whom i fear it is all over no time for more measure my affection by the length of this the longest epistle extant in my handwriting my dear boy yours ever ulick oshane the mixed and crossing emotions which this letter was calculated to excite having crossed and mixed and subsided a little the predominating feeling was expressed by our young hero with a sigh and this reflection two months at the least i must wait before i can have my commissiontwo months more in idleness the fates have decreed that last is a part of the decree that depends on yourself not on the fates two months you must wait but why in idleness said dr cambray the kind and prudent doctor did not press the questionhe was content with its being heard knowing that it would sink into the mind and produce its effect in due season accordingly after some time after ormond had exhaled impatience and exhausted invective and submitted to necessity he returned to reason with the doctor one evening when the doctor and his family had returned from walking and as the teaurn was just coming in bubbling and steaming ormond set to work at a corner of the table at the doctors elbow my dear doctor suppose i was now to read over to you my list of books suppose you were and suppose i was to fall asleep said the doctor not the least likely sir when you are to do any thing kind for a friendmay i say friend you may come read oni am not proof against flattery even at my agewell read away ormond began but at that moment there drove past the windows a travelling chariot and four sir ulick oshane as i live cried ormond starting up i saw himhe nodded to me oh no impossiblehe said he would not come till next weekwheres his letterwhats the datecould it mean this weekno he says next week quite plainlywhat can be the reason a note for mr ormond was brought in which had been left by one of sir ulick oshanes servants as they went by my commission after all cried harry i always knew i always said that sir ulick was a good friend has he purchased the commission said dr cambray he does not actually say so but that must be what his note means said ormond means but what does it saymay i see it it is written in such a hurry and in pencil youll not be able to make it out the doctor however read aloud if mr harry ormond will inquire at castle hermitage he will hear of something to his advantage u oshane go off this minute said mrs cambray and inquire at castle hermitage what mr harry ormond may hear to his advantage and let us learn it as soon as possible thank you maam said harry and ere the words were well uttered a hundred steps were lost with more than his usual cordiality sir ulick oshane received him came out into the hall to meet his dear harry his own dear boy to welcome him again to castle hermitage we did not expect you sir till next weekthis is a most agreeable surprise did you not say no matter what i saidyou see what i have done interrupted sir ulick and now i must introduce you to a niece of mine whom you have never yet seenlady norton a charming wellbred pleasant little widow whose husband died luckily for her and me just when they had run out all their large fortune she is delighted to come to me and is just the thing to do the honours of castle hermitageused to the style but observe though she is to rule my roast and my boiled she is not to rule me or my friendsthat is a preliminary and a special clause for harry ormonds being a privileged ami de la maison now my dear fellow you understand how the land lies and depend upon it youll like her and find her every way of great advantage to you so thought harry is this all the advantage i am to hear of sir ulick led on to the drawingroom and presented him to a fashionablelooking lady neither young nor old nothing in any respect remarkable lady norton harry ormondharry ormond my niece lady norton who will make this house as pleasant to you and to me and to all my friends as it has been unpleasant ever sincein short ever since you were out of it harry lady norton with gracious smile and wellbred courtesy received harry in a manner that promised the performance of all for which sir ulick had engaged tea came and the conversation went on chiefly between sir ulick and lady norton on their own affairs about invitations and engagements they had made before they left dublin with various persons who were coming down to castle hermitage sir ulick asked when are the brudenells to come to us my deardid you settle with the lascellesand lady louisa she must be here with the viceregal partyarrange that my dear lady norton had settled every thing she took out an elegant memorandumbook and read the arrangements to sir ulick between whiles sir ulick turned to ormond and noted the claims of those persons to distinction and as several ladies were named exclaimed charming womandelightful little creaturethe darrells harry youll like the darrells toothe lardners all clever pleasant and odd will entertain you amazingly harrybut lady millicent is the womannothing at all has been seen in this country like hermost fascinating harry take care of your heart then as to the menthis man was cleverand the other was quite a heroand the next the pleasantest fellowand the best sportsmanand there were men of political eminencemen who had distinguished themselves on different occasions by celebrated speechesand particularly promising rising young men with whom he must make ormond intimately acquainted now sir ulick closed lady nortons book and taking it from her hand said i am tiring you my dearthats enough for tonightwell settle all the rest tomorrow you must be tired after your journeyi whirled you down without mercyyou look fatigued and sleepy lady norton said indeed she believed she was a little tired and rather sleepy her uncle begged she would not sit up longer from compliment accordingly apologizing to mr ormond and really much fatigued she retired sir ulick walked up and down the room meditating for some moments while harry renewed his intimacy with an old dog who at every pause in the conversation jumping up on him and squealing with delight had claimed his notice well my boy exclaimed sir ulick stopping short arent you a most extraordinary fellow pray did you get my note certainly sir and came instantly in consequence and yet you have never inquired what it is that you might hear to your advantage ii thought i had heard it sir heard it sir repeated sir ulick what can you mean simply sir that i thought the advantage you alluded to was the introduction you did me just now the favour to give me to lady norton you said her being here would be a great advantage to me and that led me to conclude well well you were always a simple good fellowconfiding in my friendshipcontinue the sameyou will i am confident but had you no other thought i had said harry when first i read your note i had i own another thought and what might it be i thought of my commission sir what of your commission that you had procured it for me sir since you ask me i tell you honestly that if it had been for your interest i would have purchased that commission long ago but there is a little secret a political secret which i could not tell you beforethose who are behind the scenes cannot always speaki may tell it to you now confidentially but you must not repeat it especially from methat peace is likely to continue so the army is out of the question well sir if that be the caseyou know best i doit is trust me and as things have turned outthough i could not possibly foresee what has happenedevery thing is for the best i have come express from town to tell you news that will surprise you beyond measure what can you mean sir simply sir that you are possessed or soon will be possessed ofbut come sit down quietly and in good earnest let me explain to you you know your fathers second wife the indian woman the governors mahoganycoloured daughtershe had a prodigious fortune which my poor friend your father chose when dying to settle upon her and her indian son leaving you nothing but what he could not take from you the little paternal estate of three hundred pounds a year well it has pleased heaven to take your mahoganycoloured stepmother and your indian brother out of this world both carried off within a few days of each other by a fever of the countrymuch regretted i dare say in the bombay gazette by all who knew them but as neither you nor i had that honour we are not upon this occasion called upon for any hypocrisy farther than a black coat which i have ordered for you at my tailors have also noted and answered in conformity the agents letter of th july received yesterday containing the melancholy intelligence farther replied to that part of his last which requested to know how and where to transmit the property which on the indian mother and brothers demise falls by the will of the late captain ormond to his european son harry ormond esq now under the guardianship of sir ulick oshane castle hermitage ireland as he spoke sir ulick produced the agents letter and put it into his wards hand pointing to the useful passages harry glancing his eye over them understood just enough to be convinced that sir ulick was in earnest and that he was really heir to a very considerable property well harry ormond esq pursued sir ulick was i wrong when i told you that if you would inquire at castle hermitage you would hear of something to your advantage i hope in heaven said ormond and pray to heaven that it may be to my advantagei hope neither my head nor my heart may be turned by sudden prosperity your heartoh ill answer for your heart my noble fellow said sir ulick but i own you surprise me by the coolness of head you show if youll excuse me said ormond i must run this minute to tell dr cambray and all my friends at vicars dale certainlyquite right said sir ulicki wont detain you a moment said hebut he still held him fast i let you go tonight but you must come to me tomorrow oh sir certainly and you will bid

such a stateand the horses happen not to be uppermost i protest harry you perfectly astonish me by the sedateness of your mind and manner you are certainly wonderfully formed and improved since i saw you lastbut how in the name of wonder in the black islands how i cannot conceive said sir ulick as to sedateness you know sir since i saw you last i may well be sobered a little for i have sufferednot

friend poor cornyay my poor cousin as far as he could i am sure he wished to be a friend to you he wished to be and was said ormond it would have been better for him and his daughter too resumed sir ulick if he had chosen you for his soninlaw instead of the coxcomb to whom dora is going to be married yet i own as your guardian i am well pleased that dora though a very pretty girl is out of your wayyou must look highershe was no match for you i am perfectly sensible sir that we should never have been happy together you are a very sensible young man ormondyou make me admire you seriouslyi

unconscionable dog polygamy is not permitted in these countriesboth no try again for a better answer though that was no bad one at the first blush i have no other answer to give than the plain truth sir i am thinking neither of polygamy nor even of marriage at present these young ladies are both very amiable very handsome and very agreeable but in short we are not thinking of one anotherindeed i believe they are engaged engagedoh then you have thought about these young ladies enough to find that out well this saves your gallantrygood night sir ulick had this evening taken a vast deal of superfluous pains to sound a mind which lay open before him clear to the very bottom but because it was so clear he could not believe that he saw the bottom he did not much like dr cambrayfather jos was right there dr cambray was one of those simple characters which puzzled sir ulickthe idea of these miss cambrays of the possibility of his wards having formed an attachment that might interfere with his views disturbed sir ulicks rest this night his first operation in the morning was to walk down unexpectedly early to vicars dale he found ormond with dr cambray very busy examining a plan which the doctor had sketched for a new cottage for moriartya mason was standing by talking of sand lime and stones but the young ladies where are they sir ulick asked ormond did not know mrs cambray who was quietly reading said she supposed they were in their gardens and not in the least suspecting sir ulicks suspicions she was glad to see him and gave credit to his neighbourly goodwill for the earliness of this visit without waiting even for the doctor to pay his respects first as he intended to do at castle hermitage oh as to that sir ulick said he did not intend to live on terms of ceremony with dr cambrayhe was impatient to take the first opportunity of thanking the doctor for his attentions to his ward sir ulicks quick eye saw on the table in harrys handwriting the list of books to be read he took it up looked it over and with a smile asked any thoughts of the church harry no sir it would be rather late for me to think of the church i should never prepare myself properly besides said sir ulick i have no living in my gift but if continued he in a tone of irony if as i should opine from the list i hold in my handyou look to a college living my boyif you are bent upon reading for a fellowshipi dont doubt but with dr cambrays assistance and with some grinder and crammer we might get you cleverly through all the college examinations and doctor if he did not in going through some of the college courses die of a logical indigestion or a classical fever or a metaphysical lethargy he might shine in the dignity of trin coll dub and mad mathesis inspiring might teach eternally how the line ab is equal to the line cdor why poor x y z are unknown quantities ah my dear boy think of the pleasure the glory of lecturing classes of ignoramuses and dunces yet unborn harry no way disconcerted laughed goodhumouredly with his guardian and replied at present sir my ambition reaches no farther than to escape myself from the class of dunces and ignoramuses i am conscious that at present i am very deficient in what my dear boyto make your complaint english you must say deficient in some thing or othertis an iricism to say in general that you are very deficient there is one of my particular deficiencies then you see siri am deficient in english you are not deficient in temper i am sure said sir ulick come come you may be tolerably well contented with yourself ignorant as i amno said ormond i will never sit down content in ignorance now that i have the fortune of a gentleman it would be so much the more conspicuous more scandalousnow that i have every way the means i will by the blessing of heaven and with the help of kind friends make myself something more and something better than i am gad you are a fine fellow harry ormond cried sir ulick i remember having once at your age such feelings and notions myself very unlike the first thoughts and feelings many young men would have on coming into unexpected possession of a fortune said dr cambray true said sir ulick and we must keep his counsel that he may not be dubbed a quiznot a word of this sort harry for the darrells the lardners or the dartfords i dont care whether they dub me a quiz or not said harry hastily what are darrells lardners or dartfords to me they are something to me said sir ulick oh i beg pardon siri didnt know thatthat makes it quite another affair and harry as you are to meet these young men i thought it well to try how you could bear to be laughed ati have tried you in this very conversation and found you to my infinite satisfaction ridicule proofbetter than even bullet proofmuch better no danger that a young man of spirit should be bullied out of his opinion and principles but great danger that he might be laughed out of themand i rejoice my dear ward to see that you are safe from this peril benevolent pleasure shone in dr cambrays countenance when he heard sir ulick speak in this manner you will dine with us dr cambray said sir ulick harry you will not forget castle hermitage forget castle hermitage as if i could where i spent my happy childhoodthat paradise as it seemed to me the first timewhen a poor little orphan boy i was brought from my smoky cabin i remember the day as well as if it were this momentwhen you took me by the hand and led me in and i clung to you cling to me still cling to me ever interrupted sir ulick and i will never fail youno never repeated he grasping harrys hand and looking upon him with an emotion of affection strongly felt and therefore strongly expressed to be sure i will said harry and i hope added sir ulick recovering the gaiety of his tone that at castle hermitage a paradise will open for your youth as it opened for your childhood mrs cambray put in a word of hope and fear about vicars dale to which ormond answered never fear mrs cambraytrust mei know my own interest too well sir ulick turning again as he was leaving the room said with an air of frank liberality well settle that at oncewell divide harry between usor well divide his day thus the mornings i leave you to your friends and studies for an hour or two harry in this vale of edenthe rest of the day we must have youmen and books best mixedsee bacon and see every clever man that ever wrote or spoke so here added sir ulick pointing to a map of history which lay on the table you will have the stream of time and with us le courant du jour sir ulick departed during the whole of this conversation and of that of the preceding night while he seemed to be talking at random of different things unconnected and of opposite sorts he had carefully attended to one object going round the whole circle of human motiveslove ambition interest ease pleasure he had made accurate observation on his wards mind and reversing the order he went round another way and repeated and corrected his observations the points he had strongly noted for practical use were that for retaining influence over his ward he must depend not upon interested motives of any kind nor upon the force of authority or precedent nor yet on the power of ridicule but principally upon feelings of honour gratitude and generosity harry now no longer crossed any of his projects but was become himself the means of carrying many into execution the plan of a match for marcus with miss annaly was entirely at an end that young lady had given a decided refusal and some circumstances which we cannot here stop to explain rendered marcus and his father easy under that disappointment no jealousy or competition existing therefore any longer between his son and ward sir ulicks affection for ormond returned in full tide nor did he reproach himself for having banished harry from castle hermitage or for having formerly neglected and almost forgotten him for two or three years sir ulick took the matter up just as easily as he had laid it downhe now looked on harry not as the youth whom he had deserted but as the orphan boy whom he had cherished in adversity and whom he had a consequent right to produce and patronize in prosperity beyond or beneath all this there was another reason why sir ulick took so much pains and felt so much anxiety to establish his influence over his ward this reason cannot yet be mentionedhe had hardly revealed it to himselfit was deep down in his soulto be or not to beas circumstances time and the hour should decide chapter xix after having lived so long in retirement our young hero when he was to go into company again had many fears that his manners would appear rustic and unfashioned with all these apprehensions as to his manners there was mixed a large proportion of pride of character which tended rather to increase than to diminish his apparent timidity he dreaded that people would value him or think that he valued himself for his newly acquired fortune instead of his good qualities he feared that he should be flattered and he feared that he should like flattery in the midst of all these various and contradictory apprehensions he would perhaps have been awkward and miserable had he been introduced into society by one who had less knowledge of the world or less knowledge of the human heart than sir ulick oshane possessed sir ulick treated him as if he had always lived in good company without presupposing any ignorance he at the same time took care to warn him of any etiquette or modern fashion so that no one should perceive the warning but themselves he neither offended ormonds pride by seeming to patronize or produce him nor did he let his timidity suffer from uncertainty or neglect ormonds fortune was never adverted to in any way that could hurt his desire to be valued for his own sake but he was made to feel that it was a part and a very agreeable part of his personal merit managed in this kind and skilful manner he became perfectly at ease and happy his spirits rose and he enjoyed every thing with the warmth of youth and with the enthusiasm of his natural character the first evening that the earthly paradise of castle hermitage reopened upon his view he was presented to all the welldressed wellbred belles black brown and fair for the first hour appeared to him all beautiful his guardian standing apart and seeming to listen to a castle secretary who was whispering to him of state affairs observed all that was passing contrary to his guardians expectations however ormond was the next morning faithful to his resolution and did not appear among the angels at the breakfasttable at castle hermitage it wont last a good week said sir ulick to himself but that good week and the next it lasted harrys studies to be sure were sometimes interrupted by floating visions of the miss darrells dartfords and lardners he every now and then sung bits of their songs repeated their bonmots and from time to time laying down his book started up and practised quadrille steps to refresh himself and increase his attention his representations of all he saw and heard at castle hermitage and his frank and natural description of the impression that every thing and every body made upon him were amusing and interesting to his friends at vicars dale it was not by satire that he amused them but by simplicity mixed with humour and good sensegood sense sometimes half opening his eyes and humour describing what he saw with those eyes half open half shut pray what sort of people are the darrells and dartfords said mrs cambray oh delightfulthe girls especiallysing like angels well the ladies i know are all angels with you at presentthat you have told us several times its really true i believeat least as far as i can see but you know i have not had time to see farther than the outside yet the gentlemen howeveri suppose you have seen the inside of some of them certainlythose who have any thing inside of themdartford for instance well mr dartford he is the man sir ulick said was so clever very cleverhe isi suppose though i dont really recollect any thing remarkable that i have heard him say but the wit must be in himand he lets out a good deal of his opinionsof his opinion of himself a little too much but he is much admired and mr darrellwhat of him very fashionable but indeed all i know about him is that his dress is quite the thing and that he knows more about dishes and cooks than i could have conceived any man upon earth of his age could knowbut they say its the fashionhe is very fashionable i hear but is he conceited why i do not knowhis manner might appear a little conceitedbut in reality he must be wonderfully humblefor he certainly values his horses far above himselfand then he is quite content if his boottops are admired bythebye there is a famous invaluable receipt he has for polishing those boottops which is to make quite another man of meif i dont forget to put him in mind about it and mr lardner oh a pleasant young manhas so many good songs and good stories and is so goodnatured in repeating them but i hope people wont make him repeat them too often for i can conceive one might be tired in time during the course of the first three weeks harry was three times in imminent danger of falling in lovefirst with the beautiful and beautifully dressed miss darrell who danced sung played rode did every thing charmingly and was universally admired she was remarkably goodhumoured even when some of her companions were rather cross miss darrell reigned queen of the day and queen of the ball for three days and three nights unrivalled in our young heros eyes but on the fourth night ormond chancing to praise the fine shape of one of her very dear friends miss darrell whispered she owes that fine shape to a finely padded corset oh i am clear of what i tell youshe is my intimate friend from that moment ormond was cured of all desire to be the intimate friend of this fair lady the second peerless damsel whose praises he sounded to dr cambray between the fits of reading middletons cicero was miss eliza darrell the youngest of the three sisters she was not yet come out though in the mean time allowed to appear at castle hermitage and she was so nave and so timid and so very bashful that sir ulick was forced always to bring her into the room leaning on his armshe could really hardly walk into a roomand if any body looked at her she was so much distressedand there were such pretty confusions and retreatings and such a manoeuvring to get to the sidetable every day and sir ulick so terribly determined it should not be it was all naturally acted and by a young pretty actress ormond used only to the gross affectation of dora did not suspect that there was any affectation in the case he pitied her so much that sir ulick was certain love was in the next degree of this the young lady herself was still more secure and in her security she forgot some of her graceful timidity it happened that in standing up for country dances one night some dispute about precedency occurred miss eliza darrell was the honourable eliza darrell and some young lady who was not honourable in contempt defiance neglect or ignorance stood above her the timid eliza remonstrated in no very gentle voice and the colour came into her facethe eloquent blood spoke too plainly shethe gentle elizapushed for her place and with her honourable elbows made way for herself for what will not even wellbred belles do in a crowd unfortunately wellbred beaux are bound to support them ormond was on the point of being drawn into a quarrel with the partner of the offending party when sir ulick appearing in the midst and not seeming to know that any thing was going wrong broke up the intended set of country dances by insisting upon it that the miss darrells had promised him a quadrille and that they must dance it then as there was but just time before supper harry who had seen how little his safety was in the eye of the gentle eliza in comparison with the most trifling point of her offended pride was determined in future not to expose himself to similar danger the next young lady who took his fancy was of course as unlike the last as possible she was one of the remarkably pleasant sprightly clever most agreeable miss lardners she did not interest him much but she amused him exceedingly her sister had one day said to her anne you cant be pretty so you had better be odd anne took the advice set up for being odd and succeeded she was a mimic a wit and very satirical and as long as the satire touched only those for whom he did not care ormond was extremely diverted he did not think it quite feminine or amiable but still it was entertaining there was also something flattering in being exempted from this general reprobation and ridicule miss lardner was intolerant of all insipid peopleflats as she called them how far ormond might have been drawn on by this laughing talking satirical flattering wit there is no saying but luckily they fell out one evening about old lady annaly miss lardner was not aware that ormond knew much less could she have conceived that he liked her ladyship miss lardner was mimicking her for the amusement of a set of young ladies who were standing round the fire after dinner when harry ormond came in he was not quite as much diverted as she expected mr ormond does not know the originalthe copy is lost upon him said miss lardner and happy it is for you continued she turning to him that you do not know her for lady annaly is as stiff and tiresome an original as ever was seen or heard ofand the worst of it is she is an original without originality lady annaly cried ormond with surprise surely not the lady annaly i know theres but one that i know ofheaven forbid that there were two but i beg your pardon mr ormond if she is a friend of yoursi humbly beg your forgivenessi did not know your taste was so very good lady annaly is a fine old lady certainlyvastly respectable and i so far agree with mr ormond that of the two paragons mother and daughter i prefer the mother paragons in their teens are insufferable patterns of perfection are good for nothing in society except to be torn to pieces miss lardner pursued this diversion of tearing them to pieces still flattering herself that her present wit and drollery would prevail with ormond as she had found it prevail with most people against an absent friend but ormond thought upon this occasion she showed more flippancy than wit and more illnature than humour he was shocked at the want of feeling and reverence for age with which she a young girl just entering into the world spoke of a person of lady annalys years and high character in the heat of attack and in her eagerness to carry her point against the annalys the young lady according to custom proceeded from sarcasm to scandal every illnatured report she had ever heard against any of the family she now repeated with exaggeration and asseverationsvehement in proportion to the weakness of proof she asserted that lady annaly with all her high character was very hardhearted to some of her nearest family connexions sweet lady millicentoh how barbarously she used hermiss annaly too she attacked as a coldblooded jilt if the truth must be told she had actually broken the heart of a young nobleman who was fool enough to be taken in by her sort of manner and the son the famous sir herbert annaly he was an absolute miser miss lardner declared that she knew from the best authority most shameful instances of his shabbiness the instances were stated but ormond could not believe these stories and what was more he began to doubt the good faith of the person by whom they were related he suspected that she uttered these slanders knowing them to be false miss lardner observing that ormond made no farther defence but now stood silent and with downcast eyes flattered herself that she had completely triumphed changing the subject she would have resumed with him her familiar playful tone but all chance of her ever triumphing over ormonds head or heart was now at an end so finished the third of his three weeks fancies such evanescent fancies would not have been worth mentioning but for the effect produced on his mind though they left scarcely any individual traces they made a general and useful impression they produced a permanent contempt for scandal that common vice of idle society he determined to guard against it cautiously himself and ever after when he saw a disposition to it in any woman however highlybred highlyaccomplished or highlygifted he considered her as a person of mean mind with whom he could never form any connexion of friendship or love the lardners darrells dartfords vanished and new figures were to appear in the magic lantern at castle hermitage sir ulick thought a few preliminary observations necessary to his ward his opinion of ormonds capacity and steadiness had considerably diminished in consequence of his various mistakes of character and sudden changes of opinion for sir ulick with all his abilities did not discriminate between want of understanding and want of practice besides he did not see the whole he saw the outward boyish follyhe did not see the inward manly sense he judged ormond by a false standard by comparison with the young men of the world of his own age he knew that none of these even of moderate capacity could have been three times in three weeks so near being taken innot one would have made the sort of blunders much less would any one having made them have acknowledged them as frankly as ormond did it was this imprudent candour which lowered him most in his guardians estimation from not having lived in society harry was not aware of the signs and tokens of folly or wisdom by which the world judge the opinion of the bystanders had not habitual power over him while the worldly young men guarded themselves with circumspect selflove against every external appearance of folly harry was completely unguarded they lived cheaply upon borrowed wisdom he profited dearly but permanently by his own experience my dear boy said sir ulick are you aware that his excellency the lord lieutenant is coming to castle hermitage tomorrow yes sir so i heard you say replied harry what sort of a man is he man repeated sir ulick smiling in the first place he is a very great man and may be of great service to you how so sir i dont want any thing from him now i have a good fortune of my own what can i want from any manor if i must not say man any great man my dear harry though a mans fortune is good it may be better for pushing it and worse may it not sir did not i hear you speaking last night of lord somebody who had been pushing his fortune all his life and died pennyless true because he pushed ill if he had pushed well he would have got into a good place i thank heaven i can get that now without any pushing you canyes by my interest perhaps you mean no by my own money i mean bribery and corruption harry places are not in this country to be boughtopenlythese are things one must not talk of and pray with your own moneyif you couldwhat place upon earth would you purchase the only place in the world i should wish for sir would be a place in the country sir ulick was surprised and alarmed but said not a word that could betray his feelings a place of my own continued ormond a comfortable house and estate on which i could live independently and happily with some charming amiable woman darrell dartford lardner which said sir ulick with a sarcastic smile i am cured of these foolish fancies sir well there is another more dangerous might seize you against which i must warn you and i trust one word of advice you will not take amiss sir i am very much obliged to you how could i take advice from you as any thing but a proof of friendship then my dear boy i must tell you in confidence what you will find out the first night you are in his company that his excellency drinks hard no danger of my following his example said harry thank you sir for the warning but i am sure enough of myself on this point because i have been triedand when i would not drink to please my own dear king corny there is not much danger of my drinking to please a lord lieutenant who after all is nothing to me after all said sir ulick but you are not come to after all yetyou know nothing about his excellency yet nothing but what you have told me sir if he drinks hard i think he sets no very good example as a lord lieutenant of ireland what oft was thought perhaps but neer so bluntly expressed said sir ulick sir ulick was afterwards surprised to see the firmness with which his ward when in company with persons of the first rank and fashion resisted the combined force of example importunity and ridicule dr cambray was pleased but not surprised for he had seen in his young friend other instances of this adherence to whatever he had once been convinced was right resolution is a quality or power of mind totally independent of knowledge of the world the habit of selfcontrol can be acquired by any individual in any situation ormond had practised and strengthened it even in the retirement of the black islands other and far more dangerous trials were now preparing for him but before we go on to these it may be expected that we should not pass over in silence the viceregal visitand yet what can we say about it all that ormond could say was that he supposed it was a great honour but it was no great pleasure the mornings two out of five being rainy hung very heavily on hand in spite of the billiardroom fine weather riding shooting or boating killed time well enough till dinner and harry said he liked this part of the business exceedingly till he found that some great men were very cross if they did not shoot as many little birds as he did then came dinner the great point of relief and reunionand there had been late dinners and long dinners and great dinners fine plate good dishes and plenty of wine but a dearth of conversationthe natural topics chained up by etiquette one half of the people at table were too prudent the other half too stupid to talk sir ulick talked away indeed but even he was not half so entertaining as usual because he was forced to bring down his wit and humour to court quality in short till the company had drunk a certain quantity of wine nothing was said worth repeating and afterwards nothing repeatable after the viceregal raree show was over and that the grand folk had been properly bowed into their carriages and had fairly driven away there was some diversion to be had people without yawning seemed to recover from a dead sleep the state of the atmosphere was changed there was a happy thaw the frozen words and bits and ends of conversations were repeated in delightful confusion the men of wit in revenge for their prudent silence were now happy and noisy beyond measure ormond was much entertained he had an opportunity of being not only amused but instructed by conversation for all the great dealers in information who had kept up their goods while there was no market now that there was a demand unpacked and brought them out in profusion there was such a rich supply and such a quick and happy intercourse of wit and knowledge as quite delighted almost dazzled his eyes but his eyes were strong he had a mind untainted with envy highly capable of emulation much was indeed beyond or above the reach of his present powers but nothing was beyond his generous admirationnothing above his future hopes of attainment the effect and more than the effect which sir ulick had foreseen was produced on ormonds mind by hearing the conversation of some of those who had distinguished themselves in political life he caught their spirittheir ambition his wish was no longer merely to see the world but to distinguish himself in it his guardian saw the noble ambition rising in his mind oh at that instant how could he think of debasing it to servile purposesof working this great power only for paltry party ends chapter xx new circumstances arose which unexpectedly changed the course of our heros mind there was a certain lady millicent whose name lady norton had read from her memorandumbook among the list of guests expected at castle hermitage sir ulick as ormond recollected had pronounced her to be a charming elegant fascinating creature sir ulicks praise was sometimes exaggerated and often lavished from party motives or given half in jest and half in earnest against his conscience but when he did speak sincerely no mans taste or judgment as to female beauty manners and character could be more safely trusted he was sincere in all he said of lady millicents appearance and manners but as to the rest he did not think himself bound to tell all he knew about her her ladyship arrived at castle hermitage ormond saw her and thought that his guardian had not in the least exaggerated as to her beauty grace or elegance she was a very young widow still in mourning for her husband a gallant officer who had fallen the preceding year at a siege in flanders lady millicent as lady norton said had not recovered and she feared never would recover from the shock her health had received at the time of her husbands death this account interested ormond exceedingly for the young widow there was something peculiarly engaging in the pensive softness and modesty of her manner it appeared free from affectation far from making any display of her feelings she seemed as much as possible to repress them and to endeavour to be cheerful that she might not damp the gaiety of others her natural disposition lady norton said was very sprightly and however passive and subdued she might appear at present she was of a high independent spirit that would on any great occasion think and act for itself better and bettereach trait suited ormonds character more and more his own observation confirmed the high opinion which the praises of her friend tended to inspire ormond was particularly pleased with the indulgent manner in which lady millicent spoke of her own sex she was free from that propensity to detraction which had so disgusted him in his last love even of those by whom as it had been hinted to him she had been hardly treated she spoke with gentleness and candour recollecting miss lardners assertion that lady annaly had used lady millicent barbarously he purposely mentioned lady annaly to hear what she would say lady annaly said she is a most respectable womanshe has her prejudiceswho is there that has notit is unfortunate for me that she has been prepossessed against me she is one of my nearest connexions by marriageone to whom i might have looked in difficulty and distressone of the few persons whose assistance and interference i would willingly have accepted and would even have stooped to ask but unhappilyi can tell you no more said she checking herself it is every way an unfortunate affair and added she after a deep sigh the most unfortunate part of it is that it is my own fault that ormond could hardly believe and whether it were or not whatever the unfortunate affair might be the candour the gentleness with which she spoke even when her feelings were obviously touched and warm interested him deeply in her favour he had heard that the annalys were just returning to ireland and he determined to go as soon as possible to see them he hoped they would come to castle hermitage and that this coolness might be made up meantime the more he saw of lady millicent the more he was charmed with her sir ulick was much engaged with various business in the mornings and lady norton lady millicent and ormond spent their time together walking driving in the sociable or boating on the lake they were continually together lady norton a very good kind of wellbred little woman was a nonentity in conversation but she never interrupted it nor laid the slightest restraint on any one by her presence which indeed was usually forgotten by ormond his conversation with lady millicent generally took a sentimental turn she did not always speak sense but she talked elegant nonsense with a sweet persuasive voice and eloquent eyes hers was a kind of exalted sentimental morality referring every thing to feeling and to the notion of sacrifice rather than to a sense of duty principle or reason she was all for sensibility and enthusiasmenthusiasm in particularwith her there was no virtue without it acting from the hope of making yourself or others happy or from any view of utility was acting merely from low selfish motives her point of virtue was so high that ordinary mortals might well console themselves by perceiving the impossibility of ever reaching it exalted to the clouds she managed matters as she pleased there and made charming confusion when she condescended to return to earth and attempted to defineno not to definedefinitions were death to her imaginationbut to describe her notions she was nearly unintelligible she declared however that she understood herself perfectly well and ormond deceived by eloquence of which he was a passionate admirer thought that he understood when he only felt her ideas of virtue were carried to such extremes that they touched the opposite vicesin truth there was nothing to prevent them for the line between right and wrong that line which should be strongly marked was effaced so delicately had sentiment shaded off its boundaries these female metaphysics this character of exalted imagination and sensitive softness was not quite so cheap and common some years ago as it has lately become the consequences to which it practically leads were not then fully foreseen and understood at all times a man experienced in female character who had any knowledge of the world even supposing he had no skill in metaphysics would easily have seen to what all this tends and where it usually terminates and such a man would never have thought of marrying lady millicent but ormond was inexperienced the whole matter and manner was new to him he was struck with the delicacy and sensibility of the fair sophist and with all that was ingenious and plausible in the doctrine instead of being alarmed by its dangerous tendency it should be observed in justice to lady millicent that she was perfectly sincereif we may use the expression of good faith in absurdities she did not use this sentimental sophistry as it has since been too often employed by many to veil from themselves the criminality of passion or to mask the deformity of vice there was perhaps the more immediate hazard of her erring from ignorance and rashness but there was also in her youth and innocence a chance that she might instinctively start back the moment she should see the precipice one evening sir ulick was talking of lord chesterfields letters a book at that time much in vogue but which the good sense and virtue of england soon cast into disrepute and which in spite of the charms of wit and style in spite of many sparkling and some valuable observations mixed with its corruption has since sunk fortunately for the nation almost into oblivion but when these private letters were first published and when my lord who now appears so stiff and awkward was in the fashion of the day there was no withstanding it the book was a manual of educationwith the vain hope of getting cheaply secondhand knowledge of the world it was read universally by every young man entering life from the noblemans son while his hair was powdering to the prentice thumbing it surreptitiously behind the counter sir ulick oshane of course recommended it to his ward to lady millicents credit she inveighed against it with honest indignation what said sir ulick smiling you are shocked at the idea of lord chesterfields advising his pupil at paris to prefer a reputable affair with a married woman to a disreputable intrigue with an opera girl well i believe you are right as an englishwoman my dear lady millicent and i am clear at all events that you are right as a woman to blush so eloquently with virtuous indignationlady annaly herself could not have spoken and looked the thing better so i was just thinking said ormond only the difference harry between a young and an elderly woman said sir ulick truths divine come mended from the lips of youth and beauty his compliment was lost upon lady millicent at the first mention of lady annalys name she had sighed deeply and had fallen into reverieand ormond as he looked at her fell into raptures at the tender expression of her countenance sir ulick tapped him on the shoulder and drawing him a little on one side take care of your heart young man whispered he no serious attachment hereremember i warn you lady norton joined them and nothing more was said take care of my heart thought ormond why should i guard it against such a womanwhat better can i do with it than offer it to such a woman a thought had crossed ormonds mind which recurred at this instant from the great admiration sir ulick expressed for lady millicent and the constant attentionmore than gallanttender attention which sir ulick paid her ormond was persuaded that but for that half of the broken chain of matrimony which still encumbered him whom it could not bind sir ulick would be very glad to offer lady millicent not only his heart but his hand suspecting this partiality and imagining a latent jealousy ormond did not quite like to consult his guardian about his own sentiments and proceedings he wished previously to consult his impartial and most safe friend dr cambray but dr cambray had been absent from home ever since the arrival of lady millicent the doctor and his family had been on a visit to a relation at a distance ormond impatient for their return had every day questioned the curate and at last in reply to his regular question of when do you expect the doctor sir he heard the glad tidings of we expect him tomorrow or next day sir positively the next day ormond who was now master of a very elegant phaeton and beautiful gray horses and having for some time been under the tuition of that knowing whip tom darrell could now drive to admiration prevailed upon lady millicent to trust herself with him in his phaetonsir ulick came up just as ormond had handed lady millicent into the carriage and pressing on his wards shoulder said have you the reins safe yes thats wellremember now harry ormond said he with a look which gave a double meaning to his words remember i charge you the warning i gave you last nightdrive carefullypray young sir look before youno rashnessyoung horses these added he patting the horsespray be careful harry ormond promised to be very careful and drove off i suppose thought he my guardian must have some good reason for this reiterated caution i will not let her see my sentiments till i know his reasons besides as dr cambray returns tomorrow i can wait another day accordingly though not without putting considerable restraint upon himself ormond talked of the beauties of nature and of indifferent matters the conversation rather flagged and sometimes on her ladyships side as well as on his he fancied that she was more reserved than usual and a little embarrassed he exerted himself to entertain herthat was but common civilityhe succeeded was pleased to see her spirits rise and her embarrassment wear off when she revived her manner was this day so peculiarly engaging and the tones of her voice so soft and winning that it required all ormonds resolution to refrain from declaring his passion now for the first time he conceived a hope that he might make himself agreeable to her that he might in time soothe her grief and restore her to happiness her expressions were all delicately careful to imply nothing but friendshipbut a womans friendship insensibly leads to love as they were returning home after a delightful drive they entered upon this subject so favourable to the nice casuistry of sentiment and to the enthusiastic eloquence of passionwhen at an opening in the road a carriage crossed them so suddenly that ormond had but just time to pull up his horses dr cambray i declare the very man i wished to see the doctor whose countenance had been full of affectionate pleasure at the first sight of his young friend changed when he saw who was in the phaeton with him the doctor looked panicstruck lady millicent dr cambray ormond began the introduction but each bowing said in a constrained voice i have the honour of knowing i have the pleasure of being acquainted the pleasure and honour seemed to be painful and embarrassing to both dont let us detain you said the doctor but i hope mr ormond you will let me see you as soon as you can at vicars dale you would not doubt that my dear doctor said ormond if you knew how impatient i have been for your returni will be with you before you are all out of the carriage the sooner the better said the doctor the sooner the better echoed the friendly voices of mrs cambray and her daughter ormond drove on but from this moment till they reached castle hermitage no more agreeable conversation passed between him and his fair companion it was all constrained i was not aware that dr cambray had the honour of being acquainted with lady millicent said ormond o yes i had the pleasure some time ago replied lady millicent when he was in dublinnot latelyi was a great favourite of his once once and always i should have thought dr cambrays a most amiable respectable man said her ladyship he must be a great acquisition in this neighbourhooda good clergyman is valuable every where in ireland most especially where the spirit of conciliation is much wanted tis unknown how much a good clergyman may do in ireland very truecertainly so with a repetition of truisms interspersed with reflections on the state of ireland tithes and the education of the poor they reached castle hermitage lady millicent you look pale said sir ulick as he handed her out oh no i have had a most delightful drive harry just stayed to say that dr cambray was returned and that he must run to see him and off he went he found the doctor in his study well my dear doctor said ormond in breathless consternation what is the matter nothing i hope said the doctor looking earnestly in ormonds face and yet your countenance tells me that my fears are well founded what is it you fear sir the lady who was in the phaeton with you lady millicent i fear why should you fear siroh tell me at oncewhat do you know of her at once then i know her to be a very imprudent though hope she is still an innocent woman innocent repeated ormond good heavens is it possible that there can be any doubt imprudent my dear doctor perhaps you have been misinformed all i know on the subject is this said dr cambray during lord millicents absence on service a gentleman of high rank and gallantry paid assiduous attention to lady millicent her relation and friend lady annaly advised her to break off all intercourse with this gentleman in such a decided manner as to silence scandal lady millicent followed but half the advice of her friend she discountenanced the public attentions of her admirer but she took opportunities of meeting him at private parties lady annaly again interferedlady millicent was offended but the death of her husband saved her from farther danger and opened her eyes to the views of a man who thought her no longer worthy his pursuit when he might have her for life ormond saw that there was no resource for him but immediately to quit castle hermitage therefore the moment he returned he informed sir ulick of his determination pointing out to him the impropriety of his remaining in the society of lady millicent when his opinion of her character and the sentiments which had so strongly influenced his behaviour were irrevocably changed this was an unexpected blow upon sir ulick he had his private reasons for wishing to detain ormond at castle hermitage till he was of age to dissipate his mind by amusement and variety and to obtain over it an habitual guidance ormond proposed immediately to visit the continent by the time he should arrive at paris dora would be settled there and he should be introduced into the best company the subtle sir ulick perceiving that ormond must change his quarters advised him to see something of his own country before he went abroad in the course of a few days various letters of recommendation were procured for him from sir ulick and his connexions and what was of still more consequence from dr cambray and his friends during this interval ormond once more visited the black islands scenes which recalled a thousand tender and a few embittering recollections he was greeted with heartfelt affection by many of the inhabitants of the island with whom he had passed some of his boyish days of some scenes he had to be ashamed but of others he was justly proud and from every tongue he heard the delightful praises of his departed friend and benefactor his little farm had been well managed during his absence the trees he had planted began to make some appearance and upon the whole his visit to the black islands revived his generous feelings and refreshed those traces of early virtue which had been engraven on his heart at castle hermitage every thing had been prepared for his departure and upon visiting his excellent friend at the vicarage he found the whole family heartily interested in his welfare and ready to assist him by letters of introduction to the best people in every part of ireland which ormond intended to visit chapter xxi during the course of ormonds tour through ireland he frequently found himself in company with those who knew the history of public affairs for years past and were but too well acquainted with the political profligacy and shameful jobbing of sir ulick oshane some of these gentlemen knowing mr ormond to be his ward refrained of course from touching upon any subject relative to sir ulick and when ormond mentioned him evaded the conversation or agreed in general terms in praising his abilities wit and address but after a day or twos journey from castle hermitage when he was beyond his own and the adjoining counties when he went into company with those who happened to know nothing of his connexion with sir ulick oshane then he heard him spoken of in a very different manner he was quite astonished and dismayed by the general abuse as he thought it which was poured upon him well every man of abilities excites envyevery man who takes a part in politics especially in times when parties run high must expect to be abused they must bear it and their friends must learn to bear it for them such were the reflections with which ormond at first comforted himself as far as party abuse went this was quite satisfactory even facts or what are told as facts are so altered by the manner of seeing them by an opposite party that without meaning to traduce they calumniate ormond entrenched himself in total disbelief and cool assertion of his disbelief of a variety of anecdotes he continually heard discreditable to sir ulick still he expected that when he went into other company and met with men of sir ulicks own party he should obtain proofs of the falsehood of these stories and by that he might be able not only to contradict but to confute them people however only smiled and told him that he had better inquire no farther if he expected to find sir ulick an immaculate character those who liked him best laughed off the notorious instances of his public defection of principle and of his private jobbing as good jokes proofs of his knowledge of the worldhis address his frankness his being not a bit of a hypocrite but even those who professed to like him best and to be the least scrupulous with regard to public virtue still spoke with a sort of facetious contempt of sir ulick as a thoroughgoing friend of the powers that beas a hack of administrationas a man who knew well enough what he was about ormond was continually either surprised or hurt by these insinuations the concurrent testimony of numbers who had no interest to serve or prejudice to gratify operated upon him by degrees so as to enforce conviction and this was still more painful harry became so sore and irritable upon this subject that he was now every day in danger of entangling himself in some quarrel in defence of his guardian several times the master of the house prevented this and brought him to reason by representing that the persons who talked of sir ulick were quite ignorant of his connexion with him and spoke only according to general opinion and to the best of their belief of a public character who was fair game it was at that time much the fashion among a certain set in dublin to try their wit upon each other in political and poetical squibsthe more severe and bitter these were the more they were applauded the talent for invective was in the highest demand at this period in ireland it was considered as the unequivocal proof of intellectual superiority the display of it was the more admired as it could not be enjoyed without a double portion of that personal promptitude to give the satisfaction of a gentleman on which the irish pride themselves the taste of the nation both for oratory and manners has become of late years so much more refined that when any of the lampoons of that day are now recollected people are surprised at the licence of abuse which was then tolerated and even approved of in fashionable society sir ulick oshane as a wellknown public character had been the subject of a variety of puns bonmots songs and epigrams which had become so numerous as to be collected under the title of ulysseana upon the late separation of sir ulick and his lady a new edition with a caricature frontispiece had been published unfortunately for ormond this had just worked its way from dublin to this part of the country it happened one day at a gentlemans house where this ulysseana had not yet been seen that a lady a visitor and a stranger full of some of the lines which she had learned by heart began to repeat them for the amusement of the teatable ladies do not always consider how much mischief they may do by such imprudence nor how they may hazard valuable lives for the sake of producing a sensation by the repetition of a severe thing ormond came into the room after dinner and with some other gentlemen gathered round the teatable while the lady was repeating some extracts from the new edition of the ulysseana the master and mistress of the house made reiterated attempts to stop the lady but too intent upon herself and her secondhand wit to comprehend or take these hints she went on reciting the following lines to serve in parliament the nation sir ulick read his recantation at first he joined the patriot throng but soon perceiving he was wrong he ratted to the courtier tribe bought by a title and a bribe but how that new found friend to bind with any oathof any kind disturbd the premiers wary mind upon his faithupon his word oh that my friend is too absurd upon his honourquite a jest upon his conscienceno such test by all he has on earthtis gone by all his hopes of heaventheyre none how then secure him in our pay he cant be trusted for a day howwhen you want the fellows throat pay by the jobyou have his vote sir ulick himself had he been present would have laughed off the epigram with the best grace imaginable and so in good policy ought ormond to have taken it but he felt it too much and was not in the habit of laughing when he was vexed most of the company who knew any thing of his connexion with sir ulick or who understood the agonizing looks of the master and mistress of the house politely refrained from smiles or applause but a cousin of the lady who repeated the lines a young man who was one of the hateful tribe of quizzers on purpose to try ormond praised the verses to the skies and appealed to him for his opinion i cant admire them sir replied ormond what fault can you find with them said the young man winking at the bystanders i think them incorrect in the first place sir said ormond and altogether indifferent well at any rate they cant be called moderate said the gentleman and as to incorrect the substance i fancy is correctly true fancy sirit would be hard if character were to be at the mercy of fancy cried ormond hastily but checking himself he in a mild tone added before we go any farther sir i should inform you that i am a ward of sir ulick o shanes oh mercy exclaimed the lady who had repeated the verses i am sure i did not know that or i would not have said a wordi declare i beg your pardon sir ormonds bow and smile spoke his perfect satisfaction with the ladys contrition and his desire to relieve her from farther anxiety so the matter might have happily ended but her cousin though he had begun merely with an intention to try ormonds temper now felt piqued by his spirit and thought it incumbent upon him to persist having drunk enough to be illhumoured he replied in an aggravating and illbred manner your being sir ulick oshanes ward may make a difference in your feelings sir but i dont see why it should make any in my opinion in the expression of that opinion at least sir i think it ought the master of the house now interfered to explain and pacify and ormond had presence of mind and command enough over himself to say no more while the ladies were present he sat down and began talking about some trifle in a gay tone but his flushed cheek and altered manner showed that he was only repressing other feelings the carriages of the visitors were announced and the strangers rose to depart ormond accompanied the master of the house to hand the ladies to their carriages to mark his being in perfect charity with the fair penitent he showed her particular attention which quite touched her and as he put her into her carriage she all the time repeated her apologies declared it should be a lesson to her for life and cordially shook hands with him at parting for her sake he wished that nothing more should be said on the subject but on his return to the hall he found there the cousin buttoning on his great coat and seeming loath to depart still in illhumour the gentleman said i hope you are satisfied with that ladys apologies mr ormond i am sir perfectly thats lucky for apologies are easier had from ladies than gentlemen and become them better i think it becomes gentlemen as well as ladies to make candid apologies where they are conscious of being wrongif there was no intention to give offence if is a great peacemaker sir but i scorn to take advantage of an if am i to suppose then sir said ormond that it was your intention to offend me suppose what you please siri am not in the habit of explanation or apology then sir the sooner we meet the better said ormond in consequence ormond applied to an officer who had been present during the altercation to be his second ormond felt that he had restrained his anger sufficientlyhe was now as firm as he had been temperate the parties met and fought the man who deserved to have suffered by the chance of this rational mode of deciding right and wrong escaped unhurt ormond received a wound in his arm it was only a flesh wound he was at the house of a very hospitable gentleman whose family were kind to him and the inconvenience and pain were easily borne in the opinion of all in that part of the world who knew the facts he had conducted himself as well as the circumstances would permit and as it was essential not only to the character of a hero but of a gentleman at that time in ireland to fight a duel we may consider ormond as fortunate in not having been in the wrong he rose in favour with the ladies and in credit with the gentlemen and he heard no more of the ulysseana but he was concerned to see paragraphs in all the irish papers about the duel that had been fought between m n esq jun of and h o esq in consequence of a dispute that arose about some satirical verses repeated by a lady on a certain wellknown character nearly related to one of the parties a flaming account of the duel followed in which there was the usual newspaper proportion of truth and falsehood ormond knew and regretted that this paragraph must meet the eyes of his guardian and still more he was sorry that dr cambray should see it he knew the doctors christian abhorrence of the whole system of duelling and by the statement in the papers it appeared that that gallant youth h o esq to whom the newswriter evidently wished to do honour had been far more forward to provoke the fight than he had been or than he ought to have beenhis own plain statement of facts which he wrote to dr cambray would have set every thing to rights but his letter crossed the doctors on the road as he was now in a remote place which the delightful mail coach roads had not then reachedwhere the post came in only three days in the weekand where the mail cart either broke down lost a wheel had a tired horse was overturned or robbed at an average once a fortnightour hero had no alternative but patience and the amusement of calculating dates and chances upon his restless sofa his taste for reading enabled him to pass agreeably some of the hours of bodily confinement which men and young men especially accustomed to a great deal of exercise liberty and locomotion generally find so intolerably irksome at length his wound was well enough for him to travelletters for him arrived a warm affectionate one from his guardian and one from dr cambray which relieved his anxiety i must tell you my dear young friend said dr cambray that while you have been defending sir ulick oshanes public character of which bytheby you know nothing i have been defending your private character of which i hope and believe i know something the truth is always known in time with regard to every character and therefore independently of other motives moral and religious it is more prudent to trust to time and truth for their defence than to sword and pistol i know you are impatient to hear what were the reports to your disadvantage and from whom i had them i had them from the annalys and they heard them in england through various circuitous channels of female correspondents in ireland as far as we can trace them we think that they originated with your old friend miss black the first account lady annaly heard of you after she went to england was that you were living a most dissolute life in the black islands with king corny who was described to be a profligate rebel and his companion an excommunicated catholic priest king priest and prince harry getting drunk together regularly every night of their lives the next account which lady annaly received some months afterwards in reply to inquiries she had made from her agent was that it was impossible to know any thing for certain of mr harry ormond as he always kept in the black islands the report was that he had lately seduced a girl of the name of peggy sheridan a respectable gardeners daughter who was going to be married to a man of the name of moriarty carroll a person whom mr ormond had formerly shot in some unfortunate drunken quarrel the match between her and moriarty had been broken off in consequence the following year accounts were worse and worse this harry ormond had gained the affections of his benefactors daughter though as he had been warned by her father she was betrothed to another man the young lady was afterwards by her fathers anger and by ormonds desertion of her thrown into the arms of a french adventurer whom ormond brought into the house under pretence of learning french from him immediately after the daughters elopement with the french master the poor father died suddenly in some extraordinary manner when out shooting with this mr ormond to whom a considerable landed property and a large legacy in money were to every bodys surprise found to be left in a will which he produced and which the family did not think fit to dispute there were strange circumstances told concerning the wake and burial all tending to prove that this harry ormond had lost all feeling hints were further given that he had renounced the protestant religion and had turned catholic for the sake of absolution many times during the perusal of this extravagant tissue of falsehoods ormond laid down and resumed the paper unable to refrain from exclamations of rage and contempt sometimes almost laughing at the absurdity of the slander after this thought he who can mind common reportsand yet dr cambray says that these excited some prejudice against me in the mind of lady annaly with such a woman i should have thought it impossible could she believe me capable of such crimesme of whom she had once a good opinionme in whose fate she said she was interested he took dr cambrays letter again and read on he found that lady annaly had not credited these reports as to the atrocious accusations but they had so far operated as to excite doubts and suspicions in some of the circumstances there was sufficient truth to colour the falsehood for example with regard both to peggy sheridan and dora the truth had been plausibly mixed with falsehood the story of peggy sheridan lady annaly had some suspicion might be true her ladyship who had seen moriartys generous conduct to ormond was indignant at his ingratitude she was a woman prompt to feel strong indignation against all that was base and when her indignation was excited she was sometimes incapable of hearing what was said on the other side of the question her daughter florence of a calmer temper and cooler judgment usually acted as moderator on these occasions she could not believe that harry ormond had been guilty of faults that were so opposite to those which they had seen in his dispositionviolence not treachery was his fault but why if there were nothing wrong lady annaly urgedwhy did not he write to her as she had requested he would when his plans for his future life were decidedshe had told him that her son might probably be able to assist him why could not he write one line ormond had heard that her son was ill and that her mind was so absorbed with anxiety that he could not at first venture to intrude upon her with his selfish concerns this was his first and best reason but afterwards to be sure when he heard that the son was better he might have written he wrote at that time such a sad scrawl of a handhe was so little used to letterwriting that he was ashamed to write then it was too late after so long a silence c foolish as these reasons were they had as we have said before acted upon our young hero and have perhaps in as important circumstances prevented many young men from writing to friends able and willing to serve them it was rather fortunate for ormond that slander did not stop at the first plausible falsehoods when the more atrocious charges came against him miss annaly who had never deserted his cause declared her absolute disbelief the discussions that went on between her and her mother kept alive their interest about this young man he was likely to have been forgotten during their anxiety in the sons illness but fresh reports had brought him to their recollection frequently and when their friend dr cambray was appointed to the living of castle hermitage his evidence perfectly reinstated harry in lady annalys good opinion as if to make amends for the injustice she had done him by believing any part of the evil reports she was now anxious to see him again a few days after dr cambray wrote ormond received a very polite and gratifying letter from lady annaly requesting that as annaly lay in his route homewards he would spend a few days there and give her an opportunity of making him acquainted with her son it is scarcely necessary to say that this invitation was eagerly accepted chapter xxii upon his arrival at annaly ormond found that dr cambray and all his family were there yes all your friends said lady annaly as ormond looked round with pleasure all your friends mr ormondyou must allow me an old right to be of that numberand here is my son who is as well inclined as i hope you feel to pass over the intermediate formality of new acquaintanceship and to become intimate with you as soon as possible sir herbert annaly confirmed by the polite cordiality of his manner all that his mother promised adding that their mutual friend dr cambray had made him already so fully acquainted with mr ormond that though he had never had the pleasure of seeing him before he could not consider him as a stranger florence annaly was beautiful but not one of those beauties who strike at first sight hers was a face which neither challenged nor sued for admiration there was no expression thrown into the eyes or the eyebrows no habitual smile on the lipsthe features were all in natural repose the face never expressed any thing but what the mind really felt but if any just observation was made in miss annalys company any stroke of genius that countenance instantly kindled into light and life and if any noble sentiment was expressed if any generous action was related then the soul within illumined the countenance with a ray divine when once ormond had seen this his eye returned in hopes of seeing it againhe had an indescribable interest and pleasure in studying a countenance which seemed so true an index to a noble and cultivated mind to a heart of delicate but not morbid sensibility his manners and understanding had been formed and improved beyond what could have been expected from the few opportunities of improvement he had till lately enjoyed he was timid however in conversation with those of whose information and abilities he had a high opinion so that at first he did not do himself justice but in his timidity there was no awkwardness it was joined with such firmness of principle and such a resolute manly character that he was peculiarly engaging to women during his first visit at annaly he pleased much and was so much pleased with every individual of the family with their manners their conversation their affection for each other and altogether with their mode of living that he declared to dr cambray he never had been so happy in his whole existence it was a remarkable fact however that he spoke much more of lady annaly and sir herbert than of miss annaly he had never before felt so very unwilling to leave any place or so exceedingly anxious to be invited to repeat his visit he did receive the wishedfor invitation and it was given in such a manner as left him no doubt that he might indulge his own ardent desire to return and to cultivate the friendship of this family his ardour for foreign travel his desire to see more of the world greatly abated and before he reached castle hermitage and by the time he saw his guardian he had almost forgotten that sir ulick had traced for him a course of travels through the british islands and the most polished parts of the continent he now told sir ulick that it was so far advanced in the season that he thought it better to spend the winter in ireland in dublin instead of london said sir ulick smiling very patriotic and very kind to me for i am sure i am your first object and depend upon it few people ladies always excepted will ever like your company better than i do then sir ulick went rapidly over every subject and every person that could lead his ward farther to explain his feelings but now as usual he wasted his address for the ingenuous young man directly opened his whole heart to him i am impatient to tell you sir said he how very kindly i was received by lady annaly she is very kind said sir ulick i suppose in general you have found yourself pretty well received wherever you have gonenot to flatter you too much on your mental or personal qualifications and no disparagement to dr cambrays letters of introduction or my own five or six thousand ayear are i have generally observed a tolerably good passport into society a sufficient passepartout passepartoutnot partoutnot quite sufficient at annaly you cannot mean sir oh i cannot mean any thing but that annaly is altogether the eighth wonder of the world said sir ulick and all the men and women in it absolutely angelsperfect angels no sir if you please not perfect for i have heardthough i own i never saw itthat perfection is always stupid now certainly that the annalys are not well well they shall be as imperfect as you likeany thing to please you but sir you used to be so fond of the annalys i remember true and did i tell you that i had changed my opinion your manner though not your words tells me so you mistake the fact isfor i always treat you harry with perfect candouri was hurt and vexed by their refusal of my son but after all added he with a deep sigh it was marcuss own faulthe has been very dissipated miss annaly was right and her mother quite right i own lady annaly is one of the most respectable women in irelandand miss annaly is a charming girli never saw any girl i should have liked so much for my daughterinlaw but marcus and i dont always agree in our tastesi dont think the refusal there was half as great a mortification and disappointment to him as it was to me you delight me dear sir cried ormond for then i may feel secure that if ever in futurei dont mean in the least that i have any present thoughtit would be absurdit would be ridiculousit would be quite improperyou know i was only there ten days but i mean if in future i should ever have any thoughtsany serious thoughts well well said sir ulick laughing at ormonds hesitation and embarrassment i can suppose that you will have thoughts of some kind or other and serious thoughts in due course but as you justly observe it would be quite ridiculous at present i beg your pardon sir interrupted harry but it would even at present be an inexpressible satisfaction to me to know that if in future such a thing should occur i should be secure in the first place of your approbation as to that my dear boy said sir ulick you know in a few days you will be at years of discretionthen my control ceases yes sir but not my anxiety for your approbation and my deference for your opinion then said sir ulick and without circumlocution or nonsense i tell you at once harry ormond that florence annaly is the woman in the world i should like best to see your wife thank you sir for this explicit answeri am sure towards me nothing can have been more candid and kind than your whole conduct has ever been thats true harry exclaimed sir ulick tell me about this duelyou have fought a duel in defence of my conduct and character i understand since i saw you but my dear fellow though i am excessively obliged to you i am exceedingly angry with you how could you possibly be so hotheated and silly as to take up any man for relishing the ulysseana bless ye i relish it myselfi only laugh at such things believe me tis the best way i am sure of it sir if one can and indeed i have had pretty good proof that one should despise reports and scandal of all kindseasier for oneself sometimes than for ones friends yes my dear ormond by the time you have been half as long living in the great and the political world as i have been you will be quite casehardened and will hear your friends abused without feeling it in the least believe me i once was troubled with a great deal of susceptibility like yoursbut after all tis no bad thing for you to have fought a duela feather in your cap with the ladies and a warning to all impertinent fellows to let you alonebut you were wounded the newspaper saidi asked you where three times in my lettersyou never condescended to answer meanswer me now i insist upon it in my arm sira slight scratch slight scratch or not i must hear all about itcome tell me exactly how the thing began and endedtell me all the rascals said of meyou wontthen ill tell you they said i am the greatest jobber in irelandthat i do not mind how i throw away the public moneyin short that i am a sad political profligatewell well i am sure after all they did me the justice to acknowledge that in private life no mans honour is more to be depended on they did do you that justice sir said ormond but pray ask me no farther questionsfor frankly it is disagreeable to meand i will tell you no more thats frank said sir ulick and i as frankly assure you i am perfectly satisfied then to return to the annalys said ormond i never saw sir herbert till nowi like himi like his principleshis love of his countryand his attachment to his family hes a very fine fellowno better fellow than herbert annaly but as for his attachment to his family who thanks him for that who could help it with such a family and his love for his countryevery body loves his country more or less i suppose said ormond but upon my word i entirely agree with you about sir herbert though i know he is prejudiced against me to the last degree if he be i dont know it siri never found it out he will let it out by and byi only hope he will not prejudice you against me that is not very easily done sir as you have given some proof my dear boy and i thank you for it but the annalys would go more cautiously to worki only put you on your guardmarcus and sir herbert never could hit it off together and i am afraid the breach between us and the annalys must be widened for marcus must stand against sir herbert at the next election if he livepray how is he not strong sirhe has a hectic colouras i was very sorry to see ay poor fellowhe broke some bloodvessel i think marcus told me when they were in england yes sirso lady annaly told meit was in overexerting himself to extinguish a fire a very fine spirited fellow he is no doubt said sir ulick but after all that was rather a foolish thing in his state of health bytheby as your guardian it is my duty to explain the circumstances of this familyin case you should hereafter have any serious thoughts as you say you should know what comforted marcus in his disappointment there there is then some confounded flaw in that old fathers will through which the great herbert estate slips to an heiratlaw who has started up within this twelvemonth miss annaly who was to have been a nonpareil of an heiress in case of the brothers death will have but a moderate fortune and the poor dowager will be but scantily provided for after all the magnificence which she has been used to unless he lives to make up something handsome for them i dont know the particulars but i know that a vast deal depends on his living till he has levied certain fines which he ought to have levied instead of amusing himself putting out other peoples fires but i am excessively anxious about it and now on your account as well as theirs for it would make a great difference to you if you seriously have any thoughts of miss annaly ormond declared this could make no difference to him since his own fortune would be sufficient for all the wishes of such a woman as he supposed miss annaly to be the next day marcus oshane arrived from england this was the first time that ormond and he had met since the affair of moriarty and the banishment from castle hermitage the meeting was awkward enough notwithstanding sir ulicks attempts to make it otherwise marcus laboured under the double consciousness of having deserted harry in past adversity and of being jealous of his present prosperity ormond at first went forward to meet him more than half way with great cordiality but the cold politeness of marcus chilled him and the heartless congratulations and frequent allusions in the course of the first hour to ormonds new fortune and consequence offended our young heros pride he grew more reserved the more complimentary marcus became especially as in all his compliments there was a mixture of persiflage which marcus supposed erroneously that ormonds untutored unpractised ear would not perceive harry sat silent proudly indignant he valued himself on being something and somebody independently of his fortunehe had worked hard to become sohe had the consciousness about him of tried integrity resolution and virtue and was it to be implied that he was somebody only in consequence of his having chanced to become heir to so many thousands a year sir ulick whose address was equal to most occasions was not able to manage so as to make these young men like one another marcus had an old jealousy of harrys favour with his father of his fathers affection for harry and at the present moment he was conscious that his father was with just cause much displeased with him of this harry knew nothing but marcus suspected that his father had told ormond every thing and this increased the awkwardness and illhumour that marcus felt and notwithstanding all his knowledge of the world and conventional politeness he showed his vexation in no very wellbred manner he was now in particularly bad humour in consequence of a scrape as he called it which he had got into during his last winter in london respecting an intrigue with a married lady of rank marcus by some intemperate expressions had brought on the discovery of which when it was too late he repented a public trial was likely to be the consequencethe damages would doubtless be laid at the least at ten thousand pounds marcus however counting as sons sometimes do in calculating their fathers fortune all the credit and knowing nothing of the debtor side of the account conceived his fathers wealth to be inexhaustible lady oshanes large fortune had cleared off all debts and had set sir ulick up in a bank which was in high credit then he had shares in a canal and in a silver minehe held two lucrative sinecure placesand had bought estates in three counties but the son did not know that for the borrowed purchasemoney of two of the estates sir ulick was now paying high and accumulating interest so that the prospect of being called upon for ten thousand pounds was most alarming in this exigency sir ulick who had long foreseen how the affair was likely to terminate had his eye upon his wards ready money it was for this he had been at such peculiar pains to ingratiate himself with ormond affection nevertheless made him hesitate he was unwilling to injure or to hazard his propertyvery unwilling to prey upon his generositystill more so after the late handsome manner in which ormond had hazarded his life in defence of his guardians honour sir ulick who perceived the first evening that marcus and ormond met that the former was not going the way to assist these views pointed out to him how much it was for his interest to conciliate ormond and to establish himself in his good opinion but marcus though he saw and acknowledged this could not submit his pride and temper to the necessary restraint for a few hours he would display his hereditary talents and all his acquired graces but the next hour his illhumour would break out towards his inferiors his fathers tenants and dependents in a way which ormonds generous spirit could not bear before he went to england even from his boyish days his manners had been habitually haughty and tyrannical to the lower class of people ormond and he had always differed and often quarrelled on this subject ormond hoped to find his manners altered in this respect by his residence in a more polished country but the external polish he had acquired had not reached the mind highbred society had taught him only to be polite to his equals he was now still more disposed to be insolent to his inferiors especially to his irish inferiors he affected to consider himself as more than half an englishman and returning from london in all the distress and disgrace to which he had reduced himself by criminal indulgence in the vices of fashionable and what he called refined society he vented his illhumour on the poor irish peasantsthe natives as he termed them in derision he spoke to them as if they were slaveshe considered them as savages marcus had early in life almost before he knew the real distinctions or more than the names of the different parties in ireland been a strong party man he called himself a government man but he was one of those partisans whom every wise and good administration in ireland has discountenanced and disclaimed he was in short one of those who make their politics an excuse to their conscience for the indulgence of a violent temper ormond was indignant at the inveterate prejudice that marcus showed against a poor man whom he had injured but who had never injured him the moment marcus saw moriarty carroll again and heard his name mentioned he exclaimed and reiterated thats a bad fellowi know him of oldall those carrolls are rascals and rebels marcus looked with a sort of disdainful spleen at the house which ormond had fitted up for moriarty so you stick to this fellow stillwhat a dupe ormond this moriarty has made of you said marcus but thats not my affair i only wonder how you wheedled my father out of the ground for the garden here there was no wheedling in the case said ormond your father gave it freely or i should not have accepted it you were very good to accept it no doubt said marcus in an ironical tone i know i have asked my father for a garden to a cottage before now and have been refused sir ulick came up just as this was said and alarmed at the tone of voice used all his address to bring his son back to good temper and he might have succeeded but that peggy carroll chanced to appear at that instant who is that cried marcuspeggy sheridan as i live is it not no please your honour but peggy sheridan that waspeggy carroll that is said peggy curtsying with a slight blush and an arch smile so you have married that moriarty at last i have please your honourhe is a very honest boyand im very happyif your honours pleased who persuaded your father to this pray contrary to my advice nobody at all plase your honour said peggy looking frightened why do you say that peggy said ormond when you know it was i who persuaded your father to give his consent to your marriage with moriarty you mr ormondoh i comprehend it all now said marcus with his sneering look and tone no doubt you had good reasons poor peggy blushed the deepest crimson i understand it all now said marcusi understand you now harry ormonds anger rose and with a look of high disdain he replied you understand me now no nor ever will nor ever can our minds are unintelligible to each other then turning from him ormond walked away with indignant speed peggy dont i see something like a cow yonder getting her bread at my expense said sir ulick directing peggys eye to a gap in the hedge by the roadside whose cow is that at the top of the ditch half through my hedge i cant say please your honour said peggy if it wouldnt be paddy mgrathsbetty mgregor cried she calling to a barefooted girl whose cow is yonder oh marcy but if it isnt our own red rogueand when i tied her legs three times myself the day said the girl running to drive away the cow oh she strays and trespasses strangely the red cow for want of the little spot your honour promised her said peggy well run and save my hedge from her now my pretty peggy and i will find the little spot for her tomorrow said sir ulick away ran peggy after the cowwhile lowering marcus cursed them all three pretty peg he swore ought to be banished the estatethe cow ought to be hamstrung instead of having a spot promised her but this is the way sir you ruin the country and the people said he to his father be that as it may i do not ruin myself as you do marcus replied the cool sir ulick never mind the cownonsense i am not thinking of a cow nor i neither sir then follow harry ormond directly and make him understand that he misunderstood you said sir ulick excuse me siri cannot bend to him said marcus and you expect that he will lend you ten thousand pounds at your utmost need the money with your estate can be easily raised elsewhere sir said marcus i tell you it cannot sir said the father i cannot bend to ormond sir to any body but himany thing but thatmy pride cannot stoop to that your pridepride that licks the dust thought sir ulick it was in vain for the politic father to remonstrate with the headstrong son the whole train which sir ulick had laid with so much skill was he feared at the moment when his own delicate hand was just preparing to give the effective touch blown up by the rude impatience of his son sir ulick however never lost time or opportunity in vain regret for the past even in the moment of disappointment he looked to the future he saw the danger of keeping two young men together who had such incompatible tempers and characters he was therefore glad when he met ormond again to hear him propose his returning to annaly and he instantly acceded to the proposal castle hermitage i know my dear boy cannot be as pleasant to you just now as i could wish to make it we have nobody here now and marcus is not all i could wish him said sir ulick with a sigh he had always a jealousy of my affection for you harryit cannot be helpedwe do not choose our own childrenbut we must abide by themyou must perceive that things are not going on quite rightly between my son and me i am sorry for it sir especially as i am convinced i can do no good and therefore wish not to interfere i believe you are rightthough i part from you with regret i shall be within your reach sir you know whenever you wish for me if ever i can be of the least use to you summon me and i am at your orders thank you but stay one moment said sir ulick with a sudden look of recollection you will be of age in a few days harrywe ought to settle accounts should not we whenever you please sirno hurry on my partbut you have advanced me a great deal of money latelyi ought to settle that oh as to thata mere trifle if you are in no hurry i am in none for i shall have business enough on my hands during these few days before lady norton fills the house again with companyi am certainly a little hurried now then sir do not think of my businessi cannot be better off you know than i ami assure you i am sensible of that never mind the accountsonly send for me whenever i can be of any use or pleasure to you i need not make speeches i trust my dear guardianmy father when i was left fatherlessi trust you believe i have some gratitude in me i do cried sir ulick much moved and by heaven it is impossible toi meanin short it is impossible not to love you harry ormond chapter xxiii there are people who can go on very smoothly with those whose principles and characters they despise and dislike there are people who provided they live in company are happy and care but little of what the company is composed but our young hero certainly was not one of these contented people he was perhaps too much in the other extreme he could not without overt words or looks of indignation endure the presence of those whose characters or principles he despisedhe could not even without manifest symptoms of restlessness or ennui submit long to live with mere companions he required to have friends nor could he make a friend from ordinary materials however smooth the grain or however fine the polish they might take even when the gay world at castle hermitage was new to himamused and enchanted as he was at first with that brilliant society he could not have been content or happy without his friends at vicars dale to whom once at least in the fourandtwenty hours he found it necessary to open his heart we may then judge how happy he now felt in returning to annaly after the sort of moral constraint which he had endured in the company of marcus oshane we may guess what an expansion of heart took place the family union and domestic happiness which he saw at annaly certainly struck him at this time more forcibly from the contrast with what he had just seen at castle hermitage the effect of contrast however is but transient it is powerful as a dramatic resource but in real life it is of no permanent consequence there was here a charm which operates with as great certainty and with a power secure of increasing instead of diminishing from habitthe charm of domestic politeness in the every day manners of this mother son and daughter towards each other as well as towards their guests ormond saw and felt it irresistibly he saw the most delicate attentions combined with entire sincerity perfect ease and constant respect the result of the early habits of goodbreeding acting upon the feelings of genuine affection the external polish which ormond now admired was very different from that varnish which often is hastily applied to hide imperfections this polish was of the substance itself to be obtained only by long use but once acquired lasting for ever not only beautiful but serviceable preserving from the injuries of time and from the dangers of familiarity what influence the sisters charms might have to increase ormonds admiration of the brother we shall not presume to determine but certainly he liked sir herbert annaly better than any young man he had ever seen sir herbert was some years older than ormond he was in his twentyseventh year but at this age he had done more good in life than many men accomplish during their whole existence sir herberts principal estates were in another part of ireland dr cambray had visited them the account he gave ormond of what had been done there to improve the people and to make them happy of the prosperous state of the peasantry their industry and independence their grateful not servile attachment to sir herbert annaly and his mother the veneration in which the name of annaly was held all delighted the enthusiastic ormond the name of annaly was growing wonderfully dear to him and all of a sudden the interest he felt in the details of a country gentlemans life was amazingly increased at times when the ladies were engaged he accompanied sir herbert in visiting his estate sir herbert had never till lately resided at annaly which had within but a short time reverted to his possession in consequence of the death of the person to whom it had been let he found much that wanted improvement in the land and more in the people this estate stretched along the seashore the tenants whom he found living near the coast were an idle profligate desperate set of people who during the time of the late middle landlord had been in the habit of making their rents by nefarious practices the best of the set were merely idle fishermen whose habits of trusting to their luck incapacitated them from industry the others were illicit distillerssmugglersand miscreants who lived by waifs and strays in fact by the pillage of vessels on the coast the coast was dangerousthere happened frequent shipwrecks owing partly as was supposed to the false lights hung out by these people whose interest it was that vessels should be wrecked shocked at these practices sir herbert annaly had from the moment he came into possession of the estate exerted himself to put a stop to them and to punish where he could not reform the offenders the people at first pleaded a sort of tenants right which they thought a landlord could scarcely resist they protested that they could not make the rent if they were not allowed to make it in their own way and showed beyond a doubt that sir herbert could not get half as much rent for his land in those parts if he looked too scrupulously into the means by which it was made they brought in corroboration of their arguments or assertions the example and constant practice of many as good a jantleman as any in ireland who had his rent made up for him that ways very ready and punctual there was his honour mr suchaone and so on and there was sir ulick oshane sure oh he was the man to live underhe was the man that knew when to wink and when to blink and if he shut his eyes properly sure his tenants filled his fist oh sir ulick was the great man for favour and purtection none like him at allhe is the good landlord that will fight the way clear for his own tenants through thick and thinnone dare touch them oh sir ulicks the kind jantleman that understands the law for the poor and could bring them off at every turn and show them the way through the holes in an act of parliament asy as through a riddle oh and if he could but afford to be half as good as his promises sir ulick oshane would be too good entirely now sir ulick oshane had purchased a tract of ground adjoining to sir herberts on this coast and he had bought it on the speculation that he could let it at a very high rent to these people of whose ways and means of paying it he chose to remain in ignorance all the tenants whom sir herbert banished from his estate flocked to sir ulicks by the sacrifice of his own immediate interest and by great personal exertion strict justice and a generous and well secured system of reward sir herbert already had produced a considerable change for the better in the morals and habits of the people he was employing some of his tenants on the coast in building a lighthouse for which he had a grant from parliament and he was endeavouring to establish a manufacture of sailcloth for which there was sufficient demand but almost at every step of his progress he was impeded by the effects of the bad example of his neighbours on sir ulicks estate and by the continual quarrels between the idle discarded tenants and their industrious and now prosperous successors whenever a vessel in distress was seen off the coast there was a constant struggle between the two parties who had opposite interests the one to save the other to destroy in this state of things causes of complaint perpetually occurred and ormond who was present when the accusers and the accused appealed to their landlord sometimes as lord of the manor sometimes as magistrate had frequent opportunities of seeing both sir herberts principles and temper put to the test he liked to compare the different modes in which king corny his guardian and sir herbert annaly managed these things sir herbert governed neither by threats punishments abuse nor tyranny nor yet did he govern by promises nor bribery favour and protection like sir ulick he neither cajoled nor bulliedneither held it as a principle as marcus did that the people must be kept down or that the people must be deceived he treated them neither as slaves subject to his will nor as dupes or objects on which to exercise his wit or his cunning he treated them as reasonable beings and as his fellowcreatures whom he wished to improve that he might make them and himself happy he spoke sense to them and he mixed that sense with wit and humour in the proportion necessary to make it palatable to an irishman in generosity there was a resemblance between the temper of sir herbert and of corny but to ormonds surprise and at first to his disappointment sir herbert valued justice more than generosity ormonds heart on this point was often with king corny when his head was forced to be with sir herbert but by degrees head and heart came together he became practically convinced that justice is the virtue that works best for a constancy and best serves every bodys interest in time and in turn ormond now often said to himself sir herbert annaly is but a few years older than i am by the time i am of his age why should not i become as useful and make as many human beings happy as he does in the meantime the idea of marrying and settling in ireland became every day more agreeable to ormond and france and italy which he had been so eager to visit faded from his imagination sir herbert and lady annaly who had understood from dr cambray that ormond was going to commence his grand tour immediately and who heard him make a number of preparatory inquiries when he had been first at annaly naturally turned the conversation often to the subject they had looked out maps and prints and they had taken down from their shelves the different books of travels which might be most useful to him with guides and postroad books and all that could speed the parting guest but the guest had no mind to partevery thing every body at annaly he found so agreeable and so excellent it must be a great satisfaction to a young man who has a grain of sense and who feels that he is falling inevitably and desperately in love to see that all the ladys family as well as the object of his passion are exactly the people whom he should wish of all others to make his friends for life here was every thing that could be desired suitability of age of fortune of character of temper of tastesevery thing that could make a marriage happy could ormond but win the heart of florence annaly was that heart disengagedhe resolved to inquire first from his dear friend dr cambray who was much in the confidence of this family a great favourite with florence and consequently dearer than ever to ormond he went directly to vicars dale to see and consult him and ormond thought he was confiding a profound secret to the doctor when first he spoke to him of his passion for miss annaly but to his surprise the doctor told him he had seen it long ago and his wife and daughters had all discovered it even when they were first with him at annaly is it possibleand what do you all think we think that you would be a perfectly happy man if you could win miss annaly and we wish you success most sincerely but butoh my dear doctor you alarm me beyond measure what by wishing you success no but by something in your look and manner and by that terrible but you think that i shall never succeedyou think that her heart is engaged if that be the case tell me so at once and i will set off for france tomorrow my good sir you are always for desperate measuresyou are in too great a hurry to come to a conclusion before you have the means of forming a just conclusion remember i tell you this precipitate temper will some time or other bring some great evil upon you i will be patient all my life afterwards if you will only this instant tell me whether she is engaged i do not know whether miss annalys heart be disengaged or noti can tell you only that she has had a number of brilliant offers and that she has refused them all that proves that she had not found one amongst them that she liked said ormond or that she liked some one better than all those whom she refused said dr cambray that is truethat is possiblethat is a dreadful possibility said ormond but do you think there is any probability of that there is i am sorry to tell you my dear ormond a probability against youbut i can only state the facts in general i can form no opinion for i have had no opportunity of judgingi have never seen the two young people together but there is a gentleman of great merit of suitable family and fortune who is deeply in love with miss annaly and who i presume has not been refused for i understand he is soon to be here to be here cried ormond a man of great meriti hope he is not an agreeable man thats a vain hope said dr cambray he is a very agreeable man very agreeablewhat sort of persongrave or gaylike any body that i ever saw yes like a person that you have seen and a person for whom i believe you have a regardlike his own father your dear king cornys friend general albemarle how extraordinaryhow unlucky said ormond i would rather my rival were any one else than the son of a man i am obliged to and a most dangerous rival he must be if he have his fathers merit and his fathers manners oh my dear dr cambray i am sure she likes himand yet she could not be so cheerful in his absence if she were much in lovei defy her and it is impossible that he can be as much in love with her as i am else nothing could keep him from her nothing but his duty i suppose you mean dutywhat duty why there really are duties in this world to be performed though a man in love is apt to forget it colonel albemarle being an officer cannot quit his regiment till he has obtained leave of absence i am heartily glad of it cried ormondi will make the best use of my time before he comes but my dear doctor do you think lady annalydo you think sir herbert wish it to be i really cannot telli know only that he is a particular friend of sir herbert and that i have heard lady annaly speak of him as being a young man of excellent character and high honour for whom she has a great regard ormond sighed heaven forgive me that sigh said he i thought i never should be brought so low as to sigh at bearing of any mans excellent character and high honour but i certainly wish colonel albemarle had never been born heaven preserve me from envy and jealousy our young hero had need to repeat this prayer the next morning at breakfast when sir herbert on opening his letters exclaimed my friend colonel albemarle and lady annaly in a tone of joy colonel albemarlei hope he will soon be here sir herbert proceeded cannot obtain leave of absence yetbut lives in hopes said sir herbert reading the letter and handing it to his mother ormond did not dare did not think it honourable to make use of his eyes though there now might have been a decisive moment for observation no sound reached his ear from miss annalys voice but lady annaly spoke freely and decidedly in praise of colonel albemarle as she read the letter sir herbert after asking ormond three times whether he was not acquainted with general albemarle obtained for answer that he really did not know in truth ormond did not know any thing at that moment sir herbert surprised and imagining that ormond had not yet heard him was going to repeat his questionbut a look from his mother stopped him a sudden light struck lady annaly mothers are remarkably quicksighted upon these occasions there was a silence of a few minutes which appeared to poor ormond to be a silence that would never be broken it was broken by some slight observation which the brother and sister made to each other upon a paragraph in the newspaper which they were reading together ormond took breath she cannot love him or she could not be thinking of a paragraph in the newspaper at this moment from this time forward ormond was in a continual state of agitation reasoning as the passions reason as ill as possible upon even the slightest circumstances that occurred from whence he might draw favourable or unfavourable omens he was resolvedand that was prudentnot to speak of his own sentiments till he was clear how matters stood about colonel albemarle he was determined not to expose himself to the useless mortification of a refusal while in this agony of uncertainty he went out one morning to take a solitary walk that he might reflect at leisure just as he was turning from the avenue to the path that led to the wood a car full of morning visitors appeared ormond endeavoured to avoid them but not before he had been seen a servant rode after him to beg to know if he were mr harry ormondif he were one of the ladies on the car mrs mcrule sent her compliments to him and requested he would be so good as to let her speak with him at the house as she had a few words of consequence to say mrs mcrule ormond did not immediately recollect that he had the honour of knowing any such person till the servant said miss black sir that wasformerly at castle hermitage his old enemy miss black he recollected well he obeyed the ladys summons and returned to the house mrs mcrule had not altered in disposition though her objects had been changed by marriage having no longer lady oshanes quarrels with her husband to talk about she had become the pest of the village of castle hermitage and of the neighbourhoodthe lady bluemantle of the parish had miss black remained in england married or single she would only have been one of a numerous species too well known to need any description but transplanted to a new soil and a new situation she proved to be a variety of the old species with peculiarly noxious qualities which it may be useful to describe as a warning to the unwary it is unknown how much mischief the lady bluemantle class may do in ireland where parties in religion and politics run high and where it often happens that individuals of the different sects and parties actually hate without knowing each other watch without mixing with one another and consequently are prone reciprocally to believe any stories or reports however false or absurd which tend to gratify their antipathies in this situation it is scarcely possible to get the exact truth as to the words actions and intentions of the nearest neighbours who happen to be of opposite parties or persuasions what a fine field is here for a mischiefmaker mrs mcrule had in her parish done her part she had gone from rich to poor from poor to rich from catholic to protestant from churchman to dissenter and from dissenter to methodist reporting every idle story and repeating every illnatured thing that she heard saidthings often more bitterly expressed than thought and always exaggerated or distorted in the repetition no two people in the parish could have continued on speaking terms at the end of the year but that happily there were in this parish both a good clergyman and a good priest and still more happily they both agreed in labouring for the good of their parishioners dr cambray and mr mcormuck made it their business continually to follow after mrs mcrule healing the wounds which she inflicted and pouring into the festering heart the balm of christian charity they were beloved and revered by their parishioners mrs mcrule was soon detected and universally avoided enraged she attacked by turns both the clergyman and the priest and when she could not separate them she found out that it was very wrong that they should agree she discovered that she was a much better protestant and a much better christian than dr cambray because she hated her catholic neighbours dr cambray had taken pains to secure the cooperation of the catholic clergyman in all his attempts to improve the lower classes of the people his village school was open to catholics as well as protestants and father mcormuck having been assured that their religion would not be tampered with allowed and encouraged his flock to send their children to the same seminary mrs mcrule was or affected to be much alarmed and scandalized at seeing catholic and protestant children mixing so much together she knew that opinions were divided among some families in the neighbourhood upon the propriety of this mixture and mrs mcrule thought it a fine opportunity of making herself of consequence by stirring up the matter into a party question this bright idea had occurred to her just about the time that ormond brought over little tommy from the black islands during ormonds absence upon his tour sheelah and moriarty had regularly sent the boy to the village school exhorting him to mind his book and his figures that he might surprise mr ormond with his larning when he should come back tommy with this excitation and being a quick clever little fellow soon got to the head of his class and kept there and won all the schoolprizes and carried them home in triumph to his grandame and to his dear moriarty to be treasured up that he might show them to mr ormond at his return home dr cambray was pleased with the boy and so was every body except mrs mcrule she often visited the school for the pleasure of finding fault and she wondered to see this little tommy who was a catholic carrying away the prizes from all the others she thought it her duty to inquire farther about him and as soon as she discovered that he came from the black islands that he lived with moriarty and that mr ormond was interested about him she said she knew there was something wrongtherefore she set her face against the child and against the shameful partiality that some people showed dr cambray pursued his course without attending to her and little tommy pursued his course improving rapidly in his larning now there was in that county an excellent charitable institution for the education of children from seven to twelve years old an apprentice fee was given with the children when they left the school and they had several other advantages which made parents of the lower classes extremely desirous to get their sons into this establishment before they could be admitted it was necessary that they should have a certificate from their parish minister and catholic clergyman stating that they could read and write and that they were wellbehaved children on a certain day every year a number of candidates were presented the certificates from the clergyman and priest of their respective parishes were much attended to by the lady patronesses and by these the choice of the candidate to be admitted was usually decided little tommy had an excellent certificate both from father mcormuck and from dr cambray sheelah and moriarty were in great joy and had all the hopes in life for him and sheelah who was very fond of surprises had cautioned moriarty and begged the doctor not to tell mr harry a word about it till all was fixed for if the boy should not have the luck to be chose at last it would only be breaking his little heart the worse that mr harry should know any thing at all about it sure meantime mrs mcrule was working against little tommy with all her might some of the lady patronesses were of opinion that it would be expedient in future to confine their bounty to the children of protestants only mrs mcrule who had been deputed by one of the absent ladies to act for her was amazingly busy visiting all the patronesses and talking and fearing and hoping to heaven and prophesying canvassing and collecting opinions and votes as for a matter of life and death she hinted that she knew that the greatest interest was making to get in this year a catholic child and there was no knowing if this went on what the consequence might be in short ireland would be ruined if little tommy should prove the successful candidate mrs mcrule did not find it difficult to stir up the prejudices and passions of several ladies whose education and whose means of information might have secured them from such contemptible influence her present business at annaly was to try what impression she could make on lady and miss annaly who were both patronesses of the school as to ormond whom she never had liked she was glad of this opportunity of revenging herself upon his little protg and of making mr ormond sensible that she was now a person of rather more consequence than she had been when he used formerly to defy her at castle hermitage she little thought that while she was thus pursuing the dictates of her own hate she might serve the interests of ormonds love chapter xxiv when ormond returned in obedience to mrs mcrules summons he found in the room an unusual assemblage of personsa party of morning visitors the unmuffled contents of the car as he entered he bowed as courteously as possible to the whole circle and advanced towards mrs mcrule whose portentous visage he could not fail to recognize that visage was nearly half a yard long thin out of all proportion and dismal beyond all imagination the corners of the mouth drawn down the whites or yellows of the eyes upturned while with hands outspread she was declaiming and in a lamentable tone deploring as ormond thought some great public calamity for the concluding words were the danger my dear lady annalythe danger my dear miss annalyoh the danger is imminent we shall all be positively undone maam and irelandoh i wish i was once safe in england againireland positively will be ruined ormond looking to lady annaly and miss annaly for explanation was somewhat reassured in this imminent danger by seeing that lady annalys countenance was perfectly tranquil and that a slight smile played on the lips of florence mr ormond said lady annaly i am sorry to hear that ireland is in danger of being ruined by your means by my means said ormond in great surprise i beg your ladyships pardon for repeating your words but i really cannot understand them nor i neither but by the time you have lived as long as i have in the world said lady annaly you will not be so much surprised as you now seem my good sir at hearing people say what you do not understand i am told that ireland will be undone by means of a protg of yours of the name of tommy dunnot dun scotus dunshaughlin perhaps said ormond laughing tommy dunshaughlin that little urchin what harm can little tommy do to ireland or to any mortal without condescending to turn her eyes upon ormond whose propensity to laughter had of old been offensive to her nature mrs mcrule continued to lady annaly it is not of this insignificant child as an individual that i am speaking lady annaly but your ladyship who has lived so long in the world must know that there is no person or thing however insignificant that cannot in the hands of a certain description of people be made an engine of mischief very true indeed said lady annaly and there is no telling or conceiving pursued mrs mcrule how in the hands of a certain party you know maam any thing now even the least and the most innocent child not that i take upon me to say that this child is so very innocent though to be sure he is very littlebut innocent or not there is positively nothing lady annaly maam which a certain party certain evildisposed persons cannot turn to their purposes i cannot contradict thati wish i could said lady annaly but i see your ladyship and miss annaly do not consider this matter as seriously as i could wish tis an infatuation said mrs mcrule uttering a sigh almost a groan for her ladyships and her daughters infatuation but if people ladies especially knew but half as much as i have learnt since i married mr mcrule of the real state of ireland or if they had but half a quarter as many means as i have of obtaining information mr mcrule being one of his majestys very active justices of the peace riding about and up and down maam scouring the country sir you know and having informers high and low bringing us every sort of intelligence i say my dear lady annaly maam you would if you only heard a hundredth part of what i hear daily trembleyour ladyship would tremble from morning till night then i am heartily glad i do not hear it for i should dislike very much to tremble from morning till night especially as my trembling could do nobody any good but lady annaly maam you can do good by exerting yourself to prevent the danger in this emergency you can do good and it becomes your station and your character you can do good my dear lady annaly maam to thousands in existence and thousands yet unborn my benevolence having but a limited appetite for thousands said lady annaly i should rather if it be equal to you mrs mcrule begin with the thousands already in existence and of those thousands why not begin with little tommy it is no use cried mrs mcrule rising from her seat in the indignation of disappointed zeal jenny pull the bell for the carmrs mgreggor if youve no objection im at your service for tis no use i see for me to speak herenor should i have done so but that i positively thought it my duty and also a becoming attention to your ladyship and miss annaly as lady patronesses to let you know beforehand our sentiments as i have collected the opinions of so many of the leading ladies and apprehended your ladyship might before it came to a public push like to have an inkling or inuendo of how matters are likely to be carried at the general meeting of the patronesses on saturday next when we are determined to put it to the vote and poll jenny do you see jack and the car good morning to your ladyship good day miss annaly ormond put in a detainer i am here in obedience to your summons mrs mcruleyou sent to inform me that you had a few words of consequence to say to me true sir i did wrap myself up this winter morning and came out as mrs mgreggor can testify in spite of my poor face in hopes of doing some little good and giving a friendly hint before an explosion should publicly take place but you will excuse me since i find i gain so little credit and so waste my breath i can only leave gentlemen and ladies in this emergency if they will be blind to the danger at this crisis to follow their own opinions ormond still remonstrating on the cruelty of leaving him in utter darkness and calling it blindness and assuring mrs mcrule that he had not the slightest conception of what the danger or the emergency to which she alluded might be or what little tommy could have to do with it the lady condescended in compliance with mrs mgreggors twitch behind to stay and recommence her statement he could not forbear smiling even more than lady annaly had done when he was made to understand that the emergency and crisis meant nothing but this childs being admitted or not admitted into a charity school while ormond was incapable of speaking in reply with becoming seriousness florence who saw his condition had the kindness to draw off mrs mcrules attention by asking her to partake of some excellent goosepie which just then made its entrance this promised for a time to suspend the discussion and to unite all parties in one common sympathy when florence saw that the consomm to which she delicately helped her was not thrown away upon mrs mcrule and that the union of goose and turkey in this christmas dainty was much admired by this good lady she attempted playfully to pass to a reflection on the happy effect that might to some tastes result from unions in party matters but notoo serious matters these to be jested with even with a glass of barsac at the lips mrs mcrule stopped to say so and to sigh per favour of the barsac however florence ventured to try what a little raillery might do it was possible that if mrs mgreggor and the chorus of young ladies could be made to laugh mrs mcrule might be brought to see the whole thing in a less gloomy point of view and might perhaps be just in time made sensible of the ridicule to which she would expose herself by persisting in sounding so pompously a false alarm but can there really be so much danger said florence in letting little children protestant and catholic come together to the same schoolsit on the same benchlearn the same alphabet from the same hornbook oh my dear miss annaly cried mrs mcrule i do wonder to hear you treat this matter so lightlyyou from whom i confess i did expect better principles sit on the same bench easily said but my dear young lady you do not consider that some errors of poperysince there is no catholic in the room i suppose i may say itthe errors of popery are wonderfully infectious i remember said lady annaly when i was a child being present once when an honest man that is a protestant for in those days no man but a protestant could be called an honest man came to my uncle in a great passion to complain of the priest my lord said he what do you think the priest is going to do he is going to bury a catholic corpse not only in the churchyard but my lord near to the grave of my father who died a stanch dissenter my dear sir said my uncle to the angry honest man the clergyman of the parish is using me worse still for he is going to bury a man who died last wednesday of the smallpox near to my grandmother who never had the smallpox in her life mrs mcrule pursed up her mouth very close at this story she thought lady annaly and her uncle were equally wicked but she did not choose exactly to say so as her ladyships uncle was a person of rank and of character too solidly established for mrs mcrule to shake she therefore only gave one of her sighs for the sins of the whole generation and after a recording look at mrs mgreggor she returned to the charge about the schools and the children it can do no possible good she said to admit catholic children to our schools because do what you will you can never make them good protestants well said lady annaly as my friend the excellent bishop of said in parliament if you cannot make them good protestants make them good catholics make them good anythings giving up lady annaly all together mrs mcrule now desired to have mr ormonds ultimatumshe wished to know whether he had made up his mind as to the affair in question but she begged leave to observe that since the child had to use the gentlest expression the misfortune to be born and bred a catholic it would be most prudent and gentlemanlike in mr ormond not to make him a bone of contention but to withdraw the poor child from the contest altogether and strike his name out of the list of candidates till the general question of admittance to those of his persuasion should have been decided by the lady patronesses ormond declared with or without submission to mrs mcrule that he could not think it becoming or gentlemanlike to desert a child whom he had undertaken to befriendthat whatever the child had the misfortune to be born he would abide by him and would not add to his misfortunes by depriving him of the reward of his own industry and application and of the only chance he had of continuing his good education and of getting forward in life mrs mcrule sighed and groaned but ormond persisted the child he said should have fair playthe lady patronesses would decide as they thought proper it had been said that the boy had dr cambrays certificate which ormond was certain would not have been given undeservedly he had also the certificate of his own priest oh what signifies the certificate of his priest interrupted mrs mcrule and as for dr cambrays though he is a most respectable man too liberal perhaps yet without meaning to insinuate any thing derogatorybut we all know how things are managed and dr cambrays great regard for mr ormond might naturally influence him a little in favour of this little protg florence was very busy in replenishing mrs mgreggors plate and ormond haughtily told mrs mcrule that as to dr cambrays character for impartiality he should leave that securely to speak for itself and that as to the rest she was at liberty to say or hint whatever she pleased as far as he was concerned but that for her own sake he would recommend it to her to be sure of her factsfor that slander was apt to hurt in the recoil alarmed by the tone of confident innocence and determination with which ormond spoke mrs mcrule who like all other bullies was a coward lowered her voice and protested she meant nothingcertainly no offence to mr ormond and as to slander there was nothing she detested so muchshe was quite glad to be set rightfor people did talkand she had endeavoured to silence them and now could from the best authority ormond looked as if he wished that any authority could silence herbut no hopes of that she was sorry to find however that mr ormond was positively determined to encourage the boy whoever he was to persist as candidate on this occasion because she should be concerned to do any thing that looked like opposing him yet she must and she knew others were determined and in short he would be mortified to no purpose well ormond said he could only do his best and bear to be mortified if necessary or when necessary a smile of approbation from florence made his heart beat and for some moments mrs mcrule spoke without his knowing one syllable she said mrs mcrule saw the smile and perceived the effect as she rose to depart she turned to miss annaly and whispered but loud enough for all to hear miss annaly must excuse me if i warn her that if she takes the part i am inclined to fear she will on saturday people i know will draw inferences florence coloured but with calm dignity and spirit which mrs mcrule did not expect from her usual gentleness and softness of manners she replied that no inference which might be drawn from her conduct by any persons should prevent her from acting as she thought right and taking that part which she believed to be just so ended the visit or the visitation the next day lady annaly miss annaly sir herbert and ormond went to vicars dale and thence with the good doctor to the village school on purpose that they might see and form an impartial judgment of the little boy on one day in the week the parents and friends of the children were admitted if they chose it to the schoolroom to hear the lessons and to witness the adjudging of the weeks premiums this was prize day as they called it and sheelah and moriarty were among the spectators their presence and the presence of mr ormond so excitedso overexcited tommy that when he first stood up to read his face flushed his voice faltered his little hands trembled so much that he could hardly hold the book he could by no means turn over the leaf and he was upon the point of disgracing himself by bursting into tears oh ho cried an illnatured voice of triumph from one of the spectators ormond and the annalys turned and saw behind them mrs mcrule murder whispered sheelah to moriarty if she fixes him with that evil eye and he gets the stroke of it moriarty tis all over with him for life tut woman dearwhat can hurt him is not the good doctor in person standing betwixt him and harm and see he is recovering upon it fastquite come toharkhe is himself againtommy voice and allsuccess to him he had success and he deserved itthe prizes were his and when they were given to him the congratulating smiles of his companions showed that dr cambrays justice was unimpeached by those whom it most concerned that notwithstanding all that had been said and done directly and indirectly to counteract his benevolent efforts he had succeeded in preventing envy and partyspirit from spreading discord among these innocent children mrs mcrule withdrew and nobody saw when or how it is clear said lady annaly that this boy is no favourite for he has friends or if he be a favourite and have friends it is a proof that he has extraordinary merit said sir herbert he is coming to us said florence who had been excessively interested for the child and whose eyes had followed him wherever he went brother whispered she will you let him pass you he wants to say something to mr ormond the boy brought to ormond all the prizes which he had won since the time he first came to school his grandame sheelah had kept them safe in a little basket which he now put into ormonds hands with honest pride and pleasure i got em and granny said youd like to see them so she didand heres what will please yousee my certificatessee signed by the doctor himselfs own hand and father mcormuck thats his name with his blessing by the same token he gave me ormond looked with great satisfaction on tommys treasures and miss annaly looked at them too with no small delight well my boy have you any thing more to say said ormond to the child who looked as if he was anxious to say something more i have sir its what id be glad to speak a word with you mr harry speak it thenyou are not afraid of this lady oh nothat i am not said the boy with a very expressive smile and emphasis but as the child seemed to wish that no one else should hear ormond retired a step or two with him behind the crowd tommy would not let go miss annalys hand so she heard all that passed i am afeard i am too troublesome to you sir said the boy to menot the least said ormond speak onsay all you have in your mind why then said the child i have something greatly on my mind because i heard granny talking to moriarty about it last night over the fire and i in the bed then i know all about mrs mcrule and how if i dont give out and wouldnt give up about the grand school on saturday i should may be be bringing you mr harry into great trouble so that being the case ill give up entirelyand ill go back to the black islands tomorrow said tommy stoutly yet swelling so in the chest that he could not say another word he turned away as they were walking home together from the school moriarty said to sheelah ill engage sheelah you did not see all that passed the day ill engage i did though said sheelah why then sheelah youve quick eyes still oh im not so blind but what i could see that with half an eyeay and saw how it was with them before you did moriarty from the first minute they comed into the room together said i to myself theres a pair of angels well matched if ever there was a pair on earth these things is all laid out above unknownst to us from the first minute we are born who we are to have in marriage added sheelah no not fixed from the first minute we are born sheelah it is not said moriarty and how should you know moriarty said sheelah whether or not and why not as well as you sheelah dear replied moriarty if you go to that well in the name of fortune have it your own way said sheelah and how do you think it is then why it is partly fixed for us said moriarty but the choice is still in us always oh burn me if i understand that said sheelah then you are mighty hard of understanding this morning sheelah see now with regard to master harry and peggy sheridan its my opinion twas laid out from the first that in case he did not do that wrong about peggythen see heaven had this lady this angel from that time forward in view for him by way of compensation for not doing the wrong he might have chose to do now dont you think sheelah thats the way it wasbe a rasonable woman the rasonable woman was puzzled and silent sheelah and moriarty having got without knowing it to the dark depths of metaphysics there was some danger of their knocking their heads against each other there as wiser heads have done on similar occasions it was an auspicious circumstance for ormonds love that florence had now a daily object of thought and feeling in common with him mrs mcrules having piqued florence was in ormonds favour it awakened her pride and conquered her timidity she ventured to trust her own motives to be sure the interest she felt for this child was uncommonly vivid but she might safely avow this interestit was in the cause of one who was innocent and who had been oppressed as mrs mcrule was so vindictively busy going about daily among the lady patronesses preparing for the great battle that was to be decided on the famous saturday it was necessary that lady and miss annaly should exert themselves at least to make the truth known to their friends to take them to see dr cambrays school and to judge of the little candidate impartially the day for decision came and florence felt an anxiety an eagerness which made her infinitely more amiable and more interesting in ormonds eyes the election was decided in favour of humanity and justice florence was deputed to tell the decision to the successful little candidate who was waiting with his companions to hear his fate radiant with benevolent pleasure she went to announce the glad tidings oh if she is not beautiful cried sheelah clasping her hands ormond felt it so warmly and his looks expressed his feelings so strongly that florence suddenly abashed could scarcely finish her speech if mrs mcrule had been present she might again have cried oh ho but she had retreated too much discomfited by the disappointments of hatred to stay even to embarrass the progress of love love had made of late rapid progress joining in the cause of justice and humanity mixing with all the virtues he had taken possession of the heart happily safelyunconsciously at first yet triumphantly at last where was colonel albemarle all this time ormond neither knew nor cared he thought but little of him at this moment however said he to himself colonel albemarle will be here in a few daysit is better for me to see how things are there before i speaki am sure florence could not give me a decisive answer till her brother has disentangled that business for her lady annaly said as much to me the other day if i understood her rightlyand i am sure this is the state of the case from the pains florence takes now to avoid giving me an opportunity of speaking to her alone which i have been watching for so anxiously so reasoned ormond but his reasonings whether wise or foolish were set at nought by unforeseen events chapter xxv one evening ormond walked with sir herbert annaly to the seashore to look at the lighthouse which was building he was struck with all that had been done here in the course of a few months and especially with the alteration in the appearance of the people their countenances had changed from the look of desponding idleness and cunning to the air of busy hopeful independence he could not help congratulating sir herbert and warmly expressing a wish that he might himself in the whole course of his life do half as much good as sir herbert had already effected you will do a great deal more said sir herbert you will have a great deal more time i must make the best of the littleprobably the very little time i shall have while i yet live let me not live in vain yet live said ormond i hopei trustyou will live many years to be happy and to make others so your strength seems quite reestablishedyou have all the appearance of health sir herbert smiled but shook his head my dear ormond do not trust to outward appearances too much do not let my friends entirely deceive themselves i know that my life cannot be longi wish before i die to do as much good as i can the manner in which these words were said and the look with which they were accompanied impressed ormond at once with a conviction of the danger fortitude and magnanimity of the person who spoke to him the hectic colour the brilliant eye the vividness of fancy the superiority of intellectual powers the warmth of the affections and the amiable gentleness of the disposition of this young man were alas but so many fatal indications of his disease the energy with which with decreasing bodily and increasing mental strength he pursued his daily occupations and performed more than every duty of his station the neverfailing temper and spirits with which he sustained the hopes of many of his friends were but so many additional causes of alarm to the too experienced mother florence with less experience and with a temper happily prone to hope was more easily deceived she could not believe that a being whom she saw so full of life could be immediately in danger of dying her brother had now but a very slight coughhe had to all appearance recovered from the accident by which they had been so much alarmed when they were in england the physicians had pronounced that with care to avoid cold and all violent exertion he might do well and last long to fulfil the conditions was difficult especially that which required him to refrain from any great exertion whenever he could be of service to his friends or could do any good to his fellowcreatures he spared neither mental nor bodily exertion under the influence of benevolent enthusiasm he continually forgot the precarious tenure by which he held his life it was now the middle of winter and one stormy night a vessel was wrecked on the coast near annaly the house was at such a distance from that part of the shore where the vessel struck that sir herbert knew nothing of it till the next morning when it was all over no lives were lost it was a small trading vessel richly laden knowing the vile habits of some of the people who lived on the coast sir herbert the moment he heard that there was a wreck went down to see that the property of the sufferers was protected from those depredators who on such occasions were astonishingly alert ormond accompanied him and by their joint exertions much of the property was placed in safety under a military guard some had been seized and carried off before their arrival but not by any of sir herberts tenants it became pretty clear that the neighbours on sir ulick oshanes estate were the offenders they had grown bold from impunity and from the belief that no jantleman would choose to interfere with them on account of their landlord sir herberts indignation rose ormond pledged himself that sir ulick oshane would never protect such wretches and eager to assist public justice to defend his guardian and above all to calm sir herbert and prevent him from overexerting himself he insisted upon being allowed to go in his stead with the party of military who were to search the suspected houses it was with some difficulty that he prevailed he parted with sir herbert and struck at the moment with his highlyraised colour and the violent heat and state of excitation he was in ormond again urged him to remember his own health and his mother and sister i willi do said sir herbert but it is my duty to think of public justice before i think of myself the apprehension ormond felt in quitting sir herbert recurred frequently as he rode on in silence but he was called into action and it was dissipated ormond spent nearly three hours searching a number of wretched cabins from which the male inhabitants fled at the approach of the military leaving the women and children to make what excuses and tell what lies they could this the women and children executed with great readiness and ability and in the most pitymoving tones imaginable the inside of an irish cabin appears very different to those who come to claim hospitality and to those who come to detect offenders ormond having never before entered a cabin with a searchwarrant constable or with the military he was not up to the thingas both the serjeant and constable remarked to each other while he listened to the piteous story of a woman about a husband who had broken his leg from a ladder sarving the masons at sir herberts lighthouse and was lying at the hospital not expected footnote not expected to live the husband was lying all the time with both his legs safe and sound in a potato furrow within a few yards of the house and the child of another eloquent matron was running off with a pair of silvermounted pistols taken from the wreck which he was instructed to hide in a boghole snugthe bogwater never rusting in one hovelfor the houses of these wretches who lived by pillage after all their illgotten gains were no better than hovelsin one of them in which as the information stated some valuable plunder was concealed they found nothing but a poor woman groaning in bed and two little children one crying as if its heart would break and the other sitting up behind the mothers bolster supporting her after the soldiers had searched every place in vain even the thatch of the house the woman showing no concern all the while but groaning on seeming scarce able to answer mr ormonds questionsthe constable an old hand roughly bid her get up that they might search the bed this ormond would not permitshe lay still thanking his honour faintly and they quitted the house the goods which had been carried off were valuable and were hid in the straw of the very bed on which the woman was lying as they were returning homewards after their fruitless search when they had passed the boundary of sir ulicks and had reached sir herberts territory they were overtaken by a man who whispered something to the serjeant which made him halt and burst out a laughing the laugh ran through the whole serjeants guard and reached ormonds ears who asking the cause of it was told how the woman had cheated them and how she was now risen from her bed and was dividing the prize among the lawful owners share and share alike these lawful owners all risen out of the potato furrows and returning from the bogs were now assembled holding their bed of justice at the moment the serjeants information came off their captain with a bottle of whiskey in his hand was drinking to the health of sir ulick oshane our worthy landlordseldom comes a better the same to his ward harry ormond esq and may his eyesight never be better nor worse harry ormond instantly turned his horses head much provoked at having been duped and resolved that the plunderers should not now escape by the advice of serjeants and constables he dismounted that no sound of horses hoofs might give notice from a distance though indeed on the sands of the seashore no horses tread he thought could be heard he looked round for some one with whom he could leave his horse but not a creature except the men who were with him was in sight what can have become of all the people said ormond it is not the workmens dinnerhour and they are gone from the work at the lighthouse and the horses and cars are left without any one with them he went on a few paces and saw a boy who seemed to be left to watch the horses and who looked very melancholy the boy did not speak as ormond came up what is the matter said ormond something dreadful has happenedspeak did not you hear it sir said the boy id be loth to tell it you has any thing happened to sir herbertaythe worst that could running to stop one of them villains that was making off with something from the wreck he dropped sudden as if he was shot andwhen they went to lift him upbut youll drop yourself sir said the boy give him some of the water out of the bucket cant ye heres my cap said the serjeant ormond was made to swallow the water and recovering his senses heard one of the soldiers near him say twas only a faint sir herbert took ill engage the thought was new life to ormond he started up mounted his horse and galloped offsaw no creature on the roadfound a crowd at the gate of the avenuethe crowd opened to let him pass many voices calling as he passed to beg him to send out word this gave him fresh hopes since nothing certain was known he spurred on his horse but when he reached the house as he was going to sir herberts room he was met by sir herberts own man oreilly the moment he saw oreillys face he knew there was no hopehe asked no question the surgeon came out and told him that in consequence of having broke a bloodvessel which bled internally sir herbert had just expiredhis mother and sister were with him ormond retiredhe begged the servants would write to him at dr cambraysand he immediately went away two days after he had a note from oreilly written in haste at a very early hour in the morning to say that he was just setting out with the hearse to the family burialplace at herbertit having been thought best that the funeral should not be in this neighbourhood on account of the poor people at annaly being so exasperated against those who were thought to be the immediate occasion of his death sir herberts last orders to oreilly were to this effectto take care and to have every thing done as privately as possible no pomp of funeral was indeed necessary for such a person the great may need itthe good need it not they are mourned in the heart and they are remembered without vain pageantry if public sorrow can soothe private griefand surely in some measure it mustthe family and friends of this young man had this consolation but they had another and a better it is the triumph of religion and of its ministers to be able to support the human heart when all other resources are of little avail time it is true at length effaces the recollection of misfortune and age deadens the sense of sorrow but that power to console is surely far superior in its effect more worthy of a rational and a social being which operatesnot by contracting or benumbing our feelings and faculties but by expanding and ennobling theminspiring us not with stoic indifference to the pains and pleasures of humanity but with pious submission to the will of heavento the order and orderer of the universe chapter xxvi though sir ulick oshane contrived to laugh on most occasions where other people would have wept and though he had pretty well casehardened his heart yet he was shocked by the first news of the death of sir herbert annaly he knew the man must die he saidso must we all sooner or laterbut for the manner of his death sir ulick could not help feeling a secret pang he felt conscious of having encouraged or at least connived at the practices of those wretches who had roused the generous and just indignation of sir herbert and in pursuit of whom this fine young man had fallen a sacrifice not only the still small voice but the cry of the country was against sir ulick on this occasion he saw that he must give up the offenders and show decidedly that he desired to have them punished decidedly then and easily as ever prince abandoned secretary or chancellor to save his own popularity quickly as ever grand seignior gave up grand vizier or chief baker to appease the people sir ulick gave up his honest rascals his rare rapparees and even his wrecker royal sir ulick set his magistrate mr mcrule at work for once on the side both of justice and law warrants committals and constables cleared the land many fleda few were seized escorted ostentatiously by a serjeant and twelve of sir ulicks corps and lodged in the county jail to stand their trial bereft of all favour and purtection bon fide delivered up to justice a considerable tract of sir ulicks coast estate in consequence of this remained untenanted some person in whom he could confide must be selected to inhabit the fishinglodge and to take care of the cabins and land till they should be relet sir ulick pitched upon moriarty carroll for this purpose and promised him such liberal reward that all moriartys friends congratulated him upon his great luck in getting the appointment against the man too that mr marcus had proposed and favoured marcus who was jealous in the extreme of power and who made every trifle a matter of party competition was vexed at the preference given against an honest man and a friend of his own in favour of moriarty a catholic a fellow he had always disliked and a protege of mr ormond ormond though obliged to sir ulick for this kindness to moriarty was too intent on other things to think much about the matter when he should see florence annaly again seemed to him the only question in the universe of great importance just at this time arrived letters for mr ormond from paris from m and mad de connal very kind letters with pressing invitations to him to pay them a visit m de connal informed him that the five hundred pounds king cornys legacy was ready waiting his orders m de connal hoped to put it into mr ormonds hands in paris in his own hotel where he trusted that mr ormond would do him the pleasure of soon occupying the apartments which were preparing for him it did not clearly appear whether they had or had not heard of his accession of fortune doras letter was not from dorait was from mad de connal it was on green paper with a border of cupids and roses and store of sentimental devices in the corners the turn of every phrase the style as far as ormond could judge was quite frenchaiming evidently at being perfectly parisian yet it was a letter so flattering to the vanity of man as might well incline him to excuse the vanity of woman besides as sir ulick oshane observed after making due deductions for french sentiment there remains enough to satisfy an honest english heart that the lady really desires to see you ormond and that now in the midst of her parisian prosperity she has the grace to wish to show kindness to her fathers adopted son and to the companion and friend of her childhood sir ulick was of opinion that ormond could not do better than accept the invitation ormond was surprised for he well recollected the manner in which his guardian had formerly and not many months ago written and spoken of connal as a coxcomb and something worse that is true said sir ulick but that was when i was angry about your legacy which was of great consequence to us then though of none nowi certainly did suspect the man of a design to cheat you but it is clear that i was wrongi am ready candidly to acknowledge that i did him injustice your money is at your orderand i have nothing to say but to beg m de connal ten thousand french pardons observe i do not beg pardon for calling him a coxcomb for a coxcomb he certainly is an insufferable coxcomb cried ormond but a coxcomb in fashion said sir ulick and a coxcomb in fashion is a useful connexion he did not fable about versaillesi have made particular inquiries from our ambassador at paris and he writes me word that connal is often at courten bonne odeur at versailles the ambassador says he meets the connals every where in the first circleshow they came there i dont know i am glad to hear that for doras sake said ormond i always thought her a sweet pretty little creature said sir ulick and no doubt she has been polished up and dress and fashion make such a difference in a womani suppose she is now ten times betterthat is prettier she will introduce you at paris and your own meritthat is manners and figure and fortunewill make your way every where bythebye i do not see a word about poor mademoiselleoh yes here is a line squeezed in at the edgemille tendres souvenirs de la part de mdlle ofaley poor mademoiselle poor mademoiselle repeated sir ulick do you mean that thing half irish half french half mud half tinsel said ormond very good memory very sly harry but still in the irish half of her i dare say there is a heart and we must allow her the tinsel in pure gratitude for having taught you to speak french so wellthat will be a real advantage to you in paris whenever i go there sir said ormond coldly sir ulick was very much disappointed at perceiving that ormond had no mind to go to paris but dropping the subject he turned the conversation upon the annalys he praised florence to the skies hoped that ormond would be more fortunate than marcus had been for somehow or other he should never live or die in peace till florence annaly was more nearly connected with him he regretted however that poor sir herbert was carried off before he had completed the levying of those fines which would have cut off the entail and barred the heiratlaw from the herbert estates florence was not now the great heiress it was once expected she should be indeed she had but a moderate gentlewomans fortunenot even what at smithfield a man of ormonds fortune might expect but sir ulick knew he said that this would make no difference to his ward unless to make him in greater impatience to propose for her it was impossible to be in greater impatience to propose for her than ormond was sir ulick did not wonder at it but he thought that miss annaly would not could not listen to him yet time the comforter must come first and while time was doing this business love could not decently be admitted that was the reason said ulick returning by another road to the charge why i advised a trip to paris but you know best i cannot bear this suspensei must and will know my fatei will write instantly and obtain an answer do so and to save time i can tell what your fate and your answer will be from florence annaly assurance of perfect esteem and regard as far as friendship perhaps but she will tell you that she cannot think of love at present lady annaly prudent lady annaly will say that she hopes mr ormond will not think of settling for life till he has seen something more of the world well you dont believe me said sir ulick interrupting himself just at the moment when he saw that ormond began to think there was some sense in what he was saying if you dont believe me harry continued he consult your oracle dr cambray he has just returned from annaly and he can tell you how the land lies dr cambray agreed with sir ulick that both lady annaly and her daughter would desire that ormond should see more of the world before he settled for life but as to going off to paris without waiting to see or write to them dr cambray agreed with ormond that it would be the worst thing he could dothat so far from appearing a proof of his respect to their grief it would only seem a proof of indifference or a sign of impatience they would conclude that he was in haste to leave his friends in adversity to go to those in prosperity and to enjoy the gaiety and dissipation of paris dr cambray advised that he should remain quietly where he was and wait till miss annaly should be disposed to see him this was most prudent ormond allowed but then the delay to conquer by delay we must begin by conquering our impatience now that was what our hero could not possibly dotherefore he jumped hastily to this conclusion that in love affairs no man should follow any mortals opinion but his own accordingly he sat down and wrote to miss annaly a most passionate letter enclosed in a most dutiful one to lady annaly as full of respectful attachment and entire obedience as a soninlaw expectant could devisebeginning very properly and very sincerely with anxiety and hopes about her ladyships health and ending as properly and as sincerely with hopes that her ladyship would permit him as soon as possible to take from her the greatest the only remaining source of happiness she had in lifeher daughter having worded this very plausiblyfor he had now learned how to write a letterour hero despatched a servant of sir ulicks with his epistle ordering him to wait certainly for an answer but above all things to make haste back accordingly the man took a cross roada short cut and coming to a bridge which he did not know was broken down till he was close upon it he was obliged to return and to go round and did not get home till long after darkand the only answer he brought was that there was no answeronly lady annalys compliments ormond could scarcely believe that no answer had been sent but the man took all the saints in heaven or in the calendar to witness that he would not tell his honour or any jantleman a lie upon a crossexamination the man gave proof that he had actually seen both the ladies they were sitting so and so and dressed so and so in mourning farther he gave undeniable proof that he had delivered the letters and that they had been opened and read forby the same tokenhe was summoned up to my lady on account of one of mr ormonds letters he did not know which or to who being dated monday whereas it was wednesday and he had to clear himself of having been three days on the road ormond inordinately impatient could not rest a moment the next morning he set off at full speed for annaly determined to find out what was the matter arrived there a new footman came to the door with not at home sir ormond could have knocked him down but he contented himself with striking his own foreheadhowever in a genteel proper voice he desired to see sir herberts own man oreilly mr oreilly is not here sirabsent on business every thing was adverse ormond had one hope that this new fellow not knowing him might by mistake have included him in a general order against morning visitors my name is ormond sir yes sir and i beg you will let lady annaly and miss annaly know that mr ormond is come to pay his respects to them the man seemed very unwilling to carry any message to his ladies he was sure he said that the ladies would not see anybody was lady annaly ill her ladyship had been but poorly but was better within the last two days and miss annaly wonderful better too sir has got up her spirits greatly today i am very glad to hear it said ormond pray sir can you tell me whether a servant from mr ormond brought a letter here yesterday he did sir and was there any answer sent i really cant say sir be so good to take my name to your lady repeated ormond indeed sir i dont like to go in for i know my ladyboth my ladies is engaged very particularly engagedhowever if you very positively desire it sir ormond did very positively desire it and the footman obeyed while ormond was waiting impatiently for the answer his horse as impatient as himself would not stand still a groom who was sauntering about saw the uneasiness of the horse and observing that it was occasioned by a peacock who with spread tail was strutting in the sunshine he ran and chased the bird away ormond thanked the groom and threw him a luck token but not recollecting his face asked how long he had been at annaly i think you were not here when i was here last said ormond no sir said the man looking a little puzzled i never was here till the day before yesterday in my born days we bees from england we that is i and masterthat is master and i ormond grew pale but the groom saw nothing of ithis eyes had fixed upon ormonds horse a very fine horse this of yours sir for sartain if he could but stand sir hes main restless at a door my masters horse is just his match for that and pray who is your master sir said ormond in a voice which he forced to be calm my master sir is one colonel albemarle son of the famous general albemarle as lost his arm sir you might have heard talk of time back said the groom at this moment a windowblind was flapped aside and before the wind blew it back to its place again ormond saw florence annaly sitting on a sofa and a gentleman in regimentals kneeling at her feet bless my eyes cried the groom what made you let go his bridle sir only you sat him well sir he would ha thrown you that minutecurse the blind that flapped in his eyes the footman reappeared on the steps sir it is just as i saidi could not be let in mrs spencer my ladys woman says the ladies is engagedyou cant see them ormond had seen enough very well sir said hemr ormonds complimentshe called thats all ormond put spurs to his horse and galloped off and fast as he went he urged his horse still faster in the agony of disappointed love and jealousy he railed bitterly against the whole sex and against florence annaly in particular many were the rash vows he made that he would never think of her morethat he would tear her from his heartthat he would show her that he was no whining lover no easy dupe to be whiffled off and on the sport of a coquette a coquetteis it possible florence annalyyouand after all certain tender recollections obtruded but he repelled themhe would not allow one of them to mitigate his rage his naturally violent passion of anger now that it broke again from the control of his reason seemed the more ungovernable from the sense of past and the dread of future restraint so when a horse naturally violent and half trained to the curb takes fright or takes offence and starting throws his master away he gallops enraged the more by the falling bridle he rears plunges curvets and lashes out behind at broken girth or imaginary pursuer good heavens what is the matter with you my dear boywhat has happened cried sir ulick the moment he saw him for the disorder of ormonds mind appeared strongly in his face and gesturesstill more strongly in his words when he attempted to give an account of what had happened it was so broken so exclamatory that it was wonderful how sir ulick made out the plain fact sir ulick however well understood the shorthand language of the passions he listened with eager interesthe sympathized so fully with ormonds feelingsexpressed such astonishment such indignation that harry feeling him to be his warm friend loved him as heartily as in the days of his childhood sir ulick saw and seized the advantage he had almost despaired of accomplishing his purposenow was the critical instant harry ormond said he would you make florence annaly feel to the quickwould you make her repent in sackcloth and asheswould you make her pine for you ay till her very heart is sick would i to be sureshow me howonly show me how cried ormond look ye harry to have and to hold a womantrust me for i have had and held manyto have and to hold a woman you must first show her that you can if you will fling her from youay and leave her there set off for paris tomorrow morningmy life upon it the moment she hears you are gone she will wish you back again ill set off tonight said ormond ringing the bell to give orders to his servant to prepare immediately for his departure thus sir ulick seizing precisely the moment when ormonds mind was at the right heat aiming with dexterity and striking with force bent and moulded him to his purpose while preparations for ormonds journey were making sir ulick said that there was one thing he must insist upon his doing before he quitted castle hermitagehe must look over and settle his guardianship accounts ormond whose head was far from business at this moment was very reluctant he said that the accounts could wait till he should return from france but sir ulick observed that if he or if ormond were to die leaving the thing unsettled it would be loss of property to the one and loss of credit to the other ormond then begged that the accounts might be sent after him to paris he would look over them there at leisure and sign them no sir ulick said they ought to be signed by some forthcoming witness in this country he urged it so much and put it upon the footing of his own credit and honour in such a manner that ormond could not refuse he seized the papers and took a pen to sign them but sir ulick snatched the pen from his hand and absolutely insisted upon his first knowing what he was going to sign the whole account could have been looked over while we have been talking about it said sir ulick ormond sat down and looked it over examined all the vouchers saw that every thing was perfectly right and fair signed the accounts and esteemed sir ulick the more for having insisted upon showing and proving that all was exact sir ulick offered to manage his affairs for him while he was away particularly a large sum which ormond had in the english funds sir ulick had a banker and a broker in london on whom he could depend and he had from his place and connexions means of obtaining good information in public affairs he had made a great deal himself by speculations in the funds and he could buy in and sell out to great advantage he said for ormond but for this purpose a power of attorney was necessary to be given by ormond to sir ulick there was scarcely time to draw one up nor was sir ulick sure that there was a printed form in the house luckily however a proper power was found and filled up and ormond had just time to sign it before he stepped into the carriage he embraced his guardian and thanked him heartily for his care of the interests of his purse and still more for the sympathy he had shown in the interests of his heart sir ulick was moved at parting with him and this struck harry the more because he certainly struggled to suppress his feelings ormond stopped at vicars dale to tell dr cambray all that had happened to thank him and his family for their kindness and to take leave of them they were indeed astonished when he entered saying any commands my good friends for london or paris i am on my way therecarriage at the door at first they could not believe him to be serious but when they heard his story and saw by the agitation of his manner that he was in earnest they were still more surprised at the suddenness of his determination they all believed and represented to him that there must be some mistake and that he was not cool enough to judge sanely at this moment dr cambray observed that miss annaly could not prevent any man from kneeling to her ormond haughtily said he did not know what she could prevent he only knew what she did she had not vouchsafed an answer to his lettershe had not admitted him these he thought were sufficient indications that the person at her feet was accepted whether he were or not ormond would inquire no further she might now accept or refuse as she pleasedhe would go to paris his friends had nothing more to say or to do but to sigh and to wish him a good journey and much pleasure at paris ormond now requested that dr cambray would have the goodness to write to him from time to time to inform him of whatever he might wish to know during his absence he was much mortified to hear from the doctor that he was obliged to proceed with his family for some months to a distant part of the north of england and that as to the annalys they were immediately removing to the seacoast of devonshire for the benefit of a mild climate and of seabathing ormond therefore had no resource but in his guardian sir ulicks affairs however were to take him over to london from whence ormond could not expect much satisfactory intelligence with respect to ireland ormond flew to dublin crossed the channel in an express boat travelled night and day in the mail to london from thence to dovercrossed the water in a storm and travelled with the utmost expedition to paris though there was no one reason why he should be in haste and for so much his travelling was as little profitable or amusing as possible he saw heard and understood nothing till he reached paris it has been said that the traveller without sensibility may travel from dan to beersheba without finding any thing worth seeing the traveller who has too much sensibility often observes as littleof this all persons must be sensible who have ever travelled when their minds were engrossed with painful feelings or possessed by any strong passion chapter xxvii ormond had written to m and madame de connal to announce his intentions of spending some time in paris and to thank them for the invitation to their house an invitation which however he declined accepting but he requested m de connal to secure apartments for him in some hotel near them upon his arrival he found every thing prepared for a milord anglois handsome apartments fashionable carriage wellpowdered laquais and a valetdechambre waited the orders of monsieur connal was with him a few minutes after his arrivalwelcomed him to paris with cordial gaietywas more glad and more sorry and said more in five minutes and above all made more protestations of regard than an englishman would make in a year he was rejoiceddelightedenchanted to see mr ormond madame de connal was absolutely transported with joy when she heard he was on his road to paris madame was now at versailles but she would return in a few days she would be in despair at mr ormonds not accepting the apartments in the hotel de connal which were actually prepared for him but in fact it was nearly the same thing within two doors of them he hoped mr ormond liked his apartmentsbut in truth that was of little consequence for he would never be in them except when he was asleep or dressing ormond thought the apartments quite superb and was going to have thanked m de connal for the trouble he had taken but at the word superbe connal ran on again with french vivacity of imagination certainly mr ormond ought he said to have every thing now in the first style he congratulated our hero on his accession of fortune of which madame de connal and he had heard with inexpressible joy and mdlle ofaley too she who had always prophesied that they should meet in happiness at paris was now absolutely in ecstasy you have no idea in short my dear ormond of what a strong impression you left on all our mindsno conception of the lively interest you always inspired it was a lively interest which had slumbered quietly for a considerable time but now it wakened with perfectly good grace ormond set little value on these sudden protestations and his pride felt a sort of fear that it should be supposed he was deceived by them yet altogether the manner was agreeable and connal was essentially useful at this moment as sir ulick had justly observed a coxcomb in fashion may in certain circumstances be a useful friend but my dear fellow cried connal what savage cut your hair lastit is a sin to trust your fine head to the barbariansmy hairdresser shall be with you in the twinkling of an eye i will send my tailorallow me to choose your embroidery and see your lace before you decidei am said to have a tolerable tastethe ladies say so and they are always the best judges the french dress will become you prodigiously i foreseebut just heavenwhat bucklesthose must have been made before the flood no disparagement to your taste but what could you do better in the black islands paris is the only place for bijouterieexcept in steel paris surpasses the universeyour eyes will be dazzled by the palais royal but this hatyou know it cant appearit would destroy you my chapelier shall be with you instantly it will all be done in five minutesyou have no idea of the celerity with which you may command every thing at paris but i am so sorry that madame is at versailles and that i am under a necessity of being there myself tomorrow for the rest of this week but i have a friend a little abb who will be delighted in the mean time to show you paris from the moment of his arrival at paris ormond resolved to put florence annaly completely out of his thoughts and to drown in gaiety and dissipation the too painful recollection of her duplicity towards him he was glad to have a few days to look about him and to see something of paris he should like as he told m de connal to go to the play to accustom himself to the language he must wear off his english or irish awkwardness a little before he should be presented to madame de connal or appear in french society a profusion of compliments followed from m de connal but ormond persisting it was settled that he should go incog this night to the thtre franois connal called upon him in the evening and took him to the theatre they were in une petite loge where they could see without being seen in the box with them was the young abb and a pretty little french actress mdlle adrienne at the first coupdoeil the french ladies did not strike him as handsome they looked as he said like dolls all eyes and rouge and rouge as he thought very unbecomingly put on in one frightful red patch or plaster high upon the cheek without any pretence to the imitation of natural colour eh fi donc said the abb what you call the natural colour that would be rouge coquette which no woman of quality can permit herself no dieu merci said the actress that is for us tis very fair we should have some advantages in the competition they have so manyby birthif not by nature m de connal explained to ormond that the frightful red patch which offended his eye was the mark of a woman of quality women only of a certain rank have the privilege of wearing their rouge in that manneryour eye will soon grow accustomed to it and you will like it as a sign of rank and fashion the actress shrugged her shoulders said something about la belle nature and the good taste of monsieur langlois the moment the curtain drew up she told him the names of all the actors and actresses as they appearednoting the value and celebrity of each the play was unfortunately for ormond a tragedy and le kain was at versailles ormond thought he understood french pretty well but he did not comprehend what was going on the french tone of tragic declamation so unnatural to his ear distracted his attention so much that he could not make out the sense of what any of the actors said tis like the quality rouge said connal your taste must be formed to it but your eye and your ear will accommodate themselves to both you will like it in a month m de connal said this was always the first feeling of foreigners but have patience said he go on listening and in a night or two perhaps in an hour or two the sense will break in upon you all at once you will never find yourself at a loss in society talk at all events whether you speak ill or well talk dont aim at correctnesswe dont expect it besides as they will tell you we like to see how a stranger play with our language m de connals manner was infinitely more agreeable toward ormond now than in former days there was perhaps still at the bottom of his mind the same fund of selfconceit but he did not take the same arrogant tone it was the tone not of a superior to an inferior but of a friend in a new society and a country to which he is a stranger there was as little of the protector in his manner as possible considering his natural presumption and acquired habits considering that he had made his own way in paris and that he thought that to be the first man in a certain circle there was to be nearly the first man in the universe the next morning the little abb called to pay his compliments and to offer his services m de connal being obliged to go to versailles in his absence the abb would be very happy he said to attend mr ormond and to show him paris he believed he humbly said that he had the means of showing him every thing that was worth his attention away they drove gare gare cried the coachman chasing away the droves of walkers before him there being no footpaths in the streets of paris they were continually driven up close to the walls ormond at first shrunk at the sight of their peril and narrow escapes monsieur apparemment is nervous after his voyage said the abb no but i am afraid the people will be run over i will make the coachman drive more quietly du toutnot at all said the little abb who was of a noble family and had all the airs of it leave him to settle it with the peoplethey are used to it and after all what have they to think of but to take care of themselvesla canaille la canaille synonymous with the swinish multitude an expression of contempt for which the parisian nobility have since paid terribly dear ormond who was not used to it found it difficult to abstract his sympathy from his fellowcreatures by whatever name they were called and he could not exclusively command his attention to admire the houses and churches which his abb continually pointed out to his notice he admired however the fine faade of the louvre the place de louis xv the astonishingly brilliant spectacle of the palais royal notre dame a few handsome bridges and the drives on the boulevards but in fact there was at that time much more to be heard and less to be seen than at present in paris paris was not then as fine a city as it now is ormond in his secret soul preferred the bay of dublin to all he then saw on the banks of the seine the little abb was not satisfied with the paucity of his exclamations and would have given him up as un froid anglois but that fortunately our young hero had each night an opportunity of redeeming his credit they went to the playhe saw french comedyhe saw and heard molet and madame de la ruette the abb was charmed with his delight his enthusiasm his genuine enjoyment of high comedy and his quick feeling of dramatic excellence it was indeed perfectionbeyond any thing of which ormond could have formed an idea every part well performednothing to break the illusion this first fit of dramatic enthusiasm was the third day at its height when connal returned from versailles and it was so strong upon him and he was so full of molet and madame de la ruette that he could scarcely listen to what connal said of versailles the kings supper and madame la dauphine no doubthe should like to see all thatbut at all events he was positively determined to see molet and madame de la ruette every night they acted connal smiled and only answered of course he would do as he pleased but in the mean time it was now madame de connals night for seeing company and he was to make his debut in a french assembly connal called for him early that they might have a few minutes to themselves before the company should arrive ormond felt some curiosity a little anxiety a slight flutter at the heart at the thought of seeing dora again the arrival of her husband interrupted these thoughts connal took the light from the hands of crepin the valet and reviewed ormond from head to foot very well crepin you have done your part and nature has done hers for monsieur yes truly said crepin nature has done wonders for monsieur and monsieur now he is dressed has really all the air of a frenchman quite lair comme il faut lair noble added connal and he agreed with crepin in opinion that french dress made an astonishing difference in mr ormond madame de connal i am sure will think so continued connal will see it with admirationfor she really has good taste i will pledge myself for your success with that figure with that air you will turn many heads in parisif you will but talk enough say every thing that comes into your headdont be like an englishman always thinking about the sensethe more nonsense the bettertrust melivrezvouslet yourself outfollow me and fear nothing cried he running down stairs delighted with ormond and with himself he foresaw that he should gain credit by producing such a man he really wished that ormond should succeed in french society and that he should pass his time agreeably in paris no man could feel better disposed towards another even if he should take a fancy to madame it was to the polite french husband a matter of indifference except so far as the arrangement might or might not interfere with his own views and these viewswhat were theyonly to win all the young mans fortune at play a cela prsexcepting this he was sincerely ormonds friend ready to do every thing possiblede faire limpossibleto oblige and entertain him connal enjoyed ormonds surprise at the magnificence of his hotel after ascending a spacious staircase and passing through antechamber after antechamber they reached the splendid salon blazing with lights reflected on all sides in mirrors that reached from the painted ceiling to the inlaid floor not a creature here yethappily madame begs said the servant that monsieur will pass on into the boudoir any body with madame no one but madame de clairville only lamie intime said connal the bosom friend how will dora feelhow will it be with us both thought ormond as he followed the light step of the husband entrezentrez toujours ormond stopped at the threshold absolutely dazzled by the brilliancy of doras beauty her face her figure her air so infinitely improved so fashioned doraah madame de connal cried ormond no french actor could have done it better than nature did it for him dora gave one glance at ormondpleasure joy sparkled in her eyes then leaning on the lady who stood beside her almost sinking dora sighed and exclaimed ah harry ormond the husband vanished ah ciel said lamie intime looking towards ormond help me to support her monsieurwhile i seek de leau de cologne ormond seized with sudden tremor could scarcely advance dora sunk on the sofa clasping her beautiful hands and exclaiming the companion of my earliest days then ormond excused to himself sprang forwardfriend of my childhood cried he yes my sister your father promised me this friendshipthis happiness said he supporting her as she raised herself from the sofa o estil o estilwhere is he monsieur ormond cried mademoiselle throwing open the door ah ciel comme il est beau a perfect frenchman already and how much embellished by dressah paris for that did i not prophesydora my darling do me the justicebutcomme vous voil saisieheres lamie with leau de cologne ah my child recover yourself for here is some onethe comte de jarillac it is entering the salon the promptitude of doras recovery was a new surprise to our hero follow me said she to him and with parisian ease and grace she glided into the salon to receive m de jarillacpresented ormond to m le comteangloisirlandoisan english an irish gentlemanthe companion of her childhood with the slightest lightest tone of sentiment imaginable and another count and another came and a baron and a marquis and a duke and madame la comtesse de and madame la duchesse and all were received with ease respect vivacity or sentiment as the occasion requirednow advancing a step or two to mark empressement where requisiteregaining always imperceptibly the most advantageous situation and attitude for herselfpresenting ormond to every onequite intent upon him yet appearing entirely occupied with every body else and in short never forgetting them him or herself for an instant can this be dora thought ormond in admiration yet in astonishment that divided his feelings it was indeed wonderful to see how quickly how completely the irish country girl had been metamorphosed into a french woman of fashion and now surrounded by admirers by adorers in embroidery and blazing with crosses and stars she received les hommagesenjoyed le succsaccepted the incense without bending too low or holding herself too highnot too sober nor too obviously intoxicated vanity in all her heart yet vanity not quite turning her head not more than was agreeable and becomingextending her smiles to all and hoping all the time that harry ormond envied each charmed with himfor her early passion for him had revived in an instantthe first sight of his figure and air the first glance in the boudoir had been sufficient she knew too how well he would succeed at parishow many rivals she would have in a week these perceptions sensations and conclusions requiring so much time in slow words to express had darted through doras head in one instant had exalted her imagination and touched her heartas much as that heart could be touched ormond meantime breathed more freely and recovered from his tremors madame de connal surrounded by adorers and shining in the salon was not so dangerous as dora half fainting in the boudoir nor had any words that wit or sentiment could devise power to please or touch him so much as the harry ormond which had burst naturally from doras lips now he began almost to doubt whether nature or art prevailed now he felt himself safe at least since he saw that it was only the coquette of the black islands transformed into the coquette of the hotel de connal the transformation was curious was admirable ormond thought he could admire without danger and in due time perhaps gallant with the best of them without feelingwithout scruple the tables were now arranging for play the conversation he heard every where round him related to the good or bad fortune of the preceding nights ormond perceived that it was the custom of the house to play every evening and the expressions that reached him about bets and debts confirmed the hint which his guardian had given him that connal played high at present however he did not seem to have any design upon ormondhe was engaged at the further end of the room he left him quite to himself and to madame and never once even asked him to play there seemed more danger of his being left out than of his being taken in donnezmoi le brascome with me monsieur ormond said mademoiselle and you shall lose nothingwhile they are settling about their parties we can get one little moments chat she took him back to the boudoir i want to make you know our paris said she here we can see the whole world pass in review and i shall tell you every thing most necessary for you to know for examplewho is whoand still more it imports you to know who and who are together look at that lady beautiful as the day in diamonds madame de connal do you mean said ormond ah no not her always said mademoiselle though she has the apple here without contradiction continued mademoiselle still speaking in english which it was always her pride to speak to whomsoever could understand her absolutely without vanity though my niece i may say it she is a perfect creatureand mise ravirdid you ever see such a change for the best in one season ah parisdid i not tell you welland you felt it well yourselfyou lost your head i saw that at first sight of her la franoisethe best proof of your taste and sensibilitshe has infinite sensibility toointeresting and at the height what you english call the tiptop of the fashion here so it appears indeed said ormond by the crowd of admirers i see round madame de connal admirers yes adorers you may sayencore if you added lovers you would not be much wrong dying for loveperdument pris see there he who is bowing nowmonsieur le marquis de beaulieuhomme de courplein desprithomme marquantvery remarkable man butah voil que entreof the court did you ever see finer entre made by man into a room so full of grace ah le comte de belle chassehow many women already he has lostit is a real triumph to madame de connal to have him in her chains what a smilecest lui qui est aimable pour nous autresdune soumission pour les femmesdune fiert pour les hommes as the lamb gentle for the pretty woman as the lion terrible for the man it is that comte de belle chasse who is absolutely irresistible absolutely irresistible ormond repeated smiling not absolutely i hope oh that is understoodyou do not doubt la sagesse de madamebesides heureusement there is an infinite safety for her in the number as you see of her adorers wait till i name them to youi shall give you a catalogue raisonne with rapid enunciation mademoiselle went through the names and rank of the circle of adorers noting with complacency the number of ladies to whom each man of gallantry was supposed to have paid his addressesnext to being of the blood royal this appearing to be of the highest distinction and propos monsieur dormond you yourself when do you count to go to versaillesahwhen you shall see the king and the kings supper and madame la dauphine ah mademoiselle was recalled from the ecstasy in which she had thrown up her eyes to heaven by some gentleman speaking to her as he passed the open door of the boudoir arm in arm with a ladymademoiselle answered with a profound inclination of the head whispering to ormond after they had passed m le due de c with madame de la tour why he is constant always to that woman heaven knows better than me stand if you are so good monsieur a little more this way and give your attentionthey dont want you yet at play then designating every person at the different cardtables she said that lady is the wife of m and there is m le baron de l her lover the gentleman who looks over her cardsand that other lady with the joli pompon she is intimate with m de la tour the husband of the lady who passed with m le duc mademoiselle explained all these arrangements with the most perfect sang froid as things of course that every body knew and spoke of except just before the husbands but there was no mystery no concealment what useto what good ormond asked whether there were any ladies in the room who were supposed to be faithful to their husbands ehma nice par exemple madame de connal i may cite as a woman of la plus belle rputation sans tchewhat you call unblemish assuredly said ormond you could not i hope think me so indiscreeti believe i said ladies in the plural number ah oui assuredly and i can name you twenty to begin there do you see that woman standing up who has the air as if she think of nothing at all and nobody thinking of her with only her husband near her cet grand homme blmethere is madame de la roussedune rputation intactefrightfully dressed as she is always but hold you see that pretty little comtesse de la brie all in whitecharmante i give her to you as a reputation against which slander cannot breathenouvelle mariebridein what you call de honeymoon but we dont know that in frenchno matter again since you are curious in these things there is another reputation without spot madame de st ange i warrant her to youbien froide cellel cold as any englishmarried a full year and still her choice to make allonsthere is three i give you already without counting my niece and wait i will find you yet another said mademoiselle looking carefully through the crowd she was relieved from her difficulty by the entrance of the little abb who came to summon monsieur to madame de connal who did him the honour to invite him to the table ormond played and fortune smiled upon him as she usually does upon a new votary and beauty smiled upon him perhaps on the same principle connal never came near him till supper was announced then only to desire him to give his arm to a charming little countessla nouvelle mariemadame de connal belonging by right of rank to monsieur le comte de belle chasse the supper was one of the delightful petit soupers for which paris was famous at that day and which she will never see again the moralist who considers the essential interests of morality more than the immediate pleasures of society will think this rather a matter of rejoicing than regret how far such society and correct female conduct be compatible is a question which it might take too long a time to decide therefore be it sufficient here to say that ormond without staying to examine it was charmed with the present effect with the gaiety the wit the politeness the ease and altogether with that indescribable thing that untranslatable esprit de socit he could not afterwards remember any thing very striking or very solid that had been said but all was agreeable at the moment and there was great variety ormonds selflove was he knew not how flattered without effort it seemed to be the object of every body to make paris agreeable to him and they convinced him that he would find it the most charming place in the worldwithout any disparagement to his own country to which all solid honours and advantages were left undisputed the ladies whom he had thought so little captivating at first view at the theatre were all charming on farther acquaintance so full of vivacity and something so flattering in their manner that it put a stranger at once at his ease towards the end of the supper he found himself talking to two very pretty women at once with good effect and thinking at the same time of dora and the comte de belle chasse moreover he thought he saw that dora was doing the same between the irresistible comte and the marquis plein desprit from whom while she was listening and talking without intermission her eyes occasionally strayed and once or twice met those of ormond is it indiscreet to ask you whether you passed your evening agreeably said m de connal when the company had retired delightfully said ormond the most agreeable evening i ever passed in my life then fearing that he had spoken with too much enthusiasm and that the husband might observe that his eyes as he spoke involuntarily turned towards madame de connal he moderated he might have saved himself the trouble he moderated his expression by adding that as far as he could yet judge he thought french society very agreeable you have seen nothing yetyou are right not to judge hastily said connal but so far i am glad you are tolerably well satisfied ah oui monsieur ormond cried mademoiselle joining them we shall fix you at paris i expect you hope i suppose you mean my dear aunt said dora with such flattering hope in her voice and in the expression of her countenance that ormond decided that he certainly intended to spend the winter at paris connal satisfied with this certainty would have let ormond go but mademoiselle had many compliments to make him and herself upon his pronunciation and his fluency in speaking the french languagereally like a frenchman himselfthe marquis de beaulieu had said to her she was sure m dormond could not fail to succeed in paris with that perfection added to all his other advantages it was the greatest of all the advantages in the worldthe greatest advantage in the universe she was going on to say but m de connal finished the flattery better you would pity us ormond cried he interrupting mademoiselle if you could see and hear the vandals they send to us from england with letters of introductionbarbarians who can neither sit stand nor speaknor even articulate the language how many of these butors rich of good family i have been sometimes called upon to introduce into society and to present at court upon my honour it has happened to me to wish they might hang themselves out of my way or be found dead in their beds the day i was to take them to versailles it is really too great a tax upon the goodbreeding of the lady of the house said madame de connal deplorable when she has nothing better to say of an english guest than that ce monsieur l a un grand talent pour le silence ormond conscious that he had talked away at a great rate was pleased by this indirect compliment but such personnages muts never really see french society they never obtain more than a suppernot a petit souperno no an invitation to a great assembly where they see nothing milord anglois is lost in the crowd or stuck across a doorway by his own sword now what could any letter of recommendation do for such a fellow as that the letters of recommendation which are of most advantage said madame de connal are those which are written in the countenance ormond had presence of mind enough not to bow though the compliment was directed distinctly to hima look of thanks he knew was sufficient as he retired mademoiselle pursuing him to the door begged that he would come as early as he could next morning that she might introduce him to her apartments and explain to him all the superior conveniences of a french house m de connal representing however that the next day mr ormond was to go to versailles mademoiselle acknowledged that was an affair to which all others must yield well flattered by all the trio and still more perhaps by his own vanity our young hero was at last suffered to depart the first appearance at versailles was a matter of great consequence courtdress was then an affair of as much importance at paris as it seems to be now in london if we may judge by the columns of birthday dresses and the honourable notice of gentlemens coats and waistcoats it was then at paris however as it is now and ever will be all over the world essential to the appearance of a gentleman that whatever time pains or expense it might have cost he should from the moment he is dressed be or at least seem to be above his dress in this as in most cases the shortest and safest way to seem is to be our young hero being free from personal conceit or overweening anxiety about his appearance looked at ease he called at the hotel de connal the day he was to go to versailles and mademoiselle was in ecstasy at the sight of his dress exclaiming superbemagnifique m de connal seemed more struck with his air than his dress and dora perhaps was more pleased with his figure she was silent but it was a silence that spoke her husband heeded not what it said but pursuing his own course observed that to borrow the expression of crepin the valetdechambre no contemptible judge in these cases m ormond looked not only as if he was n coiff but as if he had been born with a sword by his side really my dear friend continued m de connal you look as if you had come at once full dressed into the world which in our days is better than coming ready armed out of the head of jupiter mdlle ofaley now seizing upon ormond whom she called her pupil carried him off to show him her apartments and the whole house which she did with many useful notespointing out the convenience and entire liberty that result from the complete separation of the apartments of the husband and wife in french houses you see monsieur et madame with their own staircases their own passages their own doors in and out and all separate for the people of monsieur and the women of madame and here through this little door you go into the apartments of madame ormonds english foot stopped respectfully eh entrez toujours said mademoiselle as the husband had said before at the door of the boudoir but madame de connal is dressing perhaps said ormond et puisand what then you must get rid as fast as you can of your english prjugsand she is not here neither said mademoiselle opening the door madame de connal was in an inner apartment and ormond the instant after he entered this room with mademoiselle heard a quick step which he knew was doras running to bolt the door of the inner roomhe was glad that she had not quite got rid of her english prejudices mdlle ofaley pointed out to him all the accommodations of a french apartment she had not at this moment the slightest malice or bad intention in any thing she was sayingshe simply spoke in all the innocence of a frenchwomanif that term be intelligible if she had any secret motive it was merely the vanity of showing that she was quite parisienne and there again she was mistaken for having lived half her life out of paris she had forgotten if she ever had it the tone of good society and upon her return had overdone the matter exaggerated french manners to prove to her niece that she knew les usages les convenances les nuancesenfin la mode de paris a more dangerous guide in paris for a young married woman in every respect could scarcely be found m de connals valet now came to let mr ormond know that monsieur waited his orders but for this interruption he was in a fair way to hear all the private history of the family all the secrets that mademoiselle knew of the amazing communicativeness of frenchwomen on all subjects our young hero had as yet no conception chapter xxviii it was during the latter years of the life of louis the fifteenth and during the reign of madame du barry that ormond was at paris the court of versailles was at this time in all its splendour if not in all its glory at the souper du roi ormond beheld in all the magnificence of dress and jewels the nobility wealth fashion and beauty of france well might the brilliancy dazzle the eyes of a youth fresh from ireland when it amazed even old ambassadors accustomed to the ordinary grandeur of courts when he recovered from his first astonishment when his eyes were a little better used to the light and he looked round and considered all these magnificently decorated personages assembled for the purpose of standing at a certain distance to see one man eat his supper it did appear to him an extraordinary spectacle and the very great solemnity and devotion of the assistants so unsuited to the french countenance inclined him to smile it was well for him however that he kept his irish risible muscles in order and that no courtier could guess his thoughtsa smile would have lost him his reputation nothing in the world appeared to frenchmen formerly of more importance than their court etiquette though there were some who began about this time to suspect that the court order of things might not be coexistent with the order of naturethough there were some philosophers and statesmen who began to be aware that the daily routine of the courtiers etiquette was not as necessary as the motions of the sun moon and planets nor could it have been possible to convince half at least of the crowd who assisted at the kings supper this night that all the french national eagerness about the health the looks the words of le roi all the attachment le dvouement professed habituallyperhaps felt habituallyfor the reigning monarch whoever or whatever he might be by whatever namenotre bon roi or simply notre roi de franceshould in a few years pass away and be no more seen ormond had no concern with the affairs of the nation nor with the future fate of any thing he beheld he was only a spectator a foreigner and his business was according to mademoiselles maxim to enjoy today and to reflect tomorrow his enjoyment of this day was complete he not only admired but was admired in the vast crowd he was distinguished some nobleman of note asked who he wasanother observed lair nobleanother exclaimed le bel anglois and his fortune was made at paris especially as a friend of madame du barrys asked where he bought his embroidery he went afterwards at least in connals society by the name of le bel anglois half in a tone of raillery yet with a look that showed she felt it to be just madame de connal first adopted the appellation and then changed the term to mon bel irlandois invitations upon invitations poured upon ormondall were eager to have him at their partieshe was every whereattending madame de connaland she how proud to be attended by ormond he dreaded lest his principles should not withstand the strong temptation he could not leave her but he determined to see her only in crowds accordingly he avoided every select party lamie intime could never for the first three weeks get him to one petit comit though madame de connal assured him that her friends petit soupers were charming worth all the crowded assemblies in paris still he pursued his plan and sought for safety in a course of dissipation i give you joy said connal to him one day you are fairly launched you are no distressed vessel to be taken in tow nor a petty bark to sail in any mans wake you have a gale and are likely to have a triumph of your own connal was upon all occasions careful to impress upon ormonds mind that he left him wholly to himself for he was aware that in former days he had offended his independent spirit by airs of protection he managed better nowhe never even invited him to play though it was his main object to draw him to his farotable he made use of some of his friends or confederates who played for him connal occasionally coming to the table as an unconcerned spectator ormond played with so much freedom and seemed to have so gentlemanlike an indifference whether he lost or won that he was considered as an easy dupe time only was necessary m de connal thought to lead him on gradually and without alarm to let him warm to the passion for play meanwhile madame de connal felt as fully persuaded that ormonds passion for her would increase it was her object to fix him at paris but she should be content perfectly happy with his friendship his society his sentiments her own sentiment for him as she confessed to madame de clairville was absolutely invincible but it should never lead her beyond the bounds of virtue it was involuntary but it should never be a crime madame de clairville who understood her business and spoke with all the fashionable cant of sensibility asked how it was possible that an involuntary sentiment could ever be a crime as certainly as the novice among a band of sharpers is taught by the technical language of the gang to conquer his horror of crime so certainly does the cant of sentiment operate upon the female novice and vanquish her fear of shame and moral horror of vice the allusion is coarseso much the better strength not elegance is necessary on some occasions to make an impression the truth will strike the good sense and good feelings of our countrywomen and unadorned they will prefer it to german or french sophistry by such sophistry however was dora insensibly led on but ormond did not yet advance in learning the language of sentimenthe was amusing himself in the worldand dora imagined that the dissipation in which he lived prevented him from having time to think of his passion she began to hate the dissipation connal one day when dora was present observed that ormond seemed to be quite in his natural element in this sea of pleasure who would have thought it said dora i thought mr ormonds taste was more for domestic happiness and retirement retirement at paris said ormond domestic happiness at paris said connal madame de connal sighedno it was dora that sighed where do you go tonight said her husband nowherei shall stay at home and you said she looking up at harry ormond to madame de la tours thats the affair of half an houronly to appear afterwards to the opera said ormond and after the operacant you sup here said madame de connal with the utmost pleasurebut that i am engaged to madame de la bries ball thats true cried madame de connal starting upi had forgot itso am i this fortnighti may as well go to the opera too and i can carry you to madame de la toursi owe her a five minutes sittingthough she is un peu precieuse and what can you find in that little cold madame de la briedo you like ice he like to break de ice i suppose said mademoiselle ma foi you must then take a hatchet there no occasion i had rather slide upon the ice than break it my business at paris is merely you know to amuse myself said he looking at connalglissez mortels nappuyez pas but if de ice should melt of itself said mademoiselle what would you do den what would become of him den do you think my dear niece it was a case which she did not like to considerdora blushedno creature was so blind as mademoiselle with all her boasted quickness and penetration from this time forward no more was heard of madame de connals taste for domestic life and retirementshe seemed quite convinced either by her husband or by mr ormond or both that no such thing was practicable at paris she had always liked le grand mondeshe liked it better now than ever when she found ormond in every crowded assembly every place of public amusementa continual round of breakfasts dinners ballscourt ballsbal masqubal de loperaplaysgrand entertainmentspetits soupersftes at versaillespleasure in every possible form and variety of luxury and extravagance succeeded day after day and night after nightand ormond le bel irlandois once in fashion was every where and every where admired flattered by the women who wished to draw him in to be their partners at playstill more flattered by those who wished to engage him as a lovermost of all flattered by dora he felt his danger improved in coquetry by parisian practice and power dora tried her utmost skillshe played off with great dexterity her various admirers to excite his jealousy the marquis de beaulieu the witty marquis and the count de belle chasse the irresistible count were dangerous rivals she succeeded in exciting ormonds jealousy but in his noble mind there were strong opposing principles to withstand his selfish gratification it was surprising with what politeness to each other with how little love all the suitors carried on this game of gallantry and competition of vanity till ormond appeared it had been the general opinion that before the end of the winter or the spring the count de belle chasse would be triumphant why ormond did not enter the lists when there appeared to all the judges such a chance of his winning the prize seemed incomprehensible to the spectators and still more to the rival candidates some settled it with the exclamation inou others pronounced that it was english bizarrerie every thing seemed to smooth the slippery path of temptationthe indifference of her husbandthe imprudence of her aunt and the sophistry of madame de clairvillethe general customs of french societythe peculiar profligacy of the society into which he happened to be thrownthe opinion which he saw prevailed that if he withdrew from the competition a rival would immediately profit by his forbearance conspired to weaken his resolution many accidental circumstances concurred to increase the danger at these balls to which he went originally to avoid dora in smaller parties madame de connal though she constantly appeared seldom danced she did not dance well enough to bear comparison with french dancers ormond was in the same situation the dancing which was very well in england would not do in parisno late lessons could by any art bring them to an equality with french nature ah il ne danse pashe dances like an englishman at the first ball this comforted the suitors and most the comte de belle chasse but this very circumstance drew ormond and dora closer togethershe pretended headaches and languor and lassitude and in short sat still but it was not to be expected that the comte de belle chasse could give up dancing the comte de belle chasse danced like le dieu de la danse another vestris he danced every night and ormond sat and talked to dora for it was his duty to attend madame when the little abb was out of the way the spring was now appearing and the spring is delightful in paris and the promenades in the champs elyses and in the bois de boulogne and the promenade in longchamp commenced riding was just coming into high fashion with the french ladies and instead of riding in mens clothes and like a man it was now the ambition de monter cheval langloise to ride on a sidesaddle and in an english riding habit was now the ambition now dora though she could not dance as well could ride better than any french woman and she was ambitious to show herself and her horsemanship in the bois de boulogne but she had no horse that she liked le comte de belle chasse offered to get one broke for her at the kings ridinghousethis she refused but fortunately ormond as was the custom with the english at that time had after his arrival some english horses brought over to him at paris among these was the horse he had once broke for dora for this an english sidesaddle was procuredshe was properly equipped and mounted and the two friends le bel irlandois as they persisted in calling ormond and la belle irlandoise and their horses and their horsemanship were the admiration of the promenade the comte de belle chasse sent to london for an english horse at any price he was out of humourand ormond in the finest humour imaginable dora was grateful her horse was a beautiful gentlespirited creature it was called harryit was frequently patted and caressed and told how much it was valued and loved ormond was now in great danger because he felt himself secure that he was only a friendlami de la maison chapter xxix there was a picture of dagotes which was at this moment an object of fashionable curiosity in paris it was a representation of one of the many charitable actions of the unfortunate marie antoinette then dauphinessat that time full of life and splendour and joy adorning and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in and yet diffusing life and hope and joy in that lower sphere to which the radiance of the great and happy seldom reaches the dauphiness was at that time the pride of france and the darling of paris not only worshipped by the court but loved by the people while she was dauphiness and during the commencement of her reign every thing even disastrous accidents and the rigour of the season served to give her fresh opportunity of winning the affection and exciting the enthusiasm of the people when during the festivities on her marriage hundreds were crushed to death by the fall of a temporary building the sensibility of the dauphiness the eagerness with which she sent all her money to the lieutenant de police for the families of those who had perished conciliated the people and turned even the evil presage to good again during a severe frost her munificence to the suffering poor excited such gratitude that the people erected to her honour a vast pyramid of snowfrail memorialthese marks of respect were almost as transitory as the snowy pyramid ormond went with mademoiselle ofaley one morning to see the picture of the dauphiness and he had now an opportunity of seeing a display of french sensibility that eagerness to feel and to excite a sensation that desire to produce an effect to have a scene that half real half theatric enthusiasm by which the french character is peculiarly distinguished from the english he was perfectly astonished by the quantity of exclamations he heard at the sight of this picture the lifting up of hands and eyes the transports the ecstasies the tearsthe actual tears that he saw streaming in despite of rouge it was real and it was not real feeling of one thing he was clearthat this superfluity of feeling or exaggeration of expression completely silenced him and made him cold indeed like one unskilled or dumb he seemed to stand but are you of marble cried mademoisellewhere is your sensibilit then i hope it is safe at the bottom of my heart said ormond but when it is called for i cannot always find itespecially on these public occasions ah but what good all the sensibilit in the world do at the bottom of your heart where nobody see it it is on these public occasions too you must always contrive and find it quick at paris or after all you will seem but an englishman i must be content to seem and to be what i am said ormond in a tone of playful but determined resignation bon said a voice near him mademoiselle went off in impatience to find some better auditorshe did not hear the bon ormond turned and saw near him a gentleman whom he had often met at some of the first houses in paristhe abb morellet then respected as the most reasonable of all the wits of france and who has since through all the trying scenes of the revolution through the varieties of unprincipled change preserved unaltered the integrity and frankness of his character retaining even to his eightyseventh year all his characteristic warmth of heart and clearness of understandingle doyen de la littrature franoisethe love respect and admiration of every honest heart in france may he live to receive among all the other tributes which his countrymen pay publicly and privately to his merit this record of the impression his kindness left on grateful english hearts our young hero had often desired to be acquainted with the abb but the abb had really hitherto passed him over as a mere young man of fashion a mere milord anglois one of the ephemeral race who appear in parisian society vanish and leave no trace behind but now he did him the honour to enter into conversation with him the abb peculiarly disliked all affectation of sentiment and exaggeration they were revolting to his good sense good taste and feeling ormond won directly his good opinion and goodwill by having insisted upon it to mademoiselle that he would not for the sake of fashion or effect pretend to feel more than he really did bah said the abb hear all those women now and all those menthey do not know what they are sayingthey make me sick and besides i am afraid these flattering courtiers will do no good to our young dauphiness on whom so much of the future happiness or misery of france will depend her heart is excellent and they tell me she announces a strong character but what head of a young beauty and a young queen will be able to withstand perpetual flattery they will lead her wrong and then will be the first to desert hertrust me i know paris all this might change as quickly as the turn of a weathercock but i will not trouble you with forebodings perhaps never to be realized you see paris monsieur at a fortunate time continued he society is now more agreeable has more freedom more life and variety than at any other period that i can remember ormond replied by a just compliment to the men of letters who at this period added so much to the brilliancy and pleasure of parisian society but you have seen nothing of our men of literature have you said the abb much less than i wish i meet them frequently in society but as unluckily i have no pretensions to their notice i can only catch a little of their conversation when i am fortunate enough to be near them yes said the abb with his peculiar look and tone of goodnatured irony between the pretty things you are saying and hearing fromfear nothing i am not going to name any one butevery pretty woman in company i grant you it must be difficult to hear reason in such a situationas difficult almost as in the midst of the din of all the passions at the farotable i observe however that you play with astonishing coolnessthere is something stillwanting excuse mebut you interest me monsieur the determination not to play at all beyond a certain sum i have resolved never to play said ormond ah but the appetite growslappetit vient en mangeantthe danger is in acquiring the tasteexcuse me if i speak too freely not at allyou cannot oblige me more but there is no danger of my acquiring a taste for play because i am determined to lose bon said the abb that is the most singular determination i ever heard explain that to me then monsieur i have determined to lose a certain sumsuppose five hundred guineas i have won and lost backwards and forwards and have been longer about it than you would conceive to be probable but it is not lost yet the moment it is i shall stop short by this means i have acquired all the advantages of yielding to the fashionable madness without risking my future happiness the abb was pleased with the idea and with the frankness and firmness of our young hero really monsieur said he you must have a strong headyou le bel irlandoisto have prevented it from being turned with all the flattery you have received in paris there is nothing which gets into the headworse still into the heartso soon so dangerously as the flattery of pretty women and yet i declare you seem wonderfully sober considering ne jurez pas said ormond but at least in one respect i have not quite lost my senses i know the value and feel the want of a safe good guide in paris if i dared to ask such a favour i should since he has expressed some interest for me beg to be permitted to cultivate the acquaintance of m labb morellet ah anow my head will turn for no head can stand the dose of flattery that happens to suit the taste i am particularly flattered by the idea of being a safe good friend and frankly if i can be of any service to you i will is there any thing i can do for you ormond thanked him and told him that it was his great ambition to become acquainted with the celebrated men of literature in parishe said he should feel extremely obliged if m morellet would take occasion to introduce him to any of them they might meet in society we must do better for you said the abbwe must show you our men of letters he concluded by begging ormond to name a day when he could do him the honour to breakfast with him i will promise you marmontel at least for he is just going to be married to my niece and of him we shall be secure as to the rest i will promise nothing but do as much as i can the men of letters about this period in paris as the abb explained to ormond began to feel their own power and consequence and had assumed a tone of independence as yet tempered with due respect for rank many of them lived or were connected with men of rank by places about the court by secretaryships and pensions obtained through court influence some were attached by early friendship to certain great families had apartments to themselves in their hotels where they received what friends they pleased and in short lived as if they were at home their company was much sought for by the great and they enjoyed good houses good tables carriages all the conveniences of life and all the luxuries of the rich without the trouble of an establishment their mornings were their own usually employed in study and the rest of the day they gave themselves to society the most agreeable period of french literary society was perhaps while this state of things lasted the abb morellets breakfast was very agreeable and ormond saw at his house what had been promised him many of the literary men at paris voltaire was not then in france and rousseau who was always quarrelling with somebody and generally with every body could not be prevailed upon to go to this breakfast ormond was assured that he lost nothing by not seeing him or by not hearing his conversation for that it was by no means equal to his writings his temper was so susceptible and wayward that he was not fit for societyneither capable of enjoying nor of adding to its pleasures ormond heard perhaps more of rousseau and voltaire and learnt more of their characters by the anecdotes that were related and the bonmots that were repeated than he could have done if they had been present there was great variety of different characters and talents at this breakfast and the abb amused himself by making his young friend guess who the people were before he told their names it was happy for ormond that he was acquainted with some of their writings this he owed to lady annalys wellchosen present of french books he was fortunate in his first guessmarivauxs conversation was so like the style of his writings so full of hairbreadth distinctions subtle exceptions and metaphysical refinement and digressions that ormond soon guessed him and was applauded for his quickness marmontel he discovered by his being the only man in the room who had not mentioned to him any of les contes moraux but there was one person who set all his skill at defiance he pronounced that he was no authorthat he was lami de la maison he was so indeed wherever he wentbut he was both a man of literature and a man of deep scienceno less a person than the great dalembert ormond thought dalembert and marmontel were the two most agreeable men in company dalembert was simple openhearted unpresuming and cheerful in society far from being subject to that absence of mind with which profound mathematicians are sometimes reproached dalembert was present to every thing that was going forwardevery trifle he enjoyed with the zest of youth and the playfulness of childhood ormond confessed that he should never have guessed that he was a great mathematician and profound calculator marmontel was distinguished for combining in his conversation as in his character two qualities for which there are no precise english words navet and finesse whoever is acquainted with marmontels writings must have a perfect knowledge of what is meant by both it was fortunate for our young hero that marmontel was at this time no longer the dissipated man he had been during too great a period of his life he had now returned to his early tastes for simple pleasures and domestic virtueshad formed that attachment which afterwards made the happiness of his life he was just going to be married to the amiable mdlle montigny a niece of the abb morellet she and her excellent mother lived with him and ormond was most agreeably surprised and touched at the unexpected sight of an amiable united happy family when he had expected only a meeting of literati the sight of this domestic happiness reminded him of the annalysbrought the image of florence to his mind if she had been but sincere how he should have preferred her to all he had seen it came upon him just at the right moment it contrasted with all the dissipation he had seen and it struck him the more strongly because it could not possibly have been prepared as a moral lesson to make an impression he saw the real natural course of thingshe heard in a few hours the result of the experience of a man of great vivacity great talents who had led a life of pleasure and who had had opportunities of seeing and feeling all that it could possibly afford at the period of the greatest luxury and dissipation ever known in france no evidence could be stronger than marmontels in favour of virtue and of domestic life nor could any one express it with more grace and persuasive eloquence it did ormond infinite good he required such a lesson at this juncture and he was capable of taking itit recalled him to his better self the good abb seemed to see something of what in ormonds mind and became still more interested about him ah a said he to marmontel as soon as ormond was gone that young man is worth something i thought he was only le bel irlandois but i find he is much more we must do what we can for him and not let him leave paris as so many do having seen only the worst part of our society marmontel who had also been pleased with him was willing he said to do any thing in his power but he could scarcely hope that they had the means of withdrawing from the double attraction of the farotable and coquetry a young man of that age and figure fear nothing or rather hope every thing said the abb his head and his heart are more in our favour trust me than his age and his figure are against us to begin my good marmontel did not you see how much he was struck and edified by your reformation ah if there was another mdlle de montigny for him i should fear nothing or rather hope every thing said marmontel but where shall he find such another in all paris in his own country perhaps all in good time said the abb in his own countrytrue cried marmontel now you recall it to my mind how eager he grew in disputing with marivaux upon the distinction between aimable and amiable his description of an amiable woman according to the english taste was i recollect made con amore and there was a sigh at the close which came from the heart and which showed the heart was in england or ireland wherever his heart is cest bien plac said the abb i like himwe must get him into good companyhe is worthy to be acquainted with your amiable and aimable madame de beauveau and madame de seran true said marmontel and for the honour of paris we must convince him that he has taken up false notions and that there is such a thing as conjugal fidelity and domestic happiness here bon that is peculiarly incumbent on the author of les contes moraux said the abb it happened fortunately for our hero that madame de connal was about this time engaged to pass a fortnight at the country house of madame de clairville during her absence the good abb had time to put in execution all his benevolent intentions and introduced his young friend to some of the really good company of paris he pointed out to him at madame geoffrins madame de tencins madame du detfands and madame trudaines the difference between the society at the house of a rich farmer generalor at the house of one connected with the court and with people in place and political powerand the society of mixed rank and literature the mere passing pictures of these things to one who was not to live in paris might not perhaps except as a matter of curiosity be of much value but his judicious friend led ormond from these to make comparisons and deductions which were of use to him all his life afterwards chapter xxx one morning when ormond awoke the first thing he heard was that a person from ireland was below who was very impatient to see him it was patrickson sir ulick oshanes confidential man of business what news from castle hermitage cried ormond starting up in his bed surprised at the sight of patrickson the best that can benever saw sir ulick in such hearthe has a share of the loan and and what news of the annalys interrupted ormond i know nothing about them at all sir said patrickson who was a methodical man of business and whose head was always intent upon what he called the main chance i have been in dublin and heard no country news but have you no letter for me and what brings you over so suddenly to paris i have a letter for you somewhere here sironly i have so many tis hard to find said patrickson looking carefully over a parcel of letters in his pocketbook but with such a drawling slowness of manner as put ormond quite out of patience patrickson laid the letters on the bed one by one thats not itand thats not it thats for monsieur un tel marchand rue that packets from the hamburgh merchantswhat brings me overwhy sir i have business enough heaven knows patrickson was employed not only by sir ulick oshane but by many dublin merchants and bankers to settle business for them with different houses on the continent ormond without listening to the various digressions he made concerning the persons of mercantile consequence to whom the letters were addressed or from whom they were answers pounced upon the letter in sir ulicks handwriting directed to himself and tore it open eagerly to see if there was any news of the annalys nonethey were in devonshire the letter was merely a few lines on businesssir ulick had now the opportunity he had foreseen of laying out ormonds money in the loan most advantageously for him but there had been an omission in the drawing up of his power of attorney which had been done in such a hurry on ormonds leaving home it gave power only to sell out of the three per cents whereas much of ormonds money was in the four per cents another power patrickson said was necessary and he had brought one for him to sign patrickson in his slow manner descanted upon the folly of signing papers in a hurry just when people were getting into carriages which was always the way with young gentlemen he said he took care that ormond should do nothing in a hurry now for he put on his spectacles and read the power sparing him not a syllable of the law forms and repetitions ormond wrote a few kind lines to sir ulick and earnestly besought him to find out something more about the annalys if miss annaly were married it must have appeared in the papers what delayed the marriage was colonel albemarle dismissed or acceptedwhere was heormond said he would be content if sir ulick could obtain an answer to that single plain question all the time ormond was writing patrickson never stirred his forefinger from the spot where the signature was to be written at the bottom of the power of attorney pray said ormond looking up from the paper he going to sign pray patrickson are you really and truly an irishman by the fathers side i apprehend sirbut my mother was english stay sir if you pleasei must witness it witness away said ormond and after having signed this paper empowering sir ulick to sell l out of the four per cents ormond lay down and wishing him a good journey settled himself to sleep while patrickson packing up his papers deliberately said he hoped to be in london in short but that he should go by havre de grace and that he should be happy to execute any commands for mr ormond there or in dublin more he would have said but finding ormond by this time past reply he left the room on tiptoe the next morning madame de connal returned from the country and sent ormond word that she should expect him at her assembly that night every body complimented madame de connal upon the improvement which the country air had made in her beautyeven her husband was struck with it and paid her his compliments on the occasion but she stood conversing so long with ormond that the faroplayers grew impatient she led him to the table but evidently had little interest herself in the game he played at first with more than his usual success but late at night his fortune suddenly changed he lostlosttill at last he stopped and rising from table said he had no more money and he could play no longer connal who was not one of the players but merely looking on offered to lend him any sum he pleased heres a rouleauhere are two rouleauswhat will you have said connal ormond declined playing any more he said that he had lost the sum he had resolved to lose and there he would stop connal did not urge him but laughing said that a resolution to lose at play was the most extraordinary he had ever heard and yet you see i have kept it said ormond then i hope you will next make a resolution to win said connal and no doubt you will keep that as welli prophesy that you will and you will give fortune fair play tomorrow night ormond simply repeated that he should play no more madame de connal soon afterwards rose from the table and went to talk to mr ormond she said she was concerned for his loss at play this night he answered as he felt that it was a matter of no consequence to himthat he had done exactly what he had determined that in the course of the whole time he had been losing this money he had had a great deal of amusement in society had seen a vast deal of human nature and manners which he could not otherwise have seen and that he thought his money exceedingly well employed but you shall not lose your money said dora when next you play it shall be on my account as well as your ownyou know this is not only a compliment but a solid advantage the bank has certain advantagesand it is fair that you should share them i must explain to you continued madame de connalthey are all busy about their own affairs and we may speak in english at our easei must explain to you that a good portion of my fortune has been settled so as to be at my own disposalmy aunt you know has also a good fortunewe are partners and put a considerable sum into the faro bank we find it answers well you see how handsomely we live m de connal has his own share we have nothing to do with that if you would take my advice continued she speaking in a very persuasive tone instead of forswearing play as you seem inclined to do at the first reverse of fortune you would join forces with us you cannot imagine that i would advise you to any thing which i was not persuaded would be advantageous to youyou little know how much i am interested she checked herself blushed hesitated and hurried onyou have no ties in irelandyou seem to like pariswhere can you spend your time more agreeably more agreeablynowhere upon earth cried ormond her manner tone and look at this moment were so flattering so bewitching that he was scarcely master of himself they went to the boudoirthe company had risen from the farotable and one after another had most of them departed connal was goneonly a few remained in a distant apartment listening to some music it was late ormond had never till this evening stayed later than the generality of the company but he had now an excuse to himself something that he had long wished to have an opportunity of saying to dora when she should be quite alone it was a word of advice about le comte de belle chasseher intimacy with him was beginning to be talked of she had been invited to a bal par at the spanish ambassadors for the ensuing nightbut she had more inclination to go to a bal masqu as ormond had heard her declare now certain persons had whispered that it was to meet the comte de belle chasse that she intended to go to this ball and ormond feared that such whispers might be injurious to her reputation it was difficult to him to speak because the counsels of the friend might be mistaken for the jealous fears of a lover with some embarrassment he delicately timidly hinted his apprehensions dora though naturally of a temper apt to take alarm at the touch of blame and offence at the tone of advice now in the most graceful manner thanked her friend for his counsel said she was flattered gratified by the interest it showed in her happinessand she immediately yielded her will her fantaisie to his better judgment this compliance and the look with which it was accompanied convinced him of the absolute power he possessed over her heart he was enchanted with dorashe never looked so beautiful never before not even in the first days of his early youth had he felt her beauty so attractive dear madame de connal dear dora he exclaimed call me dora said she i wish ever to be dora to harry ormond oh harry my first my best my only friend i have enjoyed but little real happiness since we parted tears filled her fine eyesno longer knowing where he was harry ormond found himself at her feet but while he held and kissed in transport the beautiful hand which was but feebly withdrawn he seemed to be suddenly shocked by the sight of one of the rings on her finger my weddingring said dora with a sigh unfortunate marriage that was not the ring on which ormonds eyes were fixed dora whose gray hair is this my fathers said dora in a tremulous voice your father cried ormond starting up the full recollection of that fond father that generous benefactor that confiding friend rushed upon his heart and is this the return i makeoh if he could see us at this instant and if he could cried dora oh how he would admire and love you ormond and how he would her voice failed and with a sudden motion she hid her face with both her hands he would see you dora without a guide protector or friend surrounded with admirers among profligate men and women still more profligate yet he would see that you have preserved a reputation of which your father would be proud my father oh my poor father cried dora oh generous dear ever generous ormond bursting into tearsalternate passions seizing herat one moment the thoughts of her father the next of her lover possessed her imagination at this instant the noise of some one approaching recalled them both to their senses they were found in earnest conversation about a party of pleasure that was to be arranged for the next day madame de connal made ormond promise that he would come the next morning and settle every thing with m de connal for their intended expedition into the country the next day as ormond was returning to madame de connals with the firm intention of adhering to the honourable line of conduct he had traced out for himself just as he was crossing the pont neuf some one ran full against him surprised at what happens so seldom in the streets of paris where all meet pass or cross in crowds with magical celerity and address he looked back and at the same instant the person who had passed looked back also an apparition in broad daylight could not have surprised ormond more than the sight of this person could it becould it possibly be moriarty carroll on the pont neuf in paris by the blessing then its the man himselfmaster harrythough i didnt know him through the french disguise oh master then ive been tried and cast and all but hangedsentenced to botanytransported any wayfor a robbery i didnt commitsince i saw you last but your honours uneasy and its not proper i know to be stopping a jantleman in the street but i have a word to say that will bear no delay not a minute ormonds surprise and curiosity increasedhe desired moriarty to follow him and now moriarty what is it you have to say it is a long story then please your honour i was transported to botany though innocent but first and foremost for what consarns your honour first first said ormond if you were transported how came you here because i was not transported plase your honouronly sentencedfor i escaped from kilmainham where i was sent to be put on board the tender but i got on board of an american ship by the help of a friendand this ship being knocked against the rocks i came safe ashore in this country on one of the sticks of the vessel so when i knowed it was france i was in and recollected miss dora that was married in paris i thought if i could just make my way any hows to paris shed befriend me in case of need but dear master said moriarty interrupting its a folly to talkill not tell you a word more of myself till you hear the news i have for you the worst news i have to tell you is there is great fear of the breaking of sir ulicks bank the breaking of sir ulicks bank i heard from him the day before yesterday may be you did but the captain of the american ship in which i came was complaining of his having been kept two hours at that bank where they were paying large sums in small notes and where there was the greatest run upon the house that ever was seen ormond instantly saw his dangerhe recollected the power of attorney he had signed two days before but patrickson was to go by havre de gracethat would delay him it was possible that ormond by setting out instantly might get to london time enough to save his property he went directly and ordered post horses he had no debts in paris nothing to pay but for his stables and lodging he had a faithful servant whom he could leave behind to make all necessary arrangements you are right jewel to be in a hurry said carroll but sure you wont leave poor moriarty behind ye here in distress when he has no friend in the wide world but yourself tell me in the first place moriarty are you innocent upon my conscience master i am perfectly innocent as the child unborn both of the murder and the robbery if your honour will give me leave ill tell you the whole story that will be a long affair moriarty if you talk out of the face as you used to do i will however find an opportunity to hear it all but in the meantime stay where you are till i return ormond went instantly to connals to inform him of what had happened his astonishment was obviously mixed with disappointment but to do him justice besides the interest which he really had in the preservation of the fortune he felt some personal regard for ormond himself what shall we do without you said he i assure you madame and i have never been so happy together since the first month after our marriage as we have been since you came to paris connal was somewhat consoled by hearing ormond say that if he were time enough in london to save his fortune he proposed returning immediately to paris intending to make the tour of switzerland and italy connal had no doubt that they should yet be able to fix him at paris madame de connal and mademoiselle were outconnal did not know where they were gone ormond was glad to tear himself away with as few adieus as possible he got into his travelling carriage put his servant on the box and took moriarty with him in the carriage that he might relate his history at leisure plase your honour said moriarty mr marcus never missed any opportunity of showing me illwill the supercargo of the ship that was cast away when you were with sir herbert annaly god rest his soul came down to the seaside to look for some of the things that he had lost the day after he came early in the morning his horse and bridle and saddle and a surtout coat was found in a lane near the place where we lived and the supercargo was never heard any more of suspicion fell upon manythe country rung with the noise that was made about this murderand at last i was taken up for it because people had seen me buy cattle at the fair and the people would not believe it was with money your honour sent me by the good parsonfor the parson was gone out of the country and i had nobody to stand my friend for mr marcus was on the grand jury and the sheriff was his friend and sir ulick was in dublin at the bank howsomdever after a long trial which lasted the whole day a cute lawyer on my side found out that there was no proof that any body had been murdered and that a man might lose his horse his saddle and his bridle and his big coat without being kilt so that the judge ordered the jury to let me off for the murder they then tried me for the robbery and sure enough that went again me for a pair of silvermounted pistols with the mans name engraved upon them was found in my house they knew the mans name by the letters in the big coat the judge asked me what i had to say for myself my lard says i those pistols were brought into my house about a fortnight ago by a little boy one little tommy dunshaughlin who found them in a punkhorn at the edge of a boghole the jidge favoured me more than the juryfor he asked how old the boy was and whether i could produce him the little fellow was brought into court and it was surprising how clear he told his story the jidge listened to the child young as he was but mcrule was on the jury and said that he knew the child to be as cunning as any in ireland and that he would not believe a word that came out of his mouth so the short and the long of it was i was condemned to be transported it would have done you good if youd heard the cry in the court when sentence was given for i was loved in the country poor peggy and sheelahbut ill not be troubling your honours tender heart with our parting i was transmuted to dublin to be put on board the tender and lodged in kilmainham waiting for the ship that was to go to botany i had not been long there when another prisoner was brought to the same room with me he was a handsomelooking man about thirty years of age of the most penetrating eye and determined countenance that i ever saw he appeared to be worn down with illhealth and his limbs much swelled notwithstanding which he had strong handcuffs on his wrists and he seemed to be guarded with uncommon care he begged the turnkey to lay him down upon the miserable iron bed that was in the cell and he begged him for gods sake to let him have a jug of water by his bedside and to leave him to his fate i could not help pitying this poor cratur i went to him and offered him any assistance in my power he answered me shortly what are you here fori told him well says he whether you are guilty or not is your affair not mine but answer me at onceare you a good mancan you go through with a thingand are you steel to the backbonei am said i then said he you are a lucky manfor he that is talking to you is michael dunne who knows how to make his way out of any jail in ireland saying this he sprung with great activity from the bed it is my cue said he to be sick and weak whenever the turnkey comes in to put him off his guardfor they have all orders to watch me strictly because as how do you see i broke out of the jail of trim and when they catched me they took me before his honour the police magistrate who did all he could to get out of me the way which i made my escape well says the magistrate ill put you in a place where you cant get outtill youre sent to botany plase your worship says i if theres no offence in saying it theres no such place in irelandno such place as what no such place as will hold michael dunnewhat do you think of kilmainbam says he i think its a fine jailand it will be no asy matter to get out of itbut it is not impossiblewell mr dunne said the magistrate i have heard of your fame and that you have secrets of your own for getting out now if youll tell me how you got out of the jail of trim ill make your confinement at kilmainham as asy as may be so as to keep you safe and if you do not you must be ironed and i will have sentinels from an english regiment who shall be continually changed so that you cant get any of them to help youplase your worship said dunne thats very hard usage but i know as how that you are going to build new jails all over ireland and that youd be glad to know the best way to make them secure if your worship will promise me that if i get out of kilmainham and if i tell you how i do it then youll get me a free pardon ill try hard but what before three months are over ill be a prisoner at largethats more than i can promise you said the magistrate but if you will disclose to me the best means of keeping other people in i will endeavour to keep you from botany baynow sir says dunne i know your worship to be a man of honour and that your own honour regards yourself and not me so that if i was ten times as bad as i am youd keep your promise with me as well as if i was the best gentleman in ireland so that now mr moriarty said dunne do you see if i get out i shall be safe and if you get out along with me you have nothing to do but to go over to america and if you are a married man and tired of your wife youll get rid of her if you are not tired of her and you have any substance she may sell it and follow you there was something master harry about the man that made me have great confidence in himand i was ready to follow his advice whenever the turnkey was coming he was groaning and moaning on the bed at other times he made me keep bathing his wrists with cold water so that in three or four days they were not half the size they were at first this change he kept carefully from the jailor i observed that he frequently asked what day of the month it was but that he never made any attempt to speak to the sentinels nor did he seem to make any preparation or to lay any scheme for getting out i held my tongue and waited quitely at last he took out of his pocket a little flageolet and began to play upon it he asked me if i could play i said i could a little but very badly i dont care how bad it is if you can play at all he got off the bed where he was lying and with the utmost ease pulled his hands out of his handcuffs besides the swelling of his wrists having gone down he had some method of getting rid of his thumb that i never could understand says i mr dunne the jailor will miss the fettersno said he for i will put them on again and so he did with great ease now said he it is time to begin our work he took off one of his shoes and taking out the insole he showed me a hole that was cut where the heel was in which there was a little small flat bottle which he told me was the most precious thing in life and under the rest of the sole there were a number of saws made of watch spring that lay quite flat and snug under his foot the next time the turnkey came in he begged for the love of god to have a pipe and some tobacco which was accordingly granted to him what the pipes and tobacco were for i could not then guess but they were found to be useful he now made a paste of some of the bread of his allowance with which he made a cup round the bottom of one of the bars of the window into this cup he poured some of the contents of the little bottle which was i believe oil of vitriol in a little time this made a bad smell and it was then i found the use of the pipe and tobacco for the smell of the tobacco quite bothered the smell of the vitriol when he thought he had softened the iron bar sufficiently he began to work away with the saws and he soon taught me how to use them so that we kept working on continually no matter how little we did at a time but as we were constantly at it what i thought never could be done was finished in three or four days the use of the flageolet was to drown the noise of the filing for when one filed the other piped when the bar was cut through he fitted the parts nicely together and covered them over with rust he proceeded in the same manner to cut out another bar so that we had a free opening out of the window our cell was at the very top of the jail so that even to look down to the ground was terrible under various pretences we had got an unusual quantity of blankets on our beds these he examined with the utmost care as upon their strength our lives were to depend we calculated with great coolness the breadth of the strips into which he might cut the blankets so as to reach from the window to the ground allowing for the knots by which they were to be joined and for other knots that were to hinder the hands and feet from slipping now said he mr moriarty all this is quite asy and requires nothing but a determined heart and a sound head but the difficulty is to baffle the sentinel that is below and who is walking backward and forward continually day and night under the window and there is another you see in a sentrybox at the door of the yard and for all i know there may be another sentinel at the other side of the wall now these men are never twice on the same duty i have friends enough out of doors who have money enough and would have talked reason to them but as these sentinels are changed every day no good can be got of them but stay till tomorrow night and well try what we can do i was determined to follow him the next night the moment that we were locked in for the night we set to work to cut the blankets into slips and tied them together with great care we put this rope round one of the fixed bars of the window and pulling at each knot we satisfied ourselves that every part was sufficiently strong dunne looked frequently out of the window with the utmost anxietyit was a moonlight night the moon said he will be down in an hour and a half in a little while we heard the noise of several girls singing at a distance from the windows and we could see as they approached that they were dancing and making free with the sentinels i saw that they were provided with bottles of spirits with which they pledged the deluded soldiers by degrees the sentinels forgot their duty and by the assistance of some laudanum contained in some of the spirits they were left senseless on the ground the whole of this plan and the very night and hour had been arranged by dunne with his associates before he was put into kilmainham the success of this scheme which was totally unexpected by me gave me i suppose plase your honour fresh courage he very honourably gave me the choice to go down first or to follow him i was ashamed not to go first after i had got out of the window and had fairly hold of the rope my fear diminished and i went cautiously down to the bottom here i waited for dunne and we both of us silently stole along in the dark for the moon had gone in and we did not meet with the least obstruction our out of doors assistants had the prudence to get entirely out of sight dunne led me to a hidingplace in a safe part of the town and committed me to the care of a seafaring man who promised to get me on board an american ship as for my part said dunne i will go in the morning boldly to the magistrate and claim his promise he did soand the magistrate with good sense and good faith kept his promise and obtained a pardon for dunne i wrote to peggy to get aboard an american ship i was cast away on the coast of francemade my way to the first religious house that i could hear of where i luckily found an irishman who saved me from starvation and who sent me on from convent to convent till i got to paris where your honour met me on that bridge just when i was looking for miss doras house and thats all ive got to tell concluded moriarty and all true no adventures of any sort happened to our hero in the course of his journey the wind was fair for england when he reached calais he had a good passage and with all the expedition that good horses good roads good money and civil words ensure in england he pursued his way and arrived in the shortest time possible in london he reached town in the morning before the usual hour when the banks are open leaving orders with his servant on whose punctuality he could depend to awaken him at the proper hour he lay down overcome with fatigue and sleptyesslept soundly chapter xxxi ormond was wakened at the proper hourwent immediately to s bank it was but just open and beginning to do business he had never been there beforehis person was not known to any of the firm he entered a long narrow room so dark at the entrance from the street that he could at first scarcely see what was on either side of hima clerk from some obscure nook and from a desk higher than himself put out his head with a long pen behind his ear and looked at ormond as he came in pray sir am i rightis this mr s bank yes sir with mercantile economy of words and a motion of his head the clerk pointed out to ormond the way he should goand continued casting up his books ormond walked down the narrow aisle and it became light as he advanced towards a large window at the farther end before which three clerks sat at a table opposite to him a person stood with his back to ormond and was speaking earnestly to one of the clerks who leaned over the table listening just as ormond came up he heard his own name mentionedhe recollected the voicehe recollected the back of the figurethe very bottlegreen coatit was patricksonormond stood still behind him and waited to hear what was going on sir said the clerk it is a very sudden order for a very large sum true sirbut you see my poweryou know mr ormonds handwriting and you know sir ulick oshanes mr james said the principal clerk turning to one of the others be so good to hand me the letters we have of mr ormond as we have never seen the gentleman sign his name sir it is necessary that we should be more particular in comparing oh sir no doubtcompare as much as you pleaseno doubt people cannot be too exact and deliberate in doing business it certainly is his signature said the clerk i witnessed the paper said patrickson sir i dont dispute it replied the clerk but you cannot blame us for being cautious when such a very large sum is in question and when we have no letter of advice from the gentleman but i tell you i come straight from mr ormond i saw him last tuesday at paris and you see him now sir said ormond advancing patricksons countenance changed beyond all power of control mr ormondi thought you were at paris mr patricksoni thought you were at havre de gracewhat brought you here so suddenly i acted for another hesitated patrickson i therefore made no delay and thank heaven said ormond i have acted for myselfbut just in timesir continued he addressing himself to the principal clerk gentlemen i have to return you my thanks for your cautionit has actually saved me from ruinfor i understand ormond suddenly stopped recollecting that he might injure sir ulick oshane essentially by a premature disclosure or by repeating a report which might be illfounded he turned again to speak to patrickson but patrickson had disappeared then continuing to address himself to the clerks gentlemen said ormond speaking carefully have you heard any thing of or from sir ulick oshane lately except what you may have heard from this mr patrickson not from but of sir ulick oshane we heard from our dublin correspondentin due course we have heard replied the head clerk too true i am afraid sir that his bank had come to paying in sixpences on saturday the second clerk seeing great concern in ormonds countenance added but sunday you know is in their favour sir and monday and tuesday are holidays so they may stand the run and recover yet with the help of this gentlemans thirty thousand they might have recovered perhapsbut mr ormond would scarcely have recovered it as to the ten thousand pounds in the three per cents of which sir ulick had obtained possession a month ago that was irrecoverable if his bank should breakifthe clerks all spoke with due caution but their opinion was sufficiently plain they were honestly indignant against the guardian who had thus attempted to ruin his ward though almost stunned and breathless with the sense of the danger he had so narrowly escaped yet ormonds instinct of generosity if we may use the expression and his gratitude for early kindness operated he would not believe that sir ulick had been guilty of a deliberate desire to injure him at all events he determined that instead of returning to france as he had intended he would go immediately to ireland and try if it were possible to assist sir ulick without materially injuring himself having ordered horses he made inquiry wherever he thought he might obtain information with respect to the annalys all that he could learn was that they were at some seabathing place in the south of england and that miss annaly was still unmarried a ray of hope darted into the mind of our heroand he began his journey to ireland with feelings which every good and generous mind will know how to appreciate he had escaped at paris from a temptation which it was scarcely possible to resist he had by decision and activity preserved his fortune from ruinhe had under his protection an humble friend whom he had saved from banishment and disgrace and whom he hoped to restore to his wretched wife and family forgetful of the designs that had been meditated against him by his guardian to whose necessities he attributed his late conduct he hastened to his immediate assistance determined to do every thing in his power to save sir ulick from ruin if his difficulties arose from misfortune and not from criminality if on the contrary he should find that sir ulick was fraudulently a bankrupt he determined to quit ireland immediately and to resume his scheme of foreign travel the system of posting had at this time been carried to the highest perfection in england it was the amusement and the fashion of the time to squander large sums in hurrying from place to place without any immediate motive for arriving at the end of a journey but that of having the satisfaction of boasting in what a short time it had been performed or as it is expressed in one of our comedies to enter london like a meteor with a prodigious tail of dust moriarty carroll who was perched upon the box with ormonds servant made excellent observations wherever he went his english companion could not comprehend how a man of common sense could be ignorant of various things which excited the wonder and curiosity of moriarty afterwards however when they travelled in ireland moriarty had as much reason to be surprised at the impression which irish manners and customs made upon his companion after a rapid journey to holyhead our hero found to his mortification that the packet had sailed with a fair wind about half an hour before his arrival notwithstanding his impatience he learned that it was impossible to overtake the vessel in a boat and that he must wait for the sailing of the next days packet fortunately however the lordlieutenants secretary arrived from london at holyhead time enough for the tide and as he had an order from the postoffice for a packet to sail whenever he should require it the intelligent landlord of the inn suggested to ormond that he might probably obtain permission from the secretary to have a berth in this packet ormonds manner and address were such as to obtain from the goodnatured secretary the permission he required and in a short time he found himself out of sight of the coast of wales during the beginning of their voyage the motion of the vessel was so steady and the weather so fine that every body remained on deck but on the wind shifting and becoming more violent the landsmen soon retired below decks and poor moriarty and his english companion slunk down into the steerage submitting to their fate ormond was never seasick he walked the deck and enjoyed the admirable manoeuvring of the vessel two or three naval officers and some other passengers who were used to the sea and who had quietly gone to bed during the beginning of the voyage now came from below to avoid the miseries of the cabin as one of these gentlemen walked backwards and forwards upon deck he eyed our hero from time to time with looks of anxious curiosityormond perceiving this addressed the stranger and inquired from him whether he had mistaken his looks or whether he had any wish to speak to him sir said the stranger i do think that i have seen you before and i believe that i am under considerable obligations to youi was supercargo to that vessel that was wrecked on the coast of ireland when you and your young friend exerted yourselves to save the vessel from plunder after the shipwreck the moment i found myself on land i hastened to the neighbouring town to obtain protection and assistance in the mean time your exertions had saved a great deal of our property which was lodged in safety in the neighbourhood i had procured a horse in the town to which i had gone and had ridden back to the shore with the utmost expedition along with the vessel which had been shipwrecked there had sailed another american sloop we were both bound from new york to bourdeaux in the morning after the shipwreck our consort hove in sight of the wreck and sent a boat on shore to inquire what had become of the crew and of the cargo but they found not a human creature on the shore except myself the plunderers had escaped to their hidingplaces and all the rest of the inhabitants had accompanied the poor young gentleman who had fallen a sacrifice to his exertions in our favour it was of the utmost consequence to my employers that i should arrive as soon as possible at bourdeaux to give an account of what had happened i therefore without hesitation abandoned my horse with its bridle and saddle and i got on board the american vessel without delay in my hurry i forgot my great coat on the shore a loss which proved extremely inconvenient to meas there were papers in the pockets which might be necessary to produce before my employers i arrived safely at bourdeaux settled with my principals to their satisfaction and i am now on my way to ireland to reclaim such part of my property and that of my employers as was saved from the savages who pillaged us in our distressthis detail which was given with great simplicity and precision excited considerable interest among the persons upon the deck of the packet moriarty who was pretty well recovered from his sickness was now summoned upon deck ormond confronted him with the american supercargo but neither of them had the least recollection of each other and yet said ormond to the american though you do not know this man he is at this moment under sentence of transportation for having robbed you and he very narrowly escaped being hanged for your murder a fate from which he was saved by the patience and sagacity of the judge who tried him moriartys surprise was expressed with such strange contortions of delight and with a tone and in a phraseology so peculiarly his own as to astonish and entertain the spectators among these was the irish secretary who without any application being made to him promised moriarty to procure for him a free pardon on ormonds landing in dublin the first news he heard and it was repeated a hundred times in a quarter of an hour was that sir ulick oshane was bankruptthat his bank shut up yesterday it was a public calamity a source of private distress that reached lower and farther than any bankruptcy had ever done in ireland ormond heard of it from every tongue it was written in every facein every house it was the subject of lamentation of invective in every street poor men with ragged notes in their hands were stopping to pore over the names at the back of the notes or hurrying to and fro looking up at the shopwindows for half price given here for oshanes notes groups of people of all ranks gatheredstoppeddispersed talking of sir ulick oshanes bankruptcytheir hopestheir fearstheir lossestheir ruintheir despairtheir rage some said it was all owing to sir ulicks shameful extravagance his house in dublin fit for a dukecastle hermitage full of company to the last weekballsdinnersthe most expensive luxuriesscandalous others accused sir ulicks absurd speculations many pronounced the bankruptcy to be fraudulent and asserted that an estate had been made over to marcus who would live in affluence on the ruin of the creditors at sir ulicks house in town every windowshutter was closed ormond rang and knocked in vainnot that he wished to see sir ulickno he would not have intruded on his misery for the world but ormond longed to inquire from the servants how things were with him no servant could be seen ormond went to sir ulicks bank such crowds of people filled the street that it was with the utmost difficulty and after a great working of elbows that in an hour or two he made his way to one of the barred windows there was a place where notes were handed in and accepted as they called it by the clerks who thus for the hour soothed and pacified the sufferers with the hopes that this acceptance would be good and would stand in stead at some future day they were told that when things should come to a settlement all would be paid there was property enough to satisfy the creditors when the commissioners should look into it sir ulick would pay all honourablyas far as possiblefifteen shillings in the pound or certainly ten shillingsthe accepted notes would pass for that any where the crowd pressed closer and closer arms crossing over each other to get notes in at the window the clerks heads appearing and disappearing it was said they were laughing while they thus deluded the people all the intelligence that ormond after being nearly suffocated could obtain from any of the clerks was that sir ulick was in the country they believed at castle hermitagecould not be certainhad no letters for him todayhe was ill when they heard lastso ill he could do no businessconfined to his bed the people in the street hearing these answers replied confined in his bed is hein the jail it should be as many will be along of him ill is he sir ulicksham sickness may beall his life a sham all these and innumerable other taunts and imprecations with which the poor people vented their rage ormond heard as he made his way out of the crowd of all who had suffered he who had probably lost the most and who certainly had been on the brink of losing the greatest part of what he possessed was the only individual who uttered no reproach he was impatient to get down to castle hermitage and if he found that sir ulick had acted fairly to be some comfort to him to be with him at least when deserted by all the rest of the world at all the inns upon the road as he went from dublin to castle hermitage even at the villages where he stopped to water the horses every creature down to the hostlers were talking of the bankruptcyand abusing sir ulick oshane and his son the curses that were deep not loud were the worstand the faces of distress worse than all gathering round his carriage wherever it stopped the people questioned him and his servants about the news and then turned away saying they were ruined the men stood in unutterable despair the women crying loudly bewailed their husbands their sons that must waste in the jail or fly the country for what should they do for the rents that had been made up in sir ulicks notes and no good now ormond felt the more on hearing these complaints from his sense of the absolute impossibility of relieving the universal distress he pursued his melancholy journey and took moriarty into the carriage with him that he might not be recognized on the road when he came within sight of castle hermitage he stopped at the top of the hill at a cottage where many a time in his boyish days he had rested with sir ulick out hunting the mistress of the house now an old woman came to the door master harry dear cried she when she saw who it was but the sudden flash of joy in her old face was over in an instant but did you hear it cried she and the great change it caused himpoor sir ulick oshane i went up with eggs on purpose to see him but could only hearhe was in his bedwasting with troublenobody knows any thing moreall is kept hush and close mr marcus took off all he could rap and ran even to well well i dont want to hear of marcuscan you tell me whether dr cambray is come home not expected to come till monday are you sure oh not a morning but im there the first thing asking and longing for them lie back moriarty in the carriage and pull your hat over your face whispered ormond postilions drive on to that little cabin with the trees about it at the foot of the hill this was moriartys cabin when they stopped poor peggy was called out alas how altered from the dancing sprightly blooming girl whom ormond had known so few years since in the black islands how different from the happy wife whom he had left comfortably settled in a cottage suited to her station and her wishes she was thin pale and haggardher dress was neglectedan illnursed child that she had in her arms she gave to a young girl near her approaching the carriage and seeing harry ormond she seemed ready to sink into the earth however after having drank some water she recovered sufficiently to be able to answer ormonds inquiries what do you intend to do peggy do sirgo to america to join my husband sure every thing was to have been sold monday lastbut nobody has any moneyand i am tould it will cost a great deal to get across the sea at this she burst into tears and cried most bitterly and at this moment the carriage door flew openmoriartys impatience could be no longer restrainedhe flung himself into the arms of his wife leaving this happy and innocent couple to enjoy their felicity we proceed to castle hermitage ormond directed the postilions to go the back way to the house they drove down the old avenue presently they saw a boy who seemed to be standing on the watch run back towards the castle leaping over hedge and ditch with desperate haste then came running from the house three men calling to one another to shut the gates for the love of god they all ran towards the gateway through which the postilions were going to drive reached it just as the foremost horses turned and flung the gate full against the horses heads the men without looking or caring went on locking the gate ormond jumped out of the carriageat the sight of him the padlock fell from the hand of the man who held it master harry himselfand is it youwe ask your pardon your honour the men were three of sir ulicks workmenormond forbad the carriage to follow for perhaps you are afraid of the noise disturbing sir ulick said be no plase your honour said the foremost man it will not disturb himas well let the carriage come ononly whispered he best to send the hack postilions with their horses always to the inn afore theyd learn any thing ormond walked on quickly and as soon as he was out of hearing of the postilions again asked the men what newshow is sir ulick poor gentleman he has had a deal of troubleand no help for him said the man better tell him plain whispered the next master harry sir ulick oshanes trouble is over in this world sir is he dead he is and cold and in his coffinthis minuteand thanks be to god if he is safe there even from them that are on the watch to seize on his bodyin the dread of them creditors orders were given to keep the gates locked he is dead since tuesday sirbut hardly one knows it out of the castleexcept us ormond walked on silently while they followed talking at intervals there is a very great cry against him sir i hear in dublinand here in the country too said one the distress they say is very great he caused but they might let his body rest any waywhat good can that do them bad or good they shant touch it said the other by the blessing we shall have him buried safe in the morning afore they are stirring we shall carry the coffin through the under ground passage that goes to the stables and out by the lane to the churchyard asyand the gentleman the clergyman has notice all will be ready and the housekeeper only attending oh the pitiful funeral said the eldest of the men the pitiful funeral for sir ulick oshane that was born to better well we can only do the best we can said the other let what will happen to ourselves for sir marcus said he wouldnt take one of his fathers notes from any of us ormond involuntarily felt for his purse oh dont be bothering the gentleman dont be talking said the old man this way master harry if you please sir the underground way to the back yard we keep all close till after the burying for fearthat was the housekeepers order sent all off to dublin when sir ulick took to his bed and lady norton went off ormond refrained from asking any questions about his illness fearing to inquire into the manner of his death he walked on more quickly and silently when they were going through the dark passage one of the men in a low voice observed to mr ormond that the housekeeper would tell him all about it when they got to the house the housekeeper and sir ulicks man appeared seeming much surprised at the sight of mr ormond they said a great deal about the unfortunate event and their own sorrow and distress but ormond saw that theirs were only the long faces dismal tones and outward show of grief they were just a common housekeeper and gentlemans gentleman neither worse nor better than ordinary servants in a great house sir ulick had only treated them as such the housekeeper without ormonds asking a single question went on to tell him that castle hermitage was as full of company even to the last week as ever it could hold and all as grand as ever the first people in irelandchampagne and burgundy and ices and all as usualand a ball that very week sir ulick was very considerate and sent lady norton off to her other friends he took ill suddenly that night with a great pain in his head he had been writing hard and in great trouble and he took to his bed and never rose from ithe was found by mr dempsey his own man dead in his bed in the morningof a broken heart to be surepoor gentlemansome people in the neighbourhood was mighty busy talking how the coroner ought to be sent for but that blew over sir but then we were in dread of the seizure of the body for debt so the gates was kept locked and now you know all we know about it sir ormond said he would attend the funeral there was no attempt to seize upon the body only the three workmen the servants a very few of the cottagers and harry ormond attended to the grave the body of the once popular sir ulick oshane this was considered by the country people as the greatest of all the misfortunes that had befallen him the lowest degradation to which an oshane could be reduced they compared him with king corny and see the difference said they the one was the true thing and never changedand after all where is the great friends nowthe quality that used to be entertained at the castle above where is all the favour promised him now what is it come to see with all his wit and the schemes upon schemes broke and gone and forsook and forgot and buried without a funeral or a tear but from master harry ormond was surprised to hear in the midst of many of their popular superstitions and prejudices how justly they estimated sir ulicks abilities and character as the men filled up his grave one of them said there lies the making of an excellent gentlemanbut the cunning of his head spoiled the goodness of his heart the day after the funeral an agent came from dublin to settle sir ulick oshanes affairs in the country on opening his desk the first thing that appeared was a bundle of accounts and a letter directed to h ormond esq he took it to his own room and read ormond i intended to employ your money to reestablish my falling credit but i never intended to defraud you ulick oshane chapter xxxii both from a sense of justice to the poor people concerned and from a desire to save sir ulick oshanes memory as far as it was in his power from reproach ormond determined to pay whatever small debts were due to his servants workmen and immediate dependents for this purpose when the funeral was over he had them all assembled at castle hermitage every just demand of this sort was paid all were satisfied even the barefooted kitchenmaid the drudge of this great house who in despair had looked at her poor one guinea note of sir ulicks had that note paid in gold and went away blessing master harry happy for all that he is come home to us was the general feeling but there was one man a groom of sir ulicks who did not join in any of these blessings or praises he stood silent and motionless with his eyes on the money which mr ormond had put into his hand is your money right said ormond it is sir but i had something to tell you when all the other servants had left the room the man said i am the groom sir that was sent just before you went to france with a letter to annaly there was an answer to that letter sir though you never got it there was an answer cried ormond anger flashing but an instant afterwards joy sparkling in his eyes there was a letterfrom whomill forgive you all if you will tell me the whole truth i willand not a word of lie and i beg your honours pardon if go onstraight to the fact this instant or you shall never have my pardon why then i stopped to take a glass coming home and not knowing how it was i had the misfortune to lose the bit of a note and i thought no more about it till plase your honour after you was gone it was found found cried ormond stepping hastily up to himwhere is it i have it safe here said the man opening a sort of pocketbook here i have kept it safe till your honour came back ormond saw and seized upon a letter in lady armalys hand directed to him tore it opentwo notesone from florence i forgive you said he to the man and made a sign to him to leave the room when ormond had read or without reading had taken in by one glance of the eye the sense of the lettershe rang the bell instantly inquire at the postoffice said he to his servant whether lady annaly is in england or irelandif in england whereif in ireland whether at annaly or at herberts town quickan answer an answer was quickly brought in englandin devonshire sir here is the exact direction to the place sir i shall pack up i suppose sir certainlydirectly leaving a few lines of explanation and affection for dr cambray our young hero was off again to the surprise and regret of all who saw him driving away as fast as horses could carry him his servant from the box however spread as he went for the comfort of the deploring village the assurance that master and he would soon be back again please heavenand happier than ever and now that he is safe in the carriage what was in that note of miss annalys which has produced such a sensation no talismanic charm ever operated with more magical celerity than this note what were the words of the charm that is a secret which shall never be known to the world the only point which it much imports the public to know is probably already guessedthat the letter did not contain a refusal nor any absolute discouragement of ormonds hopes but lady annaly and florence had both distinctly told him that they could not receive him at annaly till after a certain day on which they said that they should be particularly engaged they told him that colonel albemarle was at annalythat he would leave it at such a timeand they requested that mr ormond would postpone his visit till after that time not receiving this notice ormond had unfortunately gone upon the day that was specially prohibited now that the kneeling figure appeared to him as a rival in despair not in triumph ormond asked himself how he could ever have been such an idiot as to doubt florence annaly why did i set off in such haste for pariscould not i have waited a daycould not i have written againcould i not have crossquestioned the drunken servant when he was sobercould not i have done any thing in short but what i did clearly as a man when his anger is dissipated sees what he ought to have done or to have left undone while the fury lasted vividly as a man in a different kind of passion sees the folly of all he did said or thought when he was possessed by the past madness so clearly so vividly did ormond now see and feeland vehemently execrate his jealous folly and mad precipitation and then he came to the question could his folly be repairedwould his madness ever be forgiven ormond in love affairs never had any presumptionany tinge of the connal coxcombry in his nature he was not apt to flatter himself that he had made a deep impression and now he was perhaps from his sense of the superior value of the object more than usually diffident though miss annaly was still unmarried she might have resolved irrevocably against him though she was not a girl to act in the highflown heroine style and in a fit of pride or revenge to punish the man she liked by marrying his rival whom she did not like yet florence annaly as ormond well knew inherited some of her mothers strength of character and in circumstances that deeply touched her heart might be capable of all her mothers warmth of indignation it was in her character decidedly to refuse to connect herself with any man however her heart might incline towards him if he had any essential defect of temper or if she thought that his attachment to her was not steady and strong such as she deserved it should be and such as her sensibility and all her hopes of domestic happiness required in a husband and then there was lady annaly to be consideredhow indignant she would be at his conduct while ormond was travelling alone he had full leisure to torment himself with these thoughts pressed forward alternately by hope and fear each urging expedition he hastened onreached dublincrossed the waterand travelling day and night lost not a moment till he was at the feet of his fair mistress to those who like to know the how the when and the where it should be told that it was evening when he arrived florence annaly was walking with her mother by the seaside in one of the most beautiful and retired parts of the coasts of devonshire when they were told by a servant that a gentleman from ireland had just arrived at their house and wished to see them a minute afterwards they sawcould it be lady annaly said turning in doubt to her daughter but the cheek of florence instantly convinced the mother that it could be none but mr ormond himself mr ormond said lady annaly advancing kindly yet with dignified reservemr ormond after his long absence is welcome to his old friend there was in ormonds look and manner as he approached something that much inclined the daughter to hope that he might prove not utterly unworthy of her mothers forgiveness and when he spoke to the daughter there was in his voice and look something that softened the mothers heart and irresistibly inclined her to wish that he might be able to give a satisfactory explanation of his strange conduct where the parties are thus happily disposed both to hear reason to excuse passion and to pardon the errors to which passion even in the most reasonable minds is liable explanations are seldom tedious or difficult to be comprehended the moment ormond produced the cover the soiled cover of the letters a glimpse of the truth struck florence annaly and before he had got farther in his sentence than these words i did not receive your ladyships letter till within these few days all the reserve of lady annalys manner was dispelled her smiles relieved his apprehensions and encouraged him to proceed in his story with happy fluency the carelessness of the drunken servant who had occasioned so much mischief was talked of for a few minutes with great satisfaction ormond took his own share of the blame so frankly and with so good a grace and described with such truth the agony he had been thrown into by the sight of the kneeling figure in regimentals that lady annaly could not help comforting him by the assurance that florence had at the same moment been sufficiently alarmed by the rearing of his horse at the sight of the flapping windowblind the kneeling gentleman said lady annaly whom you thought at the height of joy and glory was at that moment in the depths of despair so ill do the passions see what is even before their eyes if lady annaly had had a mind to moralize she might have done so to any length without fear of interruption from either of her auditors and with the most perfect certainty of unqualified submission and dignified humility on the part of our hero who was too happy at this moment not to be ready to acknowledge himself to have been wrong and absurd and worthy of any quantity of reprehension or indignation that could have been bestowed upon him her ladyship went however as far from morality as possibleto paris she spoke of the success mr ormond had had in parisian societyshe spoke of m and madame de connal and various persons with whom he had been intimate among others of the abb morellet ormond rejoiced to find that lady annaly knew he had been in the abb morellets distinguished society the happiest hopes for the future rose in his mind from perceiving that her ladyship by whatever means knew all that he had been doing in paris it seems that they had had accounts of him from several english travellers who had met him at paris and had heard him spoken of in different companies ormond took caregive him credit for it all who have ever been in loveeven in these first moments with the object of his present affection ormond took care to do justice to the absent dora whom he now never expected to see again he seized dexterously an opportunity in reply to something lady annaly said about the connals to observe that madame de connal was not only much admired for her beauty at paris but that she did honour to ireland by having preserved her reputation young and without a guide as she was in dissipated french society with few examples of conjugal virtues to preserve in her mind the precepts and habits of her british education he was glad of this opportunity to give as he now did with all the energy of truth the result of his feelings and reflections on what he had seen of the modes of living among the french their superior pleasures of society and their want of our domestic happiness while ormond was speaking both the mother and daughter could not help admiring in the midst of his moralizing the great improvement which had been made in his appearance and manners with all his own characteristic frankness he acknowledged the impression which french gaiety and the brilliancy of parisian society had at first made upon him he was glad however that he had now seen all that the imagination often paints as far more delightful than it really is he had thank heaven passed through this course of dissipation without losing his taste for better and happier modes of life the last few months though they might seem but a splendid or feverish dream in his existence had in reality been he believed of essential service in confirming his principles settling his character and deciding for ever his taste and judgment after full opportunity of comparison in favour of his own countryand especially of his own countrywomen lady annaly smiled benignantly and after observing that this seemingly unlucky excursion which had begun in anger had ended advantageously to mr ormond and after having congratulated him upon having saved his fortune and established his character solidly she left him to plead his own cause with her daughterin her heart cordially wishing him success what he said or what florence answered we do not know but we are perfectly sure that if we did the repetition of it would tire the reader lady annaly and tea waited for them with great patience to an unusually late which they conceived to be an unusually early hour the result of this conversation was that ormond remained with them in this beautiful retirement in devonshire the next day and the next andhow many days are not precisely recorded a blank was left for the number which the editor of these memoirs does not dare to fill up at random lest some mrs mcrule should exclaim scandalously too long to keep the young man thereor scandalously too short a courtship after all it is humbly requested that every young lady of delicacy and feeling will put herself in the place of florence annalythen imagining the man she most approves of to be in the place of mr ormond she will be pleased to fill up the blank with what number of days she may think proper when the happy day was named it was agreed that they should return to ireland to annaly and that their kind friend dr cambray should be the person to complete that union which he had so long foreseen and so anxiously desired those who wish to hear something of estates as well as of weddings should be told that about the same time ormond received letters from marcus oshane and from m de connal marcus informing him that the estate of castle hermitage was to be sold by the commissioners of bankrupts and beseeching him to bid for it that it might not be sold under value m de connal also besought his dear friend mr ormond to take the black islands off his hands for they encumbered him terribly no wonder living as he did at paris with his head at versailles and his heart in a faro bank ormond could not oblige both the gentlemen though they had each pressing reasons for getting rid speedily of their property and were assured that he would be the most agreeable purchaser castle hermitage was the finest estate and by far the best bargain but other considerations weighed with our hero while sir ulick oshanes son and natural representative was living banished by debts from his native country ormond could not bear to take possession of castle hermitage for the black islands he had a fondnessthey were associated with all the tender recollections of his generous benefactor he should hurt no ones feelings by this purchaseand he might do a great deal of good by carrying on his old friends improvements and by farther civilizing the people of the islands all of whom were warmly attached to him they considered prince harry as the lawful representative of their dear king corny and actually offered up prayers for his coming again to reign over them to those who think that the mind is a kingdom of yet more consequence than even that of the black islands it may be agreeable to hear that ormond continued to enjoy the empire which he had gained over himself and to maintain that high character which in spite of his neglected education and of all the adverse circumstances to which he was early exposed he had formed for himself by resolute energy lady annaly with the pride of affection gloried in the full accomplishment of her prophecies and was rewarded in the best manner for that benevolent interest which she had early taken in our heros improvement by seeing the perfect felicity that subsisted between her daughter and ormond the end
