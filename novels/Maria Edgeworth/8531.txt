collingwood to her husband as she looked out of the window the slight figure of a young person in deep mourning appeared between the treeshow slowly she walks she looks very unhappy yes said mr collingwood with a sigh she is young to know sorrow and to struggle with difficulties to which she is quite unsuited both by nature and by education difficulties which no one could ever have foreseen how changed are all her prospects changed indeed said mrs collingwood pretty young creaturedo you recollect how gay she was when first we came to cecilhurst and even last year when she had hopes of her uncles recovery and when he talked of taking her to london how she enjoyed the thoughts of going there the world was bright before her then how cruel of that uncle with all his fondness for her never to think what was to become of her the moment he was dead to breed her up as an heiress and leave her a beggar but what is to be done my dear said her husband i am sure i do not know i can only feel for her you must think for her then i think i must tell her directly of the state in which her uncles affairs are left and that there is no provision for her not yet my dear said mrs collingwood i dont mean about there being no provision for herself that would not strike her but her uncles debtsthere is the point she would feel dreadfully the disgrace to his memoryshe loved him so tenderly yet it must be told said mr collingwood resolutely and perhaps it will be better now she will feel it less while her mind is absorbed by grief for him helen was the only daughter of colonel and lady anne stanley her parents had both died when she was too young to know her loss nor had she ever felt till now that she was an orphan for she had been adopted and brought up with the greatest tenderness by her uncle dean stanley a man of genius learning and sincere piety with the most affectionate heart and a highly cultivated understanding but on one subject he really had not common sense in money matters he was inconceivably imprudent and extravagant extravagant from charity from taste from habit he possessed rich benefices in the church and an ample private fortune and it was expected that his niece would be a great heiresshe had often said so himself and his fondness for her confirmed every one in this belief but the deans taste warred against his affection his too hospitable magnificent establishment had exceeded his income he had too much indulged his passion for all the fine arts of which he was a liberal patron he had collected a magnificent library and had lavished immense sums of money on architectural embellishments cursed with too fine a taste and with too soft a hearta heart too well knowing how to yield never could he deny himself much less any other human being any gratification which money could command and soon the necessary consequence was that he had no money to command his affairs fell into embarrassmenthis estate was sold but as he continued to live with his accustomed hospitality and splendour the world believed him to be as rich as ever some rise superior from the pressure of pecuniary difficulties but that was not the case with dean stanley not from want of elasticity of mind but perhaps because his ingenuity continually suggested resources and his sanguine character led him to plunge into speculationsthey failed and in the anxiety and agitation which his embarrassments occasioned him he fell into bad health his physicians ordered him to italy helen his devoted nurse the object upon which all his affections centered accompanied him to florence there his health and spirits seemed at first by the change of climate to be renovated but in italy he found fresh temptations to extravagance his learning and his fancy combined to lead him on from day to day to new expense and he satisfied his conscience by saying to himself that all the purchases which he now made were only so much capital which would when sold in england bring more than their original price and would he flattered himself increase the fortune he intended for his niece but one day while he was actually bargaining for an antique he was seized with a fit of apoplexy from this fit he recovered and was able to return to england with his niece here he found his debts and difficulties had been increasing he was harassed with doubts as to the monied value of his lastchosen chefdoeuvres his mind preyed upon his weakened frame he was seized with another fit lost his speech and after struggles the most melancholy for helen to see conscious as she was that she could do nothing for himhe expiredhis eyes fixed on her face and his powerless hand held between both hers all was desolation and dismay at the deanery helen was removed to the vicarage by the kindness of the good vicar and his wife mr and mrs collingwood it was found that the dean instead of leaving a large fortune had nothing to leave all he had laid out at the deanery was sunk and gone his real property all sold his imaginary wealth his pictures statueshis whole collection even his books his immense library shrunk so much in value when estimated after his death that the demands of the creditors could not be nearly answered as to any provision for miss stanley that was out of the question these were the circumstances which mrs collingwood feared to reveal and which mr collingwood thought should be told immediately to helen but hitherto she had been so much absorbed in sorrow for the uncle she had loved that no one had ventured on the task though mr and mrs collingwood had not known her long for they had but lately come to the neighbourhood they had the greatest sympathy for her orphan state and they had seen enough of her during her uncles illness to make them warmly attached to her every body loved her that knew her rich or poor for in her young prosperity from her earliest childhood she had been always sweettempered and kindhearted for though she had been bred up in the greatest luxury educated as heiress to a large fortune taught every accomplishment used to every fashionable refinement she was not spoiledshe was not in the least selfish indeed her uncles indulgence excessive though it was had been always joined with so much affection that it had early touched her heart and filled her whole soul with ardent gratitude it is said that the ill men do lives after themthe good is oft interred with their bones it was not so with dean stanley the good he had intended for helen his large fortune was lost and gone but the real good he had done for his niece remained in full force and to the honour of his memory the excellent education he had given herit was excellent not merely in the worldly meaning of the word as regards accomplishments and elegance of manners but excellent in having given her a firm sense of duty as the great principle of action and as the guide of her naturally warm generous affections and now when helen returned from her walk mr collingwood in the gentlest and kindest manner he was able informed her of the confusion in her uncles affairs the debts the impossibility of paying the creditors the total loss of all fortune for herself mrs collingwood had well foreseen the effect this intelligence would have on helen at first with fixed incredulous eyes she could not believe that her uncle could have been in any way to blame twice she askedare you sureare you certainis there no mistake and when the conviction was forced upon her still her mind did not take in any part of the facts as they regarded herself astonished and shocked she could feel nothing but the disgrace that would fall upon the memory of her beloved uncle then she exclaimedone part of it is not true i am certain and hastily leaving the room she returned immediately with a letter in her hand which without speaking she laid before mr collingwood who wiped his spectacles quickly and read it was addressed to the poor dean and was from an old friend of his colonel munro stating that he had been suddenly ordered to india and was obliged to return a sum of money which the dean had many years before placed in his hands to secure a provision for his niece miss stanley this letter had arrived when the dean was extremely ill helen had been afraid to give it to him and yet thought it right to do so the moment her uncle had read the letter which he was still able to do and to comprehend though he was unable to speak he wrote on the back with difficulty in a sadly trembling hand yet quite distinctly these wordsthat money is yours helen stanley no one has any claim upon it when i am gone consult mr collingwood consider him as your guardian mr collingwood perceived that this provision had been made by the dean for his niece before he had contracted his present debtsmany years before when he had sold his paternal estate and that knowing his own disposition to extravagance he had put this sum out of his own power rightall right my dear miss stanley said the vicar i am very gladit is all justly yours no said helen i shall never touch it take it my dear mr collingwood take it and pay all the debts before any one can complain mr collingwood pressed her to him without speaking but after a moments recollection he repliedno no my dear child i cannot let you do this as your guardian i cannot allow such a young creature as you are in a moment of feeling thus to give away your whole earthly fortuneit must not be it must indeed it must my dear sir oh pay everybody at oncedirectly no not directly at all events said mr collingwoodcertainly not directly the law allows a year but if the money is ready said helen i cannot understand why the debt should not be paid at once is there any law against paying people immediately mr collingwood half smiled and on the strength of that half smile helen concluded that he wholly yielded yes do cried she send this money this instant to mr james the solicitor he knows all about it you say and he will see everybody paid stay my dear miss stanley said the vicar i cannot consent to this and you should be thankful that i am steady if i were at this minute to consent and to do what you desirepay away your whole fortune you would repent and reproach me with my folly before the end of the yearbefore six months were over never never said helen mrs collingwood strongly took her husbands side of the question helen could have no idea she said how necessary money would be to her it was quite absurd to think of living upon air could miss stanley think she was to go on in this world without money helen said she was not so absurd she reminded mrs collingwood that she should still have what had been her mothers fortune before helen had well got out the words mrs collingwood replied that will never do you will never be able to live upon that the interest of lady anne stanleys fortune i know what it was would just do for pocketmoney for you in the style of life for which you have been educated some of your uncles great friends will of course invite you presently and then you will find what is requisite with that set of people some of my uncles friends perhaps will said helen but i am not obliged to go to great or fine people and if i cannot afford it i will not for i can live independently on what i have be it ever so little mrs collingwood allowed that if helen were to live always in the country in retirement she might do upon her mothers fortune wherever i livewhatever becomes of me the debts must be paidi will do it myself and she took up a pen as she spokei will write to mr james by this days post surprised at her decision of manner and the firmness of one in general so gentle yielding and retired and feeling that he had no legal power to resist mr collingwood at last gave way so far as to agree that he would in due time use this money in satisfying her uncles creditors provided she lived for the next six months within her income helen smiled as if that were a needless proviso i warn you continued mr collingwood that you will most probably find before six months are over that you will want some of this money to pay debts of your own no no no cried she of that there is not the slightest chance and now my dear child said mrs collingwood now that mr collingwood has promised to do what you wish will you do what we wish will you promise to remain with us to live here with us for the present at least we will resign you whenever better friends may claim you but for the present will you try us try in a transport of gratitude and affection she could only repeat the words try oh my dear friends how happy i am an orphan without a relation to have such a home but though mr and mrs collingwood childless as they were felt real happiness in having such a companionsuch an adopted daughter yet they were sure that some of dean stanleys great friends and acquaintance in high life would ask his niece to spend the spring in town or the summer in the country with them and post after post came letters of condolence to miss stanley from all these personages of high degree professing the greatest regard for their dear amiable friends memory and for miss stanley his and their dear helen and these polite and kind expressions were probably sincere at the moment but none of these dear friends seemed to think of taking any trouble on her account or to be in the least disturbed by the idea of never seeing their dear helen again in the course of their lives helen quite touched by what was said of her uncle thought only of him but when she showed the letters to mr and mrs collingwood they marked the oversight and looked significantly as they read folded the letters up and returned them to helen in silence afterwards between themselves they indulged in certain comments lady c does not invite her for she has too many daughters and they are too ugly and helen is too beautiful said mrs collingwood lady l has too many sons said mr collingwood and they are too poor and helen is not an heiress now but old lady margaret dawe who has neither sons nor daughters what stands in the way there oh her delicate healthdelicate health is a blessing to some peopleexcuses them always from doing anything for anybody then came many who hoped in general to see miss stanley as soon as possible and some who were very anxious indeed to have their dear helen with them but when or where never specifiedand a general invitation as every body knows means nothing but good morning to you mrs coldstream ends with i forbear to say more at present without giving any reason and here is the deans dear duchess always in the greatest haste with you know my heart in a parenthesis ever and ever most sincerely and affecyours and the davenants continued mrs collingwood who were such near neighbours and who were so kind to the dean at florence they have not even written but they are at florence still said mr collingwood they can hardly have heard of the poor deans death the davenants were the great people of this part of the country their place cecilhurst was close to the deanery and to the vicarage but they were not known to the collingwoods who had come to cecilhurst during the deans absence abroad and here is mrs wilmot too continued mrs collingwood wondering as usual at everybody else wondering that lady barker has not invited miss stanley to castleport and it never enters into mrs wilmots head that she might invite her to wilmots fort and this is friendship as the world goes and as it has been ever since the beginning of the world and will be to the end replied mr collingwood only i thought in dean stanleys casehowever i am glad his niece does not see it as we do nowith all helens natural quickness of sensibility she suspected nothing saw nothing in each excuse but what was perfectly reasonable and kind she was sure that her uncles friends could not mean to neglect her in short she had an undoubting belief in those she loved and she loved all those who she thought had loved her uncle or who had ever shown her kindness helen had never yet experienced neglect or detected insincerity and nothing in her own true and warm heart could suggest the possibility of doubledealing or even of coldness in friendship she had yet to learn that no afterfriendship eer can raze th endearments of our early days and neer the heart such fondness prove as when it first began to love ere lovely nature is expelled and friendship is romantic held but prudence comes with hundred eyes the veil is rent the vision flies the dear illusions will not last the era of enchantments past the wild romance of life is done the real history begun chapter ii some time after this mr collingwood rising from the breakfasttable threw down the days paper saying there was nothing in it mrs collingwood glancing her eye over it exclaimed do you call this nothing helen hear this marriage in high lifeat the ambassadors chapel paris on the th instant general clarendon to lady cecilia davenant only daughter of earl and countess davenant married absolutely married exclaimed helen i knew it was to be but so soon i did not expect ambassadors chapelwhere did you sayparis no that must be a mistake they are all at florencesettled there i thought their letters said mrs collingwood pointed to the paragraph and helen saw it was certainly paristhere could be no mistake here was a full account of the marriage and a list of all the fashionables who attended the fair bride to the hymeneal altar her father gave her away then certainly it is so said helen and she came to the joyful conclusion that they must all be on their way homedear lady davenant coming to cecilhurst again lady cecilia the fair bride had been helens most intimate friend they had been when children much together for the deanery was so close to cecilhurst that the shrubbery opened into the park but is it not rather extraordinary my dear helen said mrs collingwood that you should see this account of your dear lady cecilias marriage in the public papers only without having heard of it from any of your friends themselvesnot one letter not one line from any of them a cloud came over helens face but it passed quickly and she was sure they had writtensomething had delayed their letters she was certain lady davenant or lady cecilia had written or if they had not it was because they could not possibly in such a hurry such agitation as they must have been in at all events whether they had written or not she was certain they could not mean anything unkind she could not change her opinion of her friend for a letter more or less indeed said mrs collingwood how long is it since you have seen them about two years just two years it is since i parted from them at florence and you have corresponded with lady cecilia constantly ever since asked mrs collingwood not constantly not constantlyoh said mrs collingwood in a prolonged and somewhat sarcastic tone not constantlyso much the better said her husband a constant correspondence is always a great burthen and moreover sometimes a great evil between young ladies especiallyi hate the sight of ladies long crossbarred letters helen said that lady cecilias letters were never crossbarred always short and far between you seem wonderfully fond of lady cecilia said mrs collingwood not wonderfully replied helen but very fond and no wonder we were bred up together andcontinued she after a little pause and if lady cecilia had not been so generous as she is she might have beenshe must have been jealous of the partiality the fondness which her mother always showed me but was not lady davenants heart large enough to hold two asked mrs collingwood was not she fond of her daughter yes as far as she knew her but she did not know lady cecilia not know her own daughter mr and mrs collingwood both at once exclaimed how could that possibly be very easily helen said because she saw so little of her was not lady cecilia educated at home yes but still lady cecilia when a child was all day long with her governess and at cecilhurst the governesss apartments were quite out of the way in one of the wings at the end of a long corridor with a separate staircase she might as well have been in another house bad arrangement said mr collingwood speaking to himself as he stood on the hearth bad arrangement which separates mother and daughter at that time continued helen there was always a great deal of company at cecilhurst lord davenant was one of the ministers then i believei know he saw a great many political people and lady davenant was forced to be always with them talking talking yes yes said mr collingwood i understand it alllady davenant is a great politician and female politicians with their heads full of the affairs of europe cannot have time to think of the affairs of their families what is the matter my dear helen said mrs collingwood taking her hand helen had tears in her eyes and looked unhappy i have done very wrong said she i have said something that has given you a bad a false opinion of one for whom i have the greatest admiration and loveof lady davenant i am excessively sorry i have done very wrong not the least my dear child you told us nothing but what everybody knowsthat she is a great politician you told us no more but i should have told you more and what nobody knows better than i do cried helen that lady davenant is a great deal more and a great deal better than a politician i was too young to judge you may think but young as i was i could see and feel and children can and do often see a great deal into character and i assure you lady davenants is a sort of deep high character that you would admire mrs collingwood observed with surprise that helen spoke of her with even more enthusiasm than of her dear lady cecilia yes because she is a person more likely to excite enthusiasm you did not feel afraid of her then i do not say that replied helen yet it was not fear exactly it was more a sort of awe but still i liked it it is so delightful to have something to look up to i love lady davenant all the better even for that awe i felt of her and i like you all the better for everything you feel think and say about your friends cried mrs collingwood but let us see what they will do when i see whether they can write and what they write to you i will tell you more of my mindif any letters come if helen repeated but would say no moreand there it rested or at least stopped by common consent the subject was not recurred to for several days every morning at posttime helens colour rose with expectation and then faded with disappointment still with the same confiding look she said i am sure it is not their fault time will show said mrs collingwood at length one morning when she came down to breakfast triumph my dear helen cried mrs collingwood holding up two large letters all scribbled over with try this place and try that missent to crosskeysover moor and heaven knows whereandno matter helen seized the packets and tore them open one was from paris written immediately after the news of dean stanleys death it contained two letters one from lady davenant the other from lady ceciliawritten only think cried she how kindthe very day before her marriage signed cecilia davenant for the last timeand lady davenant tooto think of me in all their happiness she opened the other letters written since their arrival in england she read eagerly onthen stopped and her looks changed lady davenant is not coming to cecilhurst lord davenant is to be sent ambassador to petersburgh and lady davenant will go along with himoh there is an end of everything i shall never see her againstayshe is to be first with lady cecilia at clarendon park wherever that is for some timeshe does not know how longshe hopes to see me thereoh how kind how delightful helen put lady davenants letter proudly into mrs collingwoods hand and eagerly opened lady cecilias so like herself so like cecilia cried she mrs collingwood read and acknowledged that nothing could be kinder for here was an invitation not vague or general but particular and pressing as heart could wish or heart could make it we shall be at clarendon park on thursday and shall expect you dearest helen on monday just time the general says for an answer so write and say where horses shall meet you c c upon my word this is being in earnest when it comes to horses meeting cried mr collingwood of course you will go directly helen was in great agitation writewritemy dear directly said mrs collingwood for the postboy waits and before she had written many lines the crosspost boy sent up word that he could wait no longer helen wrote she scarcely knew what but in short an acceptance signed sealed delivered and then she took breath off cantered the boy with the letters bagged and scarcely was he out of sight when helen saw under the table the cover of the packet in which were some lines that had not yet been read they were in lady cecilias handwritinga postscript i forgot dear helen the thing that is most essential you remember our friend dumonts definition of une betse cest doublier la chose essentielle i forgot to tell you that the general declares he will not hear of a mere visit from you he bids me tell you that it must be till death or marriage so my dear friend you must make up your mind in short to live with us till you find a general clarendon of your own to this postscript no replysilence gives consent if i had seen this said helen as she laid it before mr and mrs collingwood i ought to have answered but indeed i never saw it she sprang forward instantly to ring the bell exclaiming it is time yetstop the boysilence gives consent i must write i cannot leave you my dear friends in this way i did not see that postscript believe me i did not they believed her they thanked her but they would not let her ring the bell they said she had better not bind herself in any way either to themselves or to lady cecilia accept of the present invitation she mustshe must go to see her friend on her marriage she must take leave of her dear lady davenant before her departure they are older friends than we are said mr collingwood they have the first claim upon you but let us think of it as only a visit now as to a residence for life that you can best judge of for yourself after you have been some time at clarendon park if you do not like to remain there you know how gladly we shall welcome you here again my child or if you decide to live with those you have known so long and loved so much we cannot be offended at your choice this generous kindness this freedom from jealous susceptibility touched helens heart and increased her agitation she could not bear the thoughts of either the reality or appearance of neglecting these kind good people the moment she had other prospects and frequently in all the hurry of her preparations she repeated it will only be a visit at clarendon park i will return to you i shall write to you my dear mrs collingwood at all events constantly when mr collingwood gave her his parting blessing he reminded her of his warning about her fortune mrs collingwood reminded her of her promise to write the carriage drove from the door helens heart was full of the friends she was leaving but by degrees the agitation of the parting subsided her tears ceased her heart grew lighter and the hopes of seeing her friends at clarendon park arose bright in her mind and her thoughts all turned upon cecilia and lady davenant chapter iii helen looked eagerly out of the carriagewindow for the first view of clarendon park it satisfiedit surpassed her expectations it was a fine aristocratic placeancestral trees and a vast expanse of park herds of deer yellow and dark or spotted their heads appearing in the distance just above the fern or grazing near startled as the carriage passed through the long approach she caught various views of the house partly gothic partly of modern architecture it seemed of great extent and magnificence all delightful so far but now for her own reception her breath grew quick and quicker as she came near and nearer to the house some one was standing on the steps was it general clarendon no only a servant the carriage stopped more servants appeared and as helen got out a very sublimelooking personage informed her that lady cecilia and the general were out ridingonly in the parkwould be in immediately and as she crossed the great hall the same sublime person informed her that there would be still an hour before dinnertime and inquired whether she would be pleased to be shown to her own apartment or to the library helen felt chilled and disappointed because this was not exactly the way she had expected things would be upon her arrival she had pictured to herself cecilia running to meet her in the hall without answering the groom of the chambers she asked is lady davenant out too no her ladyship is in the library to the library then and through the antechamber she passed rapidly impatient of a momentary stop of her conductor to open the foldingdoors while a man with a letterbox in hand equally impatient begged that lady davenant might be told the generals express was waiting lady davenant was sealing letters in great haste for this express but when the door opened and she saw helen she threw wax and letter from her and pushing aside the sofatable came forward to receive her with open arms all was in an instant happy in helens heart but there was the man of the letterbox he must be attended to beg your pardon helen my dearone moment letters of consequencemust not be delayed by the time the letters were finished before they were gone lady cecilia came in the same as ever with affectionate delight in her eyesher beautiful eyes the same yes the same cecilia as ever yet different less of a girl less lively but more happy the moment she had embraced her lady cecilia turned quick to present general clarendon thinking he had followed but he had stopped in the hall send off the letters were the first words of his which helen heard the tone commanding the voice remarkably gentlemanlike an instant afterwards he came in a fine figure a handsome man in the prime of life with a highborn highbred military air english decidedlyproudly english something of the old schoolcomposed selfpossession with voluntary deference to othersrather distant helen felt that his manner of welcoming her to clarendon park was perfectly polite yet she would have liked it better had it been less politemore cordial lady cecilia whose eyes were anxiously upon her drew her arm within hers and hurried her out of the room she stopped at the foot of the stairs gathered up the folds of her ridingdress and turning suddenly to helen said helen my dear you must not think that think what said helen think thatfor which you are now blushing oh you know what i mean helen your thoughts are just as legible in your face as they always were to me his manner is reservedcold may bebut not his heart understand this prayonce for all do you will you dearest helen i do i will cried helen and every minute she felt that she better understood and was more perfectly pleased with her friend lady cecilia showed her through the apartment destined for her which she had taken the greatest pleasure in arranging everything there was not only most comfortable but particularly to her taste and some little delicate proofs of affection recollections of childhood were therekeepsakes early drawings nonsensical things not worth preserving but still preserved look how near we are together said cecilia opening a door into her own dressingroom you may shut this up whenever you please but i hope you will never please to do so you see how i leave you your own free will as friends usually do with a proviso a hope at least that you are never to use it on any accountlike the childs half guinea pocketmoney never to be changed her playful tone relieved as she intended it should helens too keen emotion and this too was felt with the quickness with which every touch of kindness ever was felt by her helen pressed her friends hand and smiled without speaking they were to be some time alone before the commencement of bridal visits and an expected succession of troops of friends this was a time of peculiar enjoyment to helen she had leisure to grow happy in the feeling of reviving hopes from old associations she did not forget her promise to write to mrs collingwood nor afterwards to her credit be it here markedeven when the house was full of company and when by amusement or by feeling she was most pressed for timedid she ever omit to write to those excellent friends those who best know the difficulty will best appreciate this proof of the reality of her gratitude as lady cecilia was a great deal with her husband riding or walking helen had opportunities of being much alone with lady davenant who now gave her a privilege that she had enjoyed in former times at cecilhurst that of entering her apartment in the morning at all hours without fear of being considered an intruder the first morning however on seeing her ladyship immersed in papers with a brow of care deeply intent helen paused on the threshold i am afraid i interrupti am afraid i disturb you come in helen come in cried lady davenant looking up and the face of care was cleared and there was a radiance of pleasureinterruptyes disturbno often in your little life helen you have interruptednever disturbed me from the time you were a child till this moment never did i see you come into my room without pleasure then sweeping away heaps of papers she made room for helen on the sofa beside her now tell me how things are with yousomewhat i have heard reported of my friend the deans affairstell me all helen told all as briefly as possible she hurried on through her uncles affairs with a tremulous voice and before she could come to a conclusion lady davenant exclaimed i foresaw it long since with all my friends virtues all his talentsbut we will not go back upon the painful past you my dear helen have done just what i should have expected from yourightright too the condition mr collingwood has madevery right and now to the next pointwhere are you to live helen or rather with whom helen was not quite sure yet she said she had not quite determined am i to understand that your doubt lies between the collingwoods and my daughter yes cecilia most kindly invited me but i do not know general clarendon yet and he does not know me yet cecilia might wish most sincerely that i should live with her and i am convinced she does but her husband must be considered true said lady davenanttrue a husband is certainly a thing to be cared forin scottish phrase and general clarendon is no doubt a person to be consideredbut it seems that i am not a person to be considered in your arrangements even the altered dry and almost acrid tone in which lady davenant spoke and the expression of disappointment in her countenancewere as marks of strong affection deeply gratifying to helen lady davenant went on was not cecilhurst always a home to you helen stanley yes yesalways a most happy home then why is not cecilhurst to be your home my dear lady davenant how kindhow very very kind of you to wish itbut i never thought of and why did you not think of it helen i meani thought you were going to russia and have you settled my dear helen said lady davenant smiling have you settled that i am never to come back from russia do not you know that you arethat you ever wereyou ever will be to me a daughter and drawing helen fondly towards her she added as my own very deari must not say dearest childmust not because as i well remember oncelittle creature as you were thenyou whispered to me never call me dearestgeneroushearted child and tears started into her eyes as she spoke but at that moment came a knock at the door a packet from lord davenant by mr mapletofft my lady helen rose to leave the room but lady davenant laid a detaining hand upon her saying you will not be in my way in the least and she opened her packet adding that while she read helen might amuse herself with arranging the books on that table or in looking over the letters in that portfolio helen had hitherto seen lady davenant only with the eyes of very early youth but now after an absence of two yearsa great space in her existence it seemed as if she looked upon her with new eyes and every hour made fresh discoveries in her character contrary to what too often happens when we again see and judge of those whom we have early known lady davenants character and abilities instead of sinking and diminishing appeared to rise and enlarge to expand and be ennobled to helens view strong lights and shades there were but these only excited and fixed her attention even her defectsthose inequalities of temper of which she had already had some example were interesting as evidences of the power and warmth of her affections the books on the table were those which lady davenant had had in her travelling carriage they gave helen an idea of the range and variety of the readers mind some of them were presentation copies as they are called from several of the first authors of our own and foreign countries some with dedications to lady davenant others with inscriptions expressing respect or propitiating favour or anxious for judgment the portfolio contained letters whose very signatures would have driven the first of modern autograph collectors distracted with joywhose meanest scrap would make a scrapbook the envy of the world but among the letters in this portfolio there were none of those nauseous notes of compliment none of those epistles adulatory degrading to those who write and equally degrading to those to whom they are written letters which are however cleverly turned inexpressibly wearisome to all but the parties concerned after opening and looking at the signature of several of these letters helen sat in a delightful embarras de richesse to read them allall at once was impossible with which to begin she could not determine one after another was laid aside as too good to be read first and after glancing at the contents of each she began to deal them round alphabetically till she was struck by a passage in one of themshe looked to the signature it was unknown to fameshe read the whole it was striking and interesting there were several letters in the same hand and helen was surprised to find them arranged according to their dates in lady davenants own writingpreserved with those of persons of illustrious reputation these she read on without further hesitation there was no sort of affectation in themquite easy and natural real feeling and genius certainly genius she thoughtand there seemed something romantic and uncommon in the character of the writer they were signed granville beauclerc who could he be this granville beauclerc she read on till lady davenant having finished her packet rang a silver handbell as was her custom to summon her page at the first tingle of the bell helen started and lady davenant asked whose letter my dear has so completely abstracted you carlos the page came in at this instant and after a quick glance at the handwriting of the letters lady davenant gave her orders in portuguese to carlos and then returning to helen took no further notice of the letters but went on just where she had left off helen i remember when you were about nine years old timid as you usually were your coming forward bold as a little lion to attack me in cecilias defence i forget the particulars but i recollect that you said i was unjust and that i did not know cecilia and there you were right so to reward you you shall see that now i do her perfect justice and that i am as fond of her as your heart can wish i really never did know cecilia till i saw her heartily in love i had imagined her incapable of real love i thought the desire of pleasing universally had been her ruling passionthe ruling passion that of a little mind and a cold heart but i did her wrong in another more material point too i was mistaken lady davenant paused and looked earnestly at helen whose eyes said i am glad and yet she was not quite certain she knew to what she alluded cecilia righted herself and won my good opinion by the openness with which she treated me from the very commencement of her attachment to general clarendon lady davenant again paused to reflect and played for some moments with the tablets in her hand some one says that we are apt to flatter ourselves that we leave our faults when our faults leave us from change of situation age and so forth and perhaps it does not signify much which it is if the faults are fairly gone and if there be no danger of their returning all our former misunderstandings arose on cecilias part from cowardice of character on mine fromno matter whatno matter which of us was most wrong true true cried helen eagerly and anxious to prevent recurrence to painful recollections she went on to ask rapidly several questions about cecilias marriage lady davenant smiled and promised that she should have the whole history of the marriage in true gossip detail when i wrote to you i gave you some general ideas on the subject but there are little things which could not well be written even to so safe a young friend as you are for what is written remains and often for those by whom it was never intended to be seen the dessoux des cartes can seldom be either safely or satisfactorily shown on paper so give me my embroideryframe i never can tell well without having something to do with my hands and as helen set the embroideryframe lady davenant searched for some skeins of silk and silk winders take these my dear and wind this silk for me for i must have my hearer comfortably established not like the agonised listener in the world leaning against a table with the corner running into him all the time chapter iv i must go back continued lady davenant quite to the dark ages the time when i knew nothing of my daughters character but by the accidental lights which you afforded me i will take up my story before the reformation in the middle ages when you and your dear uncle left us at florence about two years ago when cecilia was in the height of her conquests about the time when a certain colonel daubiguy flourished you remember him helen answered yes in rather a constrained voice which caused lady davenant to look up and on seeing that look of inquiry helen coloured though she would have given the world not to be so foolish the affair was cecilias and helen only wished not to have it recurred to and yet she had now by colouring done the very thing to fix lady davenants attention and as the look was prolonged she coloured more and more i see i was wrong said lady davenant i had thought colonel daubignys ecstasy about that miniature of you was only a feint but i see he really was an admirer of yours helen of mine oh no never still from her fear of saying something that should implicate cecilia her tone though she spoke exactly the truth was not to lady davenants discriminative ear quite naturalhelen seeing doubt added impossible my dear lady davenant you know i was then so young quite a child no no not quite two from eighteen and sixteen remain i think and in our days sixteen is not absolutely a child helen made no answer her thoughts had gone back to the time when colonel daubigny was first introduced to her which was just before her uncles illness and when her mind had been so engrossed by him that she had but a confused recollection of all the rest now you are right my dear said lady davenant right to be absolutely silent in difficult cases say nothing but still you are wrong in sitting so uneasily under it for that seems as if there was something nothing upon earth cried helen if you would not look at me so my clear lady davenant then my dear helen do not break my embroidery silk that jerk was imprudent and trust me my dear the screw of that silk winder is not so much to blame as you would have me think take patience with yourself and with me there is no great harm done no unbearable imputation you are not accused of loving or liking only of having been admired never cried helen well well it does not signify in the least now the man is either dying or dead i am glad of it cried helen how barbarous said lady davenant but let it pass i am neither glad nor sorry contempt is more dignified and safer than hatred my dear now to return to cecilia soon after i will not say the daubigny era but soon after you left us i fell sick cecilia was excessively kind to me in kindness her affectionate heart never failed and i felt this the more from a consciousness that i had been a little harsh to her i recovered but slowly i could not bear to have her confined so long in a sick room and yet i did not much like either of the chaperons with whom she went out though they were both of rank and of unimpeachable characterthe one english one of the best women in the world but the most stupid the other a foreigner one of the most agreeable women in the world but the most false i prevailed on cecilia to break off thati do not know what to call it friendship it was not and my daughter and i drew nearer together better times began to dawn but still there was little sympathy between us my mind was intent on lord davenants interests hers on amusement and admiration her conquests were numerous and she gloried in their number for between you and me cecilia was before the reformation not a little of a coquette you will not allow it you did not see it you did not go out with her and being three or four years younger you could not be a very good critic of cecilias conduct and depend upon it i am right she was not a little of a coquette she did not know and i am sure i did not know that she had a heart till she became acquainted with general clarendon the first time we met himobserving a quickening of attention in helens eyes lady davenant smiled and said young ladies always like to hear of the first time we saw himthe first time we saw general clarendon wasforgive me the day of the monthin the gallery at florence i forget how it happened that he had not been presented to meto lord davenant he must have been but so it was and it was new to cecilia to see a man of his appearance who had not on his first arrival shown himself ambitious to be made known to her he was admiring a beautiful magdalene and he was standing with his back towards us i recollect that his appearance when i saw him as a strangerthe time when one can best judge of appearancestruck me as that of a distinguished person but little did i think that there stood cecilias husband so little did my maternal instinct guide me as we approached he turned and gave one look at cecilia she gave one look at him he passed on she stopped me to examine the picture which he had been admiring every english mother at florence except myself had their eyes fixed upon general clarendon from the moment of his arrival but whatever i may have been or may have been supposed to be on the great squares of politics i believe i never have been accused or even suspected of being a manoeuvrer on the small domestic scale my reputation for imbecility in these matters was perhaps advantageous he did not shun me as he did the tribe of knowing ones a hundred reports flew about concerning him settling in one that he was resolved never to marry yet he was a passionate admirer of beauty and grace and it was said that he had never been unsuccessful where he had wished to please the secret of his resolution against marriage was accounted for by the gossiping public in many ways variously absurd the fact was that in his own family and in that of a particular friend there had been about this time two or three scandalous intrigues followed by the public brand of shameful life one of these sad affairs as they are styled was marked with premeditated treachery and turpitude the lady had been or had seemed to be for years a pattern wife the mother of several children yet she had long betrayed and at last abandoned a most amiable and confiding husband and went off with a man who did not love her who cared for nought but himself a disgusting monster of selfishness vanity and vice this woman was said to have been once good but to have been corrupted and depraved by residence abroadby the contagion of foreign profligacy in the other instance the seduced wife had been originally most amiable pureminded uncommonly beautiful loved to idolatry by her husband clarendons particular friend a man high in public estimation the husband shot himself the seducer was its said the ladys first love that these circumstances should have made a deep impression on clarendon is natural the more feelingthe stronger the mind the more deep and lasting it was likely to be besides his resolution against marriage in general we heard that he had specially resolved against marrying any travelled lady and most especially against any woman with whom there was danger of a first love how this danger was to be avoided or ascertained mothers and daughters looked at one another and did not ask or at least did not answer cecilia apparently unconcerned heard and laughed at these high resolves after her gay fashion with her young companions and marvelled how long the resolution would be kept general clarendon of course could not but be introduced to us could not but attend our assemblies nor could he avoid meeting us in all the good english and foreign society at florence but whenever he met us he always kept at a safe distance this caution marked his sense of danger to avoid its being so construed perhaps he made approaches to me politely cold we talked very wisely on the state of the continent and the affairs of europe i did not however confine myself or him to politics i gave him many unconscious opportunities of showing in conversation not his abilities for they are nothing extraordinary but his character which is firstrate gleams came out of a character born to subjugate to captivate to attach for life it worked first on cecilias curiosity she thought she was only curious and she listened at first humming an opera air between times with the least concerned look conceivable but her imagination was caught and it thenceforward through every thing that every body else might be saying and through all she said herself she heard every word that fell from our general and even all that was repeated of his saying at second or third hand so she learned in due season that he had seen women as handsome handsomer than lady cecilia davenant but that there was something in her manner peculiarly suited to his tastehis fastidious taste so free from coquetry he said she was and true perfectly true from the time he became acquainted with her no hypocrisy on her part no mistake on his at the first touch of a real love there was an end of vanity and coquetry then her deferenceher affection for her mother was so charming he thought such perfect confidencesuch quick intelligence between us no deceit here either only a little selfdeception on cecilias part she had really grown suddenly fonder of me what had become of her fear she did not know but i knew full well my new charm and my real merit i was a good and safe conductor of the electric shock it chanced one day when i was listening only as one listens to a man who is talking at another through oneself i did not immediately catch the meaning or i believe hear what the general said cecilia unawares answered for me and showed that she perfectly understoodhe bowedshe blushed man is usually quicksighted to womans blushes but our general was not vain only proud the blush he did not set down to his own account but very much to hers it was a proof he thought of so much simplicity of heart so unspoiled by the world so unlikein short so like the very woman he had painted in his fancy before he knew too much lady cecilia was now a perfect angel not one word of all this did he say but it was understood quite as well as if it had been spoken his lips were firm compressed and the whole outer man composedfrigidly coldyet through all this cecilia sawsuch is womans penetration in certain casescecilia saw what must sooner or later happen he still proud of his prudence refrained from word look or sigh resolved to be impassive till his judgment should be perfectly satisfied at last this judgment was perfectly satisfied that is he was passionately in lovefairly caught my dear in the strong toils of grace and he threw himself at cecilias feet she was not quite so much surprised as he expected but more pleased than he had ventured to hope there was that however in his proud humility which told cecilia there must be no trifling he either fears his fate too much or his deserts are small who fears to put it to the touch to win or lose it all he put it to the test and won it all general clarendon indeed is a man likely to win and keep the love of woman for this among other good reasons that love and honour being with him inseparable the idol he adores must keep herself at the height to which he has raised her or cease to receive his adoration she must be no common vulgar idol for every passing worshipper as lady davenant paused helen looked up hesitated and said i hope that general clarendon is not disposed to jealousy no hes too proud to be jealous replied lady davenant are proud men never jealous thought helen i mean continued lady davenant that general clarendon is too proud to be jealous of his wife for aught i know he might have felt jealousy of cecilia before she was his for then she was but a woman like another but once hisonce having set his judgment on the cast both the virtues and the defects of his character join in security for his perfect confidence in the wife his choice and passion both approve from temper and principle he is unchangeable i acknowledge that i think the general is a little inclined perhaps to obstinacy but as burke says though obstinacy is certainly a vice it happens that the whole line of the great and masculine virtues constancy fidelity fortitude magnanimity are closely allied to this disagreeable quality of which we have so just an abhorrence it is most peculiarly happy for cecilia that she has a husband of this firm character one on whom she can relyone to whom she may she must look up if not always yet upon all important occasions where decision is necessary or integrity required it is between her and her general as it should be in marriage each has the compensating qualities to those which the other possesses general clarendon is inferior to cecilia in wit but superior in judgment inferior in literature superior in knowledge of the world inferior to my daughter altogether in abilities in what is called genius but far superior in that ruling power strength of mind strength of mind is an attaching as well as a ruling power all human creatures women especially become attached to those who have power over their minds yes helen i am satisfied with their marriage and with your congratulations yours are the sort i like vulgar peopleby vulgar people i mean all who think vulgarlyvery great vulgar people have congratulated me upon this establishment of my daughters fortune and future rank a dukedom in view all that could be wished in worldly estimation but i rejoice in it as the security for my daughters character and happiness thank you again my dear young friend for your sympathy you can understand me you can feel with me sympathy intelligent quick warm unwearied unweariable such as helens is really a charming accomplishment in a friend the only obligation a proud person is never too proud to receive and it was most gratifying to helen to be allowed to sympathise with lady davenantone who in general never spoke of herself or unveiled her private feelings even to those who lived with her on terms of intimacy helen felt responsible for the confidence granted to her thus upon credit and a strong ambition was excited in her mind to justify the high opinion her superior friend had formed of her she determined to become all that she was believed to be as the flame of a taper suddenly rises towards what is held over it her spirit mounted to the point to which her friend pointed chapter v helens perfect happiness at clarendon park was not of long duration people who have not been by nature blessed or cursed with nice feelings or who have well rubbed off their delicacy in roughing through the world can be quite happy or at least happy enough without ascertaining whether they are really esteemed or liked by those with whom they live many and some of high degree when well sheltered and fed and provided with all the necessaries and surrounded by all the luxuries of life and with appearances tolerably well kept up by outward manner care little or nought about the inside sentiments but helen was neither of the casehardened philosophic or the naturally obtusefeeling class she belonged to the overanxious surrounded at clarendon park with all the splendour of life and with the immediate expectation of seeing and being seen by the first society in england with the certainty also of being tenderly loved and highly esteemed by two of the persons she was living with yet a doubt about the third began to make her miserable whether general clarendon really liked her or not was a question that hung upon her mind sometimes as a dead weightthen vibrating backwards and forwards she often called to mind and endeavoured to believe what cecilia the first day told her that this reserved manner was natural to him with strangers and would wear off but to her the icy coldness did not thaw so she felt or so she fancied and which it was she could not decide she had never before lived with any one about whose liking for her she could doubt therefore as she said to herself i know i am a bad judge she feared to open her mind to cecilia lady davenant would be the safest person to consult yet helen with all her young delicacy fresh about her scrupled and could not screw her courage to the stickingplace every morning going to lady davenants room she half resolved and yet came away without speaking at last one morning she began you said something the other day my dear lady davenant about a visit from miss clarendon perhapsi am afraidin short i thinki fear the general does not like my being here and i thought perhaps he was displeased at his sisters not being herethat he thought cecilias having asked me prevented his sisters coming but then you told me he was not of a jealous temper did not you distinguez said lady davenant distinguons as the old french metaphysicians used to say distinguons there be various kinds of jealousy as of love the old romancers make a distinction between amour and amour par amours whatever that mean i beg leave to take a distinction full as intelligible i trust between jalousie par amour and jalousie par amiti now to apply when i told you that our general was not subject to jealousy i should have distinguished and said jalousie par amourjealousy in love but i will not ensure him against jalousie par amitijealousy in friendshipof friends and relations i mean methinks i have seen symptoms of this in the general he does not like my influence over cecilia nor yours my dear i understand it all exclaimed helen and i was right from the very first i saw he disliked me and he ever will and must dislike and detest mei see it in every look hear it in every word in every tone now my dear helen if you are riding off on your imagination i wish you a pleasant ride and till you come back again i will write my letter said lady davenant taking up a pen helen begged pardon and protested she was not going to ride off upon any imaginationshe had no imagination nowshe entreated lady davenant to go on for she was very anxious to know the whole truth whatever it might be lady davenant laid down her pen and told her all she knew in the first place that cecilia did not like miss clarendon who though a very estimable person had a sort of uncompromising sincerity joined with a brusquerie of manner which cecilia could not endure how her daughter had managed matters to refuse the sister without offending the brother lady davenant said she did not know that was cecilias secret and probably it lay in her own charming manner of doing things aided by the whole affair having occurred a few days before marriage when nothing could be taken ill of the bride elect the general as cecilia told me desired that she would write to invite you helen she did so and i am very glad of it this is all i know of this mighty matter but helen could not endure the idea of being there contrary to the generals wishes in the place of the sister he loved oh how very very unfortunate she was to have all her hopes blighted destroyedand cecilias kindness all in vain dear dear ceciliabut for the whole world helen would not be so selfishshe would not run the hazard of making mischief she would never use her influence over cecilia in opposition to the general oh how little he knew of her character if he thought it possible helen had now come to tears then the keen sense of injustice turned to indignation and the tears wiped away and pride prevailing colouring she exclaimed that she knew what she ought to do she knew what she would doshe would not stay where the master of the house did not wish for her orphan though she was she could not accept of protection or obligation from any human being who neither liked or esteemed her she would shorten her visit at clarendon parkmake it as short as his heart could desireshe would never be the cause of any disagreementpoor dear kind cecilia she would write directly to mrs collingwood at the close of these last incoherent sentences helen was awestruck by the absolute composed immovability and silence of lady davenant helen stood rebuked before her instead of writing to mrs collingwood had not you better go at once said her ladyship speaking in a voice so calm and in a tone so slightly ironical that it might have passed for earnest on any but an acutely feeling earshall i ring and order your carriage putting her hand on the bell as she spoke and resting it there she continuedit would be so spirited to be off instantly so wise so polite so considerate towards dear ceciliaso dignified towards the general and so kind towards me who am going to a far country helen and may perhaps not see you ever again forgive me cried helen i never could go while you were here i did not know what you might think proper when you seemed to have lost your senses i have recovered them said helen i will do whatever you pleasewhatever you think best it must not be what i please my dear child nor what i think best but what you judge for yourself to be best else what will become of you when i am in russia it must be some higher and more stable principle of action that must govern you it must not be the mere wish to please this or that friendthe defect of your character helen remember i tell you is thisinordinate desire to be loved this impatience of not being lovedthat which but a moment ago made you ready to abandon two of the best friends you have upon earth because you imagine or you suspect or you fear that a third person almost a stranger does not like before he has had time to know you i was very foolish said helen but now i will be wise i will do whatever isright surely you would not have me live here if i were convinced that the master of the house did not wish it certainly notcertainly not repeated lady davenant but let us see our way before us never gallop my dear much less leap never move till you see your wayonce it is ascertained that general clarendon does not wish you to be here nor approve of you for the chosen companion of his wife i as your best friend would say begone and speed you on your way then as much pride as much spirit as you will but those who are conscious of possessing real spirit should never beseldom arein a hurry to show it that kind of ostentatious haste is undignified in man and ungraceful in woman helen promised that she would be patience itself but tell me exactly said she what you would have me do nothing said lady davenant nothing that is easy at least said helen smiling no not so easy as you imagine it requires sometimes no small share of strength of mind strength of mind said helen i am afraid i have not any acquire it then my dear said her friend but can i certainly strength of mind like strength of body is improved by exercise if i had any to begin with said helen you have some helen a great deal in one particular else why should i have any more regard for you or more hope of you than of any other welldressed welltaught beauty any of the tribe of young ladies who pass before me without ever fixing my minds eye for one moment but in what particular my dear lady davenant do you mean said helen anxiously i am afraid you are mistaken in what do you think i ever showed strength of mind tell me and i will tell you the truth that you will and there is the point that i mean ever since i have known you you have always as at this moment coward as you are been brave enough to speak the truth and truth i believe to be the only real lasting foundation for friendship in all but truth there is a principle of decay and dissolution now good bye my dearstay one word morethere is a line in some classic poet which says the suspicion of illwill never fails to produce itremember this in your intercourse with general clarendon show no suspicion of his bearing you illwill and to show none you must feel none put absolutely out of your head all that you may have heard or imagined about miss clarendon or her brothers prejudices on her account i willi will indeed said helen and so they parted a few words have sometimes a material influence on events in human life perhaps even among those who hold in general that advice never does good there is no individual who cannot recollect some few wordssome conversation which has altered the future colour of their lives helens overanxiety concerning general clarendons opinion of her being now balanced by the higher interest lady davenant had excited she met him with newborn courage and lady cecilia not that she suspected it was necessary but merely by way of prevention threw in little douceurs of flattery on the generals part repeated sundry pretty compliments and really kind things which he had said to her of helen these always pleased helen at the moment but she could never make what she was told he said of her quite agree with what he said to her indeed he said so very little that no absolute discrepancy could be detected between the words spoken and the words reported to have been said but still the looks did not agree with the opinions or the cordiality implied one morning lady cecilia told her that the general wished that she would ride out with them and you must come indeed you must and try his pretty zelica he wishes it of all things he told me so last night the general chancing to come in as she spoke lady cecilia appealed to him with a look that almost called upon him to enforce her request but he only said that if miss stanley would do him the honour he should certainly be happy if zelica would not be too much for her but he could not take it upon him to advise then looking for some paper of which he came in search and passing her with the most polite and deferential manner possible he left the room half vexed half smiling helen looked at cecilia and asked whether all she had told her was not a littleplus belle que la vrit lady cecilia blushing slightly poured out rapid protestations that all she had ever repeated to helen of the generals sayings was perfect truthi will not swear to the wordsbecause in the first place it is not pretty to swear and next because i can never recollect anybodys words or my own five minutes after they have been said partly by playfulness and partly by protestations lady cecilia half convinced helen but from this time she refrained from repeating compliments which true or false did no good and things went on better observing this she left them to their natural course upon all such occasions the best way and now visitors began to appear and some officers of the generals staff arrived clarendon park happened to be in the district which general clarendon commanded so that he was able usually to reside there it was in what is called a good neighbourhood and there was much visiting and many entertainments one day at dinner helen was seated between the general and a fine young guardsman who as far as his deep sense of his own merit and his fashionable indifference to young ladies would permit had made some demonstrations of a desire to attract her notice he was piqued when in the midst of something he had wonderfully exerted himself to say he observed that her attention was distracted by a gentleman opposite who had just returned from the continent and who among other pieces of news marriages and deaths of english abroad mentioned that poor daubigny was at last dead helen looked first at cecilia who as she saw heard what was said with perfect composure and then at lady davenant who had meantime glanced imperceptibly at her daughter and then upon helen whose eyes she metand helen coloured merely from association because she had coloured beforeprovoking yet impossible to help it all passed in less time than it can be told and helen had left the guardsman in the midst of his sentence discomfited and his eyes were now upon her and in confusion she turned from him and there were the generals eyes but he was only inviting her to taste some particular wine which he thought she would like and which she willingly accepted and praised though she assuredly did not know in the least what manner of taste it had the general now exerted himself to occupy the guardsman in a conversation about promotion and drew all observation from helen yet not the slightest indication of having seen heard or understood appeared in his countenance not the least curiosity or interest about colonel daubigny of one point helen was however intuitively certain that he had noticed that confusion which he had so ably so coolly covered one ingenuous look from her thanked him and his look in return was most gratifying she could not tell how it was but it appeared more as if he understood and liked her than any look she had ever seen from him before they were both more at their ease next day he certainly justified all cecilias former assurances by the urgency with which he desired to have her of the riding party he put her on horseback himself bade the aidedecamp ride on with lady ceciliathree several times set the bridle right in miss stanleys hand assuring her that she need not be afraid that zelica was the gentlest creature possible and he kept his fiery horse fleetfoot to a pace that suited her during the whole time they were out helen took courage and her ride did her a vast deal of good the rides were repeated the general evidently became more and more interested about miss stanley he appealed continually to her taste and marked that he considered her as part of his family but as helen told lady davenant it was difficult with a person of his highbred manners and reserved temper to ascertain what was to be attributed to general deference to her sex what to particular regard for the individual how much to hospitality to his guest or attention to his wifes friend and what might be considered as proof of his own desire to share that friendship and of a real wish that she should continue to live with them while she was in this uncertainty lord davenant arrived from london he had always been fond of helen and now the first sight of her youthful figure in deep mourning the recollection of the great changes that had taken place since they had last met touched him to the hearthe folded her in his arms and was unable to speak he a great bulky man with a face of constitutional joybut so it was he had a tender heart deep feelings of all kinds under an appearance of insouciance which deceived the world he was distinguished as a political leaderbut as he said of himself he had been three times inoculated with ambitiononce by his mother once by his brother and once by his wife but it had never taken well the last the best howeverit had shown at least sufficiently to satisfy his friends and he was happy to be no more tormented with talents of the first order and integrity unblenching his character was not of that stern stuffno not of that corrupt stuffof which modern ambition should be made he had now something to tell helen which he would say even before he opened his london budget of news he told her with a congratulatory smile that he had had an opportunity of showing his sense of mr collingwoods merits and as he spoke he put a letter into her hand the letter was from her good friend mr collingwood accepting a bishopric in the west indies which had been offered to him by lord davenant it enclosed a letter for helen desiring in the most kind manner that she would let him know immediately and decidedly where and with whom she intended to live and there was a postscript from mrs collingwood full of affection and doubts and hopes and fears the moment helen had finished this letter without seeming to regard the inquiring looks of all present and without once looking towards any one else she walked deliberately up to general clarendon and begged to speak to him alone never was general more surprised but of course he was too much of a general to let that appear without a word he offered his arm and led her to his study he drew a chair towards her no misfortune i hope miss stanley if i can in any way be of service the only service general clarendon said helen her manner becoming composed and her voice steadying as she went onthe only service you can do me now is to tell me the plain truth and this will prevent what would certainly be a misfortune to meperhaps to all of us will you read this letter he received it with an air of great interest and again moved the chair to her before she sat down she added i am unused to the world you see general clarendon i have been accustomed to live with one who always told me his mind sincerely so that i could judge always what i ought to do will you do so now it is the greatest service as well as favour you can do me depend upon it i will said general clarendon i should not ask you to tell me in wordsthat might be painful to your politeness only let me see it said helen and she sat down the general read on without speaking till he came to the mention of helens original promise of living with the collingwoods he did not comprehend that passage he said showing it to her he had always on the contrary understood that it had been a long settled thing a promise between miss stanley and lady cecilia that helen should live with lady cecilia when she married no such thing helen said no such agreement had ever been made so the general now perceived but this was a mistake of his which he hoped would make no difference in her arrangements he said why should itunless miss stanley felt unhappy at clarendon park he paused and helen was silent then taking desperate resolution she answered i should be perfectly happy here if i were sure of your wishes your feelings about meabout it is it possible that there has been any thing in my manner said he that could give miss stanley pain what could have put a doubt into her mind there might be some other person nearer and naturally dearer to you said helen looking up in his face ingenuouslyone whom you might have desired to have in my placeyour sister miss clarendon in short did cecilia tell you of this no lady davenant did and since i heard it i never could be happyi never can be happy till i know your feeling his manner instantly changed you shall know my feelings then said he till i knew you helen my wish was that my sister should live with my wife now i know you my wish is that you should live with us you will suit cecilia better than my sister couldwill suit us both better having the same truth of character and more gentleness of manner i have answered you with frankness equal to your own and now said he taking her hand you know cecilia has always considered you as her sisterallow me to do the same consider me as a brothersuch you shall find me thank you this is settled for life added he drawing her arm through his and taking up her letters he led her back towards the library but her emotion the stronger for being suppressed was too great for reappearing in company she withdrew her arm from his when they were passing through the hall and turning her face away she had just voice enough to beg he would show her letters to he understood she ran upstairs to her own room glad to be alone a flood of joy came over her a brother in cecilias husbanda brother the word had a magical charm and she could not help repeating it aloudshe wept like a child lady cecilia soon came flying in all delight and affection reproaches and wonder alternately in the quickest conceivable succession delighted it is settled and for ever my dear dear helen but how could you ever think of leaving us you wicked helen well now you see what clarendon really is but my dear i was so terrified when i heard it all you are and ever were the oddest mixture of cowardice and courage ido you know i brave inever should have advisednever should have ventured as you have but he is delighted at it all and so am i now it has all ended so charmingly now i have you safe i will write to the collingwoods you shall not have a moments pain i will settle it all and invite them here before they leave england clarendon desired i wouldoh he isnow you will believe me the collingwoods too will be glad to be asked here to take leave of you and all will be right i love as you do dear helen that everybody should be pleased when i am happy when lady davenant heard all that had passed she did not express that prompt unmixed delight which helen expected a cloud came over her brow something painful regarding her daughter seemed to strike her for her eyes fixed on cecilia and her emotion was visible in her countenance but pleasure unmixed appealed as she turned to helen and to her she gave what was unusual unqualified approbation my dear helen i admire your plain straightforward truth i am satisfied with this first essay of your strength of mind and courage courage said helen smiling not such as is required to take a lion by the beard or a bull by the horns replied lady davenant but there are many persons in this world who brave though they be would rather beard a lion sooner seize a bull by the horns than when they get into a dilemma dare to ask a direct question and tell plainly what passes in their own minds moral courage is believe me uncommon in both sexes and yet in going through the world it is equally necessary to the virtue of both men and women but do you really think said helen that strength of mind or what you call moral courage is as necessary to women as it is to men certainly show me a virtue male or femaleif virtues admit of grammatical distinctions if virtues acknowledge the more worthy gender and the less worthy of the grammar show me a virtue male or female that can long exist without truth even that emphatically termed the virtue of our sex helen on which social happiness rests society depends on what is it based is it not on that singlehearted virtue truthand truth on what on courage of the mind they who dare to speak the truth will not ever dare to go irretrievably wrong then what is falsehood but cowardiceand a false womandoes not that say all in one word but whence arose all this you wonder perhaps said lady davenant and i have not inclination to explain here comes lord davenant now for politicsfarewell morality a long farewell now for the london budget and what news from constantinople grand vizier certainly strangled or not chapter vi the london budget of news was now opened and gone through by lord davenant including quarrels in the cabinet and all that with fear of change perplexes politicians but the fears and hopes of different ages are attached to such different subjects that helen heard all this as though she heard it not and went on with her drawing touching and retouching it without ever looking up till her attention was wakened by the name of granville beauclerc this was the name of the person who had written those interesting letters which she had met with in lady davenants portfolio what is he doing in town asked the general amusing himself i suppose replied lord davenant i believe he forgets that i am his guardian said the general i am sure he cannot forget that you are his friend said lady cecilia for he has the best heart in the world and the worst head for any thing useful said the general he is a man of genius said lady davenant did you speak to him my lord pursued the general about standing for the county yes and he said what that he would have nothing to do with it why something about not being tied to party and somewhat he said about patriotism replied lord davenant nonsense said the general he is a fool only young said lady davenant men are not so very young in these days at twoandtwenty said the general in some said lady davenant the classical touch the romance of political virtue lasts for months if not years after they leave college even those who like granville go into high life in london do not sometimes for a season or two lose their first enthusiasm of patriotism the generals lips became compressed lord davenant throwing himself back in his easy chair repeated patriotism yes every young man of talent is apt to begin with a fit of that sort my dear lord cried lady davenant you of all men to speak of patriotism as a disease and a disease that can be had but once in life i am afraid replied her lord laughing and yet as if believing in that at which he laughed it evaporates in most men in words written or spoken lasts till the first pamphlet is published or till the maidenspeech in parliament is fairly made and fairly paid forin all honourall honourable men lady davenant passed over these satirical observations and somewhat abruptly asked lord davenant if he recollected the late mr windham certainly he was not a man to be easily forgotten but what in particular the scales of his mind were too fine said lady davenant too nicely adjusted for common purposes diamond scales will not do for weighing wool very refined very ingenious very philosophical minds such as windham burke bacon were all too scrupulous weighers their scales turned with the millionth of a grain and all from the same cause subject to the same defect indecision they saw too well how much can be said on both sides of the question there is a sort of philosophical doubt arising from enlargement of understanding quite different from that irresolution of character which is caused by infirmity of will and i have observed continued lady davenant in some of these over scrupulous weighers that when once they come to a balance that instant they become most wilful so it will be you will see with beauclerc after excessive indecision you will see him start perhaps at once to rash action rash of wrong resolute of right said lord davenant he is constitutionally wilful and metaphysically vacillating said lady davenant the general waited till the metaphysics were over and then said to lord davenant that he suspected there was something more than mere want of ambition in beauclercs refusal to go into parliament some words were here inaudible to helen and the general began to walk up and down the room with so strong a tread that at every step the china shook on the table near which helen sat so that she lost most part of what followed and yet it seemed interesting about some lord beltravers and a comtesse de saint something or a lady blanche somebody lady davenant looked anxious the generals steps became more deliberately more ominously firm till lady cecilia came up to him and playfully linking her arm in his the steps were moderated and when a soothing hand came upon his shoulder the compressed lips were relaxedshe spoke in a low voicehe answered aloud by all means write to him yourself my love get him down here and he will be safe he cannot refuse you tuesday then she would name the earliest day if the general approved he approved of every thing she said tuesday let it be following him to the door lady cecilia added something which seemed to fill the measure of his contentment always good and kind said he so let it be then shall i write to your sister or will you you said the general let the kindness come from you as it always does lady cecilia in a moment at the writingtable ran off as fast as pen could go two notes which she put into her mothers hand who gave an approving nod and leaving them with her to seal and have franked cecilia darted out on the terrace carrying helen along with her to see some italian garden she was projecting and as she went and as she stood directing the workmen at every close of her directions she spoke to helen she said she was very glad that she had settled that beauclerc was to come to them immediately he was a great favourite of hers not for any of those grandissimo qualities which my mother sees in him and which i am not quite clear exist but just because he is the most agreeable person in nature and really natural though he is a man of the world yet not the least affected quite fashionable of course but with true feeling oh he is delightful just then she interrupted herself to give directions to the workmen about her italian garden oleander in the middle of that bed vases nearer to the balustrade beauclerc has a very good taste and a beautiful place he has thorndale he will be very rich few very rich young men are agreeable now women spoil them soborder that bed with something prettystill he is and i long to know what you will think of him i know what i think he will think but however i will say no more people are always sure to get into scrapes in this world when they say what they thinkthat fountain looks beautifuli forgot to tell you he is very handsome the general is very fond of him and he of the general except when he considers him as his guardian for granville beauclerc does not particularly like to be controlledwho does it is a curious storyunpack those vases and by the time that is done i will be backtake a turn with me helen this way it is a curious story granville beauclercs fatherbut i dont know it perfectly i only know that he was a very odd man and left the general though he was so much younger than himself guardian to granville and settled that he was not to be of age i mean not to come into possession of his large estates till he is fiveandtwenty shockingly hard on poor granville and enough to make him hate clarendon but he does not and that is charming that is one reason i like him so amazingly respectful to his guardian always considering how impetuous he is amazingly respectful though i cannot say i think he is what the gardening books call patient of the knife i dont think he likes his fancies to be lopped but then he is so clever much more what you would call a reading man than the general distinguished at college and all that which usually makes a young man conceited but beauclerc is only a little headstrongall the more agreeable it keeps one in agitation one never knows how it will end but i am sure it will all go on well now it is curious too that mamma knew him also when he was at eton i believei dont know how but long before we ever heard of clarendon and she corresponded with him but i never knew him till he came to florence just after it was all settled with me and the general and he was with us there and at paris and travelled home with us and i like him now you know all except what i do not choose to tell you so come back to the workmenthat vase will not do there move it in front of these evergreens that will do then returning to helenafter all i did so right and i am so glad i thought in time of inviting esther now mr beauclerc is comingthe generals sisterhalf sister oh so unlike him you would never guess that miss clarendon was his sister except from her pride but she is so different from other people she knows nothing and wishes to know nothing of the world she lives always at an old castle in wales llan something which she inherited from her mother and she has always been her own mistress living with her aunt in melancholy grandeur there till her brother brought her to florence whereoh how she was out of her element come this way and i will tell you more the fact is i do not not much like miss clarendon and i will tell you whyi will describe her to you no no do not said helen do not my dear cecilia and i will tell you why whywhy cried cecilia do you recollect the story my uncle told us about the young bride and her old friend and the bit of advice no cecilia did not recollect any thing of it she should be very glad to hear the anecdote but as to the advice she hated advice still if you knew who gave itit was given by a very great man a very great man now you make me curious well what is it said lady cecilia that for one year after her marriage she would not tell to her friends the opinion she had formed if unfavourable of any of her husbands relations as it was probable she might change that opinion on knowing them better and would afterwards be sorry for having told her first hasty judgment long afterwards the lady told her friend that she owed to this advice a great part of the happiness of her life for she really had in the course of the year completely changed her first notions of some of her husbands family and would have had sorely to repent if she had told her first thoughts cecilia listened and said it was all vastly well excellent but i had nothing in the world to say of miss clarendon but that she was too goodtoo sincere for the world we live in for instance at paris one day a charming frenchwoman was telling some anecdote of the day in the most amusing manner esther clarendon all the while stood by grave and black as night and at last turning upon our charmer at the end of the story pronounced there is not one word of truth in all you have been saying conceive it in full salon the french were in such amazement inconceivable as they might well say to me as she walked off with her tragedyqueen air inconcevablemais vraiment inconcevable and bien anglaise they would have added no doubt if i had not been by but there must surely have been some particular reason said helen none in the world only the story was not true i believe and then another time when she was with her cousin the duchess of lisle at lisleroyal and was to have gone out the next season in london with the duchess she came down one morning just before they were to set off for town and declared that she had heard such a quantity of scandal since she had been there and such shocking things of london society that she had resolved not to go out with the duchess and not to go to town at all so absurdso prudish helen felt some sympathy in this and was going to have said so but cecilia went on with and then to expect that granville beauclercshould here cecilia paused and helen felt curious and ashamed of her curiosity she turned away to raise the branches of some shrub which were drooping from the weight of their flowers i know something has been thought of said cecilia a match has been in contemplationdo you comprehend me helen you mean that mr beauclerc is to marry miss clarendon said helen compelled to speak i only say it has been thought of replied lady cecilia that is as every thing in this way is thought of about every couple not within the prohibited degrees ones grandmother inclusive and the plainer the woman the more sure she is to contemplate such things for herself lest no one else should think of them for her but my dear helen if you mean to ask oh i dont mean to ask any thing cried helen but whether you ask or not i must tell you that the general is too proud to own even to himself that he could ever think of any man for his sister who had not first proposed for her there was a pause for some minutes but resumed lady cecilia i could not do less than ask her here for clarendons sake when i know it pleases him and she is veryestimable and so i wish to make her love me if i could but i do not think she will be nearer her point with mr beauclerc if it is her point by coming here just now granville has eyes as well as ears and contrasts will strike i know who i wish should strike him as she strikes meand i thinki hope helen looked distressed i am as innocent as a dove pursued lady cecilia but i suppose even doves may have their own private little thoughts and wishes helen was sure cecilia had meant all this most kindly but she was sorry that some things had been said she was conscious of having been interested by those letters of mr beauclercs but a particular thought had now been put into her mind and she could never more say never more feel that such a thought had not come into her head she was very sorry it seemed as if somewhat of the freshness the innocence of her mind was gone from her she was sorry too that she had heard all that cecilia had said about miss clarendon it appeared as if she was actually doomed to get into some difficulty with the general about his sister she felt as if thrown back into a sea of doubts and she was not clear that she could even by opposing end them on the appointed tuesday late miss clarendon arrived a fine figure but ungraceful as helen observed from the first moment when she turned sharply away from lady cecilias embrace to a great dog of her brothersah old neptune im glad youre here still and when lady cecilia would have put down his pawslet him alone let him alone dear honest old fellow but the dear honest old fellows paws are wet and will ruin your pretty new pelisse it may be new but you know it is not pretty said miss clarendon continuing to pat neptunes head as he jumped up with his paws on her shoulders o my dear esther how can you bear him he is so rough in his love i like rough better than smooth the rough paw caught in her lace frill and it was torn to pieces before down down and the united efforts of lady cecilia and helen could extricate itdont distress yourselves about it pray it does not signify in the least poor neptune how really sorry he looksthere there wag your tail againno one shall come between us two old friends her brother came in and starting up her arms were thrown round his neck and her bonnet falling back helen who had thought her quite plain before was surprised to see that now her colour was raised and there was life in her eyes she was really handsome gone again that expression when cecilia spoke to her whatever she said miss clarendon differed from if it was a matter of taste she was always of the contrary opinion if narrative or assertion she questioned doubted seemed as if she could not believe her conversation if conversation it could be called was a perpetual rebating and regrating especially with her sisterinlaw if lady cecilia did but say there were three instead of four it was taken up as quite a mistake and marked not only as a mistake but as not true every the slightest error became a crime against majesty and the first day ended with helens thinking her really the most disagreeable intolerable person she had ever seen and the second day went on a little worse helen thought cecilia took too much pains to please and said it would be better to let her quite alone helen did so completely but miss clarendon did not let helen alone but watched her with penetrating eyes continually listened to every word she said and seeming to weigh every syllableoh my words are not worth your weighing said helen laughing yes they are to settle my mind the first thing that seemed at all to settle it was helens not agreeing with cecilia about the colour of two ribands which helen said she could not flatter her were good matches the next was about a drawing of miss clarendons of llansillan her place in wales a beautiful drawing indeed which she had brought for her brother but one of the towers certainly was out of the perpendicular helen was appealed to and could not say it was upright miss clarendon instantly took up a knife cut the paper at the back of the frame and taking out the drawing set the tower to rights theres the use of telling the truth of listening to it said helen we shall get on i see miss stanley if you can get over the first bitter outside of mea hard outside difficult to crackstains delicate fingers may be she continued as she replaced her drawing in its framestains delicate fingers may be in the opening but a good walnut you will find it taken with a grain of salt many a grain seemed necessary and very strong nutcrackers in very strong hands lady cecilias evidently were not strong enough though she strained hard helen did not feel inclined to try cecilia invited miss clarendon to walk out and see some of the alterations her brother had made as they passed the new italian garden miss clarendon asked whats all thisdont like thishow i regret the old english garden and the high beech hedges every thing is to be changed here i supposepray do not ask my opinion about any of the alterations i do not wonder said cecilia that you should prefer the old garden with all your early associations warmhearted amiable people must always be so fond of what they have loved in childhood i never was here when i was a child and i am not one of your amiable people very true indeed thought helen miss stanley looks at me as if i had seven heads said miss clarendon laughing and a minute after overtaking helen as she walked on she looked full in her face and added do acknowledge that you think me a savage helen did not deny it and from that moment miss clarendon looked less savagely upon her she laughed and said i am not quite such a bear as i seem youll find at least i never hug people to death my growl is worse than my bite unless some one should flatter my classical bearish passion and offer to feed me with honey and when i find it all comb and no honey who would not growl then lady cecilia now came up and pointed out views to which the general had opened yes its well he has done very well but pray dont stand on ceremony with me i can walk alone you may leave me to my own cogitations as i like best surely as you like best said lady cecilia pray consider yourself as you know you are at home here no i never shall be at home here said esther oh dont say that let me hopelet me hope and she withdrew helen just stayed to unlock a gate for miss clarendons rambles further and as she unlocked it she heard miss clarendon sigh as she repeated the word hope i do not like to hope hope has so often deceived me you will never be deceived in cecilia said helen take carestay till you try i have tried said helen i know her how long from childhood youre scarcely out of childhood yet i am not so very young i have had trials of my friendsof cecilia particularly much more than you could ever have had well this is the best thing i ever heard of her and from good authority too her friends abroad were all false said miss clarendon it is very extraordinary said helen to hear such a young person as you are talk so sohow of false friendsyou must have been very unfortunate pardon mevery fortunateto find them out in time she looked at the prospect and liked all that her brother was doing and disliked all that she even guessed lady cecilia had done helen showed her that she guessed wrong here and there and smiled at her prejudices and miss clarendon smiled again and admitted that she was prejudiced but every body is only some show and tell and others smile and fib i wish that word fib was banished from english language and white lie drummed out after it things by their right names and we should all do much better truth must be told whether agreeable or not but whoever makes truth disagreeable commits high treason against virtue said helen is that yours cried miss clarendon stopping short no said helen it is excellent whoever said it it was from my uncle stanley i heard it said helen superior man that uncle must have been i will leave you now said helen do i see we shall like one another in time miss stanley in timei hate sudden friendships that evening miss clarendon questioned helen more about her friendship with cecilia and how it was she came to live with her helen plainly told her then it was not an original promise between you not at all said helen lady cecilia told me it was just like heri knew all the time it was a lie shocked and startled at the word and at the idea helen exclaimed oh miss clarendon how can you say so anybody may be mistaken cecilia mistook lady cecilia joined them at this moment miss clarendons face was flushed this room is insufferably hot what can be the use of a fire at this time of year cecilia said it was for her mother who was apt to be chilly in the evenings and as she spoke she put a screen between the flushed cheek and the fire miss clarendon pushed it away saying i cant talk i cant hear i cant understand with a screen before me what did you say lady cecilia to lady davenant as we came out from dinner about mr beauclerc that we expect him tomorrow you did not tell me so when you wrote no my dear why pray i dont know you dont know lady cecilia why should people say they do not know when they do know perfectly well if i had thought it was of any consequence to you esther said cecilia with an arch look now you expect me to answer that it was not of the least consequence to methat is the answer you would make but my answer is that it was of consequence to me and you knew it was and if i did if you did why say if i had thought it of any consequence to youwhy say so answer me truly answer me truly repeated lady cecilia laughing oh my dear esther we are not in a court of justice nor in a court of honour pursued miss clarendon well well let it be a court of love at least said lady cecilia what a pretty proverb that was helen that we met with the other day in that book of old english proverbslove rules his kingdom without a sword very likely but to the point said miss clarendon when do you expect mr beauclerc tomorrow then i shall go tomorrow my dear esther why you know why you know what reports have been spread it suits neither my character nor my brothers to give any foundation for such reports let me ring the bell and i will give my own orders my dear esther but your brother will be so vexedso surprised my brother is the best judge of his own conduct he will do what he pleases or what you please i am the judge of mine and certainly shall do what i think right she rang accordingly and ordered that her carriage should be at the door at six oclock in the morning nay my dear esther persisted cecilia i wish you would not decide so suddenly we were so glad to have you come to us glad why you know i know interrupted lady cecilia colouring and she began as fast as possible to urge every argument she could think of to persuade miss clarendon but no arguments no entreaties of hers or the generals public or private were of any availgo she would and go she did at six oclock i suppose said helen to lady davenant that miss clarendon is very estimable and she seems to be very clever but i wonder that with all her abilities she does not learn to make her manners more agreeable my dear said lady davenant we must take people as they are you may graft a rose upon an oak but those who have tried the experiment tell us the graft will last but a short time and the operation ends in the destruction of both where the stocks have no common nature there is ever a want of conformity which sooner or later proves fatal to both but beauclerc what was become of himthat day passed and no beauclerc another and another came and on the third day only a letter from him which ought to have come on tuesdaybut too late the shameful brand of procrastination was upon itand it contained only a few lines blotted in the folding to say that he could not possibly be at clarendon park on tuesday but would on wednesday or thursday if possible goodnatured lord davenant observed when a young man in london writing to his friends in the country names two days for leaving town and adds an if possible his friends should never expect him till the last of the two named the last of the two days arrivedthursday the aidedecamp asked if mr beauclerc was expected today yes i expect to see him today the general answered i hope but do not expect said lady davenant for as learned authority tells me to expect is to hope with some degree of certainty the general left the room repeating i expect him today cecilia the day passed however and he came notthe night came the general ordered that the gate should be kept open and that a servant should sit up the servant sat up all night cursing mr beauclerc and in the morning he replied with malicious alacrity to the first question his master asked no sir mr beauclerc is not come at breakfast the general after buttering his bread in silence for some minutes confessed that he loved punctuality it might be a military prejudiceit might be too professional martinet perhapsbut still he owned he did love punctuality he considered it as a part of politeness a proper attention to the convenience and feelings of others indispensable between strangers it is usually felt to be and he did not know why intimate friends should deem themselves privileged to dispense with it his eyes met helens as he finished these words and smiling he complimented her upon her constant punctuality it was a voluntary grace in a lady but an imperative duty in a manand a young man you are fond of this young man i see general said lord davenant but not of his fault lady cecilia said something about forgiving a first fault never said lady davenant lord collingwoods rule wasnever forgive a first fault and you will not have a second you love beauclerc i see as lord davenant says love him resumed the general with all his faults and follies i love him as if he were my brother at which words lady cecilia with a scarcely perceptible smile cast a furtive glance at helen the general called for his horses and followed by his aidedecamp departed saying that he should be back at luncheontime when he hoped to find beauclerc in the same hope lady davenant ordered her ponyphaeton earlier than usual lady cecilia further hoped most earnestly that beauclerc would come this day for the next the house would be full of company and she really wished to have him one day at least to themselves and she gave a most significant glance at helen the first move often secures the game against the best players said she helen blushed because she could not help understanding she was ashamed vexed with cecilia yet pleased by her kindness and half amused by her arch look and tone they were neither of them aware that lady davenant had heard the words that passed or seen the looks but immediately afterwards when they were leaving the breakfastroom lady davenant came between the two friends laid her hand upon her daughters arm and said before you make any move in a dangerous game listen to the voice of old experience lady cecilia startled looked up but as if she did not comprehend cupids bow my dear continued her mother is as the asiatics tell us strung with bees which are apt to stingsometimes fatallythose who meddle with it lady cecilia still looked with an innocent air and still as if she could not comprehend to speak more plainly then cecilia said her mother build no matrimonial castles in the air standing or falling they do mischiefmischief either to the builder or to those for whom they may be built certainly if they fall they disappoint one said lady cecilia but if they stand seeing that she made no impression on her daughter lady davenant turned to helen and gravely said my dear helen do not let my daughter inspire you with false and perhaps vain imaginations certainly premature therefore unbecoming helen shrunk back yet instantly looked up and her look was ingenuously grateful but mamma said lady cecilia i declare i do not understand what all this is about about mr granville beauclerc said her mother how can you dear mamma pronounce his name so tout an long pardon my indelicacy my dear delicacy is a good thing but truth a better i have seen the happiness of many young women sacrificed by such false delicacy and by the fear of giving a moments present pain which it is sometimes the duty of a true friend to give certainly certainly mamma only not necessary now and i am so sorry you have said all this to poor dear helen if you have said nothing to her cecilia i acknowledge i have said too much i saidi did nothing cried lady cecilia i built no castlesnever built a regular castle in my life never had a regular plan in my existence never mentioned his name except about another person an appealing look to helen was however protested to the best of my recollection at least lady cecilia immediately added helen seems to be blushing for your want of recollection cecilia i am sure i do not know why you blush helen i am certain i never did say a word distinctly not distinctly certainly said helen in a low voice it was my fault if i understood always true you are said lady davenant i protest i said nothing but the truth cried lady cecilia hastily but not the whole truth cecilia said her mother i did upon my word mamma persisted lady cecilia repeating upon my word upon your word cecilia that is either a vulgar expletive or a most serious asseveration she spoke with a grave tone and with her severe look and helen dared not raise her eyes lady cecilia now coloured deeply shame natures hasty conscience said lady davenant heaven preserve it oh mother cried lady cecilia laying her hand on her mothers surely you do not think seriouslysurely you are not angryi cannot bear to see you displeased said she looking up imploringly in her mothers face and softly urgently pressing her hand no pressure was returned that hand was slowly and with austere composure withdrawn and her mother walked away down the corridor to her own room lady cecilia stood still and the tears came into her eyes my dear friend i am exceedingly sorry said helen she could not believe that cecilia meant to say what was not true yet she felt that she had been to blame in not telling all and her mother in saying too much lady cecilia her tears dispersed stood looking at the impression which her mothers signetring had left in the palm of her hand it was at that moment a disagreeable recollection that the motto of that ring was truth rubbing the impress from her hand she said half speaking to herself and half to heleni am sure i did not mean anything wrong and i am sure nothing can be more true than that i never formed a regular plan in my life after all i am sure that so much has been said about nothing that i do not understand anything i never do when mamma goes on in that way making mountains of molehills which she always does with me and did ever since i was a child but she really forgets that i am not a child now it is well the general was not by he would never have borne to see his wife so treated but i would not for the world be the cause of any disagreement oh helen my mother does not know how i love her let her be ever so severe to me but she never loved me she cannot help it i believe she does her best to love memy poor dear mother helen seized this opportunity to repeat the warm expressions she had heard so lately from lady davenant and melting they sunk into cecilias heart she kissed helen again and again for a dear good peacemaker as she always wasand im resolvedbut in the midst of her good resolves she caught a glimpse through the glass door opening on the park of the general and a fine horse they were ringing and she hurried out all light of heart she went as though or shake the downy blowball from her stalk chapter vii since lord davenants arrival lady davenants time was so much taken up with him that helen could not have many opportunities of conversing with her and she was the more anxious to seize every one that occurred she always watched for the time when lady davenant went out in her pony phaeton for then she had her delightfully to herself the carriage holding only two it was at the door and lady davenant was crossing the hall followed by helen when cecilia came in with a look unusual in her of being much discomfited another put off from mr beauclerc he will not be here today i give him up lady davenant stopped short and asked whether cecilia had told him that probably she should soon be gone to be sure i did mamma and what reason does he give for his delay none mamma nonenot the least apology he says very cavalierly indeed that he is the worst man in the world at making excusesshall attempt none there he is right said lady davenant those who are good at excuses as franklin justly observed are apt to be good for nothing else the general came up the steps at this moment rolling a note between his fingers and looking displeased lady davenant inquired if he could tell her the cause of mr beauclercs delay he could not lady cecilia exclaimedvery extraordinary provoking insufferable intolerable it is mr beauclercs own affair said lady davenant wrapping her shawl round her and taking the generals arm she walked on to her carriage seating herself and gathering up the reins she repeatedmr beauclercs own affair completely the lash of her whip was caught somewhere and while the groom was disentangling it she reiteratedthat will do let the horses goand with halfsuppressed impatience thanked helen who was endeavouring to arrange some illdisposed cloakthank you thank you my dear its all very well sit down helen she drove off rapidly through the beautiful park scenery but the ancient oaks standing alone casting vast shadows the distant massive woods of magnificent extent and of soft and varied foliage the secluded glades all were lost upon her looking straight between her horses ears she drove on in absolute silence helens idea of mr beauclercs importance increased wonderfully what must he be whose coming or not coming could so move all the world or those who were all the world to her and left to her own cogitations she was picturing to herself what manner of man he might be when suddenly lady davenant turned and asked what she was thinking of i beg your pardon for startling you so my dear i am aware that it is a dreadfully imprudent impertinent questionone which indeed i seldom ask few interest me sufficiently to make me care of what they think from fewer still could i expect to hear the truth naynothing upon compulsion helen only say plainly if you would rather not tell me that answer i should prefer to the ingenious formula of evasion the solecism in metaphysics which cecilia used the other day when unwittingly i asked her of what she was thinkingof a great many different things mamma helen still more alarmed by lady davenants speech than by her question and aware of the conclusions which might be drawn from her answer nevertheless bravely replied that she had been thinking of mr beauclerc of what he might be whose coming or not coming was of such consequence as she spoke the expression of lady davenants countenance changed thank you my dear child you are truth itself and truly do i love you therefore its well that you did not ask me of what i was thinking for i am not sure that i could have answered so directly but i could never have presumed to ask such a question of you said helen there is such a difference yes replied lady davenant there is such a difference as age and authority require to be made but nevertheless such as is not quite consistent with the equal rights of friendship you have told me the subject of your daydream my love and if you please i will tell you the subject of mine i was rapt into times long past i was living over again some early scenessome which are connected and which connect me in a curious manner with this young man mr granville beauclerc she seemed to speak with some difficulty and yet to be resolved to go on helen i have a mind continued she to tell you what in the language of affected autobiographers i might call some passages of my life helens eyes brightened as she eagerly thanked her but hearing a halfsuppressed sigh she addednot if it is painful to you though my dear lady davenant painful it must be she replied but it may be useful to you and a weak friend is that who can do only what is pleasurable you have often trusted me with those little inmost feelings of the heart which however innocent we shrink from exposing to any but the friends we most love it is unjust and absurd of those advancing in years to expect of the young that confidence should come all and only on their side the human heart at whatever age opens only to the heart that opens in return lady davenant paused again and then saidit is a general opinion that nobody is the better for advice i am sure i do not think so said helen i am glad you do not nor do i much depends upon the way in which it is offered general maxims drawn from experience are to the young at least but as remarksmoral sentencesmere dead letter and take no hold of the mind i have felt must come before i think especially in speaking to a young friend and though i am accused of being so fond of generalising that i never come to particulars i can and will therefore my dear i will tell you some particulars of my life in which take notice there are no adventures mine has been a life of passionof feeling at leastnot of incidents nothing my dear to excite or to gratify curiosity but independent of all curiosity about events said helen there is such an interest in knowing what has been really felt and thought in their former lives by those we know and love i shall sink in your esteem said lady davenantso be it i need not begin as most people do with i was born but interrupting herself she said this heat is too much for me they turned into a long shady drive through the woods lady davenant drew up the reins and her ponies walked slowly on the grassy road then turning to helen she said it would have been well for me if any friend had when i was of your age put me on my guard against my own heart but my too indulgent too sanguine mother led me into the very danger against which she should have warned meshe misled me though without being aware of it our minds our very natures differed strangely she was a castlebuilderyes now you know my dear why i spoke so strongly and as you thought so severely this morning my mother was a castlebuilder of the ordinary sort a worldly plan of a castle was hers and little care had she about the knight within yet she had sufficient tact to know that it must be the idea of the preux chevalier that would lure her daughter into the castle prudent for herself imprudent for me and yet she loved meall she did was for love of me she managed with so much address that i had no suspicion of my being the subject of any speculationotherwise probably my imagination might have revolted my selfwill have struggled my pride have interfered or my delicacy might have been alarmed but nothing of all that happened i was only too ready too glad to believe all that i was told all that appeared in that springtime of hope and love i was very romantic not in the modern fashionable younglady sense of the word with the mixed ideas of a shepherdesss hat and the paraphernalia of a peeresslove in a cottage and a fashionable house in town no mine was honest pure real romantic loveabsurd if you will it was love nursed by imagination more than by hope i had early in my secret soul as perhaps you have at this instant in yours a pattern of perfectionsomething chivalrous noble something that is no longer to be seen nowadaysthe more delightful to imagine the moral sublime and beautiful more than human yet with the extreme of human tenderness mine was to be a demigod whom i could worship a husband to whom i could always look up with whom i could always sympathise and to whom i could devote myself with all a womans selfdevotion i had then a vast ideaas i think you have now helenof selfdevotion you would devote yourself to your friends but i could not shape any of my friends into a fit object so after my own imagination i made one dwelt upon it doated on it and at last threw this bright image of my own fancy full upon the being to whom i thought i was most happily destineddestined by duty chosen by affection the words i love you once pronounced i gave my whole heart in return gave it sanctified as i felt by religion i had high religious sentiments a vow once passed the lips a look a single look of appeal to heaven was as much for me as if pronounced at the altar and before thousands to witness some time was to elapse before the celebration of our marriage protracted engagements are unwise yet i should not say so this gave me time to open my eyesmy bewitched eyes still some months i passed in a trance of beatification with visions of duties all performedbenevolence universal and gratitude and high success and crowns of laurel for my hero for he was military it all joined well in my fancy all the pictured tales of vast heroic deeds were to be his living i was to live in the radiance of his honour or dying to die with him and then to be most blessed it is all to me now as a dream long passed and never told no never except to him who had a right to know itmy husband and now to you helen from my dream i was awakened by a rude shocki saw i thank heaven i first and i alone saw that his heart was gone from methat his heart had never been minethat it was unworthy of me no i will not say that i will not think so still i trust he had deceived himself though not so much as he deceived me i am willing to believe he did not know that what he professed for me was not love till he was seized by that passion for another a younger faireroh how much fairer beauty is a great gift of heavennot for the purposes of female vanity but a great gift for one who loves and wishes to be loved but beauty i had not had not interrupted helen i always heard he did not think so my dear no matter what others thought at least so i felt at that time my identity is so much changed that i can look back upon this now and tell it all to you calmly it was at a rehearsal of ancient music i went there accidentally one morning without my mother with a certain old duchess and her daughters the dowager full of some indian screen which she was going to buy the daughters intent one of them on a quarrel between two of the singers the other upon loves and hates of her own i was the only one of the party who had any real taste for music i was then particularly fond of it well my dear i must come to the point her voice changing as she spokeafter such a lapse of time during which my mind my whole self has so changed i could not have believed before i began to speak on this subject that these reminiscences could have so moved me but it is merely this sudden wakening of ideas long dormant for years not called up never put into words i was sitting wrapt in a silent ecstasy of pleasure leaning back behind the whispering party when i saw him come in and thinking only of his sharing my delight i made an effort to catch his attention but he did not see mehis eye was fixed on another i followed that eye and saw that most beautiful creature on which it fixed i saw him seat himself beside herone look was enoughit was conviction a pang went through me i grew cold but made no sound nor motion i gasped for breath i believe but i did not faint none cared for me i was unnoticedsaved from the abasement of pity i struggled to retain my selfcommand and was enabled to complete the purpose on which i theneven then resolved that resolve gave me force in any great emotion we can speak better to those who do not care for us than to those who feel for us more calmly than i now speak to you i turned to the person who then sat beside me to the dowager whose heart was in the indian screen and begged that i might not longer detain her as i wished that she would carry me homeshe readily complied i had presence of mind enough to move when we could do so without attracting attention it was well that woman talked as she did all the way home she never saw never suspected the agony of her to whom she spoke i ran up to my own room bolted the door and threw myself into a chair that is the last thing i remember till i found myself lying on the floor wakening from a state of insensibility i know not what time had elapsed so as soon as i could i rang for my maid she had knocked at my door and supposing i slept had not disturbed memy mother i found had not yet returned i dressed for dinner he was to dine with us it was my custom to see him for a few minutes before the rest of the company arrived no time ever appeared to me so dreadfully long as the interval between my being dressed that day and his arrival i heard him coming up stairs my heart beat so violently that i feared i should not be able to speak with dignity and composure but the motive was sufficient what i said i know not i am certain only that it was without one word of reproach what i had at one glance foreboded was truehe acknowledged it i released him from all engagement to me i saw he was evidently relieved by the determined tone of my refusalat what expense to my heart he was set free he saw notnever knewnever suspected but after that first involuntary expression of the pleasure of relief i saw in his countenance surprise a sort of mortified astonishment at my selfpossession i own my womans pride enjoyed this it was something better than pridethe sense of the preservation of my dignity i felt that in this shipwreck of my happiness i made no cowardly exposure of my feelings but he did not understand me our minds as i now found moved in different orbits we could not comprehend each other instead of feeling as the instinct of generosity would have taught him to feel that i was sacrificing my happiness to his he told me that he now believed i had never loved him my eyes were openedi saw him at once as he really was the ungenerous look upon selfdevotion as madness folly or art he could not think me a fool he did not think me mad artful i believe he did suspect me to be he concluded that i made the discovery of his inconstancy an excuse for my own he thought me perhaps worse than capricious interestedfor our engagement being unknown a lover of higher rank had in the interval presented himself my perception of this base suspicion was useful to me at the moment as it roused my spirit and i went through the better and without relapse of tenderness with that which i had undertaken one condition only i made i insisted that this explanation should rest between us two that in fact and in manner the breaking off the match should be left entirely to me and to this part of the business i now look back with satisfaction and i have honest pride in telling you who will feel the same for me that i practised in the whole conduct of the affair no deceit of any kind not one falsehood was told the world knew nothing there my mother had been prudent she was the only person to whom i was bound to explainto speak i mean for i did not feel myself bound to explain perfect confidence only can command perfect confidence in whatever relation of life i told her all that she had a right to know i announced to her that the intended marriage could never bethat i objected to it that both our minds were changed that we were both satisfied in having released each other from our mutual engagement i had as i foresaw to endure my mothers anger her entreaties her endless surprise her bitter disappointment but she exhausted all these and her mind turned sooner than i had expected to that hope of higher establishment which amused her during the rest of the season in london two months of it were still to be passedto me the two most painful months of my existence the daily nightly effort of appearing in public while i was thus wretched in the full gala of life in the midst of the young the gay the happybrokenhearted as i feltit was an effort beyond my strength that summer was i remember intolerably hot whenever my mother observed that i looked pale and that my spirits were not so good as formerly i exerted myself more and more accepted every invitation because i dared not refuse i danced at this ball and the next and the next urged on i finished to the dregs the dissipation of the season my mother certainly made me do dreadfully too much but i blame others as we usually do when we are ourselves the most to blamei had attempted that which could not be done by suppressing all outward sign of suffering allowing no vent for sorrow in words or tearsby actual force of compressioni thought at once to extinguish my feelings little did i know of the human heart when i thought this the weak are wise in yielding to the first shock they cannot be struck to the earth who sink prostrate sorrow has little power where there is no resistancethe flesh will follow where the pincers tear mine was a presumptuousit had nearly been a fatal struggle that london season at last over we got into the country i expected rest but found none the pressing necessity for exertion over the stimulus ceasing i sunksunk into a state of apathy time enough had elapsed between the breaking off of my marriage and the appearance of this illness to prevent any ideas on my mothers part of cause and effect ideas indeed which were never much looked for or well joined in her mind the world knew nothing of the matter my illness went under the convenient head nervous i heard all the opinions pronounced on my case and knew they were all mistaken but i swallowed whatever they pleased no physician i repeated to myself can minister to a mind diseased i tried to call religion to my aid but my religious sentiments were at that time tinctured with the enthusiasm of my early character had i been a catholic i should have escaped from my friends and thrown myself into a cloister as it was i had formed a strong wish to retire from that world which was no longer anything to me the spring of passion which i then thought the spring of life being broken i meditated my resolution secretly and perpetually as i lay on my bed they used to read to me and among other things some papers of the rambler which i liked not at all its tripod sentences tired my ear but i let them go onas well one sound as another it chanced that one night as i was going to sleep an eastern story in the rambler was read to me about some man aweary of the world who took to the peaceful hermitage there was a regular moral tagged to the end of it a thing i hate the words were no life pleasing to god that is not useful to man when i wakened in the middle of that night this sentence was before my eyes and the words seemed to repeat themselves over and over again to my ears when i was sinking to sleep the impression remained in my mind and though i never voluntarily recurred to it came out long afterwards perfectly fresh and became a motive of action strange mysterious connection between mind and body in mere animal nature we see the same the bird wakened from his sleep to be taught a tune sung to him in the dark and left to sleep againthe impression rests buried within him and weeks afterward he comes out with the tune perfect but these are only phenomena of memorymine was more extraordinary i am not sure that i can explain it to you in my weak state my understanding enfeebled as much as my bodymy reason weaker than my memory i could not help allowing myself to think that the constant repetition of that sentence was a warning sent to me from above as i grew stronger the superstition died away but the sense of the thing still remained with me it led me to examine and reflect it did more than all my mothers entreaties could effect i had refused to see any human creature but i now consented to admit a few the charm was broken i gave up my longing for solitude my plan of retreat from the world suffered myself to be carried where they pleasedto brighton it wasto my mothers satisfaction i was ready to appear in the ranks of fashion at the opening of the next london campaign automatically i ran my female exercises oer with as good grace as ever i had followers and proposals but my mother was again thrown into despair by what she called the short work i made with my admirers scarcely allowing decent time for their turning into lovers before i warned them not to think of me i have heard that women who have suffered from mans inconstancy are disposed afterwards to revenge themselves by inflicting pain such as they have themselves endured and delight in all the cruelty of coquetry it was not so with me mine was too deep a woundskinned overnot callous and all danger of its opening again i dreaded i had lovers the more perhaps because i cared not for them till amongst them there came one who as i saw appreciated my character and as i perceived was becoming seriously attached to prevent danger to his happiness as he would take no other warning i revealed to him the state of my mind however humiliating the confession i thought it due to him i told him that i had no heart to givethat i had received none in return for that with which i had parted and that love was over with me as a passion it may be so not as an affection was his reply the words opened to me a view of his character i saw too by his love increasing with his esteem the solidity of his understanding and the nobleness of his nature he went deeper and deeper into my mind till he came to a spring of gratitude which rose and overflowed vivifying and fertilising the seemingly barren waste i believe it to be true that after the first great misfortune persons never return to be the same that they were before but this i knowand this it is important you should be convinced of my dear helenthat the mind though sorely smitten can recover its powers a mind i mean sustained by good principles and by them made capable of persevering efforts for its own recovery it may be sure of regaining in timeobserve i say in timeits healthful tone time was given to me by that kind that noble being who devoted himself to me with a passion which i could not returnbut with such affection as i could give and which he assured me would make his happiness i determined to devote to him the whole of my future existence happiness for me i thought was gone except in so far as i could make him happy i married lord davenantmuch against my mothers wish for he was then the younger of three brothers and with a younger brothers very small portion had it been a more splendid match i do not think i could have been prevailed on to give my consent i could not have been sure of my own motives or rather my pride would not have been clear as to the opinion which others might form this was a weakness for in acting we ought to depend upon ourselves and not to look for the praise or blame of others but i let you see me as i am or as i was i do not insist like queen elizabeth in having my portrait without shade chapter viii i am proud to tell you that at the time i married we were so poor that i was obliged to give up many of those luxuries to which i was entitled and to which i had been so accustomed that the doing without them had till then hardly come within my idea of possibility our whole establishment was on the most humble scale i look back to this period of my life with the greatest satisfaction i had exquisite pleasure like all young people of sanguine temperament and generous disposition in the consciousness of the capability of making sacrifices this notion was my idol the idol of the inmost sanctuary of my mind and i worshipped it with all the energies of body and soul in the course of a few years my husbands two elder brothers died if you have any curiosity to know how i will tell you though indeed it is as little to the purpose as half the things people tell in their histories the eldest a homebred lordling who from the moment he slipped his mothers apronstrings had fallen into folly and then to show himself manly run into vice lost his life in a duel about some ladys crooked thumb or more crooked mind the second brother distinguished himself in the navy he died the death of honour he fell gloriously and was by his country honouredby his country mourned after the death of this young man the inheritance came to my husband fortune soon after poured in upon us a tide of wealth swelled by collateral streams you will wish to know what effect this change of circumstances produced upon my mind and you shall as far as i know it myself i fancied that it would have made none because i had been before accustomed to all the trappings of wealth yet it did make a greater change in my feelings than you could have imagined or i could have conceived the possibility of producing a great effect in society of playing a distinguished part and attaining an eminence which pleased my fancy had never till now been within my reach the incense of fame had been wafted near me but not to menear my husband i mean yet not to him i had heard his brothers name from the trumpet of fame i longed to hear his own i knew what to the world was then unknown his great talents for civil business which if urged into action might make him distinguished as a statesman even beyond his hero brother but i knew that in him ambition if it ever awoke must be awakened by love conscious of my influence i determined to use it to the utmost lord davenant had not at that time taken any part in politics but from his connections he could ask and obtain and there was one in the world for whom i desired to obtain a favour of importance it chanced that he whom i have mentioned to you as my inconstant lover now married to my lovely rival was at this time in some difficulty about a command abroad his connections though of very high rank were not now in power he had failed in some military exploit which had formerly been intrusted to him he was anxious to retrieve his character his credit his whole fate in life depended on his obtaining this appointment which at my request was secured to him by lord davenant the day it was obtained was i think the proudest of my life i was proud of returning good for evil that was a christian pride if pride can be christian i was proud of showing that in me there was none of the fury of a woman scornedno sense of the injury of charms despised but it was not yet the fulness of success it had pained me in the midst of my internal triumph that my husband had been obliged to use intermediate powers to obtain that which i should have desired should have been obtained by his own why should not he be in that first place of rule he could hold the balance with a hand as firm an eye as just that he should be in the house of peers was little satisfaction to me unless distinguished among his peers it was this distinction that i burned to see obtained by lord davenant i urged him forward then by all the motives which make ambition virtue he was averse from public life partly from indolence of temper partly from sound philosophy power was low in the scale in his estimate of human happiness he saw how little can be effected of real good in public by any individual he felt it scarcely worth his while to stir from his easy chair of domestic happiness however love urged him on and inspired him if not with ambition at least with what looked like it in public he entered the lists and in the political tournament tilted successfully many were astonished for till they came against him in the joust they had no notion of his weight or of his skill in arms and many seriously inclined to believe that lord davenant was only lady davenant in disguise and all he said wrote and did was attributed to me envy gratifies herself continually by thus shifting the merit from one person to another in hopes that the actual quantity may be diminished she tries to make out that it is never the real person but somebody else who does that which is good this silly base propensity might have cost me dear would have cost me my husbands affections had he not been a man as there are few above all jealousy of female influence or female talent in short he knew his own superiority and needed not to measure himself to prove his height he is quite content rather glad that every body should set him down as a commonplace character far from being jealous of his wifes ruling him he was amused by the notion it flattered his pride and it was convenient to his indolence it fell in too with his peculiar humour the more i retired the more i was put forward he laughing behind me prompted and forbade me to look back now helen i am come to a point where ambition ceased to be virtue but why should i tell you all this no one is ever the better for the experience of another oh i cannot believe that cried helen pray pray go on ambition first rose in my mind from the ashes of another passion fresh materials of heterogeneous kinds altered the colour and changed the nature of the flame i should have told you but narrative is not my fortei never can remember to tell things in their right order i forgot to tell you that when madame de stals book sur la revolution franaise came out it made an extraordinary impression upon me i turned in the first place as every body did eagerly to the chapter on england but though my national feelings were gratified my female pride was dreadfully mortified by what she says of the ladies of england in fact she could not judge of them they were afraid of her they would not come out of their shells what she called timidity and what i am sure she longed to call stupidity was the silence of overawed admiration or mixed curiosity and discretion those who did venture had not full possession of their powers or in a hurry showed them in a wrong direction she saw none of them in their natural state she asserts that though there may be women distinguished as writers in england there are no ladies who have any great conversational and political influence in society of that kind which during lancien rgime was obtained in france by what they would call their femmes marquantes such as madame de tencin madame du deffand mademoiselle de lespinasse this remark stung me to the quick for my country and for myself and raised in me a foolish vainglorious emulation an ambition false in its objects and unsuited to the manners domestic habits and public virtue of our country i ought to have been gratified by her observing that a lady is never to be met with in england as formerly in france at the bureau du ministre and that in england there has never been any example of a womans having known in public affairs or at least told what ought to have been kept secret between ourselves i suspect she was a little mistaken in some of these assertions but be that as it may i determined to prove that she was mistaken i was conscious that i had more within me than i had yet brought out i did not doubt that i had eloquence if i had but courage to produce it it is really astonishing what a mischievous effect those few passages produced on my mind in london one book drives out another one impression however deep is effaced by the next shaking of the sand but i was then in the country for unluckily for me lord davenant had been sent away on some special embassy left alone with my nonsense i set about as soon as i was able to assemble an audience round me to exhibit myself in the character of a female politician and i believe i had a notion at the same time of being the english corinne rochefoucault the dexterous anatomist of selflove says that we confess our small faults to persuade the world that we have no large ones but for my part i feel that there are some small faults more difficult to me to confess than any large ones affectation for instance it is something so little so paltry it is more than a crime it is a ridicule i believe i did make myself completely ridiculous i am glad lord davenant was not by it lasted but a short time our dear good friend dumont you knew dumont at florence could not bear to see it his regard for lord davenant urged him the more to disenchant me and bring me back before his return to my natural form the disenchantment was rather rude one evening after i had been snuffing up incense till i was quite intoxicated when my votaries had departed and we were alone together i said to him allow that this is what would be called at paris un grand succs dumont made no reply but stood opposite to me playing in his peculiar manner with his great snuffbox slowly swaying the snuff from side to side knowing this to be a sign that he was in some great dilemma i asked of what he was thinking of you said he and what of me in his french accent he repeated those two provoking lines new wit like wine intoxicates the brain too strong for feeble women to sustain to my face said i smiling for i tried to command my temper better than behind your back as others do said he behind my back said i impossible perfectly possible said he as i could prove if you were strong enough to bear it quite strong enough i said and bade him speak on suppose you were offered said he the fairyring that rendered the possessor invisible and enabled him to hear every thing that was said and all that was thought of him would you throw it away or put it on your finger put it on my finger i replied and this instant for a true friend is better than a magic ring i put it on you are very brave said he then you shall hear the lines i heard in a rival salon repeated by him who last wafted the censer to you tonight he repeated a kind of doggrel pasquinade beginning with tell me gentles have you seen the prating she the mock corinne dumont who had the courage for my good to inflict the blow could not stay to see its effect and this time i was left alone not with my nonsense but with my reason it was quite sufficient i was cured my only consolation in my disgrace was that i honourably kept dumonts counsel the friend who composed the lampoon from that day to this never knew that i had heard it though i must own i often longed to tell him when he was offering his incense again that i wished he would reverse his practice and let us have the satire in my presence and keep the flattery for my absence the graft of affectation which was but a poor weak thing fell off at once but the root of the evil had not yet been reached my friend dumont had not cut deep enough or perhaps feared to cut away too much that was sound and essential to life my political ambition remained and on lord davenants return sprang up in full vigour now it is all over i can analyse and understand my own motives when i first began my political course i really and truly had no love for power full of other feelings i was averse from it it was absolutely disagreeable to me but as people acquire a taste for drams after making faces at first swallowing so i from experience of the excitation acquired the habit the love of this mental dramdrinking besides i had such delightful excuses for myself i didnt love power for its own sake it was never used for myself always for others ever with my old principle of sacrifice in full play this flattering unction i laid to my soul and it long hid from me its weakness its gradual corruption the first instance in which i used my influence and by my husbands intervention obtained a favour of some importance the thing done though actually obtained by private favour was in a public point of view well done and fit to be done but when in time lord davenant had reached that eminence which had been the summit of my ambition and when once it was known that i had influence and in making it known between jest and earnest lord davenant was certainly to blame numbers of course were eager to avail themselves of the discovery swarms born in the noontide ray or such as salute the rising morn buzzed round me i was goodnatured and glad to do the service and proud to show that i could do it i thought i had some right to share with lord davenant at least the honour and pleasures of patronage and so he willingly allowed it to be as long as my objects were well chosen though he said to me once with a serious smile the patronage of europe would not satisfy you you would want india and if you had india you would sigh for the new world i only laughed and said the same thought as lord chesterfields only more neatly put if all ireland were given to such a one for his patrimony hed ask for the isle of man for his cabbagegarden lord davenant did not smile i felt a little alarmed and a feeling of estrangement began between us i recollect one day his seeing a note on my table from one of my protegs thanking me outrageously and extolling my very obliging disposition he read and threw it down and with one of his dryhumour smiles repeated half to himself and so obliging that she neer obliged i thought these lines were in the characters of women and i hunted all through them in vain at last i found them in the character of a man which could not suit me and i was pacified and what is extraordinary my conscience quite put at ease the week afterwards i went to make some request for a friend my little boyfor i had a dear little boy thenhad come in along with mamma lord davenant complied with my request but unwillingly i saw and as if he felt it a weakness and putting his hand upon the curlypated little fellows head he said this boy rules greece i see the child was sent for the grecian history his father took him on his knee while he read the anecdote and as he ended he whispered in the childs ear tell mamma this must not be papa should be ruled only by justice he really had public virtue i only talked of it after this you will wonder that i could go on but i did i had at that time a friend who talked always most romantically and acted most selfishly and for some time i never noticed the inconsistency between her words and actions in fact she had two currents in her mind two selves one romantic from books the other selfish from worldly education and love of fashion and of the goods of this world she had charming manners which i thought went for nothing with me but which i found stood for every thing in short she was as caressing as graceful in her little ways and as selfish as a cat she had claws too but at first i only felt the velvet it was for this woman that i hazarded my highest happinessmy husbands esteem and for the most paltry object imaginable she wanted some petty place for some man who was to marry her favourite maid when i first mentioned it to him lord davenant coldly said it cant be done and his pen went on very quickly with the letter he was writing vexed and ashamed and the more vexed because ashamed i persisted cannot be done for me said i not for anybody said heby me at leasti thoughthelen i am ashamed to tell you what i thought but i will tell it you because it will show you how a mind may be debased by the love of power or rather by the consequence which its possession bestows i thought he meant to point out to me that although he would not do it i might get it done and speaking as if to myself i said then ill go to such a person then ill use such and such ways and means looking up from his writing at me with a look such as i had never seen from him before he replied in the words of a celebrated minister cest facile de se servir de pareils moyens cest difficile de sy resoudre i admired him despised myself left the room and went and told my friend decidedly it could not be done that instant she became my enemy and i felt her claws i was proud of the wounds and showed them to my husband now helen you think i am cured for ever and safe alas no my dear it is not so easy to cure habit i have however some excuselet me put it forward the person for whom i again transgressed was my mother and for her i was proud of doing the utmost because she had as i could not forget been ready to sacrifice my happiness to her speculations she had left off building castles in the air but she had outbuilt herself on earth she had often recourse to me in her difficulties and i supplied funds as well i might for i had a most liberal allowance from my most liberal lord but schemes of my own very patriotic but not overwise had in process of time drained my purse i had a school at cecilhurst and a lace manufactory and to teach my little girls i must needs bring over lacemakers from flanders and lisle thread at an enormous expense i shut my lacemakers up in a room for secrecy was necessary where like spiders they quarrelled with each other and fought and the whole failed another scheme very patriotic too cost me an immensity trying to make indian cachemires in england very beautiful they were but they left not the tenth part of a penny in my private purse and then my mother wanted some thousands for a new dairy dairies were then the fashion and hers was to be floored with the finest dutch tiles furnished with sevre china with plate glass windows and a porch hung with french mirrors so she set me to represent to lord davenant her very distressed situation and to present a petition from her for a pension the first time i urged my mothers request lord davenant said i am sure anne that you do not know what you are asking i desisted i did not indeed well understand the business nor at all comprehend that i was assisting a fraudulent attempt to obtain public money for a private purpose but i wished to have the triumph of success i wished to feel my own influence had it been foretold to me that i could so forget myself in the intoxication of political power how i should have disdained the prophecylord is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing there is a fine sermon of blairs on this subject it had early made a great impression upon me but what are good impressions good feelings good impulses good intentions good any thing without principle my mother wondered how i could so easily take a refusal she piqued my pride by observing that she was sorry my influence had declined her pity so near contempt wounded me and i unadvisedly exclaimed that my influence had in no way declined scarcely had i uttered the words when i saw the inference to which they laid me open that i had not used my influence to the utmost for her my mother had quite sense and just feeling enough to refrain from marking this in words she noted it only by an observing look followed by a sigh she confessed that i had always been so kind so much kinder than she could have expected that she would say no more this was more to the purpose with me than if she had talked for hours i heard fresh sighs and saw tears begin to flowa mothers sighs and tears it is difficult and i felt it was shameful to bear i was partly melted much confused and hurried too by visitors coming in and i hastily promised that i would try once more what i could do the moment i had time for reflection i repented of what i had promised but the words were past recall it was so disagreeable to me to speak about the affair to my husband that i wanted to get it off my mind as soon as possible but the day passed without my being able to find a moment when i could speak to lord davenant in private company stayed till late my mother the latest at parting as she kissed me calling me her dearest anne she said she was convinced i could do whatever i pleased with lord davenant and as she was going down stairs added she was sure the first words she should hear from me in the morning would be victory victory i hated myself for admitting the thought and yet there it was i let it in and could not get it out from what an indescribable mixture of weak motives or impulses and often without one reasonable principle do we act in the most important moments of life even as i opened the door of his room i hesitated my heart beat forebodingly but i thought i could not retreat and i went in he was standing on the hearth looking weary but a reviving smile came on seeing me and he held out his handmy comfort always said he i took his hand and hesitating was again my better self but i would not go back nor could i begin with any prefacethank heaven that was impossible i began davenant i am come to ask you a favour and you must do it for me i hope it is in my power my dear said he i am sure you would not ask and there he stopped i told him it was in his power and that i would not ask it for any creature living but he put his hand upon my lips told me he knew what i was going to say and begged me not to say it but i hoping to carry it off playfully kissed his hand and putting it aside said i must ask and you must grant this to my mother he replied it cannot be anne consistently with public justice and with my public duty i nonsense nonsense i said such words are only to mask a refusal mask i remember was the word that hurt him of all i could have used it was the worst i knew it the instant i had said it lord davenant stepped back and with such a look you helen who have seen only his benign countenance his smiling eyes cannot conceive it i am sure he must have seen how much it alarmed me for suddenly it changed and i saw all the melting softness of love oh fool vain wicked fool that i was i thought of victory and pursued it my utmost power of persuasionwordssmilesand tears i triedand tried in vain and then i could not bear to feel that i had in vain made this trial of power and love shame and pride and anger seized me by turns and raised such a storm within mesuch confusionthat i knew not what i did or said and he was so calm looked so at least though i am sure he was not his selfpossession piqued and provoked me past all bearing i cannot tell you exactly how it wasit was so dreadfully interesting to me that i am unable to recall the exact words but i remember at last hearing him say in a voice i had never before heard lady davenanthe had never called me so before he had always called me anne it seemed as if he had dismissed me from his heart call me anne o call me anne and he yielded instantly he called me anne and caressing me his anne o helen never do as i did i whispered then my love you will do this for mefor me your own anne he put me gently away and leaned against the chimneypiece in silence then turning to me in a low suppressed voice he said i have loved youlove you as much as man can love woman there is nothing i would not sacrifice for you except no exceptions cried i in an affected tone of gaiety except honour he repeated firmlyhelen my dear you are of a generous nature so am i but the demon of pride was within me it made me long to try the extent of my power disappointed i sunk to meanness never never however tempted however provoked never do as i did never reproach a friend with any sacrifice you have made for them this is a meanness which your friend may forgive but which you can never forgive yourself i reproached him with the sacrifice of my feelings which i had made in marrying him his answer was i feel that what you say is true i am now convinced you are incapable of loving me and since i cannot make you happy we had betterpart these were the last words i heard the blow was wholly unexpected whether i sunk down or threw myself at his feet i know not but when i came to myself he was standing beside me there were other faces but my eyes saw only his i felt his hand holding mine i pressed it and said forget he stooped down and whispered it is forgotten i believe there is nothing can touch a generous mind so much as the being treated with perfect generositynothing makes us so deeply feel our own fault lady davenant was here so much moved that she could say no more by an involuntary motion she checked the reins and the horses stopped and she continued quite silent for a few minutes at length two or three deeply drawn sighs seemed to relieve her she looked up and her attention seemed to be caught by a bird that was singing sweetly on a branch over their heads she asked what bird it was helen showed it to her where it sat she looked up and smiled touched the horses with her whip and went on where she had left offthe next thing was the meeting my mother in the morning i prepared myself for it and thought i was now armed so strong in honesty that i could go through with it well my morality however was a little nervous was fluttered by the knock at the door and when i heard her voice as she came towards my room asking eagerly if i was alone i felt a sickness at the certainty that i must at once crush her hopes but i stood resolved my eyes fixed on the door through which she was to enter she came in to my astonishment with a face radiant with joy and hastening to me she embraced me with the warmest expression of fondness and gratitudei stood petrified as i heard her talk of my kindnessmy generosity i asked what she could mean said there must be some mistake but holding before my eyes a note can there be any mistake in this said she that note for i can never forget it i will repeat to you what you wish can be done in a better manner than you proposed the public must have no concern with it lady davenant must have the pleasure of doing it her own way an annuity to the amount required shall be punctually paid to your banker the first instalment will be in his hands by the time you receive thisdavenant when i had been formerly disenchanted from my trance of love the rudeness of the shock had benumbed all my faculties and left me scarcely power to think but now when thus recovered from the delirium of power i was immediately in perfect possession of my understanding and when i was made to comprehend the despicable use i would have made of my influence or the influence my husband possessed i was so shocked that i have ever since i am conscious in speaking of any political corruption rather exaggerated my natural abhorrence of it not from the mean and weak idea of convincing the world how foreign all such wrong was to my soul but because it really is foreign to it because i know how it can debase the most honourable characters i feel so much shocked at the criminal as at the crime because i saw it once in all its hideousness so near myself a change in the ministry took place this year lord davenants resignation was sent in and accepted and in retirement i had not only leisure to be good but also leisure to cultivate my mind of course i had read all such reading as ladies read but this was very different from the kind of study that would enable me to keep pace with lord davenant and his highly informed friends many of these more men of thought than of show visited us from time to time in the country though i had passed very well in london society blue red and green literary fashionable and political and had been extolled as both witty and wise especially when my husband was in place yet when i came into close contact with minds of a higher order i felt my own deficiencies lord davenants superiority i particularly perceived in the solidity of the ground he uniformly took and held in reasoning and when i too confident used to venture rashly and often found myself surrounded and in imminent danger in argument he used to bring me off and ably cover my retreat and looked so pleased so proud when i made a happy hit or jumped to a right conclusion but what i most liked most admired in him was that he never triumphed or took unfair advantages on the strength of his learning of his acquirements or of what i may call his logical training i mention these seeming trifles because it is not always in the great occasions of life that a generous disposition shows itself in the way which we most feel little instances of generosity shown in this way unperceived by others have gone most deeply into my mind and have most raised my opinion of his character the sense that i was over rather than under valued made me the more ready to acknowledge and feel my own deficiencies i felt the truth of an aphorism of lord verulams which is now come down to the copybooks that knowledge is power having made this notable discovery i set about with all my might to acquire knowledge you may smile and think that this was only in a new form the passion for power no it was something better not to do myself injustice i now felt the pure desire of knowledge and enjoyed the pure pleasure of obtaining it assisted supported and delighted by the sympathy of a superior mind as to intellectual happiness this was the happiest time of my life as if my eyes had been rubbed by your favourite dervise in the arabian tales with this charmed ointment which opened at once to view all the treasures of the earth i saw and craved the boundless treasures opened to my view i now wanted to read all that lord davenant was reading that i might be up to his ideas but this was not to be done in an instant there was a frenchwoman who complained that she never could learn any thing because she could not find anybody to teach her all she wanted to know in two words i was not quite so exigeante as this lady but after having skated on easily and rapidly far on the superficies of knowledge it was difficult and rather mortifying to have to go back and begin at the beginning yet when i wanted to go a little deeper and really to understand what i was about this was essentially necessary i could not have got through without the assistance of one who showed me what i might safely leave unlearned and who pointed out what fruit was worth climbing for what would only turn to ashes this happy time of my life too quickly passed away it was interrupted however not by any fault or folly of my own but by an infliction from the hand of providence to which i trust i submitted with resignationwe lost our dear little boy my second boy was born dead and my confinement was followed by long and severe illness i was ordered to try the air of devonshire one nightnow my dear i have kept for the last the only romantic incident in my lifeone night a vessel was wrecked upon our coast one of the passengers a lady an invalid was brought to our house i hastened to her assistanceit was my beautiful rival she was in a deep decline and had been at lisbon for some time but she was now sent home by the physicians as they send people from one country to another to die the captain of the ship in which she was mistook the lights upon the coast and ran the ship ashore near to our house of course we did for her all we could but she was dying she knew nothing of my history and i trust i soothed her last momentsshe died in my arms she had one child a son then at eton we sent for him he arrived too late the feeling he showed interested us deeply we kept him with us some time he was grateful and afterwards as he grew up he often wrote to me his letters you have read mr beauclerc said helen mr beauclerci had not seen him for some time when general clarendon presented him to me as his ward at florence where i had opportunities of essentially serving him you may now understand my dear why i had expected that mr granville beauclerc might have preferred coming to clarendon park this last month of my stay in england to the pleasures of london i was angry i own but after five minutes grace i cooled saw that i must be mistaken and came to the just conclusion of the old poet that no one sinks at once to the depth of ill and ingratitude i consider as the depth of ill i opine therefore that some stronger feeling than friendship now operates to detain granville beauclerc in that case i forgive him but for his own sake and with such a young man i should say for the sake of societyof the public goodfor he will end in public life i hope the present object is worthy of him whoever she may be have i anything more to tell you yes i should say that when by changes in the political world lord davenant was again in power i had learned if not to be less ambitious at least to show it less d who knew always how to put sense into my mind so that i found it there and thought it completely my own had once said that every public man who has a cultivated and highminded wife has in fact two selves each holding watch and ward for the other the notion pleased mepleased both my fancy and my reason i acted on it and lord davenant assures me that i have been this second self to him and i am willing to believe it first because he is a man of strict truth and secondly because every woman is willing to believe what she wishes lady davenant paused and after some minutes of reflection said i confess however that i have not reason to be quite satisfied with myself as a mother i did not attend sufficiently to cecilias early education engrossed with politics i left her too much to governesses at one period to a very bad one i have done what i can to remedy this and you have done more perhaps but i much fear that the early neglect can never be completely repaired she is however married to a man of sense and when i go to russia i shall think with satisfaction that i leave you with her after expressing how deeply she had been interested in all that she had heard and how grateful she felt for the confidence reposed in her helen said she could not help wishing that cecilia knew all that had been just told her of lady davenants history if cecilia could but know all the tenderness of her mothers heart how much less would she fear how much more would she love her it would answer no purpose replied lady davenant there are persons with intrinsic differences of character who explain as you will can never understand one another beyond a certain point nature and art forbidno spectacles you can furnish will remedy certain defects of vision cecilia sees as much as she can ever see of my character and i see in the best light the whole of hers so helen my dear take the advice of a scotch proverbproverbs are vulgar because they usually contain common senselet well alone you are really a very good little friend added she but keep my personal narrative for your own use chapter ix it was late before they reached home and helen dressed as fast as possible for the generals punctual habits required that all should assemble in the drawingroom five minutes at least before dinner she was coming down the private turret staircase which led from the family apartments to the great hall when just at the turn and in the most awkward way possible she met a gentleman a stranger where never stranger had been seen by her before running up full speed so that they had but barely space and time to clear out of each others way pardons were begged of course the manner and voice of the stranger were particularly gentlemanlike a servant followed with his portmanteau inquiring into which room mr beauclerc was to go mr beauclercwhen helen got to the drawingroom and found that not even the general was there she thought she could have time to run up the great staircase to lady davenants room and tell her that mr beauclerc was come my dear lady davenant mr beauclerche was there and she made her retreat as quickly as possible the quantity that had been said about him and the awkward way in which they had thus accidentally met made her feel much embarrassed when they were regularly introduced at the beginning of dinner helen fancied that there was unusual silence and constraint perhaps this might be so or perhaps people were really hungry or perhaps mr beauclerc had not yet satisfied the general and lady davenant however towards the end of dinner and at the dessert he was certainly entertaining and lady cecilia appeared particularly amused by an account which he was giving of a little french piece he had seen just before he left london called les premieres amours and helen might have been amused too but that lady cecilia called upon her to listen and mr beauclerc turning his eyes upon her she saw or fancied that he was put out in his story and though he went on with perfect good breeding yet it was evidently with diminished spirit as soon as politeness permitted at the close of the story she to relieve him and herself turned to the aidedecamp on her other side and devoted or seemed to devote to him her exclusive attention he was always tiresome to her but now more than ever he went on when once set agoing about his horses and his dogs while she had the mortification of hearing almost immediately after her seceding that mr beauclerc recovered the life and spirit of his tone and was in full and delightful enjoyment of conversation with lady cecilia something very entertaining caught her ear every now and then but with her eyes fixed in the necessary direction it was impossible to make it out through the aiddecamps neverending tediousness she thought the sitting after dinner never would terminate though it was in fact rather shorter than usual as soon as they reached the drawingroom lady cecilia asked her mother what was the cause of granvilles delay in town and why he had come today after he had written it was impossible lady davenant answered that he had trampled as lord chatham did on impossibilities it was not a physical impossibility it seems im surei hope continued cecilia that none of the beltravers set had any thing to do with his delay yet from a word or two the general let fall im almost sure that they havelady blanche im afraid there she stopped if it were only a money difficulty with lord beltravers resumed she that might be easily settled for beauclerc is rich enough yes said lady davenant but rashly generous an uncommon fault in these days when young men are in general selfishly prudent or selfishly extravagant i hope said ceciliai hope lady blanche forrester will not there she paused and consulted her mothers countenance her mother answered that beauclerc had not spoken to her of lady blanche after putting her hopes and fears questions and conjectures into every possible form and direction lady cecilia was satisfied that her mother knew no more than herself and this was a great comfort when mr beauclerc reappeared helen was glad that she was settled at an embroidery frame at the furthest end of the room as there apart from the world she felt safe from all cause for embarrassment and there she continued happy till some one came to raise the light of the lamp over her head it was mr beauclerc and as she looked up she gave a foolish little start of surprise and then all her confusion returning with thanks scarce audible her eyes were instantly fixed on the vine leaf she was embroidering he asked how she could by lamplight distinguish blue from green a simple and not very alarming question but she did not hear the words rightly and thinking he asked whether she wished for a screen she answered no thank you lady cecilia laughed and covering helens want of hearing by beauclercs want of sight explaineddo not you see granville the silkcards are written upon blue and green there can be no mistake mr beauclerc made a few more laudable attempts at conversation with miss stanley but she still imagining that this was forced could not in return say anything but what seemed forced and unnatural and as unlike her usual self as possible lady cecilia tried to relieve her she would have done better to have let it alone for beauclerc was not of the french wits opinion that la modestie nest bonne qu quinze ans and to him it appeared only a graceful timidity helen retired earlier than any one else and when she thought over her foolish awkwardness felt as much ashamed as if mr beauclerc had actually heard all that lady cecilia had said about himhad seen all her thoughts and understood the reason of her confusion at last when lady cecilia came into her room before she went to bed she began withi am sure you are going to scold me and i deserve it i am so provoked with myself and the worst of it is that i do not think i shall ever get over iti am afraid i shall be just as foolish again tomorrow i could find it in my heart to scold you to death said lady cecilia but that i am vexed myself then hesitating and studying helens countenance she seemed doubtful how to proceed either she was playing with helens curiosity or she was really herself perplexed she made two or three beginnings each a little inconsistent with the other mamma is always right with hercoming events really and truly cast their shadows before i do believe she has the fatal gift the coming ill to know ill said helen what ill is coming after all however it may not be an ill said lady cecilia it may be all for the best yet i am shockingly disappointed though i declare i never formed any oh my dear cecilia do tell me at once what it is you mean i mean that granville beauclerc like all men of genius has acted like the greatest fool what has he done he is absolutelyyou must look upon him in futureas a married man helen was delighted cecilia could form no farther schemes on her account and she felt relieved from all her awkwardness dearest helen this is well at all events cried cecilia seeing her cleared countenance this comforts me you are at ease and if i have caused you one uncomfortable evening i am sure you are consoled for it by the reflection that my mother was right and i as usual wrong but helen continued she earnestly remember that this is not to be known remember you must not breathe the least hint of what i have told you to mamma or the general something more than astonishment appeared in helens countenance and is it possible that mr beauclerc does not tell themdoes not trust his guardian and such a friend as your mother said helen he will tell them he will tell thembut not yet perhaps not tillhe is not to see his fiancethey have for some reason agreed to be separated for some timei do not know exactly but surely every body may choose their own opportunity for telling their own secrets in fact helen the lady i understand made it a point with him that nothing should be said of it yetto any one but he told it to you no indeed he did not tell it i found it out and he could not deny it but he charged me to keep it secret and i would not have told it to any body living but yourself and to you after all i said about him i felt it was necessarythought i was boundin short i thought it would set things to rights and put you at your ease at once and then with more earnestness she again pressed upon helen a promise of secrecy especially towards lady davenant helen submitted cecilia embraced her affectionately and left the room quite tired and quite happy helen was in bed and asleep in a few minutes not the slightest suspicion crossed her mind that all her friend had been telling her was not perfectly true to a more practised a less confiding person the perplexity of lady cecilias prefaces and some contradictions or inconsistencies might have suggested doubts but helens general confidence in her friends truth had never yet been seriously shaken lady davenant she had always thought prejudiced on this point and too severe if there had been in early childhood a bad habit of inaccuracy in cecilia helen thought it long since cured and so perhaps it was till she formed a friendship abroad with one who had no respect for truth but of this helen knew nothing and in fact till now lady cecilias aberrations had been always trifling almost imperceptible errors such as only her mothers strictness or miss clarendons scrupulosity could detect nor would cecilia have ventured upon a decided an important false assertion except for a kind purpose never in her life had she told a falsehood to injure any human creature or one that she could foresee might by any possibility do harm to any living being but here was a friend a very dear friend in an awkward embarrassment and brought into it by her means and by a little innocent stretching of the truth she could at once she fancied set all to rights the moment the idea came into her head upon the spur of the occasion she resolved to execute it directly it was settled between the drawingroom door and her dressingroom and when thus executed successfully with happy sophistry she justified it to herself after all said she to herself though it was not absolutely true it was ben trovato it was as near the truth perhaps as possible beauclercs best friends really feared that he was falling in love with the lady in question it was very likely and too likely it might end in his marrying this lady blanche forrester and on every account and every way it was for the best that helen should consider him as a married man this would restore helen by one magical stroke to herself and release her from that wretched state in which she could neither please nor be pleased and as far as this good effect upon helen was concerned lady cecilias plan was judicious it succeeded admirably wonderful how a few words spoken a single idea taken out of or put into the mind can make such a difference not only in the mental feelings but in the whole bodily appearance and in the actual powers of perception and use of our senses when helen entered the breakfastroom the next morning she looked and moved and felt quite a different creature from what she had been the preceding day she had recovered the use of her understanding and she could hear and see quite distinctly and the first thing she saw was that nobody was thinking particularly about her and now she for the first time actually saw mr beauclerc she had before looked at him without seeing him and really did not know what sort of looking person he was except that he was like a gentleman of that she had a sort of intuitive perceptionas cuvier could tell from the first sight of a single bone what the animal was what were its habits and to what class it belonged so any person early used to good company can by the first gesture the first general manner of being passive or active tell whether a stranger even scarcely seen is or is not a gentleman at the beginning of breakfast mr beauclerc had all the perfect english quiet of look and manners with somewhat of a highbred air of indifference to all sublunary things yet saying and doing whatever was proper for the present company yet it was done and said like one in a dream performed like a somnambulist correctly from habit but all unconsciously he awakened from his reverie the moment general clarendon came in and he asked eagerly general how far is it to old forest these were the first words which he pronounced like one wide awake i must ride there this morning its absolutely necessary the general replied that he did not see the necessity but when i do sir cried beauclerc the natural vivacity of the young man breaking through the conventional manner next moment with a humble look he hoped that the general would accompany him and the look of proud humility vanished from his countenance the next instant because the general demurred and beauclerc added will not you oblige me so far then i must go by myself the general seeming to go on with his own thoughts and not to be moved by his wards impatience talked of a review that was to be put off and at length found that he could accompany him beauclerc then delighted thanked him warmly what is the object of this essential visit to old forest may i ask said lady davenant to see a dilapidated house said the general to save a whole family from ruin cried beauclerc to restore a man of firstrate talents to his place in society pshaw said the general why that contemptuous exclamation my dear general said beauclerc i have told you and again i tell you the thing is impossible said the general so i hear you say sir replied his ward but till i am convinced i hold to my project and what is your project granville said lady davenant i will explain it to you when we are alone said beauclerc i beg your pardon i was not aware that there was any mystery said lady davenant no mystery said beauclerc only about lending some money to a friend to which i will not consent said the general why not sir said beauclerc throwing back his head with an air of defiance in his countenance there was as he looked at his guardian a quick mutable succession of feelings in striking contrast with the fixity of the generals appearance i have given you my reasons beauclerc said the general it is unnecessary to repeat what i have said you will do no good no good general when i tell you that if i lend beltravers the money to put his place in repair to put it in such a state that his sisters could live in it he would no longer be a banished man a useless absentee a wanderer abroad but he would come and settle at old forest reestablish the fortune and respectability of his family and above all save his own character and happiness oh my dear general general clarendon evidently moved by his wards benevolent enthusiasm paused and said that there were many recollections which made it rather painful to him to revisit old forest still he would do it for beauclerc since nothing but seeing the place would convince him of the impracticability of his scheme i have not been at old forest continued the general since i was a boysince it was deserted by the owners and sadly changed i shall find it in former times these forresters were a respectable good old english family till the second wife pretty and silly took a fancy for figuring in london where of course she was nobody then to make herself somebody she forced her husband to stand for the county a contested electionbriberya petitionanother electionruinous expense then that beltravers title coming to them and they were to live up to itand beyond their income the old storyover head and shoulders in debt then the new storythat they must go abroad for economy economy the cant of all those who have not courage to retrench at home said lady davenant they must they said live abroad it is so cheap continued the general so cheap to leave their house to go to ruin cheap education too and so goodand what does it come to a cheap provision it is for a family in many cases said lord davenant wife son and daughter satan are thy own not in this case cried beauclerc you cannot mean i hope i can answer for one the daughter at least said lady davenant that mad de st cimon whom we saw abroad at florence you know cecilia with whom i would not let you form an acquaintance your ladyship was quite right said the general beauclerc could not say quite wrongand he lookedsuffering i know nothing of the son pursued lady davenant i do said beauclerc he is my friend i thought he had been a very distressed man that young beltravers said the aiddecamp and if he were that would not prevent my being his friend sir said beauclerc of course said the aiddecamp i only asked he is a man of genius and feeling continued beauclerc turning to lady davenant but i never heard you mention lord beltravers before how long has he been your friend said lady davenant beauclerc hesitated the general without hesitation answered three weeks and one day i do not count my friendship by days or weeks said beauclerc no my dear beauclerc said the general well would it be for you if you would condescend to any such commonsense measure he rose from the breakfasttable as he spoke and rang the bell to order the horses you are prejudiced against beltravers general but you will think better of him i am sure when you know him you will think worse of him when you know him i suspect replied the general suspect but since you only suspect said beauclerc we english do not condemn on suspicion unheard unseen not unheard said the general i have heard enough of him from the reports of his enemies said beauclerc i do not usually form my judgment replied the general from reports either of friends or enemies i have not the honour of knowing any of lord beltravers enemies enemies of lord beltravers exclaimed lady davenant what right as he to enemies as if he were a great mana person of whom nobody ever heard setting up to have enemies but nowadays these candidates for fame these wouldbe celebrated set up their enemies as they would their equipages on creditthen by an easy process of logic make out the syllogism thusevery great man has enemies therefore every man who has enemies must be greathey beauclerc beauclerc vouchsafed only a faint absent smile and turning to his guardian askedsince lord beltravers was not to be allowed the honours of enemies or the benefit of pleading prejudice on what did the general form his judgment from his own words stay judgment my dear general cried beauclerc words repeated by whom repeated by no oneheard from himself by myself yourself i was not aware you had ever metwhen where beauclerc started forward on his chair and listened eagerly for the answer pity said lady davenant speaking to herselfpity that with such quick affections kindling into flame they should burn to waste when where repeated beauclerc with his eyes fixed on his guardian and his soul in his eyes soberly and slowly his guardian answered and categoricallywhen did i meet lord beltravers a short time before his fathers deathwhere at lady grace blands at lady grace blandswhere he could not possibly appear to advantage well go on sir one momentpardon me beauclerc i have curiosity as well as yourself may i ask why lord beltravers could not possibly have appeared to advantage at lady grace blands because i know he cannot endure her i have heard him speaking of her quote what johnson or somebody says of clarissa prating preaching frail creature good said the general he said this of his own aunt aunt you cannot mean that lady grace is his aunt cried beauclerc she is his mothers sister replied the general and therefore is i conceive his aunt be it so cried beauclerc people must tell the truth sometimes even of their own relations they must know it best and therefore i conclude that what beltravers said of lady grace is true bravo well jumped to a conclusion granville as usual said lady davenant but go on general tell us what you have heard from this precious lord can you have better than what beauclerc his own witness gives in evidence better i think and in the same line said the general his lordship has the merit of consistency at table servants of course present and myself a stranger i heard lord beltravers begin by cursing england and all that inhabit it but your country remonstrated his aunt he abjured england he had no country he said no liberal man ever has he had no relationswhat nature gave him without his consent he had a right to disclaim i think he argued but i can swear to these words with which he concludedmy father is an idiot my mother a brute and my sister may go to the devil her own way such bad taste said the aiddecamp lady davenant smiled at the unspeakable astonishment in helens face when you have lived one season in the world my dear child this power of surprise will be worn out but even to those who have seen the world said the aidedecamp who had seen the world as it strikes me really it is such extraordinary bad taste such ordinary bad taste as it strikes me said lady davenant base imitation and imitation is always a confession of poverty a want of original genius but then there are degrees among the race of imitators some choose their originals well some come near them tolerably but here all seems equally bad clumsy birmingham counterfeit dont you think so beauclerc a counterfeit that falls and makes no noise there is the worst of it for your protg whose great ambition i am sure it is to make a noise in the world however i may spare my remonstrances for i am quite aware that you would never let drop a friend never never cried beauclerc then my dear granville do not take up this man this lord beltravers for depend upon it he will never do if he had made a bold stroke for a reputation like a great original and sported some deed without a name to work upon the wonderloving imagination of the credulous english public one might have thought something of him but this cowardly negative sin not honouring his father and mother so commonplace too neutral tintno effect quite a failure one cannot even stare and you know granville the object of all these strange speeches is merely to make fools stare to be the wonder of the london world for a single day is the great ambition of these ephemeral famehunters insects that shine buzz and flyblow in the setting sun beauclerc pushed away his teacup half across the table exclaiming how unjust to class him among a tribe he detests and despises as much as you can lady davenant and all for that one unfortunate speechnot quite fair general not quite philosophical lady davenant to decide on a mans character from the specimen of a single speech this is like judging of a house from the sample of a single brick all this time i know how beltravers came to make that speechi know how it was as well as if i had been presentbetter better cried lady cecilia ladies and gentlemen may laugh resumed beauclerc but i seriously maintainbetter how better than the general who was present and heard and saw the whole said lady cecilia yes better for he saw only effects and i know causes and i appeal to lady davenantfrom lady davenant sarcastic to lady davenant philosophic i appealmay not the man who discovers causes say he knows more than he who merely sees effects he may say he knows more at all events replied lady davenant but now for the discovery of causes metaphysical sir i have done cried the general turning to leave the breakfastroom when beauclerc goes to metaphysics i give it up no no do not give it up my dear general cried lady cecilia do not stir till we have heard what will come next for i am sure it will be something delightfully absurd beauclerc bowed and feared he should not justify her ladyships good opinion for he had nothing delightfully absurd to say adding that the cause of his friends appearing like a brute was that he feared to be a hypocrite among hypocrites lord beltravers was in company with a set who were striving with all their might of dissimulation to appear better than they are and he as he always does strove to make himself appear worse than he really is unnecessary i should think said lady davenant impossible i should think said the general impossible i know it is to change your opinion general of any one said beauclerc for my own part i am glad of that said lady cecilia rising and i advise you granville to rest content with the generals opinion of yourself and say no more but said beauclerc one cannot be content to think only of onesself always say no more say no more repeated lady cecilia smiling as she looked back from the door where she had stopped the general for my sake say no more i entreat i do dislike to hear so much said about anything or anybody what sort of a road is it to old forest continued she why should not we ladies go with you my dear clarendon to enliven the way clarendons countenance brightened at this proposal the road was certainly beautiful he said by the banks of the thames lady cecilia and the general left the room but beauclerc remained sitting at the breakfasttable apparently intently occupied in forming a tripod of three teaspoons lady davenant opposite to him looking at him earnestly granville said she he started granville set my mind at ease by one word tell me the mot dnigme of this sudden friendship not what you suppose said he steadily yet colouring deeply the fact is that beltravers and i were schoolfellows a generous little fellow he was as ever was born he got me out of a sad scrape once at his own expense and i can never forget it we had never met since we left eton till about three weeks ago in town when i found him in great difficulties persecuted too by a partyi could not turn my back on himi would rather be shot no immediate necessity for being shot my dear granville i hope said lady davenant but if this be indeed all i will never say another word against your lord beltravers i will leave it to you to find out his character or to time to show it i shall be quite satisfied that you throw away your money if it be only money that is in the question be this lord beltravers what he may let him say or let them do it is all one to me provided that he does not marry you to his sister he has not a thought of it cried beauclerc and if he had do you conceive lady davenant that any man on earth could dispose of me in marriage at his pleasure i hope not said lady davenant be assured not my own will my own heart alone must decide that matter the horses are at the door cried cecilia as she entered but wheres helen helen had made her escape out of the room when lady davenant had pronounced the words set my mind at rest granville as she felt it must then be embarrassing to him to speak and to herself to hear her retreat had not however been effected with considerable loss she had been compelled to leave a large piece of the crapetrimming of her gown under the foot of lady davenants inexorable chair here is something that belongs to miss stanley if i mistake not said the general who first spied the fragment the aiddecamp stooped for itlady cecilia pitied itlady davenant pronounced it to be helens own faultbeauclerc understood how it happened and said nothing but helen cried lady cecilia as she reappearedbut helen are you not coming with us helen had intended to have gone in the ponycarriage with lady davenant but her ladyship now declared that she had business to do at home it was settled therefore that helen was to be of the riding party and that party consisted of lady cecilia and the general beauclerc and herself chapter x it was a delightful day sun shining not too hot air balmy birds singing all nature gay and the happy influence was quickly felt by the riding party unpleasant thoughts of the past or future if any such had been were now lost in present enjoyment the general twice a man on horseback as he always felt himself managed his own and helens horse to admiration and cecilia riding on with beauclerc was well pleased to hear his first observation that he had been quite wrong last night in not acknowledging that miss stanley was beautiful people look so different by daylight and by candlelight said he and so different when one does not know them at all and when one begins to know something of them but what can you know yet of helen one forms some idea of character from trifles light as air how delightful this day is and now you really allow she may be called beautiful yes that is with some expression of mind heart soul which is what i look for in general said beauclerc in general what can you mean by in general not in particular in particular cases i might thinkii might feelotherwise in particular then do you like fools that have no mind heart or soul granvilleanswer me take care said he that horse is too spirited for a lady not for me said lady cecilia but do not think you shall get off so what did you mean my meaning lies too deep for the present occasion for the present companyeh beauclerc half smiled and answeredyou know you used to tell me that you hated long discussions on words and nice distinctions well well but let me have the nice distinction now between love and friendship then there is a vast difference in what one wishes for in a womans face there are faces which pale passion loves to the right turn the generals voice far behind was heard to say to the right they turned into a glade of the park which opened to a favourite view of the generals to which cecilia knew that all attention must be paid he came up and they proceeded through a wood which had been planted by his father and which seemed destined to stand for ever secure from sacrilegious axe the road led them next into a village one of the prettiest of that sort of scattered english villages where each habitation seems to have been suited to the fancy as well as to the convenience of each proprietor giving an idea at once of comfort and liberty such as can be seen only in england happy england how blest would she but know her bliss this village was inhabited by the generals tenants his countenance brightened and expanded as did theirs whenever he came amongst them he saw them happy and they knew that they owed their happiness in just proportion to their landlord and themselves therefore there was a comfortable mixture in their feelings of gratitude and selfrespect some old people who were sitting on the stone benches sunning themselves at their doors rose as he passed cap in hand with cordial greeting the oldest man the father of the village forgot his crutch as he came forward to see his landlords bride and to give him joy at every house where they stopped out came husband wife and children even wee toddling things one of these while the general was speaking to its mother made its way frightfully close to his horses heels helen saw it and called to the mother the general turning and leaning back on his horse said to the bold little urchin as the mother snatched him up my boy as long as you live never again go behind a horses heels and remember it was general clarendon gave you this advice added beauclerc and turning to lady ceciliaet souvenez vous que cest marchal turenne qui vous la dit while the general searched for that english memento sixpence lady cecilia repeated marshal turenne i do not understand yes if you recollect said helen you do i dare say i know but i dont remember said cecilia it was only said helen that the same thing had happened to marshal turenne that he gave the same advice to a little child lady cecilia said she owed beauclerc an acknowledgment down to her saddlebow for the compliment to her general and a bow at least as low to helen for making her comprehend it and having paid both debts with graceful promptitude she observed in an aside to beauclerc that she quite agreed with him that in friendship it was good not to have to do with fools he smiled it is always permitted continued cecilia to woman to use her intellects so far as to comprehend what man says her knowledge of whatever sort never comes amiss when it serves only to illustrate what is said by one of the lords of the creation let us note this my dear helen as a general maxim for future use and pray since you have so good a memory remember to tell mamma who says i never generalise that this morning i have actually made and established a philosophical maxim one that may be of some use too which cannot be said of all reflections general or particular they rode on through a lane bright and fragrant with primroses and violets gradually winding this lane opened at last upon the beautiful banks of the thames whose silver bosom appeared at once before them in the bright sunshine silent flowing on seeming as beauclerc said as if it would for ever flow on unaltered in full broad placid dignity here he exclaimed as they paused to contemplate the view the throng of commerce the ponderous barge the black steamboat the hum and din of business never have violated the mighty current no lofty bridge insultingly overarches it no stonebuilt wharf confines it nothing but its own banks coeval with itself and like itself uncontaminated by the petty uses of mankindthey spread into large parks or are hung with thick woods as nature wills no citizens box no chimera villa destroys the idea of repose but nature uninterrupted carries on her own operations in field and flood and tree the general less poetically inclined would name to helen all the fine places within viewresidences as he practically remarked such as cannot be seen in any country in the world but england and not only fine places such as these but from the cottage to the palacethe homes of old england are the best homes upon earth the most candid and sensible of all modern french travellers said beauclerc was particularly struck with the superiority of our english country residences and the comfort of our homes you mean m de stal said the general true english sense in that book i allow when the general and beauclerc did agree in opinion about a book which was not a circumstance of frequent occurrence they were mutually delighted one always feeling the value of the others practical sense and the other then acknowledging that literature is good for something beauclerc in the fulness of his heart and abundance of his words began to expatiate on m de stals merits in having better than any foreigner understood the actual workings and balances of the british constitution that constitution so much talked of abroad and so little understood so little understood any where said the general reasonably as beauclerc now spoke helen formed a new idea of his capacity and began to think more respectfully even of his common sense than when she had heard him in the beltravers cause he spoke of the causes of englands prosperity the means by which she maintains her superiority among nationsher equal laws and their just administration he observed that the hope which every man born in england even in the lowest station may have of rising by his own merits to the highest eminence forms the great spring of industry and talent he agreed with the intelligent foreigners observation that the aristocracy of talent is superior in england to the aristocracy of birth the general seemed to demur at the word superior drew himself up but said nothing in contradiction industry and wealth and education and fashion all emulous act in england beneficially on each other continued beauclerc the general sat at ease again and above all pursued beauclercabove all education and the diffusion of knowledge knowledgeyes but take care of what kind said his guardian all kinds are good said beauclerc no only such as are safe said the general the march of intellect was not a favourite march with him unless the step were perfectly kept and all in good time but now on passing a projecting bend in the wood they came within sight of a place in melancholy contrast to all they had just admired a park of considerable extent absolutely bereft of trees except a few ragged firs on each side of a large dilapidated mansion on the summit of a bleak hill it seemed as if a great wood had once been there old forest exclaimed the general old forest now no more many a happy hour when i was a boy have i spent shooting in those woods and he pointed to where innumerable stumps of trees far as the eye could reach marked where the forest had once stood some of the white circles on the ground showed the magnificent size of those newly felled beauclerc was quite silent the general led the way on to the great gate of entrance the porters lodge was in ruins a huge rusty padlock hung upon one of the gates which had been dragged half open but the hinge having sunk there it stuckthe gate could not be opened further the other could not be stirred without imminent hazard of bringing down the pier on which it hung and which was so crazy the groom said he was afraid if he shook it never so little all would come down together let it alone said the general in the tone of one resolved to be patient there is room enough for us to get in one by onemiss stanley do not be in a hurry if you please follow me quietly in they filed the avenue overgrown with grass would have been difficult to find but for deep old cartruts which still marked the way but soon fallen trees and lopped branches dragged many a rood and then left there made it difficult to pass and there lay exposed the white bodies of many a noble tree some wholly some half stripped of their bark some green in decay left to the weatherand every here and there little smoking pyramids of burning charcoal as they approached the househow changed said the general from that once cheerful hospitable mansionit was a melancholy example of a deserted home the plaster dropping off the cut stone green the windows broken the shutters half shut the way to the halldoor steps blocked up they were forced to go round through the yards coachhouses and stables grand ranges now all dilapidated only one yelping cur in the great kennel the backdoor being ajar the general pushed it open and they went in and on to the great kitchen where they found in the midst of wood smoke one little old woman whom they nearly scared out of her remaining senses she stood and stared beauclerc stepped towards her to explain but she was deaf he raised his voicein vain she was made to comprehend by the general whose voice known in former times reached her heartthat they only came to see the place see the place ah a sad sight to see her eyes reverted to beauclerc and conceiving that he was the young lord himself she waxed pale and her head shook fearfully but when relieved from this mistake she went forward to show them over the house as they proceeded up the great staircase she confided to her friend the general that she was glad it was not the young lord for she was told he was a fiery man and she dreaded his coming unawares lady cecilia asked if she did not know him no she had never seen him since he was a little fellow he has been always roaming about like the rest in foreign parts and has never set foot in the place since he came to mans estate as the general passed a window on the landingplace he looked outyou are missing the great elm sir ah i remember you here a boy you was always good it was the young lord ordered specially the cutting of that which i could not stomach the last of the real old trees well well im old and foolishim old and foolish and i should not talk but still she talked on and as this seemed her only comfort they would not check her garrulity in the hope that they were come to take the house she now bustled as well as she could to show all to the best advantage but bad was the best now as she sorrowfully said she was very unwilling that the gentlemen should go up to inspect the roof they went however and the general saw and estimated and beauclerc saw and hoped the general recollecting the geography of the house observed that she had not shown them what used to be the picturegallery which looked out on the terrace he desired to see it she reluctantly obeyed and after trying sundry impossible keys repeating all the while that her heart was broke that she wished it had pleased god never to give her a heart unlock the door she could not in her trepidation beauclerc gently took the keys from her and looked so compassionately upon her that she godblessed him and thought it a pity her young lord was not like him and while he dealt with the lock lady cecilia saying they would trouble her no further slipped into her hand what she thought would be some comfort the poor old creature thanked her ladyship but said gold could be of no use to her now in life she should soon let the parish bury her and be no cost to the young lord she could forgive many things she said but she could never forgive him for parting with the old pictures she turned away as the gallerydoor opened one only old daub of a grandmother was there all the rest had been sold and their vacant places remained discoloured on the walls there were two or three dismembered old chairs the richly dight windows broken the floor rateaten the general stood and looked and did not sigh but absolutely groaned they went to the shattered glass door which looked out upon the terracethat terrace which had cost thousands of pounds to raise and he called cecilia to show her the place where the youngsters used to play and to point out some of his favourite haunts it is most melancholy to see a familyplace so gone to ruin said beauclerc if it strikes us so much what must it be to the son of this family to come back to the house of his ancestors and find it thus desolate poor beltravers the expression of the generals eye changed i am sure you must pity him my dear general continued beauclerc i might had he done any thing to prevent or had he done less to hasten this ruin how he should not have cut down the trees do you meanbut it was to pay his fathers debts and his own said the general he told me his fathers sir and i tell you his own even so said beauclerc debts are not crimes for which we ought to shut the gates of mercy on our fellowcreaturesand so young a man as beltravers left to himself without a home his family abroad no parent no friendno guardian friend but what is it you would do beauclerc said the general what you must wish to be done said beauclerc repair this ruin restore this once hospitable mansion and put it in the power of the son to be what his ancestors have been but howmy dear beauclerc tell me plainlyhow plainly i would lend him money enough to make this house fit to live in and he would never repay you and would never live in it he would sirhe promised me he would promised you and i promised him that i would lend him the money promised beauclerc without your guardians knowledge pray how much confound me if i remember the words the sense was what would do the business what would make the house fit for him and his sisters to live in ten thousandfifteen thousand would not do well sir you know what will be necessary better than i do a few thousands more or less what signifies provided a friend be well served the superfluous money accumulated during my long minority cannot be better employed all that i have been saving for you with such care from the time your father died my dear guardian my dear friend do not think me ungrateful but the fact isin short my happiness does not depend never can depend upon money as my friend therefore i beseech you to consider my moneyed interest less and my happiness more beauclerc you do not know what your happiness is one hour you tell me it is one thing the next another what is become of the plan for the new house you wanted to build for yourself i must have common sense for you beauclerc as you have none for yourself i shall not give you this money for lord beltravers you forget sir that i told you i had promised you forget beauclerc that i told you that such a promise vague and absurd in itself made without your guardians concurrence or consent is absolutely null and void null and void in law perhaps it may be cried beauclerc but for that very reason in honour the stronger the more binding and i am speaking to a man of honour to one who can take care of his own honour said the general and of mine i trust you do well to trust it as your father did to me it shall not be implicated when once i am of age interrupted beauclerc you will do as you please said the general in the mean time i shall do my duty but sir i only ask you to let me lend this money lendnonsense lend to a man who cannot give any security security said beauclerc with a look of unutterable contempt when a friend is in distress to talk to him like an attorney of security do pray sir spare me that i would rather give the money at once i make no doubt of it then at once i say no sir no sir and why do you say no because i think it my duty and nothing i have heard has at all shaken my opinion opinion and so i am to be put down by opinion without any reason cried beauclerc then trying to command his temper but tell me my dear general why i cannot have this cursed money because my dear beauclerc i am your guardian and can say no and can adhere to a refusal as firmly as any man living when it is necessary yes and when it is unnecessary general clarendon according to your own estimate fifteen thousand pounds is the utmost sum requisite to put this house in a habitable stateby that sum i abide abide yes i require it to keep my promise to beltravers and have it i must not from me from some one else then for have it i will dearest clarendon whispered lady cecilia let him have it since he has promised without seeming to hear her whisper without a muscle of his countenance altering general clarendon repeated not from me from some one else theni can not while i have power to prevent power power power yes that is what you love above all things and all persons and i tell you plainly general clarendon pursued beauclerc too angry to heed or see lady cecilias remonstrating looks at once i tell you that you have not the power you had it it is past and gone the power of affection you had if not of reason but force general clarendon despotism can never govern me i submit to no mans mere will much less to any mans sheer obstinacy at the word obstinacy the generals face which was before rigid grew hard as iron beauclerc walked up and down the room with great strides and as he strode he went on talking to himself to be kept from the use of my own money treated like a childan idiotat my time of life not considered at years of discretion when other men of the meanest capacity by the law of the land can do what they please with their own property by heavensthat will of my fathers should be respected my dear granville since it was your fathers will said lady cecilia joining him as he walked and respect he stopped short my dear lady cecilia for your sake he tried to restrain himself till this moment never did i say one disrespectful word to general clarendon i always considered him as the representative of my father and when most galled i have borne the chains in which it was my fathers pleasure to leave me few men of my age would have so submitted to a guardian not many years older than himself yes and indeed that should be considered said lady cecilia turning to the general i have always considered general clarendon more as my friend than my guardian and have found him so i had hoped said the general relaxing in tone but not in looks i have never treated you sir as some wards treat their guardians i have dealt openly as man of honour to man of honour gentleman to gentleman friend to friend acknowledged and felt by me beauclerc then now my dear clarendon grant the only request of any consequence i ever made yousay yes beauclerc trembled with impatience no said the general i have said itno the gallery rung with the sound no repeated beauclerc each walked separately up and down the room speaking without listening to what the other said helen heard an offer from beauclerc to which she extremely wished that the general had listened but he was deaf with determination not to yield to any thing beauclerc could say further the noise of passion in their ears was too great for either of them to hear the other suddenly turning beauclerc exclaimed borne with me do you say tis i that have to bearand by heavens cried he more than i canthan i willbear before tomorrows sun goes down i will have the money from whom from any moneylending jewusurerextortionercheatrascalwhatever he be you drive me to ityouyou my friendyou with whom i have dealt so openly and to the last it shall be open to no vile indirections will i stoop i tell you my guardian that if you deny me my own i will have what i want from the jews easily said his guardian but first recollect that a clause in your fathers will in such case sends his estates to your cousin venables to my cousin venables let them goallall if such be your pleasure sir be it so the lowest man on earth that has feeling keeps his promise the slave has a right to his word ruin me if you will and as soon as you please disgrace me you cannot bend my spirit you cannot ruin in any shape i will meet rather than submit to such a guardian such a tyrant he was on the point of saying but lady cecilia stopped that word by suddenly seizing upon his arm forcibly she carried him off saying come out with me on the terrace granville and recover your senses my senses i have never lost them never was cooler in my life said he kicking open the glass door upon its first resistance and shattering its remaining panes to fragments unnoticing not hearing the crash the general stood leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece and covering his eyes with his hand helen remained near him scarce breathing loud enough to be heard he did not know she was there and he repeated aloud in an accent of deep feeling tyrant from beauclerc a sigh from helen made him aware of her presence and as he removed his hand from his eyes she saw his look was more in sorrow than in anger she said softly mr beauclerc was wrong very wrong but he was in a passion he did not know what he meant there was silence for a few moments you are right i believe said the general it was heat of anger to which the best are subject said helen and the best and kindest most easily forgive but beauclerc said some things which were unpardonableonly forget them let all be forgotten yes said the general all but my determination that observe is fixed my mind miss stanley is made up and once made up it is not to be changed i am certain of that said helen but i am not clear that your mind is made up the general looked at her with astonishment your refusal is not irrevocable you do not know me miss stanley i think i do better than i know myself yes better if you do yourself the injustice to think that you would not yield if it were right to do so at this very instant pursued helen disregarding his increasing astonishment you would yield if you could reasonably honourablywould not you if you could without injury to your wards fortune or character would you not surely it is for his good only that you are so resolute certainly he waited with eyes fixed bending forward but with intensity of purpose in his calmness of attention there was something which i heard mr beauclerc say which i think escaped your attention said helen when you spoke of the new house he intended to build for himself which was to cost so much he offered to give that up i never heard that offer i heard him said helen i assure you it was when you were both walking up and down the room this may be so i was angry then said the general but you are not angry now said helen he smiled and in truth he desired nothing more than an honourable loopholea safe way of coming off without injury to his wardwithout hurting his own pride or derogating from the dignity of guardian helen saw this and thanking him for his condescension his kindness in listening to her she hastened as quickly as possible lest the relenting moment might not be seized and running out on the terrace she saw beauclerc his head down upon his arms leaning upon an old broken stone lion and lady cecilia standing beside him commiserating and as she approached she heard her persuading him to go to the general and speak to him again and say soonly say so whatever it was helen did not stay to inquire but told cecilia in as few words as she could all that she had to say and ended with was i right quite right was not she granville beauclerc looked upa gleam of hope and joy came across his face and with one grateful look to helen he darted forward they followed but could not keep pace with him and when they reached the gallery they found him appealing as to a father for pardon can you forgive and will you forgive my not hearing you not listening to you as your father would my dear beauclerc you were too hot and i was too cold and there is an end of it this reconciliation was as quick as warm as the quarrel had been and then explanations were made as satisfactorily as they are when the parties are of good understanding and depend on each others truth past present and future beauclerc whose promise all relied on and for reasons good none more implicitly than the general promised that he would ask for no more than just what would do to put this old forest house in habitable trim he said he would give up the new house for himself till as many thousands as he now lent spent or wastedtake which word you willshould be again accumulated from his income it was merely a sacrifice of his own vanity and perhaps a little of his own comfort he said to save a friend a human being from destruction well well let it rest so it was all settled witness presenttwo angels to witness as beauclerc quoted from some old play and now in high goodhumour up again to nonsense pitch they all felt that delightful relief of spirits of which friends after perilous quarrel are sensible in perfect reconciliation they left this melancholy mansion now with beauclerc the happiest of the happy in the generous hope that he should be the restorer of its ancient glories and comfort the poor old woman was not forgotten as they passed she courtesying hoping and fearing lady cecilia whispered and the deaf ear heard the roof will not fallall will be well and there is the man that will do it all well well my heart inclined to him from the firstat least from the minute i knew him not to be my young lord they were to go home by water the boat was in readiness and as beauclerc carefully handed helen into it the general saidyes you are right to take care of miss stanley beauclerc she is a good friend in need at least as i have found this morning added he as he seated himself beside her lady cecilia was charming and every thing was delightful especially the cold chicken chapter xi no two people could be more unlike in their habits of mind than this guardian and ward general clarendon referred in all cases to old experience and dreaded innovation beauclerc took for his motto my mind leadeth me to new things general clarendon was what is commonly called a practical man granville beauclerc was the flower of theorists the general fit for action prompt and decided in all his judgments was usually right and just in his conclusionsbut if wrong there was no setting him right for he not only would not but could not go back over the groundhe could not give in words any explanation of his process of reasoningit was enough for him that it was right and that it was his while beauclerc who cared not for any mans opinion was always so ingeniously wrong and could show all the steps of his reasoning so plausibly that it was a pity he should be quite out of the right road at last the general hated metaphysics because he considered them as taking a flight beyond the reach of discipline as well as of common sense he continually asked of what use are theywhile lady davenant answered to invigorate and embellish the understanding this turning the soul inward on itself concentrates its forces and fits it for the strongest and boldest flights and in such pursuits whether we take or whether we lose the game the chase is certainly of service possibly the general said he would not dispute the point with lady davenant but a losing chase however invigorating was one in which he never wished to engage as to the rest he altogether hated discussions doubts and questionings he had made up his fagot of opinions and would not let one be drawn out for examination lest he should loosen the bundle beauclerc on the contrary had his dragged out and scattered about every day and each particular stick was tried and bent and twisted this way and that and peeled and cut and hacked and unless they proved sound to the very core not a twig of them should ever go back into his bundle which was to be the bundle of bundles the best that ever was seen when once tied so that it would hold togetherof which there seemed little likelihood as every knot slipped and all fell to pieces at each pull while he was engaged in this analysis he was as his guardian thought in great moral peril for not a principle had he left to bless himself with and in any emergency if any temptation should occur what was to become of him the general who was very fond of him but also strongly attached to his own undeviating rule of right was upon one occasion about peremptorily to interpose not only with remonstrances as a friend but with authority as a guardian this occurred when beauclerc was with them at florence and when the generals love for lady cecilia and intimacy with her mother commenced lady davenant being much interested for young beauclerc begged that the patient might be left to her and that his guardian would refrain from interference this was agreed to the more readily by the general as his thoughts and feelings were then more agreeably engrossed and beauclerc found in lady davenant the very friend he wanted and wished for most ardentlyone whose mind would not blench at any moral danger would never shrink from truth in any shape but calm and selfpossessed would examine whether it were indeed truth or only a phantom assuming her form besides there was in lady davenant towards beauclerc a sort of maternal solicitude and kindness of which the effect was heightened by her dignified manner and pride of character she in the first place listened to him patiently she who could talk would listen this was as she said her first merit in his estimation to her he poured forth all those doubts of which she was wise enough not to make crimes she was sure of his honourable intentions certain that there was no underhand motive no bad passion no concealed vice or disposition to vice beneath his boasted freedom from prejudice to be justified or to be indulged by getting rid of the restraints of principle had there been any danger of this sort which with young men who profess themselves ultraliberal is usually the case she would have joined in his guardians apprehensions but in fact beauclerc instead of being le philosophe sans le savoir was le bon enfant sans le savoir for while he questioned the rule of right in all his principles and while they were held in abeyance his good habits and good natural disposition held fast and stood him in stead while lady davenant by slow degrees brought him to define his terms and presently to see that he had been merely saying old things in new words and that the systems which had dazzled him as novelties were old to older eyes in short that he was merely a resurrectionist of obsolete heresies which had been gone over and over again at various longpast periods and over and over again abandoned by the common sense of mankind so that after puzzling and wandering a weary way in the dark labyrinth he had most ingeniously made for himself he saw light followed it and at length making his way out was surprised and sorry perhaps to perceive that it was the common light of day it is of great consequence to young enthusiastic tyros like beauclerc to have safe friends to whom they can talk of their opinions privately otherwise they will talk their ingenious nonsense publicly and so they bind themselves or are bound to the stake and live or die martyrs to their own follies from these and all such dangers lady davenant protected him and she took care that nobody hurt him in his defenceless state before his shell was well formed and hardened she was further of peculiar service in keeping all safe and smooth between the ward and guardian all beauclercs romance the general would have called by the german word schwrmereynot fudgenot humbugliterally skyrocketingvisionary enthusiasm and when it came to arguments they might have turned to quarrels but for lady davenants superior influence while lady cecilias gentleness and gaiety usually succeeded in putting all serious dangerous thoughts to flight nature never having intended lady cecilia for a manoeuvrer she was now perpetually on the point of betraying herself and one day when she was alone with helen she exclaimed never was any thing better managed than i managed this my dear helen i am so glad i told you recollecting herself just in time she ended with so glad i told you the truth oh yes thank you said helen my uncle used to say no one could be a good friend who does not tell the whole truth that i deny thought cecilia the twinge of conscience was felt but very slightly not visible in any change of countenance except by a quick twinkling motion of the eyelashes not noticed by unsuspicious helen every thing now went on as happily as cecilia could have desired every morning they rode or booted to old forest to see what was doing the roof was rather hastily taken off lady cecilia hurried forward that measure aware that it would prevent the possibility of any of the ladies of the family coming there for some time delay was all she wanted and she would now as she promised herself leave the rest to time she would never interfere further in word or look especially when her mother might be by one half of this promise she kept faithfully the other she broke continually there were plans to be made of all the alterations and improvements at old forest beauclerc applied to lady cecilia for her advice and assistance her advice she gave but her assistance she ingeniously contrived to leave to helen for whenever beauclerc brought to her a sketch or a plan of what was to be done lady cecilia immediately gave it to helen repeating never drew a regular plan in my life you know my dear you must do this so that helens pencil and her patience were in constant requisition then came apologies from beauclerc and regrets at taking up her time all which led to an intimacy that lady cecilia took care to keep up by frequent visits to old forest so that helen was necessarily joined in all his present pursuits during one of these visits they were looking over some old furniture which lord beltravers had commissioned beauclerc to have disposed of at some neighbouring auction there was one curiously carved oak armchair belonging to the old old gentleman of all which the old woman particularly regretted should go she had sewn it up in a carpet and when it came out helen was struck with its likeness to a favourite chair of her uncles many painful recollections occurred to her and tears came into her eyes ashamed of what appeared so like affectation she turned away that her tears might not be seen and when cecilia following her insisted on knowing what was the matter she left helen immediately to the old woman and took the opportunity of telling beauclerc all about dean stanley and how helen was an heiress and no heiress and her having determined to give up all her fortune to pay her uncles debts there was a guardian too in the case who would not consent and in short a parallelism of circumstances a similarity of generous temper and all this she thought must interest beauclercand so it did but yet its being told to him would have gone against his nice notions of delicacy and helen would have been ruined in his opinion had he conceived that it had been revealed to him with her consent or connivance she came back before lady cecilia had quite finished and a few words which she heard made her aware of the whole the blush of astonishmentthe glance of indignationwhich she gave at lady cecilia settled beauclercs opinion and cecilia was satisfied that she had done her friend good service against her will and as to the means thought shewhat signifies going back to consider when they succeed the collingwoods gladly availed themselves of lady cecilia clarendons kind invitation as they were both most anxious to take leave of helen stanley before their departure they were to sail very soon so that their visit was but short a few days of painful pleasure to helena happy meeting but enjoyed with the mournful sense that they were so soon to separate and for so long a time perhaps for ever mr collingwood told helen that if she still agreed to his conditions he would arrange with mr james the solicitor that all the money left to her by her uncle should be appropriated to the payment of his debts but continued he pause and consider well whether you can do without this money which is still yours you are you know not bound by any promise and it is not yet too late to say you have altered your decision helen smiled and said you cannot be serious in saying this i am sure mr collingwood assured her that he was helen simply said that her determination was unalterable he looked pleased yet his last words in taking leave of her were remember my dear that when you have given away your fortune you cannot live as if you had it the collingwoods departed and after a decent time had elapsed or what she deemed a decent time lady cecilia was anxious to ascertain what progress had been made how relatively to each other lady blanche forrester and helen stood in beauclercs opinion or rather in his imagination but this was not quite so easy a matter to determine as she had conceived it would be judging from the frankness of beauclercs temper and from the terms of familiarity on which they had lived while abroad his confidence was not to be won surprised or forced he was not only jealous of his free will as most human beings are in love affairs but like all men of true feeling he desired in these matters perfect mental privacy when pysche is awakened it should be by cupid alone beauclerc did not yet wish that she should be awakened he admired he enjoyed that repose he was charmed by the perfect confiding simplicity of helens mind so unlike what he had seen in othersso real the hope of that pure friendship which dawned upon him he wished to prolong and dreaded lest by any doubt raised all might be clouded and changed lady cecilia was however convinced that without knowing it he was falling comfortably in love through friendship a very easy convenient way and helen had she too set out upon that easy convenient road of friendship she did not think about the road but she felt that it was very agreeable and thought it was quite safe as she went on so smoothly and easily she could not consider mr beauclerc as a new acquaintance because she had heard so much about him he was completely one of the family so that she as part of that family could not treat him as a stranger her happiness she was sensible had much increased since his arrival but so had everybodys he gave a new spring a new interest to everything added so much to the life of life his sense and his nonsense were each of them good in their kind and they were of various kinds from the high sublime of metaphysics to the droll realities of life but everybody blaming praising scolding laughing at or with him he was necessary to all and with all for some reason or other a favourite but the general was always as impatient as lady cecilia herself both of his hypercriticism and of his neverending fancies each of which beauclerc purused with an eagerness and abandoned with a facility which sorely tried the generals equanimity one day after having ridden to old forest general clarendon returned chafed he entered the library talking to cecilia as helen thought about his horse no managing him curb him ever so little and he is on his hindlegs directly give him his head put the bridle on his neck and he stands still does not know which way he would go or what he would do the strangest fellow for a rational creature now it was clear it was of beauclerc that he spoke so rash and yet so resolute continued the general how is that said lady davenant i do not know how but so it is said the general as you know appealing to helen and to lady cecilia he was ready to run me through till he had his own way about that confounded old house and now there are all the workmen at a stand because mr beauclerc cannot decide what he will have done or undone oh it is my fault cried helen with the guilty recollection of the last alteration not having been made yesterday in drawing the working plan and she hastened to look for it directly but when she found it she saw to her dismay that beauclerc had scribbled it all over with literary notes it was in no state to meet the generals eye she set about copying it as fast as possible yes pursued the general forty alterationsshuffling about continually cannot a man be decided always with poor beauclerc said lady cecilia le mieux est lennemi du bien no my dear cecilia it is all his indolence there he sat with a book in his hand all yesterday with all his impetuosity too indolent to stir in his own business said the general his mind is too active sometimes to allow his body to stir said lady davenant and because he cannot move the universe he will not stir his little finger he is very fond of paradoxes and your ladyship is very fond of him said the general but indolent he is and as to activity of mind it is only in pursuit of his own fancies and your fancies and his differ said lady davenant because he never fancies any thing useful said the general cest selon cest selon cried lady cecilia gaily he thinks his fancies useful and especially all he is doing at old forest but i confess he tends most to the agreeable certainly he is a most agreeable creature agreeable satisfied to be called an agreeable man cried the general indignantly yes he has no ambition there i differ from you general said lady davenant he has too much have patience with him he is longsighted in his visions of glory visions indeed said the general those who are really ambitious continued lady davenant must think before they act what shall i do to be for ever known is a question which deserves at least a little more thought than those which most young men ask themselves which commonly are what shall i do to be known tomorrowon the turf or at brooksor in doctors commonsor at some exclusive party at charming lady nobodys what will you do for the plan for these workmen in the mean time my dear clarendon said lady cecilia afraid that some long discussion would ensue here it is said helen who had managed to get it ready while they were talking she gave it to the general who thanked her and was off directly cecilia then came to divert herself with looking at beauclercs scribbled plan and she read the notes aloud for her mothers amusement it was a sketch of a dramatical metaphysical entertainment of which half a dozen proposed titles had been scratched out and there was finally left tarquin the optimist or the temple of destiny it was from an old story begun by laurentius valla and continued by leibnitzshe read act i scene sextus tarquin goes to consult the oracle who foretells the crime he is to commit and then cried lady cecilia come measures of old and new front of old forest house wings includednow he goes on with his play tarquins complaint to jupiter of the oraclemodern predestination compared to ancient destiny and here continued cecilia come prices of norway deal and a great blot and then we have jupiters answer that sextus may avoid his doom if he pleases by staying away from rome but he does not please to do so because he must then renounce the crown good speech here on vanity and inconsistency of human wishes kitchen ft by query with hobs i cannot conceive my dear helen continued lady cecilia how you could make the drawing out through all this and she continued to read scene rd high priest of delphi asks jupiter why he did not give sextus a better willwhy not make him choose to give up the crown rather than commit the crime jupiter refuses to answer and sends the high priest to consult minerva at athens nb old woman at old forest promised her an ovenleibnitz gives oh if he goes to leibnitz said lady cecilia he will be too grand for me but it will do for you mamma leibnitz gives in his temple of the destinies a representation of every possible universe from the worst to the bestthis could not be done on the stage very true indeed said lady cecilia but helen listen granville has really found an ingenious resource by ombres chinoises suppose or a gauze curtain as in zemire et azore the audience might be made to understand the main point that good resulted from tarquins bad choice brutus liberty romes grandeur and the optimist right at last qed well well continued lady cecilia i dont understand it but i understand thisbricks wanting lady davenant smiled at this curious specimen of beauclercs versatility but said i fear he will fritter away his powers on a hundred different petty objects and do nothing at last worthy of his abilities he will scatter and divide the light of his genius and show us every change of the prismatic colourscurious and beautiful to behold but dispersing wasting the light he should concentrate on some one some noble object but if he has light enough for little objects and great too said lady cecilia i allow quil faudrait plus dun coeur pour aimer tant de choses la fois but as i really think granville has more heart than is necessary he can well afford to waste some of it even on the old woman at old forest chapter xii one evening helen was looking over a beautiful scrapbook of lady cecilias beauclerc who had stood by for some time eyeing it in rather scornful silence at length asked whether miss stanley was a lover of albums and autographs helen had no album of her own she said but she was curious always to see the autographs of celebrated people why said beauclerc i dont know it seems to bring one nearer to them it gives more reality to our imagination of them perhaps said helen the imagination is probably in most cases better than the reality replied he lady davenant stooped over helens shoulder to look at the handwriting of the earl of essexthe writing of the gallant earl of essex at sight of which as she observed the hearts of queens have beat high what a crowd of associated ideas rise at the sight of that autograph who can look at it without some emotion helen could not beauclerc in a tone of raillery said he was sure from the eager interest miss stanley took in these autographs that she would in time become a collector herself and he did not doubt that he should see her with a valuable museum in which should be preserved the old pens of great men that of cardinal chigi for instance who boasted that he wrote with the same pen for fifty years and by that boast you know said lady davenant convinced the cardinal de retz that he was not a great but a very little man we will not have that pen in helens museum why not beauclerc asked it was full as well worth having as many of the relics to be found in most young ladies and even old gentlemens museums it was quite sufficient whether a man had been great or little that he had been talked ofthat he had been something of a lionto make any thing belonging to him valuable to collectors who preserve and worship even the parings of lions claws that class of indiscriminate collectors helen gave up to his ridicule still he was not satisfied he went on to the whole class of lionhunters as he called them condemning indiscriminately all those who were anxious to see celebrated people he hoped miss stanley was not one of that class no not a lionhunter said helen she hoped she never should be one of that set but she confessed she had a great desire to see and to know distinguished persons and she hoped that this sort of curiosity or as she would rather call it enthusiasm was not ridiculous and did not deserve to be confounded with the mere trifling vulgar taste for sightseeing and lionhunting beauclerc half smiled but not answering immediately lady davenant said that for her part she did not consider such enthusiasm as ridiculous on the contrary she liked it especially in young people i consider the warm admiration of talent and virtue in youth as a promise of future excellence in maturer age and yet said beauclerc the maxim not to admire is i believe the most approved in philosophy and in practice is the great secret of happiness in this world in the fine world it is a fine air i know said lady davenant among a set of fashionable young somnambulists it is doubtless the only art they know to make men happy or to keep them so but this has nothing to do with philosophy beauclerc though it has to do with conceit or affectation mr beauclerc now piqued with a look and voice of repressed feeling said that he hoped her ladyship did not include him among that set of fashionable somnambulists i hope you will not include yourself in it answered lady davenant it is contrary to your nature and if you join the nil admirari coxcombs it can be only for fashions sakemere affectation beauclerc made no reply and lady davenant turning to helen told her that several celebrated people were soon to come to clarendon park and congratulated her upon the pleasure she would have in seeing them besides being a great pleasure it is a real advantage continued she to see and be acquainted early in life with superior people it enables one to form a standard of excellence and raises that standard high and bright in men the enthusiasm becomes glorious ambition to excel in arts or arms in women it refines and elevates the taste and is so far a preventive against frivolous vulgar company and all their train of follies and vices i can speak from my own recollection of the great happiness it was to me when i early in life became acquainted with some of the illustrious of my day and may i ask said beauclerc if any of them equalled the expectations you had formed of them some far exceeded them said lady davenant you were fortunate every body cannot expect to be so happy said beauclerc i believe in general it is found that few great men of any times stand the test of near acquaintance no man spare me cried lady davenant interrupting him for she imagined she knew what he was going to say oh spare me that old sentence no man is a hero to his valet de chambre i cannot endure to hear that for the thousandth time i heartily wish it had never been said at all so do i replied beauclerc but lady davenant had turned away and he now spoke in so low a voice that only helen heard him so do i detest that quotation not only for being hackneyed but for having been these hundred years the comfort both of leanjawed envy and fat mediocrity he took up one of helens pencils and began to cut ithe looked vexed and low to her observed lady davenant did not do me the honour to let me finish my sentence then said helen if lady davenant misunderstood you why do not you explain no no it is not worth while if she could so mistake me but any body may be mistaken do explain no no said he very diligently cutting the pencil to pieces she is engaged you see with somebodysomething else but now she has done listening no no not now there are too many people and its of no consequence by this time the company were all eagerly talking of every remarkable person they had seen or that they regretted not having seen lady cecilia now called upon each to name the man among the celebrated of modern days whom they should most liked to have seen by acclamation they all named sir walter scott the ariosto of the north all but beauclerc he did not join the general voice he said low to helen with an air of disgusthow tired i am of hearing him called the ariosto of the north but by whatever name said helen surely you join in that general wish to have seen him yes yes i am sure of your vote cried lady cecilia coming up to them you granville would rather have seen sir walter scott than any author since shakespearewould not you pardon me on the contrary i am glad that i have never seen him glad not to have seen himnot the word not was repeated with astonished incredulous emphasis by all voices glad not to have seen sir walter scott how extraordinary what can mr beauclerc mean to make us all stare said lady davenant so do not gratify him do not wonder at him we cannot believe what is impossible you know only because it is impossible but continued she laughing i know how it is the spirit of contradictionthe spirit of singularitytwo of your familiars granville have got possession of you again and we must have patience while the fit is on but i have not and will not have patience said lord davenant whose goodnature seldom failed but who was now quite indignant i wonder you are surprised my dear lord said lady davenant for mr beauclerc likes so much better to go wrong by himself than to go right with all the world that you could not expect that he would join the loud voice of universal praise i hear the loud voice of universal execration said beauclerc you have all abused me but whom have i abused what have i said nothing replied lady cecilia that is what we complain of i could have better borne any abuse than indifference to sir walter scott indifference exclaimed beauclercwhat did i say lady cecilia from which you could infer that i felt indifference indifferent to him whose name i cannot pronounce without emotion i alone of all the world indifferent to that genius preeminent and unrivalled who has so long commanded the attention of the whole reading public arrested at will the instant order of the day by tales of other times and in this commonplace this everyday existence of ours created a holiday world where undisturbed by vulgar cares we may revel in a fancy region of felicity peopled with men of other timesshades of the historic dead more illustrious and brighter than in life yes the great enchanter cried cecilia great and good enchanter continued beauclerc for in his magic there is no dealing with unlawful means to work his ends there is never aid from any one of the bad passions of our nature in his writings there is no private scandalno personal satireno bribe to human frailtyno libel upon human nature and among the lonely the sad and the suffering how has he medicined to repose the disturbed mind or elevated the dejected spiritperhaps fanned to a flame the unquenched spark in souls not wholly lost to virtue his morality is not in purple patches ostentatiously obtrusive but woven in through the very texture of the stuff he paints man as he is with all his faults but with his redeeming virtuesthe world as it goes with all its compensating good and evil yet making each man better contented with his lot without our well knowing how the whole tone of our minds is raisedfor thinking nobly of our kind he makes us think more nobly of ourselves helen who had sympathised with beauclerc in every word he had said felt how true it is that next to genius is the power of feeling where true genius lies yet after all this granville said lady cecilia you would make us believe you never wished to have seen this great man beauclerc made no answer oh how i wish i had seen him said helen to lady davenant the only person present who had had that happiness if you have seen raeburns admirable pictures or chantreys speaking bust replied lady davenant you have as complete an idea of sir walter scott as painting or sculpture can give the first impression of his appearance and manner was surprising to me i recollect from its quiet unpretending good nature but scarcely had that impression been made before i was struck with something of the chivalrous courtesy of other times in his conversation you would have found all that is most delightful in all his worksthe combined talent and knowledge of the historian novelist antiquary and poet he recited poetry admirably his whole face and figure kindling as he spoke but whether talking reading or reciting he never tired me even with admiring and it is curious that in conversing with him i frequently found myself forgetting that i was speaking to sir walter scott and what is even more extraordinary forgetting that sir walter scott was speaking to me till i was awakened to the conviction by his saying something which no one else could have said altogether he was certainly the most perfectly agreeable and perfectly amiable great man i ever knew and now mamma said lady cecilia do make granville confess honestly he would give the world to have seen him do lady davenant said helen who saw or thought she saw a singular emotion in beauclercs countenance and fancied he was upon the point of yielding but lady davenant without looking at him repliedno my dear i will not ask himi will not encourage him in affectation at that word dark grew the brow of beauclerc and he drew back as it were into his shell and out of it came no more that night nor the next morning at breakfast but as far as could be guessed he suffered internally and no effort made to relieve did him any good so every one seemed to agree that it was much better to let him alone or let him be moody in peace hoping that in time the mood would change but it changed not till the middle of that day when as helen was sitting working in lady davenants room while she was writing two quick knocks were heard at the door come in said lady davenant mr beauclerc stood pausing on the threshold do not go miss stanley said he looking very miserable and ashamed and proud and then ashamed again what is the matter granville said lady davenant i am come to have a thorn taken out of my mind said hetwo thorns which have sunk deep kept me awake half the night perhaps i ought to be ashamed to own i have felt pain from such little things but so it is though after all i am afraid they will be invisible to you lady davenant i will try with a magnifyingglass said she lend me that of your imagination granvillea high power and do not look so very miserable or miss stanley will laugh at you miss stanley is too good to laugh that is being too good indeed said lady davenant well now to the point you were very unjust to me lady davenant yesterday and unkind unkind is a womans word but go on surely man may mark unkindness altered eye as well as woman said beauclerc and from a woman and a friend he may and must feel it or he is more or less than man now what can you have to say granville that will not be anticlimax to this exordium i will say no more if you talk of exordiums and anticlimaxes cried he you accused me yesterday of affectationtwice when i was no more affected than you are oh is that my crime is that what has hurt you so dreadfully here is the thorn that has gone in so deep i am afraid that as is usual the accusation hurt the more because it was do not say true interrupted beauclerc for you really cannot believe it lady davenant you know me and all my faults and i have plenty but you need not accuse me of one that i have not and which from the bottom of my soul i despise whatever are my faults they are at least real and my own you may allow him that said helen well i willi do said lady davenant to appease you poor injured innocence though anyone in the world might think you affected at this moment yet i who know you know that it is pure real folly yes yes i acquit you of affectation beauclercs face instantly cleared up but you said two thorns had gone into your mindone is out now for the other i do not feel that other now said beauclerc it was only a mistake when i began with no man i was not going to say no man is a hero to his valet de chambre if i had been allowed to finish my sentence it would have saved a great deal of trouble i was going to say that no man admires excellence more fervently than i do and that my very reason for wishing not to see celebrated people is lest the illusion should be dispelled no description ever gives us an exact idea of any person so that when any one has been much described and talked of before we see them we form in our minds eye some image some notion of our own which always proves to be unlike the reality and when we do afterwards see it even if it be fairer or better than our imagination still at first there is a sort of disappointment from the nonagreement with our previously formed conception every body is disappointed the first time they see hamlet or falstaff as i think dugald stewart observes true and i remember said lady davenant madame de la rochejaquelin once said to me i hate that people should come to see me i know it destroys the illusion yes cried beauclerc how much i dread to destroy any of those blessed illusions which make the real happiness of life let me preserve the objects of my idolatry i would not approach too near the shrine i fear too much light i would not know that they were false would you then be deceived said lady davenant yes cried he sooner would i believe in all the fables of the talmud than be without the ecstasy of veneration it is the curse of age to be thus miserably disenchanted to outlive all our illusions all our hopes that may be my doom in age but in youth the high springtime of existence i will not be cursed with such a premature ossification of the heart oh rather ten thousand times rather would i die this instant well but there is not the least occasion for your dying said lady davenant and i am seriously surprised that you should suffer so much from such slight causes how will you ever get through the world if you stop thus to weigh every light word the words of most people replied he pass by me like the idle wind but i do weigh every word from the very few whom i esteem admire and love with my friends perhaps i am too susceptible i love them so deeply this is an excuse for susceptibility of temper which flatters friends too much to be easily rejected even lady davenant admitted it and helen thought it was all natural chapter xiii lady cecilia was now impatient to have the house filled with company she gave helen a catalogue raisonn of all who were expected at clarendon park some for a fashionable three days visit some for a week some for a fortnight or three weeks be the same more or less i have but one fixed principle said she but i have onenever to have tiresome people when it can possibly be avoided impossible you know it is sometimes ones own and ones husbands relations one must have but as for the rest its ones own fault if one fails in the first and last maxim of hospitalityto welcome the coming and speed the parting guest the first party who arrived were of lady davenants particular friends to whom cecilia had kindly given the precedence if not the preference that her mother might have the pleasure of seeing them and that they might have the honour of taking leave of her before her departure from england they were political fashionable and literary some of ascendency in society some of parliamentary promise and some of ministerial eminencethe aristocracy of birth and talents well mixed the aristocracy of birth and the aristocracy of talents are words now used more as a commonplace antithesis than as denoting a real difference or contrast in many instances among those now living both are united in a manner happy for themselves and glorious for their country england may boast of having among her young nobility the first in birth the first in fame men distinguished in literature and science in senatorial eloquence and statesmanlike abilities but in this party at clarendon park there were more of the literary and celebrated than without the presence of lady davenant could perhaps have been assembled or perhaps would have been desired by the general and lady cecilia cecilias beauty and grace were of all societies and the general was glad for lady davenants sake and proud for his own part to receive these distinguished persons at his house helen had seen some of them before at cecilhurst and at the deanery by her uncles friends she was kindly recognised by others of course politely noticed but miserably would she have been disappointed and mortified if she had expected to fix general attention or excite general admiration past and gone for ever are the days if ever they were when a young lady on her entrance into life captivated by a glance overthrew by the first word and led in triumph her train of admirers these things are not to be done nowadays yet even when unnoticed helen was perfectly happy her expectations were more than gratified in seeing and in hearing these distinguished people and she sat listening to their conversation in delightful enjoyment without even wanting to have it seen how well she understood there is a precious moment for young people if taken at the prime when first introduced into society yet not expected not called upon to take a part in it they as standers by may see not only all the play but the characters of the players and may learn more of life and of human nature in a few months than afterwards in years when they are themselves actors upon the stage of life and become engrossed by their own parts there is a time before the passions are awakened when the understanding with all the life of nature fresh from all that education can do to develop and cultivate is at once eager to observe and able to judge for a brief space blessed with the double advantages of youth and age this time once gone is lost irreparably and how often it is lostin premature vanity or premature dissipation helen had been chiefly educated by a man and a very sensible man as dean stanley certainly was in all but money matters under his masculine care while her mind had been brought forward on some points it had been kept back on others and while her understanding had been cultivated it had been done without the aid of emulation or competition not by touching the springs of pride but by opening sources of pure pleasure and this pure pleasure she now enjoyed grateful to that dear uncle for the single inimitable grace of simplicity which she possessed how many mothers governesses and young ladies themselves willingly when they see how much it charms would too late exchange half the accomplishments all the acquirements so laboriously achieved beauclerc who had seen something of the london female world was both from his natural taste and from contrast pleased with helens fresh and genuine character and he sympathised with all her silent delight he never interrupted her in her enthusiastic contemplation of the great stars but he would now and then seize an interval of rest to compare her observations with his own anxious to know whether she estimated their relative magnitude and distances as he did these snatched moments of comparison and proof of agreement in their observations or the pleasure of examining the causes of their difference of opinion enhanced the enjoyment of this brilliant fortnight and not a cloud obscured the deep serene notwithstanding all the ultrarefined nonsense beauclerc had talked about his wish not to see remarkable persons no one could enjoy it more as helen now perceived and she saw also that he was considered as a man of promise among all these men of performance but there were some perhaps very slight things which raised him still more in her mind because they showed superiority of character she observed his manner towards the general in this company where he had himself the vantage groundso different now from what it had been in the oldforest battle when only man to man ward to guardian before these distinguished persons there was a looka tone of deference at once most affectionate and polite it is so generous said lady cecilia to helen is not it and helen agreed this brilliant fortnight ended too soon as helen thought but lady cecilia had had quite enough of it they are all to go tomorrow morning and i am not sorry for it said she at night as she threw herself into an armchair in helens room and after having indulged in a refreshing yawn she exclaimed very delightful very delightful as you say helen it has all been but i am not sure that i should not be very much tired if i had much more of it oh yes i admired them all amazingly but then admiring all day long is excessively wearisome the very attitude of looking up fatigues both body and mind mamma is never tired because she never has to look up she can always look down and thats so grand and so easy she has no idea how the neck of my poor mind aches this minute and my poor eyes blasted with excess of light how yours have stood it so well helen i cannot imagine how much stronger they must be than mine i must confess that without the relief of music now and then and ecart and that quadrille bad as it was i should never have got through it tonight alive or awake but cried she starting up in her chair do you know horace churchill stays tomorrow such a compliment from him to stay a day longer than he intended and do you know what he says of your eyes helenthat they are the best listeners he ever spoke to i should warn you though my dear that he is something and not a little i believe of a male coquette though he is not very young but he well understands all the advantages of a careful toilette he has like that george herbert in queen elizabeths time a genteel humour for dress he is handsome still and his fine figure and his fine feelings and his fine fortune have broken two or three hearts nevertheless i am delighted that he stays especially that he stays on your account upon my account exclaimed helen did not you see that from the first day when mr churchill had the misfortune to be placed beside me at dinner he utterly despised me he began to talk to me indeed but left his sentence unfinished his good story untold the instant he caught the eye of a grander auditor lady cecilia had seen this and marvelled at a wellbred man so far forgetting himself in vanity but this she observed was only the first day he had afterwards changed his manner towards helen completely yes when he saw lady davenant thought me worth speaking to but after all it was quite natural that he should not know well what to say to me i am only a young lady i acquit him of all peculiar rudeness to me for i am sure mr churchill really could not talk for only one insignificant hearer could not bring out his good things unless he felt secure of possessing the attention of the whole dinnertable so i quite forgive him after this curse of forgiveness my dear helen i will wish you a good night said lady cecilia laughing and she retired with a fear that there would not be jealousy enough between the gentlemen or that helen would not know how to play them one against another there is a pleasure in seeing a large party disperse in staying behind when others gothere is advantage as well as pleasure which is felt by the timid because they do not leave their characters behind them and rejoiced in by the satirical because the characters of the departed and departing are left behind fair game for them of this advantage no one could be more sensible no one availed himself of it with more promptitude and skill than mr churchill for well he knew that though wit may fail humour may not takethough even flattery may pall upon the sense scandal satire and sarcasm are resources never failing for the lowest capacities and sometimes for the highest this morning in the library at clarendon park he looked out of the window at the departing guests and as each drove off he gave to each his coup de patte to helen to whom it was new it was wonderful to see how each even of those next in turn to go enjoyed the demolition of those who were just gone how blind to fate they laughed applauded and licked the hand just raised to strike themselves of the first who wentmost respectable people said lady cecilia a bonne mre de famille most respectable people repeated horacemost respectable people old coach and all and then as another party drove offno fear of any thing truly respectable here now horace how can you say soshe is so amiable and so clever so clever only perhaps a thought too fond of english liberty and french dress poissarde bien coiffe poissarde of one of the best born best bred women in england cried lady cecilia bien coiffe i allow lady cecilia is si coiffe de sa belle amie that i see i must not say a word against her tillthe fashion changes but hark i hear a voice i never wish to hear yet nobody is better worth hearing oh yes the queen of the bluesthe blue devils hush cried the aidedecamp she is coming in to take leave then as the queen of the blue devils entered mr churchill in the most humbly respectful manner beggedmy respectsi trust your grace will do me the favourthe justice to remember me to all your party whodo me the honour to bear me in mind then as she left the room he turned about and laughed oh you sad false man cried the lady next in turn to go i declare mr churchill though i laugh i am quite afraid to go off before you afraid what could malice or envy itself find to say of your ladyship intacte as you areintacte repeated he as she drove off intactea well chosen epithet i flatter myself yes intacteuntouchedabove the breath of slander cried lady cecilia i know it so i say replied churchill fidelity that has stood all temptationsto which it has ever been exposed and her husband is a near relation of mine said lady cecilia i am not prudish as to scandal in general continued she laughing a chicken too might do me good but then the fox must not prey at home no one ought to stand by and hear their own relations abused a thousand pardons i depended too much on the general maximthat the nearer the bone the sweeter the slander nonsense said lady cecilia i meant to say the nearer the heart the dearer the blame a cut against a first cousin may go wrongbut a bosom friendoh how i have succeeded against best friends scolded all the while of course and called a monster but there is sir stephen bowing to you then as lady cecilia kissed her hand to him from the window churchill went on by the by without any scandal seriously i heard somethingi was quite concernedthat he had been of late less in his study and more in the boudoir of surely it cannot be true positively false said lady cecilia at every breath a reputation dies said beauclerc pon my soul thats true said the aidedecamp positively hit or miss horace has been going on firing away with his wit pop pop pop till he has baggedhow many brace horace turned away from him contemptuously and looked to see whereabouts lady davenant might be all this time chapter xiv lady davenant was at the far end of the room engrossed churchill feared by the newspaper as he approached she laid it down and said how scandalous some of these papers have become but it is the fault of the taste of the age those who live to please must please to live horace was not sure whether he was cut or not but he had the presence of mind not to look hurt he drew nearer to lady davenant seated himself and taking up a book as if he was tired of folly to which he had merely condescended he sat and read and then sat and thought the book hanging from his hand the result of these profound thoughts he gave to the public not to the aidedecamp no more of the little popgun pellets of witsbut now was brought out reason and philosophy in a higher tone he now reviewed the literary philosophical and political world with touches of la bruyere and rochefoucault in the characters he drew and in the reflections he made with an air too of sentimental contrition for his own penetration and fine moral sense which compelled him to see and to be annoyed by the faults of such superior men the analysis he made of every mind was really perfectin one respect not a grain of bad but was separated from the good and held up clean and clear to public view and as an anatomist he showed such knowledge both of the brain and of the heart such an admirable acquaintance with all their diseases and handled the probe and the scalpel so well with such a practised hand well really this is comfortable said lord davenant throwing himself back in his armchairtrue english comfort to sit at ease and see all ones friends so well dissected happy to feel that it is our duty to our neighbour to see him well cut upably anatomised for the good of society and when i departwhen my time comesas come it must nobody is to touch me but professor churchill it will be a satisfaction to know that i shall be carved as a dish fit for gods not hewed as a carcase for hounds so now remember cecilia i call on you to witnessi hereby being of sound mind and body leave and bequeath my character with all my defects and deficiencies whatsoever and all and any singular curious diseases of the mind of which i may die possessed wishing the same many for his saketo my good friend doctor horace churchill professor of moral philosophic and scandalous anatomy to be by him dissected at his good pleasure for the benefit of society many thanks my good lord and i accept your legacy for the honournot the value of the gift which every body must be sensible is nothing said churchill with a polite bowabsolutely nothing i shall never be able to make anything of it trytry my dear friend answered lord davenant try dont be modest that would be difficult when so distinguished said beauclerc with an admirable look of proud humility distinguished mr horace churchill assuredly is said lady davenant looking at him from behind her newspaper distinguished above all his many competitors in this age of scandal he has really raised the art to the dignity of a science satire scandal and gossip now handinhandthe three new graces all on the same elevated rankthree formerly considered as so different and the last left to our inferior sex but now surely to be a male gossip is no reproach o lady davenantmale gossipwhat an expression what a reality male gossiptombe sur moi le ciel cried churchill pourvu que je me venge always understood pursued lady davenant but why be so afraid of the imputation of gossiping mr churchill it is quite fashionable and if so quite respectable you know and in your style quite grand and gossiping wonders at being so fine malice to be hated needs but to be seen but now when it is elegantly dressed we look upon it without shame or consciousness of evil we grow to doat upon itso entertaining so graceful so refined when vice loses half its grossness it loses all its deformity humanity used to be talked of when our friends were torn to pieces but now there is such a philosophical perfume thrown over the whole operation that we are irresistibly attracted how much we owe to such men as mr churchill who make us feel detraction virtue he bowed low as lady davenant summoned by her lord left the room and there he stood as one condemned but not penitent if i have not been well sentenced said he as the door closed and made to feel detraction virtuebut since lady cecilia cannot help smiling at that i am acquitted and encouraged to sin again the first opportunity but lady davenant shall not be by nor lord davenant either lady cecilia sat down to write a note and mr churchill walked round the room in a course of critical observation on the pictures of which as of every thing else he was a supreme judge at last he put his eye and his glass down to something which singularly attracted his attention on one of the marble tables pretty said lady cecilia pretty are not theythough ones so tired of them every where nowthose doves doves said churchill what i am admiring are gloves are not they miss stanley said he pointing to an old pair of gloves which much wrinkled and squeezed together lay on the beautiful marble in rather an unsightly lump poor doctor v cried helen to cecilia that poor doctor vis as absent as ever he is gone and has forgotten his gloves absent oh as ever said lady cecilia going on with her note the most absent man alive too much of that sort of thing i think there is in doctor v pursued churchill a touch of absence of mind giving the idea of high abstraction becomes a learned man well enough but then it should only be slight as a soupon of rouge which may become a pretty woman all depends on the measure the taste with which these things are managedput on there is nothing managed nothing put on in doctor v cried helen eagerly her colour rising it is all perfectly sincere true in him whatever it be beauclerc put down his book all perfectly true you really think so miss stanley said churchill smiling and looking superior down i do indeed cried helen charmingso young how i do love that freshness of mind impertinent fellow i could knock him down felt beauclerc and you think all doctor vs humility true said churchill yes perfectly said helen but i do not wonder you are surprised at it mr churchill she meant no malice though for a moment he thought she did and he winced under beauclercs smile i do not wonder that any one who does not know doctor v should be surprised by his great humility added helen you are sure that it is not pride that apes humility asked churchill yes quite sure yet said churchill putting his malicious finger through a great hole in the thumb of the doctors glove i should have fancied that i saw vanity through the holes in these gloves as through the philosophers cloak of old horace is a famous fellow for picking holes and making much of them miss stanley you see said the aidedecamp vanity doctor vhas no vanity said helen if you knew him no vanity whom does miss stanley mean cried the aidedecamp no vanity thats good who horace mauvais plaisant horace put him by and happily not easily put out of countenance he continued to helen you give the good doctor credit too for all his navet said churchill he does not want credit for it said helen he really has it i wish i could see things as you do miss stanley show him that helen cried lady cecilia looking at a table beside them on which lay one of those dioramic prints which appear all a confusion of lines till you look at them in their right point of view show him thatit all depends and so does seeing characters on getting the right point of view ingenious said churchill trying to catch the right position but i cant i own then abruptly resuming navet charms me at fifteen and his eye glanced at helen then was retracted then returning to his point of view at eighteen perhaps may do and his eyes again turned to helen at eighteenit captivates me quite and his eye dwelt but navet at past fifty verging to sixty is quite another thing really rather too much for me i like all things in season and above all simplicity will not bear long keeping i have the greatest respect possible for our learned and excellent friend but i wish this could be any way suggested to him and that he would lay aside this outofseason simplicity he cannot lay aside his nature said helen and i am glad of it it is such a good nature kindhearted creature he is i never heard him say a severe word of any one said lady cecilia what a sweet man he must he said horace making a face at which none present not even helen could forbear to smile his heart i am sure is in the right place always i only wish one could say the same of his wig and would it be amiss if he sometimes i would not be too hard upon him miss stanley once a fortnight supposebrushed or caused to be brushed that coat of his you have dusted his jacket for him famously horace i think said the aidedecamp at this instant the door opened and in came the doctor himself lady cecilias hand was outstretched with her note thinking as the door opened that she should see the servant come in for whom she had rung what surprises you all so my good friends said the doctor stopping and looking round in all his native simplicity my dear doctor said lady cecilia only we all thought you were gonethats all and i am not gone thats all i stayed to write a letter and am come here to look forbut i cannot findmy your gloves perhaps doctor you are looking for said churchill going forward and with an air of the greatest respect and consideration both for the gloves and for their owner he presented them then shook the doctor by the hand with a cordiality which the good soul thought truly english and bowing him out added how proud he had been to make his acquaintanceau revoir he hoped in park lane oh you treacherous cried lady cecilia turning to horace as soon as the unsuspecting philosopher was fairly gone too bad really if he were not the most simpleminded creature extant he must have seen suspected something from your look and what would have become of you if the doctor had come in one moment sooner and had heard youi was really frightened frightened so was i almost out of my wits said churchill les revenans always frighten one and they never hear any good of themselves for which reason i make it a principle when once i have left a room full of friends especially nevernever to go back my gloves my hat my coat id leave sooner than lose my friends once i heard it said by one who knew the world and human nature better than any of usonce i heard it said in jest but in sober earnest i say that i would not for more than i am worth be placed without his knowing it within earshot of my best friend what sort of a best friend can yours he cried beauclerc much like other peoples i suppose replied horace speaking with perfect nonchalancemuch like other peoples best friends whosoever expects to find better i guess will find worse if he live in the world we live in may i go out of the world before i believe or suspect any such thing cried beauclerc rather than have the roman curse light upon me may you survive all your friends and relations may i die a thousand times who talks of dying in a voice so sweeta voice so loud said provoking horace in his calm wellbred tone for my part i who have the honour of speaking to you can boast that never since i was of years of discretion counting new style beginning at thirteen of coursenever have i lost a friend a sincere friendnever for this irrefragable reasonsince that nonage never was i such a neophyte as to fancy i had found that lusus natures a friend perfectly sincere how i pity you cried beauclerc if you are in earnest but in earnest you cant be pardon me i can and i am and in earnest you will oblige me mr beauclerc if you will spare me your pity for all things in this world considered said horace churchill drawing himself up i do not conceive that i am much an object of pity then turning upon his heel he walked away conscious however half an instant afterwards that he had drawn himself up too high and that for a moment his temper had spoiled his tone and betrayed him into a look and manner too boastful bordering on the ridiculous he was in haste to repair the error not garrick in the height of his celebrity and of his susceptibility was ever more anxious than horace churchill to avert the stroke of ridiculeto guard against the dreaded smile as he walked away he felt behind his back that those he left were smiling in silence lady cecilia had thrown herself on a sofa resting after the labour of lloquence de billet he stopped and leaning over the back of the sofa on which she reclined repeated an italian line in which was the word pavoneggiarsi my dear lady cecilia you who understand and feel italian so well how expressive are some of their words pavoneggiarsiuntranslatable one cannot say well in english to peacock oneself to make oneself like unto a peacock is flat but pavoneggiarsiaction passion picture all in one to plume oneself comes nearest to it but the word cannot be given even by equivalents in english nor can it be naturalised because in fact we have not the feeling an englishman is too proud to boasttoo bashful to strut if ever he peacocks himself it is in a moment of anger not in display the language of every country continued he raising his voice in order to reach lady davenant who just then returned to the room as he did not wish to waste a philosophical observation on lady ceciliathe language of every country is to a certain degree evidence record history of its character and manners then lowering his voice almost to a whisper but very distinct turning while he spoke so as to make sure that miss stanley heardyour young friend this morning quite captivated me by her naturenature the thing that now is most uncommon a real natural woman and when in a beauty how charming how delicious when one meets with effusion de coeur a young lady too who speaks pure english not a leash of languages at once and cultivated too your friend is for one does not like ignorance if one could have knowledge without pretensionso hard to find the golden meanand if one could find it one might not be nearer to lady cecilia listened for the finishing word but none came it all ended in a sigh to be interpreted as she pleased a look towards the ottoman where beauclerc had now taken his seat beside miss stanley seemed to point the meaning out but lady cecilia knew her man too well to understand him beauclerc seated on the ottoman was showing to helen some passages in the book he was reading she read with attention and from time to time looked up with a smile of intelligence and approbation what either said horace could not hear and he was the more curious and when the book was put down after carelessly opening others he took it up very much surprised was he to find it neither novel nor poem many passages were marked with pencil notes of approbation he took it for granted these were bleauclercs there he was mistaken they were lady davenants she was at her worktable horace book in hand approached the book was not in his line it was more scientific than literaryit was for posterity more than for the day he had only turned it over as literary men turn over scientific books to seize what may serve for a new simile or a good allusion besides among his philosophical friends the book being talked of it was well to know enough of it to have something to say and he had said well very judiciously he had praised it among the elect but now it was his fancy to depreciate it with all his might not that he disliked the author or the work now more than he had done before but he was in the humour to take the opposite side from beauclerc so he threw the book from him contemptuously rather a slight hasty thing in my opinion said he beauclercs eyes took fire as he exclaimed slight hasty this most noble most solid work solid in your opinion said churchill with a smile deferential slightly sneering our own opinion is all that either of us can give said beauclerc in my opinion it is the finest view of the progress of natural philosophy the most enlarged the most just in its judgments of the past and in its prescience of the future in the richness of experimental knowledge in its theoretic invention the greatest work by any one individual since the time of bacon and bacon is under your protection too protection my protection said beauclerc pardon me i simply meant to ask if you are one of those who swear by lord verulam i swear by no man i do not swear at all not on philosophical subjects especially swearing adds nothing to faith said beauclerc i stand corrected said churchill and i would go further and add that in argument enthusiasm adds nothing to reasonmuch as i admire as we all admire glancing at miss stanley that enthusiasm with which this favoured work has been advocated i could not help speaking warmly cried beauclerc it is a book to inspire enthusiasm there is such a noble spirit all through it so pure from petty passions from all vulgar jealousies all low concerns judge of a book somebody says by the impression it leaves on your mind when you lay it down this book stands that test at least with me i lay it down with such a wish to followwith steps ever so unequal still to follow where it points the way bravo bravissimo hear him hear him print him print him hotpress from the author to the author hotpress cried churchill and he laughed like one suddenly awakened from the trance of enthusiasm by the cold touch of ridicule stood beauclerc brought down from heaven to earth and by that horrid little laugh not the hearts laugh but my being ridiculous does not make my cause so and that is a comfort and another comfort you may have my dear granville said lady davenant that ridicule is not the test of truth truth should be the test of ridicule but where is the book continued beauclerc helen gave it to him now mr churchill said beauclerc i am really anxious i know you are such a good critic will you show me these faults blame as well as praise must always be valuable from those who themselves excel you are too good said churchill will you then be good enough to point out the errors for me oh by no means cried churchill dont note me do not quote me i am nobody and i cannot give up my authorities but the truth is all i want to get at said beauclerc let her rest my dear sir at the bottom of her well there she is and there she will be for ever and ever and depend upon it none of our windlassing will ever bring her up such an author as this continued beauclerc would have been so glad to have corrected any error so every author tells you but i never saw one of them who did not look blank at a list of errataif you knew how little one is thanked for them but you would be thanked now said beauclercthe faults in style at least nay i am no critic said churchill confident in his habits of literary detection but if you ask me said he as he disdainfully flirted the leaves back and forward with a there now and a here now we should not call that good writingyou could not think this correct i may be wrong but i should not use this phrase hardly english thatcolloquial i think and this awkward ablative absolutenever admitted now thank you said beauclerc these faults are easily mended easily mended say you i say better make a new one who could said beauclerc how many faults you see said helen which i should never have perceived unless you had pointed them out and i am sorry to know them now smiling at helens look of sincere mortification in contrast at this moment with mr churchills air of satisfied critical pride lady davenant said why sorry my dear helen no human work can be perfect mr churchill may be proud of that strength of eye which in such a powerful light can count the spots but whether it be the best use to make of his eyes or the best use that can be made of the light remains to be considered chapter xv beyond measure was churchill provoked to find lady davenant against him and on the same side as granville beauclercall unused to contradiction in his own society where he had long been supreme he felt a difference of opinion so sturdily maintained as a personal insult for so young a man as beauclerc yet unknown to fame not only to challenge the combat but to obtain the victory was intolerable and the more so because his young opponent appeared no ways elated or surprised but seemed satisfied to attribute his success to the goodness of his cause churchill had hitherto always managed wisely his great stakes and pretensions in both the fashionable and literary world he had never actually published any thing except a clever article or two in a review or an epigram attributed to him but not acknowledged having avoided giving his measure it was believed he was above all who had been publicly triedit was always saidif horace churchill would but publish he would surpass every other author of our times churchill accordingly dreaded and hated all who might by possibility approach the throne of fashion or interfere with his dictatorship in a certain literary set in london and from this moment he began cordially to detest beauclerche viewed him with a scornful yet with jealous eyes but his was the jealousy of vanity not of love it regarded lady davenant and his fashionable reputation in the first placehelen only in the second lady davenant observed all this and was anxious to know how much or how little helen had seen and what degree of interest it excited in her mind one morning when they were alone together looking over a cabinet of cameos lady davenant pointed to one which she thought like mr beauclerc helen did not see the likeness people see likenesses very differently said lady davenant but you and i helen usually see characters if not faces with the same eyes i have been thinking of these two gentlemen mr churchill and mr beauclercwhich do you think the most agreeable mr churchill is amusing certainly said helen but i think mr beauclercs conversation much more interestingthough mr churchill is agreeable sometimeswhen when he flatters you said lady davenant when he is not satiricali was going to say said helen there is a continual petty brilliancy a petty effort too continued lady davenant in mr churchill that tires mesparks struck perpetually but then you hear the striking of the flints the clink of the tinderbox helen though she admitted the tinderbox thought it too low a comparison she thought churchills were not mere sparks well fireworks if you will said lady davenant that rise blaze burst fall and leave you in darkness and with a disagreeable smell too and its all feu dartifice after all now in beauclerc there is too little art and too ardent nature some french friends of mine who knew both said of mr churchill de lesprit on ne peut pas plus mme paris the highest compliment a parisian can pay but they allowed that beauclerc had beaucoup plus dame yes said helen how far superior it has been said continued lady davenant that it is safer to judge of men by their actions than by their words but there are few actions and many words in life and if women would avail themselves of their daily hourly opportunities of judging people by their words they would get at the natural characters or what is of just as much consequence they would penetrate through the acquired habits and here helen you have two good studies before you preoccupied as helen was with the certainty of beauclerc being an engaged almost a married man and looking as she did on churchill as one who must consider her as utterly beneath his notice she listened to lady davenants remarks as she would have done to observations about two characters in a novel or on the stage as churchill could not immediately manifest his hatred of beauclerc it worked inwardly the more he did not sleep well this night and when he got up in the morning there was something the matter with him nervous biliouscross it could not bejournalier a french word settles everythingjournalier he allowed he was he rather gloried in it because his being permitted to be so proved his powerhis prerogative of fortune and talent combined in the vast competition of the london world it is not permitted to every man to be in his humour or out of his humour at pleasure but by an uncommon combination of circumstances churchill had established his privilege of caprice he was allowed to have his bad and his good days and the highest people and the finest smiled and submitted to his cachet de faveur et de disgrace and when he was sulky rude or snappish called it only horace churchills way they even prided themselves on his preferences and his aversions horace is always charming when he is with uswith me you have no idea how delightful he isindeed i must do him the justice to say that i never found him otherwisewhile the less favoured permitted him to be as rude as he pleased and only petted him and told of his odd ways to those who sighed in vain to have him at their parties but lady davenant was not a person to pet or spoil a child of any age and to the general mr churchill was not particularly agreeablenot his sort while to lady cecilia secure in grace beauty and fashion his humours were only matter of amusement and she bore with him pleasantly and laughingly such weather cried he in a querulous tone how can a man have any sense in such weather some foreigner says that the odious climate of england is an overbalance for her good constitution the sun of the south is in truth well worth the liberty of the north it is a sad thing said he with a very sentimental air that a freeborn briton should be servile to these skyey influences and grumbling on he looked out of the window as cross as he pleased and nobody minded him the aidedecamp civilly agreed with him that it was horrid weather and likely to rain and it did rain and every one knows how men like children are in certain circumstances affected miserably by a rainy day there was no going out horses at the door and obliged to be dismissed well since there could be no riding the next best thing the aidedecamp thought was to talk of horses and the officers all grew eager and churchill had a mind to exert himself so far as to show them that he knew more of the matter than they did that he was no mere bookman but on this unlucky day all went wrong it happened that horace fell into some grievous error concerning the genealogy of a famous racehorse and disconcerted more than he would have been at being convicted of any degree of moral turpitude vexed and ashamed he talked no more of newmarket or of doncaster left the raceground to those who prided themselves on the excellences of their fourfooted betters and lounged into the billiardroom he found lady cecilia playing with beauclerc miss stanley was looking on churchill was a famous billiardplayer and took his turn to show how much better than beauclerc he performed but this day his hand was out his eye not good he committed blunders of which a novice might have been ashamed and there was miss stanley and there was beauclerc by to see and beauclerc pitied him o line extreme of human misery he retreated to the bookroom but there the intellectual horace with all the sages poets and novelists of every age within his reach reached them not but with his hands in his pockets like any squire or schoolboy under the load of ignorance or penalties of idleness stood before the chimneypiece eyeing the pendule and verily believing that this morning the hands went backward dressingtime at last came and dinnertime bringing relief how often to man and child illtempered but this day to churchill dinner brought only discomfiture worse discomfited some of the neighbouring families were to dine at clarendon park mr churchill abhorred country neighbours and country gentlemen among these however were some not unworthy to be perceived by him and besides these there were some foreign officers one in particular from spain of high rank and birth of the sangre azul the blue blood who have the privilege of the silken cord if they should come to be hanged this spaniard was a man of distinguished talent and for him horace might have been expected to shine out it was his pleasure however this day to disappoint expectations and to do the dishonours of his country he would talk only of eating of which he was privileged not only to speak but to judge and pronounce upon en dernier ressort though this was only an air for he was not really a gourmand but after ogling through his glass the distant dishes when they with a wish came nigh he after a cursory glance or a close inspection made them with a nod retire at last he thought an opportunity offered for bringing in a wellprepared anecdote which he had about cambaeres and a hot blackbird and white feet but unluckily a country gentleman would tell some history of a battle between poachers and gamekeepers which fixed the attention of the company till the moment for the anecdote was past horace left his tale untold and spoke word never more till a subject was started on which he thought he could come out unrivalled general clarendon had some remarkably good wines churchill was referred to as a judge and he allowed them to be all good but he prided himself on possessing a certain spanish wine esteemed above all price because not to be had for moneyamontillado is its name horace appealed to the spanish officer who confirmed all he said of this vinous phenomenon no cultivator can be certain of producing it it has puzzled almost to death all the growers of xeresit is a variety of sherry almost as difficult to judge of as to procure but mr churchill boasted he had some undoubtedly genuine he added that spanish judges had assured him his taste was so accurate he might venture to pronounce upon the difficult question of amontillado or not while he yet spoke general clarendon unawares placed before him some of this very fine wine which as he finished speaking churchill swallowed without knowing it from some other sherry which he had been drinking he would have questioned that it was genuine but the spaniard as far as he could pretend to judge thought it unquestionable churchills countenance fell in a manner that quite surprised helen and exceedingly amused lady cecilia he was more mortified and vexed by this failure than by all the rest for the whole table smiled the evening of this day of misfortune was not brighter than the morning everything was wrongeven at nightat night when at last the dinner company the country visitors relieved him from their presence and when some comfort might be had he thought stretched in a good easychairlord davenant had set him the example but something had happened to all the chairsthere was a variety of fashionable kinds he tried them by turns but none of them this night would suit him yet lady cecilia maintained for the general had chosen them that they were each and all of them in their way comfortable in the full english spirit of the word and according to the french explanation of comfortable given to us by the duchess dabrantes convenablement bon but in compassion to mr churchills fastidious restlessness she would now show him a perfection of a chair which she had just had made for her own boudoir she ordered that it should be brought and in it rolled and it was looked at in every direction and sat in and no fault could be found with it even by the great faultfinder but what was it called it was neither a lounger nor a dormeuse nor a cooper nor a nelson nor a kangaroo a chair without a name would never do in all things fashionable the name is more than half such a happy name as kangaroo lady cecilia despaired of finding for her new favourite but she begged some one would give it a good one whoever gave her the best name should be invited to the honours and pleasures of the sitting in this chair for the rest of the night her eyes and all eyes turned upon mr churchill but whether the occasion was too great or that his desire to satisfy the raised expectation of the public was too high strained or that the time was out of joint or that he was out of sorts the fact was he could find no name beauclerc who had not yet tried the chair sank into its luxurious depth and leaning back asked if it might not be appropriately called the sleepyhollow sleepyhollow repeated lady cecilia excellent and by acclamation sleepyhollow was approved but when beauclerc was invited to the honours of the sitting he declined declaring that the name was not his invention only his recollection it had been given by a friend of his to some such easy chair this magnanimity was too much for horace he looked at his watch found it was bedtime pushed the chair out of his way and departed beauclerc the first and last idea in this his day of mortifications seeing a man subject to these petty irritations lowers him in the eyes of woman for that susceptibility of temper arising from the jealousy of love even when excited by trifles woman makes all reasonable all natural allowance but for the jealousy of selflove she has no pity unsuited to the manly characterso helen thought and so every woman thinks chapter xvi it was expected by all who had witnessed his discomfiture and his parting push to the chair that mr churchill would be off early in the morningsuch was his wont when he was disturbed in vanity but he reappeared at breakfast this day was a good day with horace he determined it should be so and though it was again a wet day he now showed that he could rule the weather of his own humour when intensity of will was wakened by rivalry he made himself most agreeable and the man of yesterday was forgotten or remembered only as a foil to the man of today the words he so much loved to hear and to which he had so often surreptitiously listened were now repeated no one can be so agreeable as horace churchill is on his good days bright he shone out all gaiety and graciousness the cachet de faveur was for all but its finest impression was for helen he tried flattery and wit each playing on the other with reflected and reflecting lustre for a woman naturally says to herself when this man has so much wit his flattery even must be worth something and another day came and another and another party of friends filled the house and still mr churchill remained and was now the delight of all as far as concerned his successes in society no one was more ready to join in applause than beauclerc but when helen was in question he was different though he had reasoned himself into the belief that he could not yet love miss stanley therefore he could not be jealous but he had been glad to observe that she had from the first seemed to see what sort of a person mr churchill was she was now only amused as everybody must be but she would never be interested by such a man as horace churchill a wit without a soul if she werewhy he could never feel any further interest about herthat was all so it went on and now lady cecilia was as much amused as she expected by these daily jealousies conflicts and comparisons the feelings perpetually tricking themselves out and strutting about calling themselves judgments like the servants in gil blas in their masters clothes going about as counts dukes and grandees well really said lady cecilia to helen one day as she was standing near her tambour frame you are an industrious creature and the only very industrious person i ever could bear i have myself a natural aversion to a needle but that tambour needle i can better endure than a common one because in the first place it makes a little noise in the world one not only sees but hears it getting on one finds that without dragging it draws at every link a lengthened chain it is called chainstitch is it not said the aidedecamp and miss stanley is working on so famously fast at it she will have us all in her chains by and by bow miss stanley said lady cecilia that pretty compliment deserves at least a bow if not a lookup i should prefer a lookdown if i were to choose said churchill beggars must not be choosers said the aidedecamp but the very reason i can bear to look at you working helen continued lady cecilia is because you do look up so oftenso refreshingly the professed notables i detestthose who never raise their eyes from their everlasting work whatever is said read thought or felt is with them of secondary importance to that bit of muslin in which they are making holes or that bit of canvass on which they are perpetrating such figures or flowers as nature scorns to look upon i did not mean anything against you mamma i assure you continued cecilia turning to her mother who was also at her embroidering frame because though you do work or have work before you to do you justice you never attend to it in the least thank you my dear cecilia said lady davenant smiling i am indeed a sad bungler but still i shall always maintain a great respect for work and workers and i have good reasons for it and so have i said lord davenant i only wish that men who do not know what to do with their hands were not ashamed to sew if custom had but allowed us this resource how many valuable lives might have been saved how many rich ennuys would not have hung themselves even in november what years of war what overthrow of empires might have been avoided if princes and sultans instead of throwing handkerchiefs had but hemmed them no no said lady davenant recollect that the race of spanish kings has somewhat deteriorated since they exchanged the sword for the tambourframe we had better have things as they are leave us the privilege of the needle and what a valuable resource it is sovereign against the root of all evilan antidote both to love in idleness and hate in idlenesswhich is most to be dreaded let those who have felt both decide i think we ladies must be allowed to keep the privilege of the needle to ourselves humble though it be for we must allow it is a good one good at need said churchill there is an excellent print by bouck i believe of an old woman beating the devil with a distaff distaffs have been out of fashion with spinsters ever since i fancy but as she was old churchill said lord davenant might not your lady have defied his black majesty without her distaff his black majesty i admire your distinction my lord said churchill but give it more emphasis for all kings are not black in the eyes of the fair it is said you know and here he began an anecdote of regal scandal in which lady cecilia stopped him now horace i protest against your beginning with scandal so early in the morning none of your on dits for decencys sake before luncheon wait till evening churchill coughed and shrugged and sighed and declared he would be temperate he would not touch a character upon his honour he would only indulge in a few little personalities it could not hurt any ladys feelings that he should criticise or praise absent beauties so he just made a review of all he could recollect in answer to a question one of the officers captain warmsley had asked him and which in an absent fit he had had the illmanners yesterday as now he recollected not to answerwhom he considered as altogether the handsomest woman of his acquaintance beauclerc was now in the room and horace was proud to display before him in particular his infinite knowledge of all the fair and fashionable and all that might be admitted fashionable without being fairall that have the je ne sais quoi which is than beauty dearer as one conscious of his power to consecrate or desecrate by one look of disdain or one word of praise he stood and beginning at the lowest conceivable point his uttermost notion of want of beautyhis laid ideal naming one whose image no doubt every charitable imagination will here supply horace next fixed upon another for his mediocrity pointwhat he should call just well enoughassez bien assezjust up to the bellasis motto bonne et belle assez then in the ascending scale he rose to those who in common parlance may be called charming fascinating and still for each he had his fastidious look and depreciating word just keeping within the verge horace without exposing himself to the ridicule of coxcombry ended by sighing for that being made of every creatures bestperfect yet free from the curse of perfection then suddenly turning to beauclerc and tapping him on the shoulderdo give us your notionsto what sort of a body or mind now would you willingly bend the knee beauclerc could not or would not telli only know that whenever i bend the knee said he it will be because i cannot help it beauclerc could not be drawn out either by churchills persiflage or flattery and he tried both to talk of his tastes or opinions of women he felt too much perhaps about love to talk much about it this all agreed well in helens imagination with what lady cecilia had told her of his secret engagement she was sure he was thinking of lady blanche and that he could not venture to describe her lest he should betray himself and his secret then leaving churchill and the talkers he walked up and down the room alone at the further side seeming as if he were recollecting some lines which he repeated to himself and then stopping before lady cecilia repeated to her in a very low voice the following i saw her upon nearer view a spirit yet a woman too her household motions light and free and steps of virgin liberty a countenance in which did meet sweet records promises as sweet a creature not too bright or good for human natures daily food for transient sorrows simple wiles praise blame love kisses tears and smiles helen thought lady blanche must be a charming creature if she was like this picture but somehow as she afterwards told lady cecilia she had formed a different idea of lady blanche forrestercecilia smiled and asked how different how helen did not exactly know but altogether she had imagined that she must be more of a heroine or perhaps more of a woman of rank and fashion she had not formed any exact ideabut different altogether from this description lady cecilia again smiled and said very natural and after all not very certain that the lady blanche is like this picture which was not drawn for her or from her assuredlya resemblance found only in the imagination to which we are all of us more or less dupes and tant mieux say itant pis says mammaand all mothers there is one thing i like better in mr beauclercs manners than in mr churchill said helen there are a hundred i like better said lady cecilia but what is your one thing that he always speaks of women in general with respectas if he had more confidence in them and more dependence upon them for his happiness now mr churchill with all the adoration he professes seems to look upon them as idols that he can set up or pull down bend the knee to or break to pieces at pleasurei could not like a man for a friend who had a bad or even a contemptuous opinion of womencould you cecilia certainly not lady cecilia said the general had always naturally the greatest respect for women whatever prejudices he had taken up had been only caught from others and lasted only till he had got rid of the impression of certain untoward circumstances even a grave serious dislike both lady cecilia and helen agreed that they could bear better than that persiflage which seemed to mock even while it most professed to admire horace presently discovered the mistakes he had made in his attempts and repaired them as fast as he could by his infinite versatility the changes shaded off with a skill which made them run easily into each other he perceived that mr beauclercs respectful air and tone were preferred and he now laid himself out in the respectful line adding as he flattered himself something of a finer point more polish in whatever he said and with more weight of authority but he was mortified to find that it did not produce the expected effect and after having done the respectful one morning as he fancied in the happiest manner he was vexed to perceive that he not only could not raise helens eyes from her work but that even lady davenant did not attend to him and that as he was rounding one of his best periods her looks were directed to the other side of the room where beauclerc sat apart and presently she called to him and begged to know what it was he was reading she said she quite envied him the power he possessed of being rapt into future times or past completely at his authors bidding to be transported how and where he pleased beauclerc brought the book to her and put it into her hand as she took it she said as we advance in life it becomes more and more difficult to find in any book the sort of enchanting entrancing interest which we enjoyed when life and books and we ourselves were new it were vain to try and settle whether the fault is most in modern books or in our ancient selves probably not in either the fact is that not only does the imagination cool and weaken as we grow older but we become as we live on in this world too much engrossed by the real business and cares of life to have feeling or time for factitious imaginary interests but why do i say factitious while they last the imaginative interests are as real as any others thank you said beauclerc for doing justice to poor imagination whose pleasures are surely after all the highest the most real that we have unwarrantably as they have been decried both by metaphysicians and physicians the book which had so fixed beauclercs attention was segurs history of napoleons russian campaign he was at the page where the burning of moscow is describedthe picture of buonapartes despair when he met resolution greater than his own when he felt himself vanquished by the human mind by patriotism by virtuevirtue in which he could not believe the existence of which with all his imagination he could not conceive the power which his indomitable will could not conquer beauclerc pointed to the account of that famous inscription on the iron gate of a church which the french found still standing the words written by rostopchin after the burning of his delightful home frenchmen i have been eight years in embellishing this residence i have lived in it happily in the bosom of my family the inhabitants of this estate amounting to seventeen hundred and twenty have quitted it at your approach and i have with my own hands set fire to my own house to prevent it from being polluted by your presence see what one even one magnanimous individual can do for his country exclaimed beauclerc how little did this sacrifice cost him sacrifice do i say it was a pridea pleasure churchill did not at all like the expression of helens countenance for he perceived she sympathised with beauclercs enthusiasm he saw that romantic enthusiasm had more charm for her than wit or fashion and now he meditated another change of style he would try a noble style he resolved that the first convenient opportunity he would be a little romantic and perhaps even take a touch at chivalry a burst like beauclerc but in a way of his own at the degeneracy of modern times he tried itbut it was quite a failure lady cecilia as he overheard whispered to helen what was once so happily saidah le pauvre homme comme il se batte les flancs dun enthousiasme de commande horace was too clever a man to persist in a wrong line or one in which his test of right success did not crown his endeavours if this did not do something else wouldshould it was impossible that with all his spirit of resource he should ultimately fail to please and to make an impression on helen a greater impression than beauclercto annoy beauclerc in short was still independently of all serious thoughts the utmost object of churchills endeavours end of the first volume volume the second chapter i about this time a circumstance occurred which seemed to have nothing to do with churchill or beauclerc but which eventually brought both their characters into action and passion lord davenant had purchased at the sale of dean stanleys pictures several of those which had been the deans favourites and which independently of their positive merit were peculiarly dear to helen he had ordered that they should be sent down to clarendon park at first he only begged houseroom for them from the general while he and lady davenant were in russia then he said that in case he should never return he wished the pictures should be divided between his two dear children cecilia and helen and that to prevent disputes he would make the distribution of them himself now and in the kindest and most playful manner he allotted them to each always finding some excellent reason for giving to helen those which he knew she liked best and then there was to be a hanging committee for hanging the pictures which occasioned a great deal of talking beauclerc always thinking most of helen or of what was really best for the paintings horace most of himself and his amateurship among these pictures were some fine wouvermans and other hunting and hawking pieces and one in particular of the duchess and her ladies from don quixote beauclerc who had gone round examining and admiring stood fixed when he came to this picture in which he fancied he discovered in one of the figures some likeness to helen the lady had a hawk upon her wrist churchill came up eagerly to the examination with glass at eye he could not discern the slightest resemblance to miss stanley but he was in haste to bring out an excellent observation of his own which he had made his own from a quarterly review illustrating the advantage it would be to painters to possess knowledge even of kinds seemingly most distant from the line of their profession for instance now priori one should not insist upon a great painters being a good ornithologist and yet for want of being something of a birdfancier look here what he has donequite absurd a sort of hawk introduced such as never was or could be at any hawking affair in nature would not sit upon ladys wrist or answer to her callwould never fly at a bird now you see this is a ridiculous blunder while churchill plumed himself on this critical remark captain warmsley told of who still kept hawks in england and of the hawking parties he had seen and heard ofeven this year that famous hawking in wiltshire and that other in norfolk churchill asked warmsley if he had been at lord berners when landseer was there studying the subject of his famous hawking scene have you seen it lady cecilia continued he it is beautiful the birds seem to be absolutely coming out of the picture and he was going on with some of his connoisseurship and telling of his mortification in having missed the purchase of that picture but warmsley got back to the hawking he had seen and he became absolutely eloquent in describing the sport churchill though eager to speak listened with tolerably polite patience till warmsley came to what he had forgot to mentionto the label with the date of place and year that is put upon the herons leg to the heron brought from denmark where it had been caught with the label of having been let fly from lord berners for continued he the heron is always to be saved if possible so when it is down and the hawk over it the falconer has some raw beef ready minced and lays it on the herons back or a pigeon just killed is sometimes used the hawk devours it and the heron quite safe as soon as it recovers from its fright mounts slowly upward and returns to its heronry helen listened eagerly and so did lady cecilia who said you know helen our favourite washington irving quotes that in days of yore a lady of rank did not think herself completely equipped in riding forth unless she had her tasselgentel held by jesses on her delicate hand before her words were well finished beauclerc had decided what he would do and the business was half done that is well begun he was at the library table writing as fast as pen could go to give carte blanche to a friend to secure for him immediately a whole hawking establishment which warmsley had mentioned and which was now upon public sale or privately to be parted with by the present possessor at the very moment when beauclerc was signing and sealing at one end of the room at the other horace churchill to whom something of the same plan had occurred was charming lady cecilia clarendon by hinting to her his schemeanticipating the honour of seeing one of his hawks borne upon her delicate wrist beauclerc after despatching his letter came up just in time to catch the sound and the sense and took horace aside to tell him what he had done horace looked vexed and haughtily observed that he conceived his place at erlesmede was better calculated for a hawking party than most places in england and he had already announced his intentions to the ladies the way was open to himbut beauclerc did not see why he should recede the same post might carry both their lettersboth their orders how far did your order go may i ask said churchill carte blanche churchill owned with a sarcastic smile that he was not prepared to go quite so far he was not quite so young as granville he unfortunately had arrived at years of discretionhe said unfortunately without ironical reservation he protested from the bottom of his heart he considered it as a misfortune to have become that slow circumspect sort of creature which looks before it leaps even though this might save him from the fate of the man who was in sicily still he considered it as unfortunate to have lost so much of his natural enthusiasm natural enthusiasm beauclerc could not help repeating to himself and he went on his own way it must be confessed as even beauclercs best friends allowed counting among them lady davenant and his guardian that never was man of sense more subject to that kind of temporary derangement of the reasoning powers which results from being what is called bit by a fancy he would then run on straight forward without looking to the right or the left in pursuit of his object great or small that hawking establishment now in view completely shut out for the moment all other objects of tercels and of lures he talks and before his imagination were hawking scenes and helen with a hawk on her wrist looking most gracefula hawk of his own training it should be then how to train a hawk became the question while he was waiting for the answer to his carte blanche nothing better or so good could be done as to make himself master of the whole business and for this purpose he found it essential to consult every book on falconry that could be found in the library and a great plague he became to everybody in the course of this bookhunt what a bore warmsley might be excused for muttering deep and low between the teeth general clarendon sighed and groaned lady davenant bore and forebore philosophicallyit was for beauclerc and to her great philosophy she gave all the credit of her indulgent partiality lady cecilia halfannoyed yet ever goodnatured carried her complaisance so far as to consult the catalogue and bookshelves sundry times in one hour but she was not famous for patience and she soon resigned him to a better friendhelen the most indefatigable of bookhunters she had been well trained to it by her uncle had been used to it all her life and really took pleasure in the tiresome business she assured beauclerc it was not the least trouble and he thought she looked beautiful when she said so whosoever of the male kind young and of ardent not to say impatient spirit has ever been aided and abetted in a sudden whim assisted forwarded above all sympathised with through all the changes and chances of a reigning fancy may possibly conceive how charming and more charming every hour perhaps minute helen became in beauclercs eyes but all in the way of friendship observe perfectly soon her part for she could not have another idea and it was for this reason she was so much at her ease he so understood it and thoroughly a gentleman free from coxcombry as he was and interpreting the language and manners of women with instinctive delicacy they went on delightfully churchill was on the watch but he was not alarmed all was so undisguised and frank that now he began to feel assured that love on her side not only was but ever would be quite out of the question beauclerc was indeed in the present instance really and truly intent upon what he was about and he pursued the history of falconry with all its episodes from the olden time of the boke of st albans down to the last number of the sporting magazine including colonel thorntons latest flight with the adventures of his red falcons miss mghee and lord townsend and his red tercels messrs croc franc and craignonnot forgetting that nevertobe forgotten hawking of the emperor arambombamboberus with trebizonian eagles on the authority of a manuscript in the grand signiors library beauclerc had such extraordinary dependence upon the sympathy of his friends that when he was reading any thing that interested him no matter what they might be doing he must have their admiration for what charmed him he brought his book to lord davenant who was writing a letter listen oh listen to this pathetic lament of the falconerhawks heretofore the pride of royalty the insignia of nobility the ambassadors present the priests indulgence companion of the knight and nursling of the gentle mistress are now uncalledfor and neglected ha very well that said goodnatured lord davenant stopping his pen dipping again dotting and going on then beauclerc passaged to lady davenant and interrupting her in scotts lives of the novelists on which she was deeply intent allow me my dear lady davenant though you say you are no great topographer to show you this it is so curious this royal falconers proclamationhenry the eighthsto preserve his partridges pheasants and herons from his palace at westminster to st giless in the fields and from thence to islington hampstead and highgate under penalty for every bird killed of imprisonment or whatever other punishment to his highness may seem meet lady davenant vouchsafed some suitable remark consonant to expectation on the changes of times and places and men and manners and then motioned the quarto away with which motion the quarto reluctantly complied and then following lady cecilia from window to window as she tended her flowers he would insist upon her hearing the table of precedence for hawks she who never cared for any table of precedence in her life even where the higher animals were concerned would only undertake to remember that the merlin was a ladys hawk and this only upon condition that she should have one to sit upon her wrist like the fair ladies in wouvermans pictures but further as to peregrine gerfalcon or gerkin she would hear nought of them nor could she listen though granville earnestly exhorted to the several good reasons which make a falcon dislike her master st if he speak rudely to her nd if he feed her carelessly before he could get thirdly out lady cecilia stopped him declaring that in all her life she never could listen to any thing that began with first and secondlyreasons especially horace meanwhile looked superior down and thought with ineffable contempt of beauclercs little skill in the arts of conversation thus upon unwilling ears to squander anecdotes which would have done him credit at some london dinner what i could have made of them and may make of them yet thought he but some there are who never can contrive as other some cleverly do to ride their hobbyhorses to good purpose and good effectnow beauclercs hobbies i plainly see will always run away with him headlong cost him dear certainly and may be leave him in the mire at last what this fancy was to cost him beauclerc did not yet know two or three passages in the sporting magazine had given some hints of the expense of this most delectable of all country contentments which he had not thought it necessary to read aloud and he knew that the late lord orford an ardent pursuer of this royal and noble sport had expended one hundred ayear on every hawk he kept each requiring a separate attendant and being moreover indulged in an excursion to the continent every season during moultingtime but beauclerc said to himself he had no notion of humouring his hawks to that degree they should aristocratic birds though they be content themselves in england and not pretend to damn the climate like a lord and he flattered himself that he should be able to pursue his fancy more cheaply than any of his predecessors but as he had promised his guardian that after the indulgence granted him in the beltravers cause he would not call upon him for any more extraordinary supplies he resolved in case the expense exceeded his ways and means to sell his hunters and so indulge in a new love at the expense of an old one the expected pleasure of the first days hawking was now bright in his imagination the day was named the weather promised well and the german cadgers and trainers who had been engaged and who along with the whole establishment were handed over to beauclerc were to come down to clarendon park and beauclerc was very happy teaching the merlins to sit on lady cecilias and on miss stanleys wrist helens voice was found to be peculiarly agreeable to the hawk who as beauclerc observed loved like lear that excellent thing in woman a voice ever soft gentle and low the ladies were to wear some pretty dresses for the occasion and all was gaiety and expectation and churchill was mortified when he saw how well the thing was likely to take that he was not to be the giver of the fte especially as he observed that helen was particularly pleasedwhen to his inexpressible surprise granville beauclerc came to him a few days before that appointed for the hawkingparty and said that he had changed his mind that he wished to get rid of the whole concernthat he should be really obliged to churchill if he would take his engagement off his hands the only reason he gave was that the establishment would altogether be more than he could afford he found he had other calls for money which were incompatible with his fancy and therefore he would give it up churchill obliged him most willingly by taking the whole upon himself and he managed so to do in a very ingenious way without incurring any preposterous expense he was acquainted with a set of rich fashionable young men who had taken a sporting lodge in a neighbouring county who desired no better than to accede to the terms proposed and to distinguish themselves by giving a fte out of the common line while churchill who understood like a true man of the world the worldly art of bargaining contrived with offhand gentlemanlike jockeying to have every point settled to his own convenience and he was to be the giver of the entertainment to the ladies at clarendon park when this change in affairs was announced lady cecilia the general lady davenant and helen were all in various degrees surprised and each tried to guess what could have been the cause of beauclercs sudden relinquishment of his purpose he wasvery extraordinary for himimpenetrable he adhered to the words i found i could not afford it his guardian could not believe in this wonderful prudence and was almost certain there must be some imprudence at the bottom of it all granville neither admitted nor repelled that accusation lady cecilia worked away with perpetual little strokes hoping to strike out the truth but as she said you might as well have worked at an old flint nothing was elicited from him even by lady davenant nor did the collision of all their opinions throw any light upon the matter meanwhile the day for the hawkingparty arrived churchill gave the fete and beauclerc as one of the guests attended and enjoyed it without the least appearance even of disappointment and so far from envying churchill he assisted in remedying any little defects and did all he could to make the whole go off well the party assembled on a rising ground a flag was displayed to give notice of the intended sport the falconers appeared picturesque figures in their green jackets and their long gloves and their caps plumed with herons featherssome with the birds on their wristsone with the frame over his shoulder upon which to set the hawk set did we sayno cast your hawk on the perch is beauclerc observed the correct term for as horace sarcastically remarked mr beauclerc might be detected as a novice in the art by his overexactness his too correct too attic pronunciation of the hawking language but granville readily and gaily bore all this ridicule and raillery sure that it would neither stick nor stain enjoying with all his heart the amusement of the scenethe assembled ladies the attendant cavaliers the hoodwinked hawks the ringing of their brass bells the falconers anxiously watching the clouds for the first appearance of the bird their skill in loosening the hoods as having but one hand at liberty they used their teeth to untie the stringand now the hoods are off and the hawks let fly they were to fly many castes of hawks this day the first flight was after a curlew and the riding was so hard so dangerous from the broken nature of the ground that the ladies gave it up and were contented to view the sport from the eminence where they remained and now there was a question to be decided among the sportsmen as to the comparative rate of riding at a fox chase and in the short but terrifically hard gallop with the eyes raised to the clouds which is necessary for the full enjoyment of hawking and then the gentlemen returning gathered round the ladies and the settling the point watches in hand and bets depending added to the interest of flight the first and churchill master of the revels was in the highest spirits but presently the sky was overcast the morning lowered the wind rose and changed was churchills brow there is no such thing as hawking against the windthat capricious wind curse the wind cried churchill and confusion seize the fellow who says there is to be no more hawking today the chief falconer however was a phlegmatic german and properbehaved as good falconers should be who as old tristrams booke has it even if a bird should be lost he should never swear and only say dieu soit lou and remember that the mother of hawks is not dead but horace in the face of reason and in defiance of his german counsellors insisted upon letting fly the hawks in this high wind and it so fell out that in the first place all the terms he used in his haste and spleen were wrong and in the next that the quarry taking down the wind the horsemen could not keep up with the hawks the falconers in great alarm called to them by the names they gave themmiss didlington lord berners ha miss didlingtons offoff with blucher and lady kirby and lord berners and all of em after her miss didlington flew fast and far and further still till she and all the rest were fairly out of sightlost lost lost and as fine a caste of hawks they were as ever came from germanythe falconers were in despair and churchill saw that the fault was his and it looked so like cockney sportsmanship if horace had been in a towering rage it would have been well enough but he only grew pettish snappish waspish now none of those words ending in ish become a gentleman ladies always think so and lady cecilia now thought so and helen thought so too and churchill saw it and he grew pale instead of red and that looks ugly in an angry man but beauclerc excused him when he was out of hearing and when others said he had been cross and crosser than became the giver of a gala beauclerc pleaded well for him that falconry has ever been known to be an extreme stirrerup of the passions being subject to mischances infinite however a cold and hot collation under the trees for some and under a tent for others set all to rights for the present champagne sparkled and horace pledged and was pledged and all were gay even the germans at their own table after their own fashion with their rhenish and their foaming ale contrived to drown the recollection of the sad adventure of the truant hawks and when all were refreshed and renewed in mind and body to the hawking they went again for now that the wind was laid and all their fears asleep there was to be a battle between heron and hawk one of the finest sights that can be in all falconry look look miss stanley cried granville look follow that highflown hawkthat black speck in the clouds now now right over the heron and now she will canceleerturn on her wing miss stanley as she comes down whirl round and balance herselfchanceler now now look cancelleering gloriously but helen at this instant recollected what captain warmsley had said of the freshkilled pigeon which the falconer in the nick of time is to lay upon the herons back and now even as the cancelleering was going onthree times most beautifully helen saw only the dove the white dove which that blackhearted german held his great hand round the throat just raised to wring it oh beauclerc save it save it cried lady cecilia and helen at once beauclerc sprang forward and had it been a tiger instead of a dove would have done the same no doubt at that moment the dove was saved and the heron killed if helen was pleased so was not the chief falconer nor any of the falconers the whole german council in combustion and horace churchill deeming it rather extraordinary that any gentleman should so interfere with other gentlemens hawks lady cecilia stepped between and never stepped in vain she drew a ring from her fingera seal it was the seal of peaceno great valuebut a wellcut birda bird for the chief falconera guineahen with its appropriate cry its polite motto come back come back and she gave it as a pledge that the ladies would come back another day and see another hawking and the gentlemen were pleased and the aggrieved attendant falconers pacified by a promise of another heron from the heronry at clarendon park and the clouded faces brightened and she smoothed the raven down of darkness till it smiled whatever that may mean but as milton said it it must be sense as well as sound at all events in plain prose be it understood that every body was satisfied even mr churchill for beauclerc had repaired for him just in time an error which would have been a blot on his gallantry of the day he had forgotten to have some of the pretty grey hairs plucked from the heron to give to the ladies to ornament their bonnets but beauclerc had secured them for him and also two or three of those muchvalued smooth black feathers from the head of the bird which are so much prized that a plume of them is often set with pearls and diamonds horace presented these most gracefully to lady cecilia and helen and was charmed with lady cecilias parting compliments which finished with the words quite chivalrous and so after all the changes and chances of weather wind and humour all ended well and no one rued the hawking of this day chapter ii but all this time said lady davenant you have not told me whether you have any of you found out what changed granvilles mind about this falconry schemewhy he so suddenly gave up the whole to mr churchill such a pointblank weathercock turn of fancy in most young men would no more surprise me than the changes of those clouds in the sky now shaped and now unshaped by the driving wind but in granville beauclerc there is always some reason for apparent caprice and the reason is often so ingeniously wrong that it amuses me to hear it and even as a study in human nature i am curious to know the simple fact but no one could tell the simple fact no one could guess his reason and from him it never would have been knownnever could have been found out but from a mistakefrom a letter of thanks coming to a wrong person one morning when helen was sitting in lady davenants room with her lord davenant came in reading a letter like one walking in his sleep what is all this my dear can you explain it to me some good action of yours i suppose for which i am to be thanked lady davenant looked at the letter she had nothing to do with the matter she said but on second thoughts exclaimed this is granville beauclercs doing i am clear the letter was from count polianski one of the poor banished poles now poor but who had been formerly master of a property estimated at about one hundred and sixtyfive thousand available individuals in attempting to increase the happiness and secure the liberty of these available individuals the count had lost every thing and had been banished from his countrya man of high feeling as well as talents and who had done all he could for that unhappy country torn to pieces by demagogues from within and tyrants from without lady davenant now recollected that beauclerc had learned from her all this and had heard her regretting that the circumstances in which lord davenant was placed at this moment prevented the possibility of his affording this poor count assistance for numbers of his suffering fellowcountrymen who had been banished along with him and who were now in london in the utmost distress lady davenant remembered that she had been speaking to granville on this subject the very day that he had abandoned his falconry project now i understand it all said she and it is like all i know and all i have hoped of him these hundreds ayear which he has settled on these wretched exiles are rather better disposed of in a noble national cause than in pampering one set of birds that they may fly at another set and yet this is done said lord davenant by one of the much reviled highbred english gentlemenamong whom let the much reviling lowbred english democrats say what they will we find every day instances of subscription for public purposes from private benevolence in a spirit of princely charity to be found only in our own dear englandengland with all her faults but this was a less ordinary sort of generosity of granvilles said lady davenantthe giving up a new pleasure a new whim with all its gloss fresh upon it full and bright in his eye true said lord davenant i never saw a strongpulling fancy better thrown upon its haunches the white dove whose life helen had saved was brought home by beauclerc and was offered to her and accepted whether she had done a good or a bad action by thus saving the life of a pigeon at the expense of a heron may be doubted and will be decided according to the several tastes of ladies and gentlemen for herons or doves as lady davenant remarked helens humanity or doveanity as churchill called it was of that equivocal sort which is ready to destroy one creature to save another which may happen to be a greater favourite be this as it may the favourite had a friend upon the present occasion and no less a friend than general clarendon who presented it with a marble basin such as doves should drink out of by right of long prescription the general feared he said that this vase might be a little too deepdangerously perhaps but helen thought nothing could be altogether more perfect in taste and in kindnessapproving beauclercs kindness tooa remembrance of a day most agreeably spent churchill to whom she looked as she said the last words with all becoming politeness bowed and accepted the compliment but with a reserve of jealousy on the brow and as he looked again at the dove caressing and caressed and then at the classic vasehe stood vexed and to himself he said so this is the end of all my painshawking and all quite chivalrous beauclerc carries off the honours and pleasures of the day and his present and his dove are to be all in all yet still continued he to himself in more consolatory thoughtshe is so open in her very love for the bird that it is plain she has not yet any love for the man she would be somewhat more afraid to show it delicate as she is it is only friendshiphonest friendship on her side and if her affections be not engaged somewhere elseshe may be mine ifif i pleaseifi can bring myself fairly to proposewe shall seei shall think of it and now he began to think of it seriouslymiss stanleys indifference to him and the unusual difficulty which he found in making any impression stimulated him in an extraordinary degree helen now appeared to him even more beautiful than he had at first thought herthose eyes that fix so softly thought he those dark eyelashesthat blush coming and going so beautifullyand there is a timid grace in all her motions with that fine figure tooand that highbred turn of the neckaltogether she is charming and she will be thought soshe must be mine she would do credit to his taste he thought she would when she had a little more usage du monde do the honours of his house well and it would be delightful to train herif he could but engage her affections before she had seen more of the world she might really love him for his own sakeand churchill wished to be really loved if possible for his own sake but of the reality of modern love he justly doubted especially for a man of his fortune and his age yet with helens youth and innocence he began to think he had some chance of disinterested attachment and he determined to bring out for her the higher powers of his mindthe better parts of his character one day lady davenant had been speaking of london conversation so brilliant said she so shortlived as my friend lady emmeline konce said london wit is like gas which lights at a touch and at a touch can be extinguished and lady davenant concluded with a compliment to him who was known to have this touch and go of good conversation to perfection mr churchill bowed to the compliment but afterwards sighed and it seemed an honest sigh from the bottom of his heart only lady davenant and helen were in the room and turning to lady davenant he said if i have it i have paid dearly for it more than it is worth much too dearly by the sacrifice of higher powers i might have been a very different person from what i am helens attention was instantly fixed but lady davenant suspected he was now only talking for effect he saw what she thoughtit was partly true but not quite he felt what he said at the moment and besides there is always a sincere pleasure in speaking of ones self when one can do it without exposing ones self to ridicule and with a chance of obtaining real sympathy it was my misfortune he said to be spoiled even in childhood by my mother as he pronounced the word mother either his own heart or helens eyes made him pause with a look of respectful tenderness it was cruel of a son to blame the fond indulgence of a mother but the fact was she brought him too forward early as a clever child fed him too much with that sweet dangerous fostering dew of praise the childthe manmust suffer for it afterwards true very true said lady davenant i quite agree with you i could do nothing without flattery continued he pursuing the line of confession which he saw had fixed lady davenants attention favourably unluckily i came too early into possession of a large fortune and into the london world and i lapped the stream of prosperity as i ran and it was sweet with flattery intoxicating and i knew it and yet could not forbear it then in a london life every thing is too stimulatingoverexciting if there are great advantages to men of science and literature in museums and public libraries the more than avicenna advantages of having books come at will and ministering spirits in waiting on all your pursuitsthere is too much of every thing except time and too little of that the treasures are within our reach but we cannot clutch we have but we cannot hold we have neither leisure to be good nor to be great who can think of living for posterity when he can scarcely live for the day and sufficient for the day are never the hours thereof from want of time and from the immense quantity that nevertheless must be known comes the necessity the unavoidable necessity of being superficial why should it be unavoidable necessity asked lady davenant because should waits upon must in london always if not elsewhere said churchill a conversation answer replied lady davenant yes i allow it it is even so just so and to such tricks such playing upon words do the bad habits of london conversation lead and lady davenant wondered at the courage of his candour as he went on to speak of the petty jealousies the paltry envy the miserable selfish susceptibility generated by the daily competition of london society such dissensions such squabblesan ignoble but appropriate wordsuch deplorable such scandalous squabbles among literary and even among scientific men and who continued he who can hope to escape in such a tainted atmospherean atmosphere overloaded with life peopled with myriads of little buzzing stinging vanities it really requires the strength of hercules mind and body to go through our labours fashionable political bel esprit altogether too much for mortal in parliament in politics in the tug of war you see how the strongest minds fail come to untimely do not touch upon that subject cried lady davenant suddenly agitated then commanding herself she calmly addedas you are not now i think in parliament it cannot affect you what were you sayingyour health of mind and body i think you said you were sensible had been hurt by these straining incessant competitions have hurt me my health suffered first then my temper it was originally good now as you have seen i am afraidglancing at helen who quickly looked down i am afraid i am irritable there was an awkward silence helen thought it was for lady davenant to speak but lady davenant did not contradict mr churchill now the not contradicting a person who is abusing himself is one of the most heinous offences to selflove that can be committed and it often provokes false candour to pull off the mask and throw it in your face but either mr horace churchills candour was true or it was so well guarded at the moment that no such catastrophe occurred worse than this bad effect on my temper continued he i feel that my whole mind has been deterioratedmy ambition dwindled to the shortest spanmy thoughts contracted to the narrow view of mere effect what would please at the dinnertable or at the clubswhat will be thought of me by this literary coterie or in that fashionable boudoir and for this reputation de salon i have sacrificed all hope of other reputation all power of obtaining it all hope of here he added a few words murmured down to lady davenants embroidery frame yet still in such a tone that helen could not help thinking he meant she should hearif i had a heart such as he paused and as if struck with some agonising thought he sighed deeply and then addedbut i have not a heart worth such acceptance or i would make the offer helen was not sure what these words meant but she now pitied him and she admired his candour which she thought was so far above the petty sort of character he had at first done himself the injustice to seem and she seized the first opportunity to tell beauclerc all mr churchill had said to lady davenant and to her and of the impression it had made upon them both beauclerc had often discussed mr churchills character with her but she was disappointed when she saw that what she told made no agreeable impression on beauclerc at first he stood quite silent and when she asked what he thought he saidits all very fine very clever but it is all true said helen and i admire mr churchills knowing the truth so well and telling it so candidly every thing mr churchill has said may be trueand yet i think the truth is not in him you are not usually so suspicious said helen if you had heard mr churchills voice and emphasis and seen his look and manner at the time i think you could not have doubted him the more eager she grew the colder mr beauclerc became look and manner and voice and emphasis said he make a great impression i know on ladies but what is your reason mr beauclerc for disbelief i have as yet only heard that you believe every thing that mr churchill said was true and yet that you do not believe in his truth said helen in a tone of raillery and many a time before had beauclerc been the first to laugh when one of his own paradoxes stared him in the face but now he was more out of countenance than amused and he looked seriously about for reasons to reconcile his seeming selfcontradiction in the first place all those allusions and those metaphorical expressions which you have so wonderfully well remembered and which no doubt were worth remembering all those do not give me the idea of a man who was really feeling in earnest and speaking the plain truth about faults for which if he felt at all he must be too much ashamed to talk in such a grand style and to talk of them at all except to most intimate friends seems so unnatural and quite out of character in a man who had expressed such horror of egotists and who is so excessively circumspect in general yes but mr churchills forgetting all his little habits of circumspection and all fear of ridicule is the best proof of his being quite in earnestthat all he said was from his heart i doubt whether he has any heart said beauclerc poor man he said helen began and then recollecting the words or i would make the offer she stopped short afraid of the construction they might bear and then ashamed of her fear she coloured deeply poor man he said repeated beauclerc fixing his eyes upon her what did he say may i ask no said helen i am not sure that i distinctly heard or understood mr churchill oh if there was any mystery beauclerc begged pardon and he went away very quickly he did not touch upon the subject again but helen saw that he never forgot it and by few words which she heard him say to lady davenant about his dislike to halfconfidences she knew he was displeased and she thought he was wrong she began to fear that his mistrust of churchill arose from envy at his superior success in society and though she was anxious to preserve her newlyacquired good opinion of churchills candour she did not like to lose her esteem for beauclercs generosity was it possible that he could be seriously hurt at the readiness with which mr churchill availed himself of any idea which beauclerc threw out and which he dressed up and passed as his own perhaps this might be what he meant by the truth is not in him she remembered one day when she sat between him and beauclerc and when he did not seem to pay the least attention to what mr beauclerc was saying to her yet fully occupied as he had apparently been in talking for the company in general he had through all heard granville telling the chinese fable of the man in the moon whose business it is to knit together with an invisible silken cord those who are predestined for each other presently before the dessert was over helen found the chinese man in the moon whom she thought she had all to herself figuring at the other end of the table and received with great applause and was it possible that beauclerc with his abundant springs of genius could grudge a drop thus stolen from him but without any envy in the case he was right in considering such theft however petty as a theft and right in despising the meanness of the thief such meanness was strangely incompatible with mr churchills frank confession of his own faults could that confession be only for effect her admiration had been sometimes excited by a particular happiness of thought beauty of expression or melody of language in mr churchills conversation once beauclerc had been speaking with enthusiasm of modern greece and his hopes that she might recover her ancient character and mr churchill as if admiring the enthusiasm yet tempering it with better judgment smiled paused and answered but greece is a dangerous field for a political speculator the imagination produces an illusion resembling the beautiful appearances which are sometimes exhibited in the sicilian straits the reflected images of ancient grecian glory pass in a rapid succession before the mental eye and delighted with the captivating forms of greatness and splendour we forget for a moment that the scene is in reality a naked waste some people say they can distinguish between a written and a spoken style but this depends a good deal on the art of the speaker churchill could give a colloquial tone to a readywritten sentence and could speak it with an offhand grace a carelessness which defied all suspicion of preparation and the look and pause and precipitationeach and all came in aid of the actors power of perfecting the illusion if you had heard and seen him you would have believed that in speaking this passage the thought of the fata morgana rose in his mind at the instant and that seeing it pleased you and pleased with it himself encouraged by your look of intelligence and borne along by your sympathy the eloquent man followed his own idea with a happiness more than care admirable in conversation a few days afterwards helen was very much surprised to find her admired sentence word for word in a book from which churchills card fell as she opened it persons without a name horace treated as barbarians who did not know the value of their gold and he seemed to think that if they chanced to possess rings and jewels they might be plucked from them without remorse and converted to better use by some lucky civilised adventurer yet in his most successful piracies he was always haunted by the fear of discovery and he especially dreaded the acute perception of lady davenant he thought she suspected his arts of appropriation and he took the first convenient opportunity of sounding her opinion on this point how i enjoy said he to lady cecilia telling a good story to you for you never ask if it is a fact now in a good story no one sticks to absolute fact there must be some little embellishment no one would send his own or his friends story into the world without putting a hat on its head and a stick into its hand churchill triumphantly quoted this time he did not steal but said lady davenant i find that even the pleasure i have in mere characteristic or humorous narration is heightened by my dependence on the truththe character for truthof the narrator not only horace churchill but almost every body present except helen confessed that they could not agree with her the character for truth of the storyteller had nothing to do with his story unless it was historique or that he was to swear to it and even if it were historique cried horace buoyed up at the moment by the tide in his favour and floating out farther than was prudentand even if it were historique how much pleasanter is graceful fiction than grim rigid truth and how much more amusing in my humble opinion now said lady davenant for instance this book i am readingit was dumonts mmoires de mirabeauthis book which i am reading gives me infinitely increased pleasure from my certain knowledge my perfect conviction of the truth of the author the selfevident nature of some of the facts would support themselves you may say in some instances but my perceiving the scrupulous care he takes to say no more than what he knows to be true my perfect reliance on the relaters private character for integrity gives a zest to every anecdote he tellsa specific weight to every word of conversation which he repeatsappropriate value to every trait of wit or humour characteristic of the person he describes without such belief the characters would not have to me as they now have all the power and charm and life of nature and reality they are all now valuable as records of individual varieties that have positively so existed while the most brilliant writer could by fiction have produced an effect valuable only as representing the general average of human nature but adding nothing to our positive knowledge to the data from which we can reason in future churchill understood lady davenant too well to stand quite unembarrassed as he listened and when she went on to say how differently she should have felt in reading these memoirs if they had been written by mirabeau himself with all his brilliancy all his talents how inferior would have been her enjoyment as well as instruction his shrinking conscience told him how this might all be applied to himself yet strange to say though somewhat abashed he was nevertheless flattered by the idea of a parallel between himself and mirabeau to mirabeauder was no easy task it was a certain road to notoriety if not to honest fame but even in the better parts of his character his liberality in money matters his goodnatured patronage of rising genius the meanness of his mind broke out there was a certain young poetess whom he had encouraged she happened to be sister to mr mapletofft lord davenants secretary and she had spoken with enthusiastic gratitude of mr churchills kindness she was going to publish a volume of sonnets under mr churchills patronage and as she happened to be now at some country town in the neighbourhood he requested lady cecilia to allow him to introduce this young authoress to her she was invited for a few days to clarendon park and mr churchill was zealous to procure subscriptions for her and eager to lend the aid of his fashion and his literary reputation to bring forward the merits of her book indeed he whispered he had given her some little help in the composition and all went well till in an evil hour helen praised one of the sonnets rather too muchmore he thought than she had praised another which was his own his jealousy wakenedhe began to criticise his proteges poetry helen defended her admiration and reminded him that he had himself recommended these lines to her notice wellyesi did say the best i could for the whole thing and for her it is surprisingthat is i am anxious the publication should take but if we come to compareyou know this cannot stand certain comparisons that might be made miss stanleys own taste and judgment must perceivewhen we talk of geniusthat is quite out of the question you know horace was so perplexed between his philanthropy and his jealousy his desire to show the one and his incapability of concealing the other that he became unintelligible and helen laughed and told him that she could not now understand what his opinion really was she was quite ready to agree with him she said if he would but agree with himself this made him disagree still more with himself and unluckily with his better self his benevolence quite gave way before his jealousy and illhumour and he vented it upon the book and instead of prophecies of its success he now groaned over sad careless linespassages that lead to nothingsimiles that will not hold when you come to examine them helen pointed out in the dedication a pretty a happy thought horace smiled and confessed that was his own what in the dedication to himselfand in the blindness of his vanity he did not immediately see the absurdity the more he felt himself in the wrong of course the more angry he grew and it finished by his renouncing the dedication altogether declaring he would have none of it the book and the lady might find a better patron there are things which no man of real generosity could say or do or think put him in ever so great a passion he would not be harsh to an inferiora womana protege on whom he had conferred obligations but mr churchill was harshhe showed neither generosity nor feeling and helens good opinion of him sank to rise no more of this however he had not enough of the sympathy or penetration of feeling to be aware chapter iii the party now at clarendon park consisted chiefly of young people among them were two cousins of lady cecilias whom helen had known at cecilhurst before they went abroad while she was still almost a child lady katrine hawksby the elder was several years older than cecilia when helen last saw her she was tolerably welllooking very fashionable and remarkable for high spirits with a love for quizzing and for all that is vulgarly called fun and a talent for ridicule which she indulged at everybodys expense she had always amused cecilia who thought her more diverting than really illnatured but helen thought her more illnatured than diverting never liked her and had her own private reasons for thinking that she was no good friend to cecilia but now in consequence either of the wear and tear of london life or of a disappointment in love or matrimony she had lost the fresh plumpness of youth and gone too was that spirit of mirth if not of good humour which used to enliven her countenance thin and sallow the sharp features remained and the sarcastic without the arch expression still she had a very fashionable air her pretensions to youth as her dress showed were not gone and her hope of matrimony though declining not set her manyyearsyounger sister louisa now lady castlefort was beautiful as a girl she had been the most sentimental refined delicate creature conceivable always talking poetryand so romanticwith such a soft sweet dieaway voicelips apartand such fine eyes that could so ecstatically turn up to heaven or be so cast down charmingly fixed in contemplationand now she is married just the same there she is established in the library at clarendon park with the most sentimental fashionable novel of the day beautifully bound on the little rosewood table beside her and a manuscript poem a great secret loves last sigh in her bag with her smellingbottle and embroidered handkerchief and on that beautiful arm she leaned so gracefully with her soft languishing expression so perfectly dressed toohandsomer than ever helen was curious to know what sort of man lady louisa had married for she recollected that no hero of any novel that ever was read or talked of came up to her idea of what a hero ought to be of what a man must be whom she could ever think of loving cecilia told helen that she had seen lord castlefort but that he was not lord castlefort or likely to be lord castlefort at that time and she bade her guess among all she could recollect having ever seen at cecilhurst who the man of louisas choice could be lady katrine with infinite forbearance smiled and gave no hint while helen guessed and guessed in vain she was astonished when she saw him come into the room he was a little deformed man for whom lady louisa had always expressed to her companions a peculiar abhorrence he had that look of conceit which unfortunately sometimes accompanies personal deformity and which disgusts even pitys self lord castlefort was said to have declared himself made for love and fighting helen remembered that kindhearted cecilia had often remonstrated for humanitys sake and stopped the quizzing which used to go on in their private coteries when the satirical elder sister would have it that le petit bossu was in love with louisa but what could make her marry him was there anything within to make amends for the exterior nothingnothing that could rid him of the lump behind but superior to the metamorphoses of love or of fairy tale are the metamorphoses of fortune fortune had suddenly advanced him to uncounted thousands and a title and no longer le petit bossu lord castlefort obtained the fair handthe very fair hand of lady louisa hawksby plus belle que fe still helen could not believe that louisa had married him voluntarily but lady cecilia assured her that it was voluntarily quite voluntarily you could not have so doubted had you seen the trousseau and the corbeille for you know le prsent fait oublier le futur helen could scarcely smile but louisa had feelingreally some continued lady cecilia but she could not afford to follow it she had got into such debt i really do not know what she would have done if lord castlefort had not proposed but she has some little heart and i could tell you a secret but no i will leave you the pleasure of finding it out it will be no pleasure to me said helen i never saw anybody so out of spirits cried lady cecilia laughing at anothers unfortunate marriage which all the time she thinks very fortunate she is quite happy and even katrine does not laugh at him any longer it is to be supposed it is no laughing matter now no indeed said helen nor a crying matter either said cecilia do not look shocked at me my dear i did not do it but so many do and i have seen it so often that i cannot wonder with such a foolish face of blamei do believe my dear helen that you are envious because louisa is married before you for shame my love envy is a naughty passion you know our madame bonne used to say but heres mamma now talk to her about louisa castlefort pray lady davenant took the matter with great coolness was neither shocked nor surprised at this match she had known so many worse lord castlefort as well as she recollected was easy enough to live with and after all said she it is better than what we see every day the fairest of the fair knowingly willingly giving themselves to the most profligate of the profligate in short the market is so overstocked with accomplished young ladies on the one hand and on the other men find wives and establishments so expensive clubs so cheap and so much more luxurious than any home liberty not only so sweet but so fashionable that their policy their maxim is marry not at all or if marriage be ultimately necessary to pay debts and leave heirs to good names marry as late as possible and thus the two parties with their opposite interests stand at bay or try to outwit or outbargain each other and if you wish for the moral of the whole affair here it is from the vulgar nurserymaids with their broad sense and bad english and the good or bad french of the governess to the elegant innuendo of the drawingroom all is working to the same effect dancingmasters musicmasters and all the tribe what is it all for but to prepare young ladies for the grand event and to raise in them besides the natural a factitious an abstract idea of good in being married every girl in these days is early impressed with the idea that she must be married that she cannot be happy unmarried here is an example of what i meant the other day by strength of mind it requires some strength of mind to be superior to such a foolish vain and vulgar belief it will require no great strength of mind in me said helen for i really never have formed such notions they never were early put into my head my uncle always said a woman might be very happy unmarried i do not think i shall ever be seized with a terror of dying an old maid you are not come to the time yet my dear said lady davenant smiling look at lady katrine strength of mind on this one subject would have saved her from being a prey to envy and jealousy and all the vulture passions of the mind in the old french rgime continued lady davenant the young women were at least married safely out of their convents but our young ladies with their heads full of highflown poetry and sentimental novels are taken out into the world before marriage expected to see and not to choose shown the most agreeable and expected doomed to marry the most odious but in all these marriages for establishment the wives who have least feeling are not only likely to be the happiest but also most likely to conduct themselves well in the first place they do not begin with falsehood if they have no hearts they cannot pretend to give any to the husband and that is better than having given them to somebody else husband and wife in this case clearly understand the terms of agreement expect imagine no more than they have and jogtrot they go on together to the end of life very comfortably comfortably exclaimed helen it must be most miserable not most miserable helen said lady davenant keep your pity for others keep your sighs for those who need themfor the heart which no longer dares to utter a sigh for itself the faint heart that dares to love but dares not abide by its choice such infatuated creatures with the roots of feeling left aching within them must take what opiates they can find and in afterlife through all their married existence their prayer must be for indifference and thankful may they be if that prayer is granted these words recurred to helen that evening when lady castlefort sang some tender and passionate airs played on the harp with a true saint cecilia air and attitude and at last with charming voice and touching expression sung her favouritetoo late for redress both mr churchill and beauclerc were among the group of gentlemen neither was a stranger to her mr churchill admired and applauded as a connoisseur beauclerc listened in silence mr churchill entreated for moremoreand named several of his favourite italian airs her ladyship really could not but the slightest indication of a wish from beauclerc was without turning towards him heard and attended to as her sister failed not to remark and to make others remark seizing a convenient pause while mr churchill was searching for some masterpiece lady katrine congratulated her sister on having recovered her voice and declared that she had never heard her play or sing since she was married till tonight you may consider it as a very particular compliment i assure you continued she addressing herself so particularly to mr beauclerc that he could not help being a little out of countenancei have so begged and prayed but she was never in voice or humour or heart or something yesterday even castlefort was almost on his knees for a songwere not you lord castlefort lord castlefort pinched his pointed chin and casting up an angry look replied in a dissonant voicei do not remember tout voir tout entendre tout oublier whispered lady katrine to mr churchill as she stooped to assist him in the search for a musicbooktout voir tout entendre tout oublier should be the motto adopted by all married people lady castlefort seemed distressed and turned over the leaves in such a flutter that she could not find anything and she rose in spite of all entreaties leaving the place to her sister who was she said so much better a musician and not so foolishly nervous lady castlefort said her voice always went away when she was at all there it ended as far as words went but she sighed and retired so gracefully that all the gentlemen pitied her there is one moment in which illnature sincerely repentsthe moment when it sees pity felt for its victim horace followed lady castlefort to the ottoman on which she sank beauclerc remained leaning on the back of lady katrines chair but without seeming to hear what she said or sung after some time mr churchill not finding his attentions well received or weary of paying them quitted lady castlefort but sat down by helen and in a voice to be heard by her but by no one else he said what a reliefi thought i should never get away then favoured by a loud bravura of lady katrines he went onthat beauty between you and me is something of a boreshei dont mean the lady who is now screamingshe should always sing heaven blessed her with song not sensebut here one is made so fastidious he sighed and for some moments seemed to be given up to the duet which lady katrine and an officer were performing and then exclaimed but so that helen only could hearmerciful heaven how often one wishes one had no ears that captain jones must be the son of stentor and that ladyif angels sometimes saw themselves in a lookingglass when singingthere would be peace upon earth helen not liking to be the secret receiver of his contraband good things was rising to change her place when softly detaining her he said do not be afraid no dangertrust me for i have studied under talma what can you mean i mean continued he that talma taught me the secret of his dying sceneshow every syllable of his dying words might be heard to the furthest part of the audience and igive me credit for my ingenuityknow how by reversing the art to be perfectly inaudible at ten paces distance and yet i trust perfectly intelligible always to you helen now rose decidedly and retreated to a table at the other side of the room and turned over some books that lay thereshe took up a volume of the novel lady castlefort had been readinglove unquestionable she was surprised to find it instantly gently but decidedly drawn from her hand she looked upit was beauclerc i beg your pardon miss stanley but thank you thank you said helen you need not beg my pardon this was the first time beauclerc had spoken in his friendly cordial natural manner to her since their incomprehensible misunderstanding she was heartily glad it was over and that he was come to himself again and now they conversed very happily together for some time though what they said might not be particularly worth recording lady katrine was at helens elbow before she perceived her looking for her sac and lady castlefort came for her third volume and gliding off wished to allfelice felicissima notte neither of these sisters had ever liked helen she was too true for the one and too goodnatured for the other lady katrine had always even when she was quite a child been jealous of lady cecilias affection for helen and now her indignation and disappointment were great at finding her established at clarendon parkto live with the clarendons to go out with lady cecilia now it had been the plan of both sisters that lady katrines present visit should be eternal how they would ever have managed to fasten her ladyship upon the general even if helen had been out of the question need not now be considered their disappointment and dislike to helen were as great as if she had been the only obstacle to the fulfilment of their scheme these two sisters had never agreed doomd by fate to live in all the elegance of hate and since lady castleforts marriage the younger the beautiful being now the successful lady of the ascendant the elder writhed in all the combined miseries of jealousy and dependance and an everyday lessening chance of bettering her condition lord castlefort too for good reasons of his own well remembered detested lady katrine and longed to shake her off in this wish at least husband and wife united but lady castlefort had no decent excuse for her ardent impatience to get rid of her sister she had magnificent houses in town and country ample room everywherebut in her heart she had the smallest heart conceivable and the coldest but had it been ever so large or ever so warm lady katrine was surely not the person to get into it or into any heart male or female there was the despair if katrine was but marriedmr churchill suppose faint was the suppose in lady castleforts imagination not so the hope which rose in lady katrines mind the moment she saw him here how fortunate her ladyship had now come to that no particular age when a remarkable metaphysical phenomenon occurs on one particular subject hope increases as all probability of success decreases this aberration of intellect is usually observed to be greatest in very clever women while mr churchill the flattered object of her present hope knew how to manage with great innocence and modesty and draw her on to overt acts of what is called flirtation rousseau says that a man is always awkward and miserable when placed between two women to whom he is making love but rousseau had never seen mr churchill and had but an imperfect idea of the dexterity the ambiguity that in our days can be successfully practised by an accomplished male coquette absolutely to blind female jealousy may be beyond his utmost skill but it is easy as every days practice shows to keep female vanity pleasantly perplexed by ocular deceptionto make her believe that what she really sees she does not see and that what is unreal is reality to make her to the amusement of the spectators continually stretch out her hand to snatch the visionary good that for ever eludes her grasp or changes on near approach to grinning mockery this delightful game was now commenced with lady katrine and if helen could be brought to take a snatch it would infinitely increase the interest and amusement of the lookers on of this however there seemed little chance but the evil eye of envy was set upon her and the demon of jealousy was longing to work her woe lady castlefort saw with scornful astonishment that mr beauclercs eyes sometimes when she was speaking or when she was singing would stray to that part of the room where miss stanley might be and when she was speaking to him he was wonderfully absent her ladyship rallied him while lady katrine looking on cleared her throat in her horrid way and longed for an opportunity to discomfit helen which supreme pleasure her ladyship promised herself upon the first convenient occasionconvenient meaning when lady davenant was out of the room for lady katrine though urged by prompting jealousy dared not attack her when under cover of that protection from long habit even her sarcastic nature stood in awe of a certain power of moral indignation which had at times flashed upon her and of which she had a sort of superstitious dread as of an incomprehensible incalculable power but temper will get the better of all prudence piqued by some little preference which lady cecilia had shown to helens taste in the choice of the colour of a dress an occasion offered of signalising her revenge which could not be resisted it was a question to be publicly decided whether blue green or white should be adopted for the ladies uniform at an approaching fte she was deputed to collect the votes all the company were assembled lady davenant out of the circle as it was a matter that concerned her not was talking to the gentlemen apart lady katrine went round canvassing blue green or white say blue pray but when she came to helen she made a full stop asked no questionpreferred no prayer but after fixing attention by her pause said i need not ask miss stanleys vote or opinion as i know my cousins and with miss stanley it is always i say ditto to lady cecilia therefore to save trouble i always count two for ceciliaone for herself and one for her double right lady katrine hawksby cried a voice from afar which made her start you are quite right to consider helen stanley as my daughters double for my daughter loves and esteems her as her second selfher better self in this sense helen is lady cecilias double but if you mean bless me i dont know what i meant i declare i could not have conceived that lady davenantmiss stanley i beg a thousand million of pardons helen with anxious goodnature pardoned before she was asked and hastened to pass on to the business of the day but lady davenant would not so let it pass her eye still fixed she pursued the quailing enemyone word more in justice to my daughter i must say her love has not been won by flattery as none knows better than the lady katrine hawksby the unkindest cut of all and on the tenderest part lady katrine could not stand it conscious and trembling she broke through the circle fled into the conservatory and closing the doors behind her would not be followed by helen cecilia or any body lady castlefort sighed and first breaking the silence that ensued said tis such a pity that katrine will always so let her wit run away with herit brings her so continually intofor my part in all humility i must confess i cant help thinking that what with its being unfeminine and altogether so incompatible with what in general is thought amiablei cannot but consider wit in a woman as a real misfortune what say the gentlemen they must decide gentlemen being always the best judges with an appealing tone of interrogation she gracefully looked up to the gentlemen and after a glance towards granville beauclerc unluckily unnoticed or unanswered her eyes expected reply from horace churchill he well feeling the predicament in which he stood between a fool and a femme desprit answered with his ambiguous smile that no doubt it was a great misfortune to have plus desprit quon ne sait mner this is a misfortune said lady davenant that may be deplored for a great genius once in an age but is really rather of uncommon occurrence people complain of wit where nine times in ten poor wit is quite innocent but such is the consequence of having kept bad company wit and illnature having been too often found together when we see one we expect the other and such an inseparable false association has been formed that half the world take it for granted that there is wit if they do but see illnature at this moment mr mapletofft the secretary entered with his face full of care and his hands full of papers lady katrine needed not to feign or feel any further apprehensions of lady davenant for an hour afterwards it was announced that lord and lady davenant were obliged to set off for town immediately in the midst of her hurried preparations lady davenant found a moment to comfort helen with the assurance that whatever happened she would see her again it might end in lord davenants embassy being given up at all events she would see her againshe hoped in a few weeks perhaps in a few days so no leavetakings my dear child and no tearsit is best as it is on my return let me find lord davenants waiting my lady and she hurried away chapter iv absent or present the guardian influence of a superior friend is one of the greatest blessings on earth and after lady davenants departure helen was so full of all she had said to her and of all that she would approve or disapprove that every action almost every thought was under the influence of her friends mind continually she questioned her motives as well as examined her actions and she could not but condemn some of her conduct or if not her conduct her manner towards horace churchill she had been flattered by his admiration and had permitted his attentions more than she ought when her own mind was perfectly made up as to his character ever since the affair of the poetess she had been convinced that she could never make the happiness or redeem the character of one so mean according to the ladies code a woman is never to understand that a gentlemans attentions mean anything more than common civility she is supposed never to see his mind however he may make it visible till he declares it in words but as helen could not help understanding his manner she thought it was but fair to make him understand her by her manner she was certain that if he were once completely convinced not only that he had not made any impression but that he never could make any impression on her heart his pursuit would cease his vanity mortified might revenge itself upon her perhaps but this was a danger which she thought she ought to brave and now she resolved to be quite sincere as she said to herself at whatever hazard probably meaning at the hazard of displeasing cecilia she would make her own sentiments clear and put an end to mr churchills ambiguous conduct and this should be done on the very first opportunity an opportunity soon occurredhorace had a beautiful little topaz ring with which lady katrine hawksby fell into raptures such a charming devicecupid and momus making the world their plaything it was evident that lady katrine expected that the seal should be presented to her besides being extravagantly fond of baubles she desired to have this homage from horace to her surprise and mortification however he was only quite flattered by her approving of his tasteit was his favourite seal and so he kept the topaz and the rogue was bit lady katrine was the more mortified by this failure because it was witnessed by many of the company among whom when she looked round she detected smiles of provoking intelligence soon afterwards the dressingbell rang and she quitted the room one after another every one dropped off except helen who was finishing a letter and horace who stood on the hearth playing with his seal when she came to sealingtime he approached and besought her to honour him by the acceptance of this little seal if he could obliterate momusif he could leave only cupid it would be more appropriate but it was a device invented for him by a french friend and he hoped she would pardon his folly and think only of his love this was said so that it might pass either for mere jest or for earnest his look expressed very sentimental love and helen seized the moment to explain herself decidedly it was a surprisea great surprise to mr churchill a severe disappointment not only to his vanity but to his heart for he had one it was some comfort however that he had not quite committed himself and he recoveredeven in the moment of disappointment he recovered himself time enough dexterously to turn the tables upon helen he thanked her for her candourfor her great care of his happiness in anticipating a danger which might have been so fatal to him but he really was not aware that he had said anything which required so serious an answer afterwards he amused himself with lady katrine at miss stanleys expense representing himself as in the most pitiable case of rejected addressesrejected before he had offered he had only been guilty of folly and he was brought in guilty of love poor helen had to endure not only this persiflage which was soon made to reach her ear but also the reproaches of lady cecilia who said i should have warned you helen not to irritate that mans relentless vanity now you see the consequences but after all what harm can he do me thought helen it is very disagreeable to be laughed at but still my conscience is satisfied and that is a happiness that will last all the rest will soon be over i am sure i did the thing awkwardly but i am glad it is done mr churchill soon afterwards received an invitationa command to join a royal party now at some wateringplace an illustrious person could not live another day without horace le dsir he showed the note and acted despair at being compelled to go and then he departed to the splendid party he went and drowned all recollections of whatever love he had felt in the fresh intoxication of vanitya diurnal stimulus which however degrading and he did feel it degrading was now become necessary to his existence his departure from clarendon park was openly regretted by lady cecilia while lady katrine secretly mourned over the downfall of her projects and beauclerc attempted not to disguise his satisfaction he was all life and love and would then certainly have declared his passion but for an extraordinary change which now appeared in helens manner towards him it seemed unaccountable it could not be absolute caprice she did not even treat him as a friend and she evidently avoided explanation he thought and thought and came as near the truth without touching it as possible he concluded that she had understood his joy at churchills departure that she now clearly perceived his attachment and was determined against him not having the slightest idea that she considered him as a married man he could not even guess the nature of her feelings and all the time helen did not well understand herself she began to be extremely alarmed at her own feelingsto dread that there was something not quite right this dread which had come and gone by fitsthis doubt as to her own sentimentswas first excited by the death of her dovebeauclercs gift the poor dove was found one morning drowned in the marble vase in which it went to drink helen was very sorrythat was surely natural but she was wonderfully concerned lady katrine scoffingly said and before everybody before beauclerc worse than all her ladyship represented to the best of her ability the attitude in which she had found helen mourning over her misfortune the dove in her hand pressed close to her bosomand in tearsabsolutely she would swear to the tears helen blushed tried to laugh and acknowledged it was very foolish well that passed off as only foolish and she did not at first feel that it was a thing much to be ashamed of in any other way but she was sorry that beauclere was by when lady katrine mimicked her most sorry that he should think her foolish but then did he his looks expressed tenderness he was very tenderhearted really manly men always are so and so she observed to lady cecilia lady katrine heard the observation and smiledher odious smileimplying more than words could say helen was not quite clear however what it meant to say some days afterwards lady katrine took up a book in which helens name was written in beauclercs hand gage damiti said her ladyship and she walked up and down the room humming the air of an old french song interrupting herself now and then to ask her sister if she could recollect the words the refrain if i remember right is something like this sous le nom damitisous le nom damiti la moiti du monde trompe lautre moiti sous le nom sous le nom sous le nom damiti and it ends with sous le nom damiti damon je vous adore sous le nom sous le nom damiti miss stanley do you know that song concluded her malicious ladyship nomiss stanley had never heard it before but the marked emphasis with which lady katrine sung and looked made helen clear that she meant to apply the words tauntingly to her and beauclercbut which of them her ladyship suspected was cheating or cheatedsous le nom damiti she did not know all was confusion in her mind after a moments cooler reflection however she was certain it could not be beauclerc who was to blameit must be herself and she now very much wished that every body and lady katrine in particular should know that mr beauclerc was engagedalmost married if this were but known it would put an end to all such imputations the first time she could speak to cecilia on the subject she begged to know how soon mr beauclercs engagement would be declared lady cecilia slightly answered she could not telland when helen pressed the question she asked why are you so anxious helen helen honestly told her and lady cecilia only laughed at her for minding what lady katrine saidwhen you know yourself helen how it is what can it signify what mistakes others may make but helen grew more and more uneasy for she was not clear that she did know how it was with herself at least her conscience faltered and she was not sure whether she was alarmed with or without reason she began to compare feelings that she had read of and feelings that she had seen in others and feelings that were new to herself and in this maze and mist nothing was distinctmuch was magnifiedall alarming one day beauclerc was within view of the windows on horseback on a very spirited horse which he managed admirably but a shot fired suddenly in an adjoining preserve so startled the horse that itoh what it did helen did not see she was so terrified and why was she so much terrified she excused herself by saying it was natural to be frightened for any human creature but on the other hand tom isdall was a human creature and she had seen him last week actually thrown from his horse and had not felt much concern but then he was not a friend and he fell into a soft ditch and there was something ridiculous in it which prevented people from caring about it with such nice casuistry she went on pretty well and besides she was so innocentso ignorant that it was easy for her to be deceived she went on telling herself that she loved beauclerc as a brotheras she loved the general but when she came to comparisons she could not but perceive a difference her heart never bounded on the generals appearance let him appear ever so suddenly as it did one day when beauclerc returned unexpectedly from old forest her whole existence seemed so altered by his approach his presence or his absence why was this was there any thing wrong in it she had nobody whose judgment she could consultnobody to whom she could venture to describe her feelings or lay open her doubts and scruples lady cecilia would only laugh and she could not quite trust either her judgment or her sincerity though she knew her affection besides after what cecilia had said of her being safe after all she had told her of beauclercs engagement how astonished and shocked cecilia would be then helen resolved that she would keep a strict watch over herself and repress all emotion and be severe with her own mind to the utmost and it was upon this resolution that she had changed her manner without knowing how much towards beauclerc she was certain he meant nothing but friendship it was her fault if she felt too much pleasure in his company the same things were as she wisely argued right or wrong according to the intention with which they were said done looked or felt rigidly she inflicted on herself the penance of avoiding his delightful society and to make sure that she did not try to attract she repelled him with all her powerthought she never could make herself cold and stiff and disagreeable enough to satisfy her conscience then she grew frightened at beauclercs looks of astonishmentfeared he would ask explanationavoided him more and more then on the other hand she feared he might guess and interpret wrong or rather right this change and back she changed tried in vain to keep the just mediumshe had lost the power of measuringaltogether she was very unhappy and so was beauclerc he found her incomprehensible and thought her capricious his own mind was fluttered with love so that he could not see or judge distinctly else he might have seen the truth and sometimes though free from conceit he did hope it might be all love but why then so determined to discourage him he had advanced sufficiently to mark his intentions she could not doubt his sincerity he would see farther before he ventured farther he thought a man was a fool who proposed before he had tolerable reason to believe he should not be refused lord beltravers and his sisters were now expected at old forest immediately and beauclerc went thither early every morning to press forward the preparations for the arrival of the family and he seldom returned till dinnertime and every evening lady castlefort contrived to take possession of him it appeared to be indeed as much against his will as it could be between a wellbred man and a highbred belle but to do her bidding seemed if not a moral at least a polite necessity she had been spoiled she owned by foreign attentions not french for that is all gone now at paris but italian manners which she so much preferred she did not know how she could live out of italy and she must convince lord castlefort that the climate was necessary for her health meanwhile she adopted she acted what she conceived to be foreign manners and with an exaggeration common with those who have very little sense and a vast desire to be fashionable with a certain set those who knew her best all but her sister katrine who shook her head were convinced that there was really no harm in lady castlefort only vanity and folly how frequently folly leads farther than fools ever or wise people often foresee we need not here stop to record on the present occasion all at clarendon park even those most inclined to scandal persons who by the by may be always known by their invariable preface of i hate all scandal agreed that no one so far could behave better than granville beauclercso faras yet but all the elderly who had any experience of this world all the young who had any intuitive prescience in these matters could not but fear that things could not long go on as they were now going it was sadly to be feared that so young a man and so very handsome a man and such an admirer of beauty and grace and music and of such an enthusiastic temper must be in danger of being drawn on farther than he was aware and before he knew what he was about the general heard and saw all that went on without seeming to take heed only once he asked cecilia how long she thought her cousins would stay she did not know but she said she saw he wished them to be what they were notcousins once removedand quite agreed with him he smiled for a man is always well pleased to find his wife agree with him in disliking her cousins one nightone fine moonlight nightlady castlefort standing at the conservatory door with beauclerc after talking an inconceivable quantity of nonsense about her passion for the moon and her notions about the stars and congenial souls born under the same planet proposed to him a moonlight walk the general was at the time playing at chess with helen and had the best of the game but at that moment he made a false move was checkmated rose hastily threw the men together on the board and forgot to regret his shameful defeat or to compliment helen upon her victory lady castlefort having just discovered that the fatality nonsense about the stars would not quite do for beauclerc had been the next instant seized with a sudden passion for astronomy she must see those charming rings of saturn which she had heard so much of which the general was showing miss stanley the other night she must beg him to lend his telescope she came up with her sweetest smile to trouble the general for his glass lord castlefort following objected strenuously to her going out at night she had been complaining of a bad cold when he wanted her to walk in the daytime she would only make it worse by going out in the night air if she wanted to see saturn and his rings the general he was sure would fix a telescope at the window for her but that would not do she must have a moonlight walk she threw open the conservatory door beckoned to mr beauclerc and how it ended helen did not stay to see she thought that she ought not even to think on the subject and she went away as fast as she could it was late and she went to bed wishing to be up early to go on with a drawing she was to finish for mrs collingwooda view by the river side that view which had struck her fancy as so beautiful the day she went first to old forest early the next morningand a delightful morning it wasshe was up and out and reached the spot from which her sketch was taken she was surprised to find her little campstool which she had looked for in vain in the hall in its usual place set here ready for her and on it a pencil nicely cut beauclerc must have done this but he was not in general an early riser however she concluded that he had gone over thus early to old forest to see his friend lord beltravers who was to have arrived the day before with his sisters she saw a boat rowing down the river and she had no doubt he was gone but just as she had settled to her drawing she heard the joyful bark of beauclercs dog nelson who came bounding towards her and the next moment his master appeared coming down the path from the wood with quick steps he came till he was nearly close to her then slackened his pace good morning said helen she tried to speak with composure but her heart beatshe could not help feeling surprise at seeing himbut it was only surprise i thought you were gone to old forest said she not yet said he his voice sounded different from usual and she saw in him some suppressed agitation she endeavoured to keep her own manner unembarrassedshe thanked him for the nicelycut pencil and the exactly wellplaced seat he advanced a step or two nearer stooped and looked close at her drawing but he did not seem to see or know what he was looking at at this moment nelson who had been too long unnoticed put up one paw on miss stanleys arm unseen by his master and encouraged by such gentle reproof as helen gave his audacious paw was on the top of her drawingbook the next moment and the next was upon the drawingand the paw was wet with dewnelson exclaimed his master in an angry tone o do not scold him cried helen do not punish him the drawing is not spoiledonly wet and it will be as well as ever when it is dry beauclerc ejaculated something about the temper of an angel while she patted nelsons penitent head as the drawing must be left to dry said beauclerc perhaps miss stanley would do me the favour to walk as far as the landingplace where the boat is to meet meto take meifif i must go to old forest and he sighed she took his offered arm and walked onsurprisedconfusedwondering what he meant by that sigh and that lookand that strong emphasis on must if i must go to old forest was not it a pleasurewas it not his own choicewhat could he meanwhat could be the matter a vague agitating idea rose in her mind but she put it from her and they walked on for some minutes both silent they entered the wood and feeling the silence awkward and afraid that he should perceive her embarrassment and that he should suspect her suspicion she exerted herself to speakto say something no matter what it is a charming morning after a pause of absence of mind he answered charmingvery then stopping short he fixed his eyes upon helen with an expression that she was afraid to understand it could hardly bear any interpretation but oneand yet that was impossibleought to be impossiblefrom a man in beauclercs circumstancesengagedalmost a married man as she had been told to consider him she did not know at this moment what to thinkstill she thought she must mistake him and she should be excessively ashamed of such a mistake and now more strongly felt the dread that he should see and misinterpret or interpret too rightly her emotion she walked on quicker and her breath grew short and her colour heightened he saw her agitationa delightful hope arose in his mind it was plain she was not indifferenthe looked at her but dared not look long enoughfeared that he was mistaken but the embarrassment seemed to change its character even as he looked and now it was more like displeasuredecidedly she appeared displeased and so she was for she thought now that he must either be trifling with her or if serious must be acting most dishonourablyher good opinion of him must be destroyed for ever if as now it seemed he wished to make an impression upon her heartyet still she tried not to think not to see it she was sorry she was very wrong to let such an idea into her mindand still her agitation increased quick as she turned from him these thoughts passed in her mind alternately angry and ashamed and at last forcing herself to be composed telling herself she ought to see farther and at least to be certain before she condemned himcondemned so kind so honourable a friend while the fault might be all her own she now in a softened tone as if begging pardon for the pain she had given and the injustice she had done him said some words insignificant in themselves but from the voice of kindness charming to beauclercs ear and soul are not we walking very fast said she breathless he slackened his pace instantly and with a delighted look while she in a hurried voice added but do not let me delay you there is the boat you must be in hasteimpatient in haste impatient to leave you helen she blushed deeper than he had ever seen her blush before beauclerc in general knew which blush was angers which was loves but now he was so much moved he could not decide at the first glance at the second there was no doubt it was angernot love her arm was withdrawn from his he was afraid he had gone too far he had called her helen he begged pardon half humbly half proudly i beg pardon miss stanley i should have said i see i have offended i fear i have been presumptuous but lady davenant taught me to trust to miss stanleys sincerity and i was encouraged by her expressions of confidence and friendship friendship oh yes mr beauclerc said helen in a hurried voice eagerly seizing on and repeating the word friendship yes i have always considered you as a friend i am sure i shall always find you a sincere good friend friend he repeated in a disappointed toneall his hopes sunk she took his arm again and he was displeased even with that she was not the being of real sensibility he had fanciedshe was not capable of real love so vacillated his heart and his imagination and so quarrelled he alternately every instant with her and with himself he could not understand her or decide what he should next do or say himself and there was the boat nearing the land and they were going on on towards it in silence he sighed it was a sigh that could not but be heard and noticed it was not meant to be noticed and yet it was what could she think of it she could not believe that beauclerc meant to act treacherously this time she was determined not to take anything for granted not to be so foolish as she had been with mr churchill is not that your boat that i see rowing close yes i believecertainly yes said he but now the vacillation of beauclercs mind suddenly ceased desperate he stopped her as she would have turned down that path to the landingplace where the boat was mooring he stood full across the path miss stanley one wordby one word one look decide you must decide for me whether i stayor gofor ever imr beauclerc the look of astonishmentmore than astonishment almost of indignationsilenced him completely and he stood dismayed she pressed onwards and he no longer stopped her path for an instant he submitted in despair then i must not think of it i must gomust i miss stanley will not you listen to me helen advise me let me open my heart to you as a friend she stopped under the shady tree beneath which they were passing and leaning against it she repeated as a friendbut no no mr beauclercno i am not the friend you should consultconsult the general your guardian i have consulted him and he approves you have that is well that is well at all events cried she if he approves then all is right there was a ray of satisfaction on her countenance he looked as if considering what she exactly meant he hoped again and was again resolved to hazard the decisive words if you knew all and he pressed her arm closer to himif i might tell you all helen withdrew her arm decidedly i know all said she all i ought to know mr beauclerc you know all cried he astonished at her manner you know the circumstances in which i am placed he alluded to the position in which he stood with lady castlefort she thought he meant with respect to lady blanche and she answeredyes i know all and her eye turned towards the boat i understand you said he you think i ought to go certainly said she it never entered into her mind to doubt the truth of what lady cecilia had told her and she had at first been so much embarrassed by the fear of betraying what she felt she ought not to feel and she was now so shocked by what she thought his dishonourable conduct that she repeated almost in a tone of severitycertainly mr beauclerc you ought to go the words since you are engagedyou know you are engaged she was on the point of adding but lady cecilias injunctions not to tell him that she had betrayed his secret stopped her he looked at her for an instant and then abruptly and in great agitation said may i ask miss stanley if your affections are engaged is that a question mr beauclerc which you have a right to ask me i have no rightno right i acknowledgei am answered he turned away from her and ran down the bank towards the boat but returned instantly and exclaimed if you say to me go i am gone for ever go helen firmly pronounced you never can be more than a friend to me oh never be lessgo i am gone said he you shall never see me more he went and a few seconds afterwards she heard the splashing of his oars he was gone oh how she wished that they had parted soonera few minutes sooner even before he had so lookedso spoken oh that we had parted while i might have still perfectly esteemed him but now chapter v when helen attempted to walk she trembled so much that she could not move and leaning against the tree under which she was standing she remained fixed for some time almost without thought then she began to recollect what had been before all this and as soon as she could walk she went back for her drawingbook threw from her the pencil which beauclerc had cut and made her way home as fast as she could and up to her own room without meeting anybody and as soon as she was there she bolted the door and threw herself upon her bed she had by this time a dreadful headache and she wanted to try and get rid of it in time for breakfastthat was her first object but her thoughts were so confused that they could not fix upon anything rightly she tried to compose herself and to think the whole affair over again but she could not there was something so strange in what had passed the suddenthe total change in her opinionher total loss of confidence she tried to put all thoughts and feelings out of her mind and just to lie stupified if she could that she might get rid of the pain in her head she had no idea whether it was late or early and was going to get up to look at her watch when she heard the first bell half an hour before breakfast and this was the time when cecilia usually opened the door between their rooms she dreaded the sound but when she had expected it some minutes she became impatient even for that which she feared she wanted to have it over and she raised herself on her elbow and listened with acute impatience at last the door was thrown wide open and bright and gay as ever in came cecilia but at the first sight of helen on her bed wan and miserable she stopped short my dearest helen what can be the matter mr beauclerc well what of him cried cecilia and she smiled oh cecilia do not smile you cannot imagine oh yes but i can cried cecilia i see how it is i understand it all and miserable and amazed as you look at this moment i will set all right for you in one word he is not going to be marriednot engaged helen started up not engaged no more than you are my dear oh i am glad to see your colour come again thank heaven cried helen then he is not a villainnot at all he is all thats right all that is charming my dear so thank heaven and be as happy as you please but i cannot understand it said helen sinking back i really cannot understand how it is cecilia cecilia gave her a glass of water in great haste and was very sorry and very glad and begged forgiveness and all in a breath but as yet helen did not know what she had to forgive till it was explained to her in direct words that cecilia had told her not only what was not true but what she at the time of telling knew to be false for what purpose oh my dear cecilia all to save me from a little foolish embarrassment at first you have made us miserable at last miserable my dear helen at worst miserable only for half an hour nonsense lie down again and rest your poor head i will go this minute to granville where is he gone gone for ever those were his last words impossible absurd only what a man says in a passion but where is he gone only to old forest gone for evergone till dinnertime probably coming back at this moment in all haste like a true lover to beg your pardon for your having used him abominably ill now smile do not shake your head and look so wretched but tell me exactly word for word and look for look all that passed between you and then i shall know what is best to be done word for word helen could not answer for she had been so much confused but she told to the best of her recollection and cecilia still thought no great harm was done she only looked a little serious from the apprehension now the real true apprehension of what might happen about lady blanche who as she believed was at old forest men are so foolish men in love so rash beauclerc in a fit of anger and despair on being so refused by the woman he loved might go and throw himself at the feet of another for whom he did not care in the least in a strange sort of revenge but i know how to settle it all and i will do it this moment but helen caught hold of her hand and firmly detaining it absolutely objected to her doing anything without telling her exactly and truly what she was going to do lady cecilia assured her that she was only going to inquire from the general whether lady blanche was with her sister at old forest or not listen to me my dear helen what i am going to say can do no mischief if lady blanche is there then the best thing to be done is for me to go immediately this very morning to pay the ladies a visit on their coming to the country and i will bring back granville a word will bring him back i will only tell him there was a little mistake or if you think it best i will tell him the whole truth let me goonly let me go and consult the general before the breakfastbell rings for i shall have no time afterwards helen let her go for as beauclerc had told her that he had opened his mind to the general she thought it was best that he should hear all that had happened the moment the general saw lady cecilia come in he smiled and said well my dear cecilia you have seen helen this morning and she has seen beauclercwhat is the result does he stay or go he is gone said cecilia the general looked surprised and sorry he did not propose for her continued cecilia he did not declare himselfhe only began to sound her opinion of him and sheshe contrived to misunderstandto offend him and he is gone but only to old forest and we can have him back again directly that is not likely said the general because i know that beauclerc had determined that if he went he would not return for some time your friend helen was to decide if she gave him any hope that is permitted him to appear as her declared admirer he could with propriety happiness and honour remain here if not my dear cecilia you must be sensible that he is right to go gone for some time repeated cecilia you mean as long as lady castlefort is here yes said the general i wish she was gone i am sure with all my heart said cecilia but in the mean time tell me my dear clarendon do you know whether lord beltravers sisters are at old forest the general did not think that lady blanche had arrived he was not certain but he knew that the comtesse de st cymon had arrived yesterday then said cecilia it would be but civil to go to see the comtesse i will go this morning general clarendon answered instantly and with decision that she must not think of such a thingthat it could not be done madame de st cymon is a woman of doubtful reputation not a person with whom lady cecilia clarendon ought to form any acquaintance no not form an acquaintanceim quite aware of that and eagerly she pleaded that she had no intention of doing anything but just one morning visit paid and returned you know leads to nothing probably we shall neither of us be at home and never meet and really it would be such a marked thing not to pay this visit to the beltravers family on their return to the country formerly there was such a good understanding between the forresters and your father and really hospitality requires it altogether this one visit really must be paid it cannot be helped so i will order the carriage it must not be done the general said it is a question of right not of expediency right but there is nothing really wrong surely i believe all that has been said of her is scandal nobody is safe against reportsthe public papers are so scandalous while a woman lives with her husband it is but charitable to suppose all is right thats the rule besides we should not throw the first stone then lady cecilia pleaded lady this and lady that and the whole county without the least scruple would visit madame de st cymon lady this and lady that may do as they please or as their husbands think proper or improper that is no rule for lady cecilia clarendon and as to the whole county or the whole world what is that to me when i have formed my own determination the fact was that at this very time madame de st cymon was about to be separated from her husband a terrible discovery had just been made lord beltravers had brought his sister to old forest to bide her from london disgrace there he intended to leave her to rusticate while he should follow her husband to paris immediately to settle the terms of separation or divorce beauclerc no doubt will go to paris with him said the general to paris when will he set out todaydirectly if helen has decidedly rejected him but you say he did not declare himself pray tell me all at once and if she had done so all might have been well but she was afraid her husband was as exact about some things as her mother he would certainly be displeased at the deception she had practised on helen she could not tell him that not at this moment for she had just fooled him to the top of his bent about this visit she would find a better time she so dreaded the instant change of his smilethe look of disapprobation she was so cowardly in short the present pain of displeasingthe consequences even of her own folly she never could endure and to avoid it she had always recourse to some new evasion and now when helenher dear helens happiness was at stake she falteredshe palteredshe would not for the world do her any wrong but still she thought she could manage without telling the wholeshe would tell nothing but the truth so after a moments hesitation while all these thoughts went through her mind when the general repeated his question and begged to know at once what was passing in her little head she smiled in return for that smile which played on her husbands face while he fondly looked upon her and she answered i am thinking of poor helen she has made a sad mistakeand has a horrid headache at this momentin short she has offended beauclerc past endurancepast his enduranceand he went off in a passion before she found out her mistake in short we must have him back again could you go my dear loveor write directly first let me understand said the general miss stanley has made a mistakewhat mistake she thought beauclerc was engaged to lady blanche how could she think so what reason had she she had been told so by somebody somebodythat eternal scandalmonger lady katrine i suppose nonot lady katrine said cecilia but i am not at liberty to tell you whom no matter but miss stanley is not a fool she could not believe somebody or anybody contrary to common sense no but beauclerc did not come quite to proposingand you know she had been blamed for refusing mr churchill before she was askedand in shortin love people do not always know what they are about i do not understand one word of it said the general nor i am sure do you my dear cecilia yes i really do but my dear cecilia i assure you it is always best to let people settle their love affairs their own way yes certainlyi would not interfere in the leastonly to get granville back againand then let them settle it their own way cannot you call at old forest no could you not write nonot unless i know the whole i will do nothing in the dark always tell your confessor your lawyer your physician your friend your whole case or they are fools or rogues if they act for you go back and repeat this to helen stanley from me but my dear she will think it so unkind let her show me how i can serve her and i will do it only write a line to beauclercsay beauclerc come backhere has been a mistake she would have put a pen into his hand and held paper to him let me know the whole and then and not till then can i judge whether i should be doing right for her or not the difficulty of telling the whole had increased to lady cecilia even from the hesitation and prevarication she had now made let me see helenlet me speak to her myself and learn what this strange nonsensical mystery is he was getting impatient cannot i see miss stanley why no my dear love not just now she has such a headache she is lying down there is the breakfastbellafter breakfast if you please but i am clear she would rather not speak to you herself on the subject then come down to breakfast my dear and let her settle it her own waythat is much the best plan interference in love matters always does mischief come to breakfast my deari have no time to losei must be off to a courtmartial he looked at his watch and cecilia went half down stairs with him and then ran back to keep helen quiet by the assurance that all would be settledall would be right and that she would send her up some breakfastshe must not think of coming down and cecilia lamented half breakfasttimehow subject to headaches poor helen was and through this and through all other conversation she settled what she would do for her as the last resource she would tell the whole truthnot to her husband she loved him too well to face his displeasure for one momentbut to beauclerc and writing would be so much easier than speakingwithout being put to the blush she could explain it all to beauclerc and turn it playfully and he would be so happy that he would be only too glad to forgive her and to do anything she asked she concocted and wrote a very pretty letter in which she took all the blame fully on herselfdid perfect justice to helen said she wrote without her knowledge and depended entirely upon his discretion so he must come back of his own accord and keep her counsel this letter however she could not despatch so soon as she had expected she could not send a servant with it till the general should be off to his courtmartial now had cecilia gone the straightforward way to work her husband could in that interval and would have set all to rights but this to cecilia was impossible she could only wait in an agony of impatience till the general and his officers were all out of the way and then she despatched a groom with her letter to old forest and desired him to return as fast as possible while she went to helens room to while away the time of anxious suspense as well as she could and she soon succeeded in talking herself into excellent spirits again now my dear helen if that unlucky mistake had not been madeif you had not fancied that granville was married alreadyand if he had actually proposed for youwhat would you have saidin shortwould you have accepted him oh cecilia i do hope he will understand how it all was i hope he will believe that i esteem him as i always did as to love helen paused and lady cecilia went on as to love nobody knows anything about it till it comesand here it is coming i do believe continued she looking out of the windowno not mr beauclerc but the man she had sent with her letter galloping towards the house disappointed not to see beauclerc himself she could only conclude that as he had not his horse with him he was returning in the boat the answer to her letter was brought in at the first glance on the direction her countenance changed not granvilles handwhat can have happened she tore open the note he is gonegone with lord beltraversset offgone to paris helen said not one word and cecilia in despair repeated gonegoneabsolutely gone nothing more can be done oh that i had done nothing about it all has failed heaven knows what may happen now oh if i could but have let it all alone i never never can forgive myself my dear helen be angry with mereproach me praypray reproach me as i deserve but helen could not blame one who so blamed herselfone who however foolish and wrong she had been had done it all from the kindest motives in the agony of her penitence she now told helen all that had passed between her and the general that to avoid the shame of confessing to him her first deception she had gone on another and another step in these foolish evasions contrivances and mysteries how thinking she could manage it she had written without his knowledge and now to complete her punishment not only had every thing which she had attempted failed but a consequence which she could never have foreseen had happenedhere i am with a note actually in my hand from this horrid madame de st cymon whom clarendon absolutely would not hear of my even calling upon look what she writes to me she just took advantage of this opportunity to begin a correspondence before an acquaintance but i will never answer her here is what she says the comtesse de st cymon exceedingly regrets that lady cecilia clarendons servant did not arrive in time to deliver her ladyships letter into mr beauclercs own hand mr b left old forest with lord beltravers early today for paris the comtesse de st cymon understanding that lady cecilia clarendon is anxious that there should be as little delay as possible in forwarding her letter and calculating that if returned by her ladyships servant it must be too late for this days post from clarendon park has forwarded it immediately with her own letters to paris which cannot fail to meet mr beauclerc directly on his arrival there oh cried lady cecilia how angry the general would be if he knew of this she tore the note to the smallest bits as she spoke and threw them away and next she begged that helen would never say a word about it there was no use in telling the general what would only vex him and what could not be helped and what could lead to nothing for she should never answer this note nor have any further communication of any kind with madame de st cymon helen nevertheless thought it would be much better to tell the general of it and she wondered how cecilia could think of doing otherwise and just when she had so strongly reproached herself and repented of these foolish mysteries and this was going on another step indeed cecilia said helen i wishon my own account i wish you would not conceal anything it is hard to let the general suspect me of extreme folly and absurdity or of some sort of double dealing in this business in which i have done my utmost to do right and to go straightforward poor helen with her nervous headache beating worse and worse remonstrated and entreated and came to tears and lady cecilia promised that it should be all done as she desired but again she charged and besought helen to say nothing herself about the matter to the general and this acceded to lady cecilias feelings being as transient as they were vehement all her selfreproaches penitence and fears passed away and taking her bright view of the whole affair she ended with the certainty that beauclerc would return the moment he received her letter that he would have it in a very few days and all would end well and quite as well as if she had not been a fool chapter vi the first tidings of beauclerc came in a letter from him to the general written immediately after his arrival at paris but it was plain that it must have been written before lady cecilias letter forwarded by madame de st cymon could have reached him it was evident that matters were as yet unexplained from his manner of writing about the deathblow to all his hopes and now he was setting off with lord beltravers for naples to follow m de st cymon and settle the business of the sisters divorce lady cecilia could only hope that her letter would follow him thither enclosed in this madame de st cymons despatches to her brother and now they could know nothing more till they could hear from naples meanwhile helen perceived that though the general continued to be as attentive and kind to her as usual yet that there was something more careful and reserved in his manner than formerly less of spontaneous regard and cordial confidence it was not that he was displeased by her having discouraged the addresses of his ward fond as he was of beauclerc and well as he would have been pleased by the match this he distinctly expressed the only time that he touched upon the subject he said that miss stanley was the best and the only judge of what would make her happy but he could not comprehend the nature of the mistake she had made cecilias explanations whatever they were had not made the matter clear there was either some caprice or some mystery which he determined not to inquire into upon his own principle of leaving people to settle their love affairs in their own way helens spirits were lowered naturally of great sensibility she depended more for her happiness on her inward feelings than upon any external circumstances a great deal of gaiety was now going on constantly among the young people at clarendon park and this made her want of spirits more disagreeable to herself more obvious and more observed by others lady katrine rallied her unmercifully not suspecting the truth her ladyship presumed that miss stanley repented of having before she was asked said no instead of yes to mr churchill ever since his departure she had evidently worn the willow lady cecilia was excessively vexed by this illnatured raillery conscious that she had been the cause of all this annoyance to helen and of much more serious evil to her the zeal and tenderness of her affection now increased and was shown upon every little occasion involuntarily in a manner that continually irritated her cousin katrines jealousy helen had been used to live only with those by whom she was beloved and she was not at all prepared for the sort of warfare which lady katrine carried on her perpetual sneers innuendoes and bitter sarcasms helen did not resent but she felt them the arrows illaimed and weak could not penetrate far it was not with their point they wounded but by their venomwherever that touched it worked inward mischief often to escape from one false imputation she exposed herself to another more grievous one night when the young people wished to dance and the usual music was not to be had helen played quadrilles and waltzes for hours with indefatigable goodnature and when some of the party returned their cordial thanks lady katrine whispered our musician has been well paid by lord estridges admiration of her white hands his lordship had not danced and had been standing all the evening beside helen much to the discomfiture of lady katrine who intended to have had him for her own partner the next night helen did not play but joined the dance and with a boy partner whom nobody could envy her the general who saw wonderfully quickly the byplay of society marked all this and now his eye followed helen through the quadrille and he said to some one standing by that miss stanley danced charmingly to his taste and in such a ladylike manner he was glad to see her in good spirits again her colour was raised and he observed that she looked remarkably well yes lady katrine answered remarkably well and black is so becoming to that sort of complexion no doubt this is the reason miss stanley wears it so much longer than is customary for an uncle short or long mournings are to be sure just according to fashion or feeling as some say for my part i hate long mourningsso like ostentation of sentiment whatever i did at any rate i would be consistent i never would dance in black pope you know has such a good cut at that sort of thing do you recollect the lines and bear about the mockery of woe to midnight dances and the public show lady castlefort took miss stanley aside after the dance was over to whisper to her so goodnaturedly how shockingly severe katrine had been faithfully repeating every word that her sister had said and so cruel to talk of your bearing about the mockery of woebut my sweet little lamb do not let me distress you so helen withdrawing from the false caresses of lady castlefort assured her that she should not be hurt by any thing lady katrine could say as she so little understood her real feelings and at the moment her spirit rose against the injustice and felt as much superior to such petty malice as even lady davenant could have desired she had resolved to continue in mourning for the longest period in which it is worn for a parent because in truth her uncle had been a parent to her but the morning after lady katrines cruel remarks cecilia begged that helen would oblige her by laying aside black let it be on my birthday lady cecilias birthday was to be celebrated the ensuing week well for that day certainly i will helen said but only for that day this would not satisfy cecilia helen saw that lady katrines observations had made a serious impression and dreading to become the subject of daily observation perhaps altercation she yielded the mourning was thrown aside then every thing she wore must be new lady cecilia and mademoiselle felicie her waitingmaid insisted upon taking the matter into their own hands helen really intended only to let one dress for her friends birthday be bespoken for her but from one thing she was led on to another lady cecilias taste in dress was exquisite her first general principle was admirablewhatever you buy let it be the best of its kind which is always the cheapest in the end her second maxim wasnever have anything but from such and such people or from such and such places naming those who were at the moment accredited by fashion these of course make you pay high for the name of the thing but that must be the name is all said lady cecilia does your hat your bonnet whatever it be come from the reigning fashionable authority then it is right and you are quite right you can put down all objections and objectors with the magic of a name you need think no more about your dress you have no trouble while the poor creatures who go toiling and rummaging in cheap shopswhat comes of it but total exhaustion and disgrace yesterday now my dear helen recollect when lady katrine after dinner asked little miss isdall where she bought that pretty hat the poor girl was quite out of countenance really she did not know she only knew it was very cheap you saw that nobody could endure the hat afterwards so that cheap as it might be it was money to all intents and purposes absolutely thrown away for it did not answer its purpose helen laughing observed that if its purpose had been to look well and to make the wearer look well it had fully succeeded sophistry my dear helen the purpose was not to look well but to have a distinguished air dress and what we call fashion and taste altogether you know are mere matters of opinion association of ideas and so forth when will you learn to reason as mamma says do not make me despair of you thus half in jest half in earnest with truth and falsehood sense and nonsense prettily blended together lady cecilia prevailed in overpowering helens better judgment and obtained a hasty submission in economy as in morals false principles are far more dangerous than any one single error one false principle as to laying out money is worse than any bad bargain that can be made because it leads to bad bargains innumerable it was settled that all helen wanted should be purchased not only from those who sold the best goods but from certain very expensive houses of fashionably high name in london and the next point lady cecilia insisted upon was that helens dress should always be the same as her own you know it used to be so my dear helen when we were children let it be so now but there is such a difference now said helen and i cannot afford difference oh dont talk of differenceslet there be none ever between us not affordnonsense my dearthe expense will be nothing in these days you get the materials of dress absolutely for nothingthe fashionthe makingup is all us felicie and i and everybody who knows anything of the matter can tell you now all that sort of thing we can save youhere is my wedding paraphernalia all at your servicepatterns ready cutand here is felicie whose whole french soul is in the toiletteand there is your own little maid who has hands and head and heart all devoted to youso leave it to usleave it to us my deartake no thought what you shall put onand you will put it on all the better felicie was summoned felicie remember miss stanleys dress is always to be the same as my own it must be so my dear it will be the greatest pleasure to me and with her most persuasive caressing manner she added my own dear helen if you love me let it be so this was an appeal which helen could not resist she thought that she could not refuse without vexing cecilia and from a sort of sentimental belief that she was doing cecilia a real kindnessthat it was what cecilia called a sisterly act she yielded to what she knew was unsuited to her circumstancesto what was quite contrary to her better judgment it often so happens that our friends doubly guard one obvious point of weakness while another exists undiscovered by them and unknown to ourselves lady davenant had warned helen against the dangers of indecision and coquetry with her lovers but this danger of extravagance in dress she had not foreseenand into how much expense this one weak compliance would lead her helen could not calculate she had fancied that at least till she went to town she should not want anything expensivethis was a great mistake formerly in england as still in every other country but england a marked difference was made in the style of dress in the country and in town formerly overdressing in the country was reprobated as quite vulgar but now even persons of birth and fashion are guilty of this want of taste and sense they display almost as much expensive dress in the country as in town it happened that among the succession of company at clarendon park this summer there came selfinvited from the royal party in the neighbourhood a certain wealthy lady by some called golconda by others the duchess of baubleshire she was passionately fond of dress and she eclipsed all rivals in magnificence and variety of ornaments at imminent peril of being robbed she brought to the country and carried about everywhere with her an amazing number of jewels wearing two or three different sets at different times of the daydisplaying them on the most absurdly improper occasionsat a fete champtre or a boat race once after a ridingparty at a picnic under the trees when it had been resolved unanimously that nobody should change their dress at dinnertime golconda appeared in a splendid necklace displayed over her ridingdress and when she was reproached with having broken through the general agreement not to dress she replied that really she had put the thing on in the greatest hurry without knowing well what it was just to oblige her little page who had brought three sets of jewels for her choiceshe had chosen the most undressed of the three merely because she could not disappoint the poor little fellow every one saw the affectation and folly and above all the vulgarity of this display and those who were most envious were most eager to comfort themselves by ridicule never was the golconda out of hearing but lady katrine was ready with some instance of her absurd vanity if fortune had but blessed her with such jewels lady katrine said she trusted she should have worn them with better grace but it did not appear that the taste for baubles was diminished by the ridicule thrown upon themquite the contrary it was plain that the laughers were only envious and envious because they could not be envied lady cecilia who had no envy in her naturewho was really generousentered not into this vain competition on the contrary she refrained from wearing any of her jewels because helen had none besides simplicity was really the best taste the general said sothis was well thought and well done for some time but there was a little lurking love of ornaments in cecilias mind nor was helen entirely without sympathy in that taste her uncle had early excited it in her mind by frequent fond presents of the prettiest trinkets imaginable the taste had been matured along with her love for one for whom she had such strong affection and it had seemed to die with its origin before she left cecilhurst helen had given away every ornament she possessed she thought she could never want them again and she left them as remembrances with those who had loved her and her uncle cecilia on her birthday brought her a set of forgetmenots to match those which she intended to wear herself and which had been long ago given to lady cecilia by the dear good dean himself this was irresistible to helen and they were accepted but this was only the prelude to presents of more value which helen scrupled to receive yet oft to refuse and never once offend was not so easily done as said especially with lady cecilia she was so urgent so caressing and had so many plausible reasons suitable to all occasions on the generals birthday lady cecilia naturally wished to wear his first gift to hera pair of beautiful pearl bracelets but then helen must have the same helen thought that roman pearl would do quite as well for her she had seen some such excellent imitations that no eye could detect the difference no eye very likely but still your own conscience my dear replied lady cecilia and if people ask whether they are real what could you say you know there are everywhere impertinent people malicious lady katrines who will ask questions oh positively i cannot bear to think of your being detected in passing off counterfeits in all ornaments it should be genuine or nonenone or genuine none then let it be for me this time dear cecilia cecilia seemed to submit and helen thought she had well settled it but on the day of the generals fte the pearl bracelets were on her dressingtable they were from the general and could not be refused cecilia declared she had nothing to do with the matter oh cecilia upon my word cried lady cecilia and if you doubt me the general shall have the honour of presenting and you the agony of refusing or accepting them in full salon helen sighed hesitated and submitted the general on her appearing with the bracelets bowed smiled and thanked her with his kindest look and she was glad to see him look kindly upon her again having gained her point so pleasantly this time lady cecilia did not stop there and helen found there was no resource but to bespeak beforehand for herself whatever she apprehended would be pressed upon her acceptance fresh occasions for display and new necessities for expense continually occurred reviews and races and raceballs and archery meetings and archery balls had been and a regatta was to be at some of these the ladies had appeared in certain uniforms new of course for the day and now preparations for the regatta had commenced and were going on it was to last several days and after the boatraces in the morning there were to be balls at night the first of these was to be at clarendon park and mademoiselle felicie considered her ladys dress upon this occasion as one of the objects of first importance in the universe she had often sighed over the long unopened jewelbox her lady might as well be nobody mademoiselle felicie could no ways understand a lady well born not wearing that which distinguished her above the common and if she was ever to wear jewels the ballroom was surely the proper place and the sapphire necklace would look ravir with her ladys dress which indeed without it would have no effect would be quite msquine and manque now lady cecilia had a great inclination to wear that sapphire necklace which probably felicie saw when she commenced her remonstrances for it is part of the business of the welltrained waitingwoman to give utterance to those thoughts which her lady wishes should be divined and pressed into accomplishment cecilia considered whether it would not be possible to divide the double rows of her sapphires to make out a set for helen as well as for herself she hesitated only because they had been given to her by her mother and she did not like to run the hazard of spoiling the set but still she could manage it and she would do it mademoiselle felicie protested the attempt would be something very like sacrilege to prevent which she gave a hint to helen of what was in contemplation helen knew that with cecilia when once she had set her heart upon a generous feat of this kind remonstrance would be in vain she dreaded that she would if prevented from the meditated division of the sapphires purchase for her a new set she had not the least idea what the expense was but at the moment she thought anything would be better than letting cecilia spoil her mothers present or put her under fresh obligations of this sort she knew that the sapphires had been got from the jewellers with whom her uncle had dealt and who were no strangers to her name she wrote and bespoke a similar set to lady cecilias charmante the very thing mademoiselle felicie foresaw a young lady so well born would determine on doing and if she might add a little word it would be good at the same opportunity to order a ruby brooch the same as her ladys as that would be the next object in question for the second days regatta ball when it would be indispensable for that nights appearance positivement she knew her lady would do it for miss stanley if miss stanley did not do it of her own head helen did not think that a brooch could be very expensive there was not time to consider about itthe post was goingshe was afraid that lady cecilia would come in and find her writing and prevent her sending the letter she hastily added an order for the brooch finished the letter and despatched it and when it was gone she told cecilia what she had done cecilia looked startled she was well aware that helen did not know the high price of what she had bespoken but determining that she would settle it her own way she took care not to give any alarm and shaking her head she only reproached helen playfully with having thus stolen a march upon her you think you have outgeneraled me but we shall see remember i am the wife of a general and not without resources chapter vii of the regatta of the fineness of the weather the beauty of the spectacle and the dresses of the ladies a full account appeared in the papers of the day of which it would be useless here to give a repetition and shameful to steal or seem to steal a description we shall record only what concerns helen with the freshness of youth and of her naturally happy temper she was delighted with the whole to her a perfectly new spectacle and every body was pleased except lady katrine who in the midst of every amusement always found something that annoyed her something that should not have been so she was upon this occasion more cross than usual because this mornings uniform was not becoming to her and was most particularly so to miss stanley as all the gentlemen observed just in time before the ladies went to dress for the ball at night the precious box arrived containing the set of sapphires cecilia opened it eagerly to see that all was right helen was not in the room lady katrine stood by and when she found that these were for helen her envious indignation broke forth the poor daughters of peers cannot indulge in such things cried she they are fit only for rich heiresses i understood continued she that miss stanley had given away her fortune to pay her uncles debts but i presume she has thought better of that as i always prophesied she wouldgenerosity is charming but after all sapphires are so becoming helen came into the room just as this speech was ended lady katrine had one of the bracelets in her hand she looked miserably cross for she had been disappointed about some ornaments she had expected by the same conveyance that brought miss stanleys she protested that she had nothing fit to wear tonight helen looked at cecilia and though cecilias look gave no encouragement she begged that lady katrine would do her the honour to wear these sapphires this night since she had not received what her ladyship had ordered lady katrine suffered herself to be prevailed on but accepted with as ill a grace as possible the ball went on and helen at least was happier than if she had worn the bracelets she had no pleasure in being the object of envy and now when she found that cecilia could be and was satisfied though their ornaments were not exactly alike it came full upon her mind that she had done foolishly in bespeaking these sapphires it was at that moment only a transient selfreproach for extravagance but before she went to rest this night it became more serious lady davenant had been expected all day but she did not arrive till late in the midst of the ball and she just looked in at the dancers for a few minutes before she retired to her own apartment helen would have followed her but that was not allowed after the dancing was over however as she was going to her room she heard lady davenants voice calling to her as she passed by and opening the door softly she found her still awake and desiring to see her for a few minutes if she was not too much tired oh no not in the least tired quite the contrary said helen after affectionately embracing her lady davenant held her at arms length and looked at her as the light of the lamp shone full upon her face and figure pleased with her whole appearance lady davenant smiled and said as she looked at heryou seem helen to have shared the grateful old fairys gift to lady georgiana b of the neverfading rose in the cheek but what particularly pleases me helen is the perfect simplicity of your dress in the few minutes that i was in the ballroom tonight i was struck with that overdressed duchess her figure has been before my eyes ever since hung round with jewellery and with that aurole a foot and ahalf high on her head like the russian brides headgear which heber so well called the most costly deformity he ever beheld really this passion for baubles continued lady davenant is the universal passion of our sex i will give you an instance to what extravagance it goes i know a lady of high rank who hires a certain pair of emerald earrings at fifteen hundred pounds per annum she rents them in this way from some german countess in whose family they are an heirloom and cannot be sold helen expressed her astonishment this is only one instance my dear i could give you hundreds over the whole world women of all ages all ranks all conditions have been seized with this bauble insanityfrom the counter to the throne think of marie antoinette and the story of her necklace and josephine and her cisalpine pearls and all the falsehoods she told about them to the emperor she reverenced the husband she lovedand all for whata string of beads but i forget cried lady davenant interrupting herself i must not forget how late it is and i am keeping you up and you have been dancing forgive me when once my mind is moved i forget all hours good nightor good morning my dear child go and rest but just as helen was withdrawing her hand lady davenants eye fixed on her pearl braceletsroman pearls or real real i see and very valuablegiven to you i suppose by your poor dear extravagant uncle helen cleared her uncles memory from this imputation and explained that the bracelets were a present from general clarendon she did not know they were so very valuable but she hoped she had not done wrong to accept of them in the circumstances and she told how she had been induced to take them lady davenant said she had done quite right the general was no presentmaker and this exception in his favour could not lead to any future inconvenience but cecilia continued she is too much addicted to trinket giving which ends often disagreeably even between friends or at all events fosters a foolish taste and moreover associates it with feelings of affection in a way particularly deceitful and dangerous to such a little tenderhearted person as i am speaking to whose common sense would too easily give way to the pleasure of pleasing or fear of offending a friend kiss me and dont contradict me for your conscience tells you that what i say is true the sapphires the ruby brooch and all her unsettled accounts came across helens mind and if the light had shone upon her face at that moment her embarrassment must have been seen but lady davenant as she finished the last words laid her head upon the pillow and she turned and settled herself comfortably to go to sleep helen retired with a disordered conscience and the first thing she did in the morning was to look in the red case in which the sapphires came to see if there was any note of their price she recollected having seen some little bit of cardit was found on the dressingtable when she beheld the price fear took away her breathit was nearly half her whole years income still she could pay it but the ruby brooch that had not yet arrivedwhat would that cost she hurried to her accounts she had let them run on for months unlooked at but she thought she must know the principal articles of expense in dress by her actual possessions there was a heap of little crumpled bills which with felicies griffonage helen had thrown into her tabledrawer in vain did she attempt to decipher the figures like apothecaries marks linked to quarters and threequarters and yards of gauzes silks and muslins altogether inextricably puzzling they might have been at any other moment laughable but now they were quite terrible to helen the only thing she could make clearly out was the total she was astonished when she saw to how much little nothings can amount an astonishment felt often by the most experiencedhow much more by helen all unused to the arithmetic of economy at this instant her maid came in smiling with a packet as if sure of being the bearer of the very thing her young lady most wished for it was the broochthe very last thing in the world she desired to see with a trembling hand she opened the parcel looked at the note of the price and sank upon her chair half stupified with her eyes fixed upon the sum she sat she knew not how long till roused by the opening of cecilias door she hastened to put away the papers let me see them my dear dont put away those papers cried cecilia felicie tells me that you have been at these horrid accounts these two hours andyou lookmy dear helen you must let me see how much it is she drew the total from beneath helens hand it was astounding even to cecilia as appeared by her first unguarded look of surprise but recovering herself immediately she in a playfully scolding tone told helen that all this evil came upon her in consequence of her secret machinations you set about to counteract me wrote for things that i might not get them for you you see what has come of it as to these bills they are all from tradespeople who cannot be in a hurry to be paid and as to the things felicie has got for you she can wait is not she a waitingwoman by profession now where is the rubybrooch have you never looked at iti hope it is prettyi am sure it is handsome cried she as she opened the case yes i like it prodigiously i will take it off your hands my dear will that do no cecilia i cannot let you do that for you have one the same i know and you cannot want anotherno no you speak like an angel my dear but you do not look like one said cecilia so woebegone so pale a creature never did i see do look at yourself in the glass but you are too wretched to plague seriously i want this brooch and mine it must beit is mine i have a use for it i assure you well if you have a use for it really said helen i should indeed be very glad be glad then it is mine said cecilia and now it is yours my dear helen now not a word pray if you love me helen could not accept of it she thanked cecilia with all her heart she felt her kindnessher generosity but even the hitherto irresistible words if you love me were urged in vain if she had not been in actual need of money she might have been overpersuaded but now her spirit of independence strengthened her resolution and she persisted in her refusal lady davenants bell rang and helen slowly rising took up the miserable accounts and said now i must go where said cecilia you look as if you had heard a knell that summoned youwhat are you going to do to tell all my follies to lady davenant tell your follies to nobody but me cried lady cecilia i have enough of my own to sympathise with you but do not go and tell them to my mother of all people she who has none of her own how can you expect any mercy i do not i am content to bear all the blame i so richly deserve but i know that after she has heard me she will tell me what i ought to do she will find out some way of settling it all rightly and if that can but be i do not care how much i suffer so the sooner i go to her the better said helen but you need not be in such a hurry do not be like the man who said je veux tre lenfant prodigue je veux tre lenfant perdu lenfant prodigue well and good but why lenfant perdu my dear cecilia do not play with me nowdo not stop me said helen anxiously it is serious with me now and it is as much as i can do cecilia let her go but trembled for her as she looked after her and saw her stop at her mothers door helens first knock was too low it was unheard she was obliged to wait another louder was answered by come in and in the presence she stood and into the middle of things she rushed at once the accounts the total lay before lady davenant there it was and the culprit having made her confession stood waiting for the sentence the first astonished change of look was certainly difficult to sustain i ought to have foreseen this said lady davenant my affection has deceived my judgment helen i am sorry for your sake and for my own oh do not speak in that dreadful calm voice as ifdo not give me up at once cried helen what can i do for you what can be done for one who has no strength of mind i have some thought helen or i should not be here at this moment of what avail helen is your good heartyour good intentions without the power to abide by them when you can be drawn aside from the right by the first paltry temptationby that most contemptible of passionsthe passion for baubles you tell me it was not that what then a few words of persuasion from any one who can smile and fondle and tell you that they love youthe fear of offending cecilia how absurd is this what you both call friendship but weaker still helen i perceive that you have been led blindfold in extravagance by a prating french waitingmaidto the brink of ruin the very verge of dishonesty dishonesty how ask yourself helen is a person honest who orders and takes from the owner that for which he cannot pay answer me honest or dishonest dishonest if i had intended not to pay but i did intend to pay and i will you will the weak have no willnever dare to say i will tell me how you will pay that which you owe you have no meansno choice except to take from the fund you have already willed to another purpose see what good intentions come to helen when you cannot abide by them but i can cried helen whatever else i do i will not touch that fund destined for my dear unclei have not touched it i could pay it in two years and i willi will give up my whole allowance and what will you live upon in the mean time i should not have said my whole allowance but i can do with very little i will buy nothing new buy nothinglive upon nothing repeated lady davenant how often have i heard these words said by the most improvident in the moment of repentance even then as blind and uncalculating as ever and you helen talk to me of your powers of forbearanceyou who with the strongest motive your heart could feel have not been able for a few short months to resist the most foolishthe most useless fancies helen burst into tears but lady davenant unmoved at least to all outward appearance coldly said it is not feeling that you want or that i require from you i am not to be satisfied by words or tears i deserve it all said helen and i know you are not cruel in the midst of all this i know you are my best friend lady davenant was now obliged to be silent lest her voice should betray more tenderness than her countenance chose to show only tell me what i can do now continued helen what can i do what you can do i will tell you helen who was the man you were dancing with last night i danced with several which do you mean your partner in the quadrille you were dancing when i came in lord estridge but you know himhe has been often here is he rich said lady davenant oh yes very rich and very selfsufficient he is the man cecilia used to call le prince de mon mrite did she i do not remember he made no impression on me nor on you i dare say not the least indeed no matter he will do as well as another since he is rich you can marry him and pay your present debts and contract new for thousands instead of hundredsthis is what you can do helen do you think i can said helen you can i suppose as well as others you know that young ladies often marry to pay their debts so i once heard said helen but is it possible quite you might have been told morethat they enter into regular partnerships jointstock companies with dressmakers and jewellers who make their ventures and bargains on the more or less reputation of the young ladies for beauty or for fashion supply them with finery speculate on their probabilities of matrimonial success and trust to being repaid after marriage why not pursue this plan next season in town you must come to it like others whose example you followwhy not begin it immediately there is nothing so reassuring to the conscience as to hear in the midst of blame that we do deserve suppositions of faults imputations which we know to be unmeritedimpossible instead of being hurt or alarmed by what lady davenant had said the whole idea appeared to helen so utterly beneath her notice that the words made scarcely any impression on her mind and her thoughts went earnestly back to the pressing main questionwhat can i do honestly to pay this money that i owe she abruptly asked lady davenant if she thought the jeweller could be prevailed upon to take back the sapphires and the brooch certainly not without a considerable loss to you replied lady davenant but with an obvious change for the better in her countenance she added still the determination to give up the bauble is good the means at whatever loss we will contrive for you if you are determined determinedoh yes she ran for the bracelets and brooch and eagerly put them into lady davenants hand and now another bright idea came into her mind she had a carriage of her owna very handsome carriage almost new she could part with ityes she would though it was a present from her dear unclehis last gift and he had taken such pleasure in having it made perfect for her she was very very fond of it but she would part with it she saw no other means of abiding by her promise and paying his debts and her own this passed rapidly through her mind and when she had expressed her determination lady davenants manner instantly returned to all its usual kindness and she exclaimed as she embraced her drew her to her and kissed her again and againyou are my own helen these are deeds helen not words i am satisfiedi may be satisfied with you now and about that carriage my dear it shall not go to a stranger it shall be mine i want a travelling chaisei will purchase it from you i shall value it for my poor friends sake and for yours helen so now it is settled and you are clear in the world again i will never spoil you but i will always serve you and a greater pleasure i cannot have in this world after this happy termination of the dreaded confession how much did helen rejoice that she had had the courage to tell all to her friend the pain was transientthe confidence permanent as helen was going into her own room she saw cecilia flying up stairs towards her with an open letter in her hand her face radiant with joy i always knew it would all end well churchill might well say that all the sand in my hourglass was diamond sand there my dear helenthere cried cecilia embracing her as she put the letter into her hand it was from beauclerc his answer to lady cecilias letter which had followed him to naples it was written the very instant he had read her explanation and warm from his heart he poured out all the joy he felt on hearing the truth and in his transport of delight he declared that he quite forgave lady cecilia and would forget as she desired all the misery she had made him feel some confounded quarantine he feared might detain him but he would certainly be at clarendon park in as short a time as possible helens first smile he said would console him for all he had suffered and make him forget everything helens first smile he did not see nor the blush which spread and rose as she read cecilia was delighted generous affectionate cecilia thought helen if she has faults and she really has but one who could help loving her not helen certainly or she would have been the most ungrateful of human beings besides her sympathy in helens happiness cecilia was especially rejoiced at this letter coming as it did the very day after her mothers return for though she had written to lady davenant on beauclercs departure and told her that he was gone only on lord beltravers account yet she dreaded that when it came to speaking her mothers penetration would discover that something extraordinary had happened now all was easy beauclerc was coming back he had finished his friends business and before he returned to clarendon park he wished to know if he might appear there as the acknowledged admirer of miss stanleyif he might with any chance of success pay his addresses to her secure that her mother would never ask to see the letter considering it either as a private communication to his guardian or as a love letter to helen cecilia gave this version of it to lady davenant and how she settled it with the general helen never knew but it seemed all smooth and right and now the regatta being at an end the archery meetings over and no hope of further gaiety for this season at clarendon park the castleforts and lady katrine departed lady katrines last satisfaction was the hard haughty look with which she took leave of miss stanleya look expressing as well as the bitter smile and cold form of good breeding could express it unconquered unconquerable hate chapter viii there is no better test of the strength of affection than the ready turning of the mind to the little concerns of a friend when preoccupied with important interests of our own this was a proof of friendship which lady davenant had lately given to helen for at the time when she had entered with so much readiness and zeal into helens little difficulties and debts great political affairs and important interests of lord davenants were in suspense and pressed heavily upon her mind what might be the nature of these political embarrassments had not been explained lady davenant had only hinted at them she said she knew from the terror exhibited by the inferior creatures in office that some change in administration was expected as beasts are said to howl and tremble before storm or earthquake or any great convulsion of nature takes place since lady davenants return from town where lord davenant still remained nothing had been said of the embassy to russia but that it was delayed lady cecilia who was quick and where she was not herself concerned usually right in interpreting the signs of her mothers discomfiture guessed that lord davenant had been circumvented by some diplomatist of inferior talents and she said to helen when an ass kicks you never tell it is a maxim which mamma heard from some friend and she always acts upon it but a kick whether given by ass or not leaves a bruise which sometimes tells in spite of ourselves and my mother should remember another maxim of that friends that the faults and follies of the great are the delight and comfort of the little now my mother though she is so well suited from her superior abilities and strength of mind and all that to be the wife of a great political leader yet in some respects she is the most unfit person upon earth for the situation for though she feels the necessity of conciliating she cannot unbend with her inferiors that is with half the world as catalani said of singing it is much more difficult to descend than to ascend well shockingly mamma shows in her manner sometimes how tired she is of the stupid and how she despises the mean and all the underlings think she can undo them with papa for it has gone abroad that she governs while in fact though papa asks her advice to be sure because she is so wise she never does interfere in the least but now it has once got into the worlds obstinate head that she does it cannot be put out again and mamma is the last person upon earth to take her own part or condescend to explain and set things right she is always thinking of papas glory and the good of the public but the public will never thank him and much less her so there she is a martyr without her crown now if i were to make a martyr of myself which heaven forbid i would at least take right good care to secure my crown and to have my full glory round my head and set on becomingly but seriously my dear helen continued lady cecilia i am unhappy about papa and mamma i assure you i have seen little clouds of discontent long gathering lowering and blackening and i know they will burst over their heads in some tremendous storm at last helen hoped not but looked frightened oh you may hope not my dear but i know it will bewe may not hear the thunder but we shall see the lightning all the more dangerous we shall be struck down unless she paused unless what said helen unless the storm be dispersed in time and how the lightning drawn off by some good conductorsuch as myself i am quite serious and though you were angry with me for laughing just now as if i was not the best of daughters even though i laugh i can tell you i am meditating an act of selfdevotion for my mothers sakea grand coup dtat coup dtat you cecilia my dear i helen little as you think of me of your political talents you dont expect me to think much do you my political talents you shall see what they are i am capable of a grand coup dtat i will have next week a three days congress antipolitical at clarendon park where not a word of politics shall be heard nor any thing but nonsense if i can help it and the result shall be as you shall see goodwill between all men and all womenwomen yes theres the grand point mamma has so affronted two ladies very influential as they call it eachlady masham a favourite at court and lady bearcroft risen from the ranks on her husbands shoulders he a man of law sir benjamin bearcroft and very clever she is i hear but loud and coarse absolutely inadmissible she was thought till lately and now only tolerated for her husbands sake but still have her here i must i think you had better not remonstrated helen if she is so very vulgar lady davenant and the general will never endure her oh he will the general will bear a great deal for mammas sake and more for papas i must have her my dear for the husband is of consequence and though he is ashamed of her for that very reason he cannot bear that any body should neglect her and terribly mamma has neglected her now my dear helen do not say a word more against it very few words had helen said i must ponder well continued cecilia and make out my list of worthies my concordatum party helen much advised the consulting lady davenant first but lady cecilia feared her mother might be too proud to consent to any advance on her own part helen still feared that the bringing together such discordant people would never succeed but lady cecilia always happy in paying herself with words answerable to her wishes replied that discords well managed often produced the finest harmony the only point she feared was that she should not gain the first step that she should not be able to prevail upon the general to let her give the invitations in truth it required all her persuasive words and more persuasive looks to accomplish this preliminary and to bring general clarendon to invite or permit to be invited to clarendon park persons whom he knew but little and liked not at all but as lady cecilia pleaded and urged that it would soon be over the whole will be over in three daysonly a three days visit and for mammai am sure clarendonyou will do anything for her and for papa and your own cecilia the general smiled and the notes were written and the invitations were accepted and when once general clarendon had consented he was resolutely polite in his reception of these to him unwelcome guests his manner was not false it was only properly polite not tending to deceive any one who understood the tokens of conventional good breeding it however required considerable power over himself to keep the line of demarcation correctly with one person in particular to whom he had a strong political aversion mr harleyhis very name was abhorrent to general clarendon who usually designated him as that genius ceciliathat favourite of your mothers while to lady davenant mr harley was the only person from whose presence she anticipated any pleasure or who could make the rest of the party to her endurable helen though apprehensive of what might be the ultimate result of this congress yet could not help rejoicing that she should now have an opportunity of seeing some of those who are usually considered high as human veneration can look it is easy after one knows who is who to determine that we should have found out the characteristic qualities and talents in each countenance lady cecilia however would not tell helen the names of the celebrated unknown who were assembled when they went into the drawingroom before dinner and she endeavoured to guess from their conversation the different characters of the speakers but only a few sentences were uttered signifying nothing snuffboxes were presented pinches taken and inclinations made with becoming reciprocity but the physiognomy of a snuffbox helen could not interpret though lavater asserts that every thing in nature even a cup of tea has a physiognomy dinner was announced and the company paired off seemingly not standing on the order of their going yet all especially as some were strangers secretly mindful of their honours and they moved on in precedence just and found themselves in places due at the dinnertable but helen did not seem likely to obtain more insight into the characters of these great personages in the diningroom than she had done in the drawingroom for it often happens that when the most celebrated and even the most intellectual persons are brought together expressly for the purpose of conversation then it does not flow but sinks to silence and ends at last in the stagnation of utter stupidity each seems oppressed with the weight of his own reputation and in the pride of high celebrity and the shyness real or affected of high rank each fears to commit himself by a single word people of opposite parties when thrown together cannot at once change the whole habit of their minds nor without some effort refrain from that abuse of their opposites in which they are accustomed to indulge when they have it all to themselves now every subject seems labouredfor in the pedantry of party spirit no partisan will speak but in the slang or cant of his own craft knowledge is not only at one entrance but at every entrance quite shut out and even literature itself grows perilous so that to be safe they must all be dumb lady cecilia clarendon was little aware of what she undertook when she called together this heterogeneous assembly of uncongenials and dissimilars round her dinnertable after she had in vain made what efforts she could and well skilled in throwing the ball of conversation had thrown it again and again without rebound from either side she felt that all was flat and that the silence and the stupidity were absolutely invincible helen could scarcely believe when she tried afterwards to recollect that she had literally this day during the whole of the first course heard only the following sentences which came out at long intervals between each couple of questions and answersor observations and acquiescenceswe had a showeryes i think so but very fine weather we have hadonly too hotquite the new buildings at marblemoreare they getting on my lorddo not know did not come that way whom have they now at dunstanbury was the next question then in reply came slowly a list of fashionable names sir john died worth a million they sayyes a martyr to the gout has lady rachel done any thing for her eyesgone to brighton i believe has any thing been heard of the north pole expeditionnot a word crockly has got a capital cook and english tooenglish ehenglishyes lord davenant hoped this english cook would with the assistance of several of his brother artistes of the present day redeem our country from onehalf of the abb gregoires reproach the abb has said that england would be the finest country in the world but that it wants two essentials sunshine and cooks good good very voices from different sides of the table pronounced and there was silence again at the dessert however after the servants had withdrawn most people began to talk a little to their next neighbours but by this helen profited not for each pair spoke low and those who were beside her on either hand were not disposed to talk she was seated between sir benjamin bearcroft and mr harleysir benjamin the man of law and mr harley the man of genius each eminent in his kind but he of law seemed to have nothing in him but law of which he was very full in sir benjamins economy of human life it was a wholesome rule which he practised invariably to let his understanding sleep in company that it might waken in the courts and for his repose he needed not what some great men have professed so much to likethe pillow of a womans mind helen did not much regret the silence of this great legal authority but she was very sorry that the man of genius did not talk she did not expect him to speak to her but she wished to hear him converse with others but something was the matter with him from the moment he sat down to dinner helen saw he seemed discomfited he first put his hand across his eyes then pressed his forehead she feared he had a bad headache the hand went next to his ear with a shrinking excruciating gesture it must be the earache thought helen presently his jaws were pinched together toothache perhaps at last she detected the disturbing cause opposite to mr harley and beside lady davenant sat a person whom he could not endure one in the first place of an opposite party but that was nothing a man who was in mr harleys opinion a disgrace to any party and what could bring him here they had had several battles in public but had never before met in private society and the aversion of mr harley seemed to increase inversely as the squares of the distance helen could not see in the object adequate cause for this antipathy the gentleman looked civil smiling rather mean and quite insignificant and he really was as insignificant as he appearednot of consequence in any point of view he was not high in office nor ambassador nor chargdaffaires not certain that he was an attach even but he was said to have the ear of somebody and was reputed to be secretly employed in diplomatic transactions of equivocal character disclaimed but used by his superiors and courted by his timid inferiors whom he had persuaded of his great influence somewhere lady cecilia had been assured from good authority that he was one who ought to be propitiated on her fathers account but now when she perceived what sort of creature he was sorely did she repent that he had been invited and her mother by whom he sat seemed quite oppressed and nauseated so ended the dinner and as lady cecilia passed the general in going out of the room she looked her contrition her acknowledgment that he was perfectly right in his prophecy that it would never do chapter ix it was rather worse when the ladies were by themselves some of the party were personally strangers to lady davenant all had heard of her sufficiently most had formed a formidable and false opinion of her helen was quite astonished at the awe her ladyship inspired in strangers lady davenants appearance and manner at this moment were not indeed calculated to dispel this dread she was unusually distant and haughty from a mistaken sort of moral pride aware that some of the persons now before her had in various ways by their own or their husbands means power to serve or to injure lord davenant she disdained to propitiate them by the slightest condescension but how any persons in englandin londoncould be strangers to lady davenant was to a foreign lady who was present matter of inexpressible surprise she could not understand how the wives of persons high in political life some of opposite but some of the same parties should often be personally strangers to each other foreigners are on first coming to england apt to imagine that all who act together in public life must be of the same private society while on the contrary it often happens that the ladies especially of the same party are in different grades of fashionmoving in different orbits the number of different circles and orbits in london is indeed astonishing to strangers and the manner in which though touching at tangents these keep each their own path attracted and repelled or mutually influential is to those who have not seen and studied the planisphere absolutely incomprehensible and as she pondered on this difficulty the ambassadress all foreigner as she was and all unused to silence spoke not and no one spoke and nought was heard but the cup on the saucer or the spoon in the cup or the buzzing of a fly in the window in the midst of this awful calm it was that lady bearcroft blurted out with loud voiceamazing entertaining we are so many clever people got together too for what it was worth while to have seen lady mashams face at that moment lady bearcroft saw it and fearing no mortal struck with the comic of that look of lady mashams burst into laughter uncontrolled and the contrast of dignity and gravity in lady davenant only made her laugh the more till out of the room at last she ran lady masham all the while of course never betrayed the slightest idea that she could by any possibility have been the object of lady bearcrofts mirth but lady davenanthow did she take it to her daughters infinite relief quite quietly she looked rather amused than displeased she bore with lady bearcroft altogether better than could have been expected because she considered her only as a person unfortunately out of her place in society and without any fault of her own dragged up from below to a height of situation for which nature had never intended and neither art nor education had ever prepared her whose faults and deficiencies were thus brought into the flash of day at once before the malice of party and the fastidiousness of fashion which knows not to distinguish between manque desprit and manque dusage not so lady davenant she made liberal and philosophic allowance for even those faults of manner which were most glaring and she further suspected that lady bearcroft purposely exaggerated her own vulgarity partly for diversion partly to make people stare and partly to prevent their seeing what was habitual and what involuntary by hiding the bounds of reality of this lady masham had not the most distant conception on the contrary she was now prepared to tell a variety of odd anecdotes of lady bearcroft she had seen she said this extraordinary person before but had never met her in society and delighted she was unexpectedly to find her herequite a treat such characters are indeed seldom met with at a certain height in the atmosphere of society and such were peculiarly and justly lady mashams delight for they relieved and at the same time fed a sense of superiority insufficient to itself such a person is fair privileged safe game and lady masham began as does a reviewer determined to be especially severe with a bit of praise really very handsome lady bearcroft must have been yes as you say lady cecilia she is not out of blow yet certainly only too full blown rather for some tastesfortunately not for sir benjamin he married her you know long ago for her beauty she is a very correct personalways was but they do repeat the strangest things she saysso very odd and they tell such curious stories too of the things she does lady masham then detailed a variety of anecdotes which related chiefly to lady bearcrofts household cares which never could she with haste despatch then came stories of her cheap magnificence and extraordinary toilette expedients i own continued lady masham that i always thought the descriptions i heard must be exaggerated but one is compelled to acknowledge that there is here in reality a terrible want of tact poor sir benjamin i quite pity him he must so see it though not of the first water himself yet still he must feel when he sees lady bearcroft with other people he has feeling though nobody would guess it from his look and he shows it too i am told sadly annoyed he is sometimes by her malapropoisms one day she at one end of the table and he at the other her ladyship in her loud voice called out to him sir benjamin sir benjamin this is our weddingday he poor man did not hear she called out again louder sir benjamin my dear this day fifteen years ago you and i were married well my dear he answered well my dear how can i possibly help that now pleased with the success of this anecdote which raised a general smile lady masham vouched for its perfect correctness she had it from one who heard it from a person who was actually present at the time it happened lady davenant had not the least doubt of the correctness of the story but she believed the names of the parties were different she had heard it years ago of another person it often happens as she observed to those who make themselves notoriously ridiculous as to those who become famous for wit that all good things in their kinds are attributed to them though the one may have no claim to half the witticisms and the other may not be responsible for half the absurdities for which they have the reputation it required all lady mashams politeness to look pleased and all her candour to be quite happy to be set right as to that last anecdote but many she had heard of lady bearcroft were really incredible yet one would almost believe anything of her while she was yet speaking lady bearcroft returned and her malicious enemy leaning back in her chair as if in expectation of the piece beginning waited for her puppet to play or be played off all this time lady cecilia was not at ease she well aware what her mother would feel and had felt while lady masham was going on with this gossiptalk had stood between her ladyship and lady davenant and as lady masham did not speak much above her breath cecilia had for some time flattered herself that her laudable endeavours to intercept the sound or to prevent the sense from reaching her mothers ear had succeeded especially as she had made as many exclamations as she could of really indeed how extraordinary you do not say so which as she pronounced them might have excited the curiosity of commonplace people but which she knew would in her mothers mind deaden all desire to listen however lady masham had raised her voice and from time to time had stretched her neck of snow beyond lady cecilias intercepting drapery so as actually to claim lady davenants attention the consequences her daughter heard and felt she heard the tap tap tap of the ivory foldingknife upon the table and well interpreting she knew even before she saw her mothers countenance that lady masham had undone herself and what was of much more consequence had destroyed all chance of accomplishing that reconciliation with mamma that projected coalition which was to have been of such ultimate advantage to papa notwithstanding lady bearcrofts want of knowledge of the great world she had considerable knowledge of human nature which stood her wonderfully in stead she had no notion of being made sport of for the lgantes and with all lady mashams plausibility of persiflage she never obtained her end and never elicited anything really absurd by all attempts to draw her outout she would not be drawn after an unconquerable silence and all the semblance of dead stupidity lady bearcroft suddenly showed signs of life however and she all at once began to talkto helen of all peopleand whybecause she had taken in her own phrase a monstrous fancy to miss stanley she was not sure of her name but she knew she liked her nature and it would be a pity that her reason should not be known and in the words in which she told it to lady cecilia now i will just tell you why i have taken such a monstrous fancy to your friend here miss hanley miss stanleygive me leave to mention said lady cecilia let me introduce you regularly oh by no means dont trouble yourself now lady cecilia for i hate regular introductions but as i was going to tell you how before dinner today as i came down the great staircase i had an uncommon large big and for aught i know yellow corkingpin which that most careless of all careless maids of minea good girl toohad left sticking point foremost out of some part of me miss hanleystanley beg pardon was behind and luckily saw and stopped out she pulled it begging my pardon so kindly too i only felt the twitch on my sleeve and turned and loved the first sight i had of that pretty face which need never blush i am sure though its very becoming the blush too so goodnatured you know lady cecilia it was when nobody was looking and before any body was the wiser not like some young ladies or old even that would have showed one up rather than help one out in any pins point of a difficulty lady cecilia herself was included in lady bearcrofts good graces for she liked that winning way and saw there was a real goodnature there too she opened to both friends cordially propos to some love of a lace trimming of lace she was a famous judge and she went into details of her own good bargains with histories of her expeditions into the extremity of the city in search of cheap goods and unheard of wonders at prime cost in regions unknown she told how it was her clever way to leave her carriage and her people and go herself down narrow streets and alleys where only wheelbarrows and herself could go she boasted of her feats in diving into dark dens in search of run goods charming thingsfrench warrantedthat could be had for next to nothing and in exemplification showed the fineness of her embroidered cambric handkerchiefs and told their price to farthing lady mashams wonderful was worthy of any jesuit male or female that ever existed from her amazing bargains the lady of the lawknight went on to smuggling and as she got into spirits talking loudly she told of some amber satin a whole piece capitally got over in an old gentlemans last will and testament tied up with red tape so nicely and sealed and superscribed and all got through untouched but a better thing i did myself continued she the last trip i made to pariscoming back i set at defiance all the searchers and stabbers and customhouse officers of both nations i had hundreds of pounds worth of valenciennes and brussels lace hidyou would never guess where i never told a servantnot a mortal maid even thats the only way had only a confidante of a coachmaker but when it came to packingup time my own maid smelt out the lace was missing and gave notice i am confident to the customhouse people to search me so much the more glory to me i got off clear and when they had stabbed the cushions and torn the inside of my carriage all to pieces i very coolly made them repair the mischief at their own cost oh i love to do things bravely and away i drove triumphant with the lace well stuffed packed and covered within the pole leather of the carriage they had been searching all the time at this period of her narrative the gentlemen came into the drawingroom but here comes sir benjamin mum mum not a word more for my life you understand lady cecilia husbands must be minded and let me whisper a favoura whistparty i must beg nothing keeps sir ben in goodhumour so certainly as whistwhen he wins i mean the whistparty was made and lady cecilia took care that sir benjamin should win while she lost with the best grace possible by her conciliating manners and good management in dividing to govern all parties were arranged to general satisfaction mr harleys antipathy the attach she settled at ecart with lady masham who found him quite a wellmannered pleasant person lady cecilia explained to mr harley that it was her faulther mistake entirelythat this person had been invited mr harley was now himself again and happy in conversation with lady davenant beside whom he found his place on the sofa after helen had done her duty at harp and pianoforte cecilia relieved her and whispered that she might now go to her mothers sofa and rest and be happy mammas work is in some puzzle helen you must go and set it to rights my dear lady davenant welcomed her with a smile made room for her on the sofa and made over to her the tambourframe and now that helen saw and heard mr harley in his natural state she could scarcely believe that he was the same person who had sat beside her at dinner animated and delightful he was now and what she particularly liked in him there was no displaynothing in the churchill style whenever any one came near and seemed to wish to hear or speak mr harley not only gave them fair play but helped them in their play helen observed that he possessed the art which she had often remarked in lord davenant peculiar to goodnatured geniusthe art of drawing something good out of every body sometimes more than they knew they had in them till it was brought out even from lord masham insipid and soulless though he was as any courtierlord in waiting could be something was extracted lord masham universally believed to have nothing in him was this evening surprisingly entertaining he gave lady davenant a description of what he had been so fortunate as to seethe first public dinner of the king of france on his restoration served according to all the cidevant ceremonials and in the etiquette of louis the fourteenths time lord masham represented in a lively manner the marquis de dreux in all his antiquarian glory going through the whole form prescribed first knocking with his cane at the door then followed by three guards with shouldered carbines marching to buttery and hall each and every officer of the household making reverential obeisance as they passed to the nefthe nef being as lord masham explained to miss stanley a piece of gilt plate in the shape of the hull of a ship in which the napkins for the kings table are kept but why the hull of a ship should be appropriated to the royal napkins was asked lord masham confessed that this was beyond him but he looked amazingly consideratedelicately rubbed his polished forehead with the second finger of the right hand then regarded his ring and turned it thrice slowly round but the talismanic action produced nothing and he received timely relief by a new turn given to the conversation in which he was not he thought called upon to take any sharethe question indeed appeared to him irrelevant and retiring to the cardtable he left the discussion to abler heads the question was why bow to the nef at allthis led to a discussion upon the advantages of ceremonials in preserving respect for order and reverence for authority and then came an inquiry into the abuses of this real good it was observed that the signs of the times should always be consulted and should guide us in these thingshow far was next to be considered all agreed on the principle that order is heavens first law yet there were in the application strong shades of difference between those who took part in the conversation on one side it was thought that overturning the tabouret at the court of france had been the signal for the overthrow of the throne while on the other hand it was suggested that a rigid adherence to forms unsuited to the temper of the times only exasperates and that wherever reliance on forms is implicit it is apt to lead princes and their counsellors to depend too much on the strength of that fence which existing only in the imagination is powerless when the fashion changes in a court quite surrounded and enveloped by old forms the light of day cannot penetrate to the interior of the palace the eyes long kept in obscurity are weakened so that light cannot be borne when suddenly it breaks in the royal captive is bewildered and if obliged to act he gropes blunders injures himself and becomes incapable of decision in extremity of danger reduced to the helplessness which marks the condition of the eastern despot or les rois fainans of any time or country as helen sat by listening to this conversation what struck and interested her most was the manner in which it went on and went off without leading to any unpleasant consequences notwithstanding the various shades of opinion between the parties this she saw depended much on the good sense and talents but far more on the good breeding and temper of those who spoke and those who listened time in the first place was allowed and taken for each to be understood and no one was urged by exclamation or misconception or contradiction to say more than just the thing he thought lady cecilia who had now joined the party was a little in pain when she heard louis the fourteenths love for punctuality alluded to she dreaded when the general quoted punctuality is the virtue of princes that mr harley with the usual impatience of genius would have ridiculed so antiquated a notion but to lady cecilias surprise he even took the part of punctuality in a very edifying manner he distinguished it from mere ceremonial etiquettethe ceremonial of the german courts where they lose time at breakfast at dinner at supper at court in the antechamber on the stairs everywherepunctuality was he thought a habit worthy to be ranked with the virtues by its effects upon the mind the power it demands and gives of selfcontrol raising in us a daily hourly sense of duty of something that ought that must be done one of the best habits human creatures can have either for their own sake or the sake of those with whom they live and to kings and courtiers more particularly because it gives the idea of stabilityof duration and to the aged because it gives a sort of belief that life will last for ever the general had often thought this but said he had never heard it so well expressed he afterwards acknowledged to cecilia that he found mr harley was quite a different person from what he had expectedhe has good sense as well as genius and good breeding i am glad my dear cecilia that you asked him here this was a great triumph towards the close of the evening when mortals are beginning to think of bedchamber candles lady cecilia looked at the ecart table and said to her mother how happy they are and how comfortable we are a cardtable is really a necessary of lifenot even music is more universally useful mr harley said i doubt and then arose between lady davenant and him an argument upon the comparative power in modern society of music and cards mr harley took the side of music but lady davenant inclined to think that cards in their day and their day is not over yet have had a wider range of influence nothing like that happy board of green cloth it brings all intellects to one level she said mr harley pleaded the cause of music which he said hushes all passions calms even despair lady davenant urged the silent superiority of cards which rests the weary talker and relieves the perplexed courtier and in support of her opinion she mentioned an old ingenious essay on cards and tea by pinto she thought and she begged that helen would some time look for it in the library helen went that instant she searched but could not find where it ought to have been there it of course was not while she was still on the bookladder the door opened and enter lady bearcroft miss hanley cried she i have a word to say to you for though you are a stranger to me i see you are a dear good creature and i think i may take the liberty of asking your advice in a little matter helen who had by this time descended from the steps stood and looked a little surprised but said all that was properly civil gratified by lady bearcrofts good opinionhappy to be of any servicec c well thensit ye down one instant miss hanley helen suggested that her name was stanley stanleyehyes i remember but i want to consult you since you are so kind to allow me on a little matterbut do sit down i never can talk of business standing now i just want you my dear miss hanley to do a little job for me with lady davenant who with half an eye can see is a great friend of yoursarent i right helen said lady davenant was indeed a very kind friend of hers but still what it could be in which lady bearcroft expected her assistance she could not imagine you need not be frightened at the word job if that is what alarms you continued lady bearcroft put your heart at ease there is nothing of that sort here it is only a compliment that i want to make and nothing in the world expected in return for itas it is a return in itself but in the first place look at this cover she produced the envelope of a letter is this lady davenants handwriting think you she pointed to the word missent written on the corner of the cover helen said it was lady davenants writing you are certainwell that is oddmissent when it was directed to herself and nobody else on earth as you see as plain as possiblecountess davenant surely that is right enough then opening a red morocco case she showed a magnificent diamond sevign observe now she continued these diamonds are so big my dear miss hanleystanley they would have been quite out of my reach only for that late french invention which maybe you may not have heard of nor should i but for the hint of a friend at paris who is in the jewellery line the french you must know have got the art of sticking small diamonds together so as to make little worthless ones into large so that as you see you would never tell the difference and as it was a new discovery and something ingenious and scientific and lady davenant being reported to be a scientific lady as well as political and influential and all that i thought it a good opportunity and a fine excuse for paying her a compliment which i had long wished to pay for she was once on a time very kind to sir ben and got him appointed to his present station and though lord davenant was the ostensible person i considered her as the prime mover behind the curtain accordingly i sat me down and wrote as pretty a note as i could pen and sir ben approved of the whole thing but i dont say that im positive he was as offhanded and cleanhearted in the matter as i was for between you and i his gratitude as they say of some peoples is apt to squint with one eye to the future as well as one to the pastyou comprehend helen was not clear that she comprehended all that had been said still less had she any idea what she could have to do in this matter she waited for further explanation now all i want from you then miss hanleystanley i would say i beg pardon im the worst at proper names that livesbut all i want of you miss hanley isfirst your opinion as to the validity of the handwritingwell you are positive then that this missent is her hand now then i want to know do you think lady davenant knew what she was about when she wrote it helens eyes opened to their utmost power of distension at the idea of anybodys questioning that lady davenant knew what she was about la my dear said lady bearcroft spare the whites of your eyes i didnt mean she didnt know what she was about in that sense what sense said helen not in any particular sense replied lady bearcroft but let me go on or we shall never come to an understanding i only meant that her ladyship might have just sat down to answer my note as i often do myself without having read the whole through or before i have taken it in quite helen thought this very unlikely to have happened with lady davenant but still it might have happened continued lady bearcroft that her ladyship did not notice the delicacy of the way in which the thing was putfor it really was put so that nobody could take hold of it against any of usyou understand and after all such a curiosity of a sevign as this and such fine dimonds was too pretty and too good a thing to be refused handoverhead in that way besides my note was so respectable and respectful it surely required and demanded something more of an answer methinks from a person of birth or education than the single bald word missent like the postman surely miss hanley now putting your friendship apart candidly you must think as i do and whether or no at least you will be so obliging to do me the favour to find out from lady davenant if she really made the reply with her eyes open or not and really meant what she said helen being quite clear that lady davenant always meant what she said and had written with her eyes open declined as perfectly useless making the proposed inquiry it was plain that lady davenant had not thought proper to accept of this present and to avoid any unpleasant explanations had presumed it was not intended for her but had been sent by mistake helen advised her to let the matter rest well well said lady bearcroft thank you miss hanley at all events for your good advice but neck or nothing i am apt to go through with whatever i once take into my head and since you cannot aid and abet i will trouble you no further only not to say a word of what i have mentioned but all the time i thank you my dear young lady as much as if i took your dictum so my dear miss hanleystanleydo not let me interrupt you longer in your bookhunt take care of that stepladder though it is coggledy as i observed when you came downgood night good night chapter x my dear helen there is an end of every thing cried lady cecilia the next day bursting into helens room and standing before her with an air of consternation what has brought things to this sad pass i know not continued she for but an hour before i left every body in goodhumour with themselvesall in good train but now what said helen for you have not given me the least idea of what has happened because i have not the least idea myself my dear all i know is that something has gone wrong dreadfully between my mother and lady bearcroft mamma would not tell me what it is but her indignation is at such a height she declares she will not see that woman againpositively will not come forth from her chamber as long as lady bearcroft remains in the house so there is a total break upand i wish i had never meddled with any thing o that i had never brought together these unsuitabilities these incompatibilities oh helen what shall i do quite pale lady cecilia stood really in despair and helen did not know what to advise do you know any thing about it helen for you look as if you did an abrupt knock at the door interrupted them and without waiting for permission in came lady bearcroft as if blown by a high wind looking very red half angry half frightened and then laughing she exclaimeda fine boggledebotch i have made of it but seeing lady cecilia she stopped shortbeg pardonthought you were by yourself miss hanley lady cecilia instantly offered to retire yet intimated as she moved towards the door a wish to stay and if it were not too much to ask what was meant by by boggledebotch do you mean said lady bearcroft i am aware it is not a canonical wordclassical i mean nor in nor out of any dictionary perhapsbut when people are warm they cannot stand picking terms certainly not said lady cecilia but what is the matter i am sorry any thing unpleasant has occurred unpleasant indeed cried lady bearcroft i have been treated actually like a dog while paying a compliment too and a very handsome compliment beyond contradiction judge for yourself lady cecilia if this sevign is to be sneezed at she opened the case lady cecilia said the diamonds were certainly very handsome but but repeated lady bearcroft i grant you there may be a but to everything in life still it might be said civilly as you say it lady cecilia or looked civilly as you look it miss hanley and if that had been done instead of being affronted i might after all have been well enough pleased to pocket my diamonds but nobody can without compunction pocket an affront lady cecilia was sure her mother could not mean any affront oh i do not know what she could or could not mean but i will tell you what she didall but threw the diamonds in my face impossible cried helen possibleand i will show you how miss hanley this way just shut down the casesnapand across the table she threw it just as you would deal a card in a passion only with a mrs siddons air to boot i beg your pardons both ladies for mimicking your friend and your parent but flesh and blood could not stand that sort of style you know and a little wholesome mimicry breaks no bones and is not very offensive i hope the mimicry could not indeed be very offensive for the imitation was so utterly unlike the reality that lady cecilia and helen with difficulty repressed their smiles ladies may smile but they would smile on the wrong sides of their pretty little mouths if they had been treated as i have beenso ignominiously i am sure i wish i had taken your advice miss hanley but the fact was last night i did not quite believe you i thought you were only saying the best you could to set off a friend for since i have been among the great and indeed even when i lived with the little i have met with so many fair copies of false countenances that i could not help suspecting there might be something of that sort with your lady davenant but i am entirely convinced all you told me is true for i peeped quite close at her lifted up the hood and found there were not two faces under itonly one very angry one for my pains but i declare i would rather see that than a double one like my lady mashams with her spermaceti smile and after all do you know continued lady bearcroft in a right vulgarlycordial tonedo you know now really the first anger over i like lady davenanti protest and vow even her pride i likeit well became herbirth and all for i hear she is straight from charlemagne but i was going to mention now my recollection is coming to me that when i began talking to her ladyship of sir bens gratitude about that place she got for him she cut me short with her queer look and said she was sure that lord davenant and if he had been the king himself instead of only her husband and your father lady cecilia she could not have pronounced his name with more distinctionshe was sure she said that lord davenant would not have been instrumental in obtaining that place for sir benjamin bearcroft if he had known any man more worthy of it which indeed i did not think at the time over and above civilfor where then was the particular compliment to sir ben but when lady bearcroft saw lady cecilias anxiety and real distress at her mothers indignant resolution she with surprising goodhumour saidi wish i could settle it for you my dear i cannot go away directly which would be the best move because sir benjamin has business here today with lord davenantsome job of his own which must take place of any movements of mine he being the more worthy gender but i will tell you what i can do and will and welcome i will keep my room instead of your mother keeping hers so you may run and tell lady davenant that she is a prisoner at large with the range of the whole house without any danger of meeting me for i shall not stir till the carriage is at the door tomorrow morning when she will not be up for we will have it at six i will tell sir benjamin he is in a hurry back to town and he always is so all is right on my part and go you to your mother my dear lady cecilia and settle her i am glad to see you smile again it is a pity you should ever do any thing else it was not long before cecilia returned proclaiming peace peace she had made such an amusing report to her mother of all that lady bearcroft had said and done and purposed to do that lady davenant could not help seeing the whole in a ludicrous light felt at once that it was beneath her serious notice and that it would be unbecoming to waste indignation upon such a person the result was that she commissioned helen to release lady bearcroft as soon as convenient and to inform her that an act of oblivion was passed over the whole transaction there had been a shower and it had cleared up lady cecilia thought the sky looked bluer and birds sang sweeter and the air felt pleasanter than before the storm nothing like a storm said she for clearing the air nothing like a little honest hurricane but with lady masham there never is anything like a little honest hurricane it is all still and close with an indescribable volcanolike feeling one is not sure of what one is standing upon do you know helen continued she i am quite afraid of some explosion between mamma and lady masham if we came to any difficulty with her we could not get out of it quite so well as with lady bearcroft for there is no resource of heart or frankness of feeling with her before we all meet at dinner i must sound mamma and see if all is tolerably safe and when she went this day at dressingtime with a bouquet as was her custom for her mother she took helen with her at the first hint of lady cecilias fears that lady masham could do her any mischief lady davenant smiled in scorn the will she may have my dear but she has not the power she is very foolish to be sure said lady cecilia still she might do mischief and there is something monstrously treacherous in that smile of hers monstrously repeated lady davenant no no my dear cecilia nothing monstrous leave to lady bearcroft the vulgar belief in courtbred monsters we know there are no such things men and women there as everywhere else are what nature education and circumstances have made them once an age once in halfadozen ages nature may make a brinvilliers or art allow of a zeluco but in general monsters are mere fabulous creaturesmistakes often from bad drawings like the unicorn yes mamma yes now i feel much more comfortable the unicorn has convinced me said lady cecilia laughing and singing tis all a mere fable theres nothing to fear and i shall think of her henceforth as nothing but what she appears to be a welldressed wellbred fine lady ayevery inch a fine lady every word look motion thought suited to that metier that vocation said lady davenant it is above a trade with her it really is a sacred duty not merely a pleasure to be fine she is a fine lady of the first order nothing too professional in her mannerno obvious affectation for affectation in her was so early wrought into habit as to have become second nature scarcely distinguishable from realall easy just so mamma one gets on so easy with her a curious illusion continued lady davenant occurs with every one making acquaintance with such persons as lady masham i have observed perhaps it is that some sensation of the treadmill life she leads communicates itself to those she is talking to which makes you fancy you are always getting on but you never do get beyond a certain point that is exactly what i feel said helen while lady masham speaks or while she listens i almost wonder how she ever existed without me yes and though one knows it is all an illusion said lady cecilia still one is pleased knowing all the time that she cannot possibly care for one in the least but then one does not expect every body to care for one really at least i know i cannot like all my acquaintance as much as my friends much less can i love all my neighbours as myself come come cecilia said her mother by come come mamma means dont go any further cecilia said she turning to helen but now mamma i am not clear whether you really think her your friend or your enemy inclined to do you mischief or not just as it may be for her interest or not i suppose and just as it may be the fashion or not said lady davenant i remember hearing old lady one of the cleverest women of the last century and one who had seen much of the world say if it was the fashion to burn me and i at the stake i hardly know ten persons of my acquaintance who would refuse to throw on a faggot oh mammaoh lady davenant exclaimed helen and cecilia it was a strong way of putting the matter said lady davenant laughingbut fashion has i assure you more influence over weak minds such as lady mashams than either party or interest and since you do not like my illustration by fire take one by watershe is just a person to go out with on a party of pleasure on the smooth surface of a summer sea and if a slight shower comes on would pity your bonnet sincerely but if a serious squall arose and all should be in danger then of course every body would take care of themselves interrupted lady cecilia excepting such a simpleton as helen who would take care of you first mamma of me next and of herself last i believe iti do believe it cried lady davenant and her eyes and thoughts fixing upon helen she quite forgot what further she was going to say of lady masham the perfectly unimpassioned tone in which her mother had discussed this ladys character even the candour convinced lady cecilia as well as helen that nothing further could be done as to drawing them together no condescension of manner no conciliation could be expected from lady davenant towards lady masham but at the same time there was no fear of any rupture and to this humble consolation was lady cecilia brought she told helen that she gave up all hope of doing any good she would now be quite content if she avoided doing harm and if this visit ended without coming to any further outrage on the part of lady bearcroft and without her mothers being guilty of contempt to lady masham she had done some little service however with respect to the ambassadress and her mother knew it it was well known that the ambassadress governed the ambassador and lady cecilia had quite won her heart so that he will be assuredly a friend to papa indeed this has been almost promised madame lambassadrice assured me that her husband looks upon lord davenant as one of the first sages of england that is to say of europe and she says he is well acquainted with all lord davenants worksand it is my belief concluded lady cecilia that all sir william davenants works go with her to papas credit for as she spoke she gave a polite glance towards the bookcase where she saw their gilded backs and i found the ambassador himself afterwards with davenant on trade in his hand be it so it is not after all you know robbing the dead only inheriting by mistake from a namesake which with foreigners is allowable because impossible to avoid from the time of monsieur robinson parent apparemment de monsieur crusoe to the present day by dint of keeping well asunder those who would not draw well together lady cecilia did contrive to get through the remaining morning of this operose visit some she sent out to drive with gallant military outriders to see places in the neighbourhood famed for this or that others walked or boated or went through the customary course of conservatories pheasantry flowergarden pleasuregrounds and best views of clarendon parkand billiards always the political conferences were held in lord davenants apartment to what these conferences tended we never knew and never shall we consider them as matters of history and leave them with due deference to the historian we have to do only with biography far be it from us to meddle with politicswe have quite enough to do with manners and morality chapter xi the next day as helen was going across the hall she saw the members of the last political conclave coming out of lord davenants room each looking as if the pope had not been chosen according to his wishdark and disappointed even mr harleys radiant countenance was dimmed and the dry symptomatic cough which he gave after taking leave of lady davenant convinced helen that all was not well within he departed and there seemed to be among those who remained a greater constraint than ever there appeared to be in each an awakened sense that there were points on which they could never agree all seemed to feel how different it would have been if mr harley had remained true the absence or presence of a person of genius makes as much difference in the whole appearance of things as sunshine or no sunshine on the landscape dinner however was got through for time and the hour two hours or three will get through the roughest dinner or the smoothest never saw a difficult dinnerparty better bothered was lady bearcrofts compliment whispered to cecilia as they went into the drawingroom and helen notwithstanding lady bearcrofts vulgarity could not help beginning absolutely to like her for her good nature and amazingly prompt sympathy but after all good nature without good manners is but a blundering ally dangerous to its best friend this evening lady cecilia felt that every one was uncomfortable and flitting about the room she touched here and there to see how things were going on they were not going on well and she could not make them better even her efforts at conciliation were ineffectual she had stepped in between her mother some of the gentlemen and the general in an argument in which she heard indications of strife and she set about to explain away contradictions and to convince every body that they were really all of the same opinion with her sweet voice and pretty persuasive look this might have done for the general as a relaxing smile seemed to promise but it would not do at all with lady davenant who from feelings foreign to the present matter was irritated and spoke as helen thought too harshlycecilia you would act harmony in the comedy to perfection but unfortunately i am not one of those persons who can be persuaded that when i say one thing i mean quite anotherprobably because it is not my practice so to do that old epigram sir benjamin do you know it continued she which begins with a bankrupts roguish whereas whereas the religion and fate of three nations depend on th importance of our conversations whereas some objections are thrown in our way and words have been construed to mean what they say be it known from henceforth to each friend and each brother whener we say one thing we mean quite another sir benjamin gravely remarked that it was good law practice the courts themselves would be shut up if some such doctrine were not understood in the practice there subaudito if not publicly proclaimed with an absolute whereas be it known from henceforth whether this was dry humour of sir benjamins or plain matter of fact and serious opinion the gravity with which it was delivered indicated not but it produced the good effect of a smile a laugh at him or with him lady cecilia did not care which the laugh was good at all events her invincible goodnature and sweetness of temper had not been soured or conquered even by her mothers severity and lady davenant observing this forgave and wished to be forgiven my dearest cecilia said she clasp this bracelet for me will you it would really be a national blessing if in the present times all women were as amiable as you fond to spread friendships but to cover heats then turning to a french gentleman she spoke of the change she had observed when she was last at paris from the overwhelming violence of party spirit on all sides dreadfully true the french gentleman repliedparty spirit taking every proteus form calling itself by a hundred names and with a thousand devices and watchwords which would be too ridiculous if they were not too terribledomestic happiness destroyed all society disordered disorganisedliterature not able to support herself scarcely appearing in companyall precluded superseded by the politics of the day lady davenant joined with him in his regrets and added that she feared society in england would soon be brought to the same condition no said the french gentleman english ladies will never be so vehement as my countrywomen they will never become i hope like some of our lady politicians qui heurlent comme des demons lady cecilia said that from what she had seen at paris she was persuaded that if the ladies did bawl too loud it was because the gentlemen did not listen to them that above half the partyviolence which appeared in parisian belles was merely dramatic to produce a sensation and draw the gentlemen from the black pelotons in which they gathered back to their proper positions round the fauteuils of the fair ladies the foreigner speaking to what he saw passing in lady davenants mind went onladies can do much however in this as in all other dilemmas where their power is and ought to be omnipotent female influence is and ought to be potent said the general with an emphasis on influence contradistinguishing it from power and reducing the exaggeration of omnipotent by the short process of lopping off two syllables so long as ladies keep in their own proper character said lady davenant all is well but if once they cease to act as women that instant they lose their privilegetheir charm they forfeit their exorcising power they can no longer command the demon of party nor themselves and he transforms them directly as you say said she to the french gentleman into actual furies and when so transformed sometimes unconscious of their state said the general drily his eye glancing towards the other end of the room and lighting upon lady bearcroft who was at the instant very red and very loud and lady cecilia was standing as if watchful for a moments pause in which to interpose her word of peace she waited for some time in vain for when she hastened from the other end of the room to thisthe scene of action things had come to such a pass between the ladies masham and bearcroft that mischief serious mischief must have ensued had not lady cecilia at utmost need summoned to her aid the happy genius of nonsensethe genius of nonsense in whose elfin power even love delights on whom reason herself condescends often to smile even when logic frowns and chops him on his block but cut in twain the ethereal spirit soon unites again and lives and laughs but mark him wellthis little happy genius of nonsense see that he be the true thingthe genuine spirit you will know him by his wellbred air and tone which none can counterfeit and by his smile for while most he makes others laugh the arch little rogue seldom goes beyond a smile himself graceful in the midst of all his pranks he never goes too farthough far enough he has been known to gohe has crept into the armour of the great hero convulsed the senate in the wig of a chancellor and becomingly decorously put on now and then the mitre of an archbishop if good people said archbishop usher would but make goodness agreeable and smile instead of frowning in their virtue how many they would win to the good cause lady cecilia in this was good at need and at her utmost need obedient to her call came this happy little genius and brought with him song and dance riddle and charade and comic prints and on a halfopened parcel of books cecilia darted and produced a comic annual illustrated by him whom no risible muscles can resist all smiled who understood and mirth admitted of her crew all who smiled and partyspirit fled but there were foreigners present foreigners cannot well understand our local allusions our cruikshank is to them unintelligible and hoods sorrows of number one quite lost upon them then lady bearcroft thought she would do as much as lady cecilia and morethat she would produce what these poor foreigners could comprehend but not at her call came the genius of lively nonsense he heard her not in his stead came that counterfeit who thinks it witty to be rude and placing raillery in railing will tell aloud your greatest failing that vulgar imp yclept funknown by his broad grin by his loud tone and by his rude banter head foremost forcing himself in came he and brought with him a heap of coarse caricatures and they were party caricatures capital lady bearcroft however pronounced them as she spread all upon the table for applausebut no applause ensued not such these as real good english humour produces and enjoys independently of partythese were all too broad too coarse lady davenant despised the general detested helen turned away and lady cecilia threw them under the table that they might not be seen by the foreigners for the honour of england do not let them be spread abroad pray lady bearcroft the world is grown mighty nice said lady bearcroft for my part give me a good laugh when it is to be had perhaps we shall find one here said lady cecilia opening a portfolio of caricatures in a different style but they were old and lady bearcroft would have thrown them aside but lord davenant observed that if they have lasted so longthey must be good because their humour only can ensure their permanence the personality dies with the person for instance in the famous old print of the minister ratcatcher in the westminster election the likeness to each rat of the day is lost to us but the ridicule on placemen ratters remains the whole however is perfectly incomprehensible to foreigners rats rat repeated one of the foreigners as he looked at and studied the print it was amusing to see the gravity with which this foreign diplomatist quite new to england listened to lady bearcrofts explanation of what is meant in english by a rat political she was at first rather good on this topic professing a supernatural acuteness of the senses arising from an unconquerable antipathy born with her to the whole race of rats she declared that she could see a rat a mile off in any mancould from the moment a man opened his mouth in parliament or on the hustings prophesy whether he would turn into a rat at last or not she moreover understood the language of rats of every degree and knew even when they said no that they meant yestwo monosyllables the test of rats which betray them all sooner or later and transform the biped into the quadruped who then turns tail and runs always to the other side from whatever side he may be of the chargdaffaires stood in half bow lending deferential ear and serious attention the whole time of this lecture upon rats without being able from beginning to end to compass its meaning and at the close with a disconsolate shrug he exclaimed ah je renonce a lady bearcroft went onsince i cannot make your excellency understand by description what i mean by an english ratpolitical i must give you an example or two dead and livingliving best and i have more than one noted and branded rat in my eye but lady cecilia anxious to interrupt this perilous business hastily rang for wine and water and as the gentlemen went to help themselves she gave them a general toast as sitting down to the pianoforte to the tune ofheres to the maiden of blushing fifteen she sang heres to rats and ratcatchers of every degree the rat that is trapped and the rat that is free the rat that is shy sir the rat that is bold sir the rat upon sale sir the rat that is sold sir let the rats rat success to them all and well off to the old ones before the house fall chapter xii sir benjamin and lady bearcroft departed at six oclock the next morning and all the rest of the political and diplomatic corps left immediately after breakfast lady davenant looked relieved the general satisfied and lady cecilia consoled herself with the hope that if she had done no good she had not done any harm this was a bad slide perhaps in the magic lantern but would leave no trace behind she began now to be very impatient for beauclercs appearance always sanguine and as rapid in her conclusions as she was precipitate in her actions she felt no doubt no anxiety as to the future for though she refrained from questioning helen as to her sentiments for beauclerc she was pretty well satisfied on that subject helen was particularly grateful to lady cecilia for this forbearance being almost ashamed to own even to herself how exceedingly happy she felt and now that it was no longer wrong in her to love or dishonourable in him to wish to be loved she was surprised to find how completely the idea of beauclerc was connected with and interwoven through all her thoughts pursuits and sentiments he had certainly been constantly in her company for several months a whole summer but she could scarcely believe that during this time he could have become so necessary to her happiness while with still increasing agitation she looked forward to his arrival she felt as if lady davenants presence was a sort of protection a something to rely on in the new circumstances in which she was to be placed lord davenant had returned to town but lady davenant remained the russian embassy seemed still in abeyance one morning as helen was sitting in lady davenants room alone with her she said suddenly at your age helen i had as little taste for what are called politics as you have yet you see what i am come to and by the same road you may you will arrive at the same point i oh i hope not cried helen almost before she felt the whole inference that might be drawn from this exclamation you hope not repeated her ladyship calmly let us consider this matter rationally and put our hopes and our fears and our prejudices out of the question if possible let me observe to you that the position of women in society is somewhat different from what it was a hundred years ago or as it was sixty or i will say thirty years since women are now so highly cultivated and political subjects are at present of so much importance of such high interest to all human creatures who live together in society you can hardly expect helen that you as a rational being can go through the world as it now is without forming any opinion on points of public importance you cannot i conceive satisfy yourself with the common nambypamby little missy phrase ladies have nothing to do with politics helen blushed for she was conscious that wrong or right nambypamby little missy or not she had hitherto satisfied herself very comfortably with some such thought depend upon it helen resumed lady davenant that when you are married your love for a man of superior abilities and of superior character must elevate your mind to sympathy with all his pursuits with all the subjects which claim his attention helen felt that she must become strongly interested in every subject in which the man she loved was interested but still she observed that she had not abilities or information like lady davenants that could justify her in attempting to follow her example besides helen was sure that even if she had it would not suit her taste and besides in truth she did not think it well suited to a womanshe stopped when she came to that last thought but what kindness and respect suppressed was clearly understood by her penetrating friend fixing her eyes upon helen she said with a smile the candour and nobleness of her character rising above all little irritation of temper i agree with you my dear helen in all you do not say and were i to begin life over again my conduct should in some respects be different of the public dangers and private personal inconveniences that may result from women becoming politicians or as you better express our meaning interfering with public affairs no one can be more aware than i am interfering observe i say for i would mark and keep the line between influence and interference female influence must will and ought to exist on political subjects as on all others but this influence should always be domestic not publicthe customs of society have so ruled it of the thorns in the path of ambitious men all moralists talk but there are little scarcely visible thorns of a peculiar sort that beset the path of an ambitious woman the venomous prickles of the domestic bramble a plant not perhaps mentioned in witherings botany or the hortus kewensis but it is too well known to many and to me it has been sorely known at this instant general clarendon came in with some letters which had been forwarded to him express one for lady davenant he had been desired to put into her hands himself he retired and lady davenant opened the letter by the first glance at her countenance helen saw that there was something in it which had surprised and given her great concern helen withdrew her eyes and waited till she should speak but lady davenant was quite silent and helen looking at her again saw her put her hand to her heart as if from some sudden sense of violent bodily pain and she sank on the sofa fell back and became as pale as death and motionless excessively frightened helen threw open the window rang the bell for lady davenants own woman and sent the page for lady cecilia in a few moments lady cecilia and elliott came neither was as much alarmed as helen had expected they would be they had seen lady davenant under similar attacksthey knew what remedies to apply elliott was a remarkably composed steady person she now went on doing all that was necessary without speaking a word the paroxysm lasted longer than usual as lady cecilia observed and though she continued her assurances to helen that it was all nervousonly nerves she began evidently to be herself alarmed at length symptoms of returning animation appeared and then cecilia retired beckoning to helen to follow her into the next room we had better leave mamma to elliott she will be happier if she thinks we know nothing of the matter then recollecting that helen had been in the room when this attack came on she addedbut no you must go back for mamma will remember that you were presenttake as little notice however as possible of what has happened cecilia said that her mother when they were abroad had been subject to such seizures at intervals and in former times before i was born i believe said lady cecilia she had some kind of extraordinary disease in the heart but she has a particular aversion to being thought nervous every physician who has ever pronounced her nervous has always displeased her and has been dismissed she was once quite vexed with me for barely suggesting the idea there cried cecilia i hear her voice go to her helen followed lady cecilias suggestion and took as little notice as possible of what had happened elliott disappeared as she enteredthe page was waiting at the door but to helens satisfaction lady davenant did not admit him not yet tell him i will ring when i want him said she the door closed and lady davenant turning to helen said whether i live or die is a point of some consequence to the friends who love me but there is another question helen of far more importance to me and i trust to them that question is whether i continue to live as i have lived honoured and respected or live and die dishonoured and despisedher eye glanced towards the letter she had been reading my poor child continued lady davenant looking at helens agitated countenancemy poor child i will not keep you in suspense she then told helen that she was suspected of having revealed a secret of state that had been confided to her husband and which it was supposed and truly supposed that lord davenant had told to her beyond its political importance the disclosure involved a charge of baseness in her having betrayed confidence having suffered a copy of a letter from an illustrious personage to be handed about and read by several people lord davenant as yet knows nothing of this the effect upon him is what i most dread i cannot show you this continued she opening again the letter she had just received because it concerns others as well as myself i am at all events under obligations that can never be forgotten to the person who gave me this timely notice which could no otherwise have reached me and the person to whom i am thus obliged is one helen whom neither you nor i like and whom cecilia particularly dislikesmiss clarendon her manner of doing me this service is characteristic she begins miss clarendon is aware that lady davenant has no liking for her but that shall not prevent miss clarendon from doing what she thinks an act of justice towards a noble character falsely attackedlady davenant read no more had not you better wait till you are stronger my dear lady davenant said helen seeing her prepare to write it was once said gloriously well replied lady davenant that the duties of life are more than life itselfso i think while she wrote helen thought of what she had just heard and she ventured to interrupt lady davenant to ask if she had formed any idea of the means by which the secret could have been betrayedor the copy of the letter obtained yes she had a suspicion of one person the diplomatist to whom mr harley had shown such a mortal antipathy she recollected that the last morning the congress had sat in lord davenants cabinet she had left her writingdesk there and this letter was in it she thought that she had locked the desk when she had left the room it certainly was fast when she returned but it had a spring bramah lock and its being shut down would have fastened it she had no proof one way or other her suspicion rested where was her instinctive dislike it was remarkable however that she at once did justice to another person whom she did not like mr mapletofft lord davenants secretary his manners do not please me she said but i have perfect confidence in his integrity helen felt and admired this generous candour but her suspicions were not of the diplomatist alone she thought of one who might perhaps have been employed by himcarlos the page and many circumstances which she recollected and put together now strengthened this suspicion she wondered it had not occurred to lady davenant she thought it must but that she did not choose to mention it helen had often heard lady davenants particular friends complain that it was extremely disagreeable to them to have this boy constantly in the room whatever might be the conversation there was the page either before or behind a screen always within hearing lady davenant said that as carlos was a portuguese and had never been in england till she had brought him over a few months before he could not understand english well enough to comprehend what was going on this was doubted especially by helen who had watched his countenance and had represented her doubts and her reasons for them to lady davenant but she was not convinced it was one of the few points on which she could justly be reproached with adhering to her fancy instead of listening to reason the more carlos was attacked the more she adhered to him in fact it was not so much because he was a favourite as because he was a proteg he was completely dependent upon her protection she had brought him to england had saved him from his mother a profligate campfollower had freed him from the most miserable condition possible and had raised him to easy happy confidential life to the generous the having conferred an obligation is in itself a tie hard to sever all nobleminded people believe in fidelity and never doubt of gratitude they throw their own souls into those they oblige and think and feel for them as they in their situation would think and feel lady davenant considered it an injustice to doubt the attachment of this boy and a cruelty she deemed it to suspect him causelessly of being the most base of human creatureshe a young defenceless orphan helen had more than once offended by attempting to stop lady davenant from speaking imprudently before carlos she was afraid even at this moment to irritate her by giving utterance to her doubts she determined therefore to keep them to herself till she had some positive grounds for her suspicions she resolved to watch the boy very carefully presently having finished her letters lady davenant rang for him helens eyes were upon carlos the moment he entered and her thoughts did not escape observation you are wrong helen said lady davenant as she lighted the taper to seal her letters if i am not right said helen keeping her eyes upon the boys changing countenance i am too suspiciousbut observe am i not right at this instant in thinking that his countenance is bad lady davenant could not but see that countenance change in an extraordinary manner in spite of his efforts to keep it steady you cause that of which you complain said she going on sealing her letters deliberately in courts of public justice and in private equity the word equity she pronounced with an austere emphasis how often is the change of countenance misinterpreted the sensibility of innocence that cannot bear to be suspected is often mistaken for the confusion worse confounded of guilt helen observed that as lady davenant spoke and spoke in his favour the boys countenance cleared up that vacillating expression of fear and consciousness of having something within him unwhipt of justice completely disappeared and his whole air was now bold and opentowards helen almost an air of defiance what do you think is the cause of this change in his countenanceyou observe it do you not asked helen yes and the cause is as plain as the change he sees i do not suspect him though you do and seeing helen that he has at least one friend in the world who will do him justice the orphan boy takes courage i wish i could be as good as you are my dearest lady davenant said helen but i cannot help still feeling and sayingi doubt now observe him while i speak i will turn my eyes away that my terrible looks may not confound him you say he knows that you do not suspect him and that i do how does he know it how said lady davenant by the universal language of the eyes not only by that universal language i think said helen but i suspect he understands every word we say helen without ever looking up from a bunch of seals which she was rubbing bright slowly and very distinctly added i think that he can speak read and write english a change in the countenance of carlos appeared notwithstanding all his efforts to hold his features in the same position instead of placid composure there was now grim rigidity give me the great seal with the coat of arms on it said lady davenant dropping the wax on her letter and watching the boys eye as she spoke without herself looking towards the seal she had described he never stirred and helen began to fear she was unjust and suspicious but again her doubts at least of his disposition occurred as she was passing through lady davenants dressingroom with her when they were going down to dinner the page following them helen caught his figure in a mirror and saw that he was making a horrible grimace at her behind her back his dark countenance expressing extreme hatred and revenge helen touched lady davenants arm but before her eye could be directed to the glass carlos perceiving that he was observed pretended to be suddenly seized with the cramp in his foot which obliged him to make these frightful contortions helen was shocked by his artfulness but it succeeded with lady davenant it was in vain to say more about it to her so helen let it pass when she mentioned it afterwards to lady cecilia she saidi am sorry for your sake helen that this happened depend upon it that revengeful little portuguese gnome will work you mischief some time or other helen did not think of herselfindeed she could not imagine any means by which he could possibly work her woe but the face was so horrible that it came again and again before her eyes and she was more and more determined to watch carlos constantly this was one of the public days at clarendon park on which there was a good deal of company many of the neighbouring gentry were to be at dinner when lady davenant appeared no inquiries concerning her health were made by her daughter or by the generalno allusion to her having been unwell she seemed quite recovered and helen observed that she particularly exerted herself and that her manner was more gracious than usual to commonplace peoplemore present to everything that was passing she retired however early and took helen with her the depression of her spirits or rather the weight upon her mind appeared again as soon as they were alone together she took her writingdesk and looked over some letters which she said ought to be burned she could not sleep in peace she saidshe ought not to sleep till this was done several of these as she looked over them seemed to give her pain and excited her indignation or contempt as she from time to time exclaimedmeannesscorruptioningratitude tooall favours forgotten to seeto feel thisis the common fate of all who have lived the life i have lived of this i am not so inconsistent as to complain but it is hard that my own characterthe integrity of a whole lifeshould avail me nothing and yet added she after a moments pause of reflection to how few can my character be really known women cannot like men make their characters known by public actions i have no right to complain but if lord davenants honour is to be she paused her thoughts seeming too painful for utterance she completed the arrangement of the papers and as she pressed down the lid of her writingbox and heard the closing sound of the lock she saidnow i may sleep in peace she put out the lamp and went to her bedroom carrying with her two or three books which she intended to read after she should be in bed for though she talked of sleeping it was plain she thought she should not helen prevailed upon her to let her remain with her and read to her she opened first a volume of shakspeare in which was lady davenants mark yes said she read that speech of wolseys read that whole scene the finest picture of ambition ever drawn and after she had heard the scene she observed that there is no proof more certain of the truth of poetic description than its recurring to us at the time we strongly feel those who tell us continued she that it is unnatural to recollect poetry or eloquence at times of powerful emotion are much mistaken they have not strong feelings or strong imaginations i can affirm from my own experience that it is perfectly natural lady davenant rapidly mentioned some instances of this sort which she recollected but seeing the anxiety of helens look she added you are afraid that i am feverish you wish me to rest then go on reading to me helen read on till lady davenant declared she would not let her sit up any longer only before you go my dear child look here at what i have been looking at while you have been reading she made helen place herself so as to see exactly in the same direction and light in which she was looking and she pointed out to her in the lining of the bed a place where from the falling of the folds and the crinkles in the material a figure with the head headdress and perfect profile of an old woman with a turnedup chin appeared at first helen could not see it but at last she caught it and was struck with it the same sort of curious effect of chance resemblance and coincidence which painters leonardo da vinci in particular have observed in the moss and stains on old stones observed lady davenant but it struck me tonight helen perhaps because i am a little feverishit struck me in a new point of viewmoral not picturesque if such be the effects of chance or of coincidence how cautious we should be in deciding from appearances or pronouncing from circumstantial evidence upon the guilt of evil design in any human creature you mean this to apply to me about carlos said helen i do but not only of him and you was i thinking but of myself and those who judge of me falsely from coincidences attributing to me designs which i never had and actions of which i am incapable she suddenly raised herself in her bed and was going to say more but the pendule striking at that instant two oclock she stopped abruptly kissed helen and sent her away helen gathered together and carried away with her all the books that lady davenant might not be tempted to look at them more as she had several piled on one arm and had a taper in her hand she was somewhat encumbered and though she managed to open the bedroom door and to shut it again without letting any of the books fall and crossed the little anteroom between the bedchamber and dressingroom safely yet as she was opening the dressingroom door and taking too much or too little care of some part of her pyramid of books down came the whole pile with a noise which in the stillness of the night sounded tremendous she was afraid it would disturb lady davenant and was going back to tell her what it was when she was startled by hearing as she thought the moving of a chair or table in the dressingroom she stopped short to listenall was silent she thought she had mistaken the direction in which the noise came she softly opened the dressingroom door and looked inall was silentno chair or stool or table overturned every thing was in its place exactly as they had left it but there was a strong smell of a half extinguished lamp she thought it had been put out when they had left the room she now supposed it had not been sufficiently lowered she turned the screw and took care now to see it completely extinguished then went back for the books and as people sometimes will when most tired and most late be most orderly she would not go to bed without putting every volume in its place in the bookcase after reaching to put one book upon the highest shelf as she was getting down she laid her hand on the top of lady davenants writingbox and as she leaned on it was surprised to hear the click of its lock closing the sound was so peculiar she could not be mistaken besides she thought she had felt the lid give way under her pressure there was no key left in the lockshe perfectly recollected the very sound of that click when lady davenant shut the lid down before leaving the room this night she stood looking at the lock and considering how this could be and as she remained perfectly still she heard or thought she heard some one breathing near her holding in her own breath she listened and cautiously looked round without stirring from the place where she stoodone of the window curtains moved so at least she thoughtyes certainly there was some living thing behind it it might be lady davenants great dog but looking again at the bottom of the curtain she saw a human foot the page carlos was her instant suspicion and his vengeful face came before her and a vision of a stiletto or she did not well know what she trembled all over yet she had presence of mind enough to recollect that she should not seem to take notice and while she moved about the books on the table she gave another look and saw that the foot was not withdrawn she knew she was safe still it had not been perceived that she had seen it now what was she to do go up to that curtain and draw it back and face the boybut she did not dare yet he was only a boybut it might be a man and not the page better go and call somebodytell lady davenant she must go through the antechamber and pass close to that curtain to open the door all this was the thought of one moment and she went on holding up the light to the bookshelves as if in quest of some book and kept coasting along to gain the door she was afraid when she was to pass the windowcurtain either of touching it or of stumbling over that foot but she got past without touching or stumbling opened the door whisked throughthat was done too quickly but she could not help itshe shut bolted the door and ran across the antechamber to lady davenants bedroom she entered softly aware of the danger to her of sudden alarm but lady davenant was not asleep was not alarmed but was effective in a moment first she askeddid you lock the door after you yes bolted itthat is well neither of them said who do you think it is but each knew what the other thought they returned through the antechamber to the dressingroom but when they opened the door all was quietno one behind the curtain no one in the roomthey searched under the sofas everywhere there was no closet or hidingplace in which any one could be concealed the window fastenings were unstirred but the door into the gallery was unlocked and the simple thing appearedthat helen in her confusion had thought only of fastening the door into the antechamber which also opened on the gallery but had totally forgotten to lock that from the dressingroom into the gallery by which whoever had been in the room had escaped without any difficulty lady davenant rather inclined to believe that no one had been there and that it was all helens imagination but helen persisted that she had seen what she had seen and heard what she had heard they went into the galleryall silence no creature visible and the doors at the ends of the gallery locked outside after a fruitless search they retired lady davenant to her own room and helen to hers full of shame and regret that she had not had the courage to open the curtain at the right moment nothing could stir her belief however in the evidence of her senses the boy must have been there and must be still concealed somewhere in the gallery or in some of the rooms opening into it some of these were unoccupied but they were all locked up as lady davenant had told her when she had proposed searching them one or two they tried and found fastened she stood at her own door after having put down the candle on her table still giving a lingering lookout when through the darkness in the gallery at the further end she saw a ray of light on the floor which seemed to come from under the door of a room unoccupiedmr mapletoffts room he had gone to town with lord davenant helen went on tiptoe very softly along the gallery almost to this door when it suddenly opened and the page stood before her the lamp in his hand shining full on his face and on hers both startedthen both were motionless for one secondbut he recovering instantly shot back again into the room flung to the door and locked it seen him cried lady davenant when helen flew to her room and told her seen him do you say and then ringing her bell she bade helen run and knock at the generals door while she went herself to mr mapletoffts room commanding carlos to open the door immediately but he would not open it nor make any answer the servants came and the general ordered one to go round to the windows of the room lest the boy should escape that way it was too late he had escaped when the door was forced one of the windows was found open carlos was not in the room he must have swung himself down from the height by means of a tree which was near the window the lamp was still burning and papers half burnt smouldering on the table there were sufficient remains to tell what they had been lady davenant saw in the handwriting of carlos copies of letters taken from her desk one half unburnt cover of the packet he had been making up showed by its direction to whom it was to have been sent and there were a few lines in the boys own writing withinsideaddressed to his employer which revealed the whole his employer was as lady davenant had suspectedthe diplomatist a duplicate bramah key was found under the table and she recollected that she had some months ago missed this duplicate key of her desk and supposed she had dropped it from her watchring while out walking she recollected further that carlos had with great zeal assisted her in the search for it all through the shrubbery walks the proofs of this boys artifice and longpremeditated treachery accumulating upon lady davenant shocked her so much that she could not think of anything else is it possible is it in human nature she exclaimed such falsehood such art such ingratitude as she fixed her eyes upon the writing scarcely yet dry she repeated it is his writingi see it yet can scarcely believe it i who taught him to write myselfguided that little hand to make the first letters that he ever formed and this is in human nature i could not have conceived itit is dreadful to be so convinced it lowers ones confidence in ones fellowcreatures that is the worst of all she sighed deeply and then turning to helen said but let us think no more of it tonight we can do no more they are in pursuit of him i hope i may never never see him more chapter xiii some people value their friends most for active service some for passive kindness some are won by tender expressions some convinced by solid proofs of regard others of a yet nobler kind and of this sort was lady davenant are apt to be best pleased most touched by proofs that their own character has been thoroughly understood and that they have justly appreciated the good qualities of their friend more than by all the kindness and sympathy helen had ever before shown her was she now pleased and touched by the respect for her feelings in this affair of the page helen never having at the moment of his detection nor afterwards by word or look indulged in the selftriumph of you see how right i was which implies you see how wrong you were on the contrary she gave what comfort she honestly could by showing that she knew from what humane motives and generous feelings lady davenant had persisted in supporting this boy to the last as to the little wretch himself he appeared no more search was made for him in every direction but he was not to be found and helen thought it was well that lady davenant should be spared the pain of seeing or hearing more about him the whole mystery was now solved the difficulty for lady davenant in a fair way to be ended she had felt an instinctive aversion to the fawning tone of the diplomatist whom she had suspected of caballing against lord davenant secretly and it was now proved that he had been base beyond what she could have conceived possible had been in confederacy with this boy whom he had corrupted purchasing from him copies of private letters and bribing him to betray his benefactress the copy of that letter from an illustrious personage had been thus obtained the proofs now brought home to the guilty person deprived him at once of all future means of injuring lord davenant completely in their power he would be ready to ensure silence at any price and instead of caballing further this low intriguer would now be compelled to return from whence he came too happy to be permitted to retreat from his situation and quit england without being brought to public disgrace no notice of the report that had been in private circulation against lady davenant having yet appeared in the public prints it was possible to prevent the mischief that even the mention of her name in such an affair must have occasioned it was necessary however that letters should be written immediately to the different persons whom the private reports had reached and helen and her daughter trembled for her health in consequence of this extreme hurry and fatigue but she repeated her favourite maximbetter to wear out than to rust outand she accomplished all that was to be done lord davenant wrote in triumph that all was settled all difficulties removed and they were to set out for russia immediately and now lady davenant breathed freely relieved from the intolerable thought that the base finger of suspicion could point at her or at lord davenant her spirits rose her whole appearance renovated and all the fears that helen and her daughter had felt lest she should not be able to sustain the hardships of a long voyage and the rigour of a northern climate were now completely dispelled the day of departure was fixedlady davenant remained however as long as she possibly could with her daughter and she was anxious too to see granville beauclerc before she left clarendon park the number of the days of quarantine were gone over every morning at breakfast by lady cecilia and the general they looked in the papers carefully for the arrivals at the hotel which beauclerc usually frequented this morning in reading the list aloud the general came to the name of sir thomas daubigny brother to the colonel the paragraph stated that colonel daubigny had left some manuscripts to his brother which would soon be published and then followed some puff in the usual style which the general did not think it necessary to read but one of the officers who knew some of the daubignys went on talking of the colonel and relating various anecdotes to prove that his souvenirs would be amusing helen who was conscious that she always blushed when colonel daubignys name was mentioned and that the general had observed it was glad that he never looked up from what he was reading and when she had courage to turn towards her she admired cecilias perfect selfpossession beauclercs name was not among the arrivals and it was settled consequently that they should not see him this day some time after they had left the breakfastroom helen found lady davenant in her own apartment sitting as it was very unusual with her perfectly unemployedher head leaning on her hand and an expression of pain in her countenance are not you well my dear lady davenant helen asked my mind is not well she replied and that always affects my body and i suppose my looks after a moments silence she fixed her eyes on helen and said you tell me that colonel daubigny never was a lovernever was an admirer of yours never said helen low but very decidedly lady davenant sighed but did not speak after a longer continuance of silence than had almost ever occurred when they two were alone together lady davenant looked up and said i hope in god that i am mistaken i pray that i may never live to see it to see what cried helen to see that one little black spot invisible to you helen the speck of evil in that heartmy daughters heartspread and taint and destroy all that is good it must be cut outat any pain it must be cut away if any part be unsound the corruption will spread corruption in cecilia exclaimed helen oh i know heri know her from dear childhood there is nothing corrupt in her no not a thought my dear helen you see her as she has beenas she is i see her as she may becomeveryfrightfully different helen if truth fail if the principle of truth fail in her character all will fail all that charming nature all that fair semblance all that fair reality all this bright summers dream of happiness even lovethe supreme felicity of her warm hearteven love will fail her cecilia will lose her husbands affections helen uttered a faint cry worse continued lady davenant worse she will lose her own esteem she will sink but i shall be gone cried she and pressing her hand upon her heart she faintly repeated gone and then abruptly added call cecilia i must see cecilia i must speak to her but first i will tell you from a few words that dropped this morning from general clarendon i suspecti fear that cecilia has deceived him impossibleabout whatabout whom that colonel daubigny said lady davenant i know all about it and it was all nothing but nonsense did you look at her when the general read that paragraph this morningdid you see that innocent countenance i saw it helen and thought as you did but i have been so deceivedso lately in countenance not by hersnever not by yours helen never and yet why should i say so this very morning yours had i not known you yours would have misled me oh my foolish absurd habit of blushing how i wish i could prevent it said helen i know it will make me betray somebody some time or other betray what have you to betray cried lady davenant leaning forward with an eagerness of eye and voice that startled helen from all power of immediate reply after an instants pause however she answered firmly nothing lady davenant and that there is nothing wrong to be known about cecilia i as firmly believe as that i stand here at this moment can you suspect anything really wrong suspectwrong cried lady davenant starting up with a look in her eyes which made helen recoil helen what can you conceive that i suspect wrongceciliacaptain daubignywhat did you mean wrong did you sayof cecilia could you meancould you conceive helen that i having such a suspicion could be hereliving with herorliving anywhere and she sank down on the sofa again seized with sudden spasmin a convulsion of agonising pain but she held helens hand fast grasped detaining herpreventing her from pulling the bell and by degrees the pain passed off the livid hue cleared away the colour of life once more returned but more tardily than before and helen was excessively alarmed poor child my poor dear child i feeli hear your heart beating you are a coward helen but a sweet creature and i love youand i love my daughter what were we saying oh say no more say no more now for heavens sake said helen kneeling beside her and yielding to that imploring look lady davenant with a fond smile parted the hair on her forehead kissed her and remained perfectly quiet and silent for some time i am quite well again now said she and quite composed if cecilia has told her husband the whole truth she will continue to be as she is a happy wife but if she have deceived him in the estimation of a single wordshe is undone with him of all men never will confidence once broken unite again now general clarendon told me this morningwould i had known it before the marriagethat he had made one point with my daughter and only one on the faith of which he married the point was that she should tell him if she had ever loved any other man and she told himi fear from some words which he said afterwardsi am sure he is in the beliefthe certainty that his wife never loved any man breathing but himself nor did she said helen i can answer for itshe has told him the truthand she has nothing to fear nor have you you give me new life cried lady davenant her face becoming suddenly radiant with hope but how can you answer for this helen you had no part in any deceit i am sure but there was something about a miniature of you which i found in colonel daubignys hands one day that was done i thought at the time to deceive me to make me believe that you were his objectdeceit there was on his part said helen much and always but on cecilias there was only from her overawe of you some little concealment but the whole was broken off and repented of whatever little there was long since and as to loving him she never did she told me so then and often and often she has told me so since convince me of that said lady davenant convince me that she thought what she said i believe indeed that till she met general clarendon she never felt any enthusiastic attachment but i thought she liked that manit was all coquetry flirting nonsense perhaps be it soi am willing to believe it convince me but that she is truethere is the only point of consequence the man is dead and gone the whole in oblivion and all that is of importance is her truth convince me but of that and i am a happy mother helen brought recollections and proofs from conversations at the time and letters since confirming at least cecilias own belief that she had never loved the man that it was all vanity on her part and deception on his lady davenant listened willing to be convinced and now said she let us put this matter out of our minds entirelyi want to talk to you of yourself she took helen out with her in her ponyphaeton and spoke of granville beauclerc and of his and helens prospects of happiness lady cecilia who was riding with her husband in some fields adjoining the park caught a glimpse of the phaeton as it went along the avenue and while the general was giving some orders to the woodranger about a new plantation she telling him that she would be back in two minutes cantered off to overtake her mother and making a short cut across the fields she leaped a wide haha which came in her way she was an excellent horsewoman and fairy carried her lightly over and when she heard the generals voice in dismay and indignation at what she had done she turned and laughed and cantered on till she overtook the phaeton the breeze had blown her hair most becomingly and raised her colour and her eyes were joyously bright and her light figure always well on horseback now looked so graceful as she bent to speak to her mother that her husband could not find it in his heart to scold her and he who came to chide remained to admire her mother looking up at her could not help exclaiming well certainly you are an excessively pretty creature bearers of good news always look well i believe said she smiling so there is now some goodness in my face that there certainly is said her mother fondly but you certainly dont know what it isyou cannot know till i tell you my dearest helenmy dear mother i mean granville beauclerc will be here todayi am sure of it so pray do not go far from homedo not go out of the grounds this was what i was in such a hurry to say to you but how do you know cecilia just because i can read replied she because i can read a newspaper through which none of you newspaperreaders by profession could do this morning after you all of you laid them down i took them up and found in that evening paper which your stupid aidedecamp had been poring and boring over a fresh list of arrivals and mr granville beauclerc among them at full length now he would not stay a moment longer in town than was absolutely necessary you know or else he ought to be excommunicated but it is not in his nature to delay he will be here directlyi should not be surprised you are right cecilia interrupted the general i see a caleche on that roadit is he the caleche turned into the park and in a few minutes they metcarriages horses and servants were sent off to the house while the whole party walked and talked and looked lady cecilia was in delightful spirits and so affectionately so delicately joyfulso kind that if helen and beauclerc had ever blamed or had reason to blame her it must now be for ever forgotten as in their walk they came near that seat by the waters side where the lovers had parted cecilia whispered something to her mother and instantly it was done as desired beauclerc and helen were left to their own explanations and the rest of the party pursued their walk home of what passed in this explanatory scene no note has been transmitted to the biographer and we must be satisfied with the result chapter xiv all is right cried lady cecilia o my dear mother i am the happiest creature in the world if you were not going away could not you staya little a very little longerjust till no no my dear do not urge me to stay said lady davenant i cannotyour father expects me tomorrow all her preparations were madein short it must be so and lady davenant begged her daughter would not spend the short remaining time they were to have together in entreaties distressing and irritating to the feelings of those who ask and of those who must refuse let us enjoy in peace said she all that is to be enjoyed this day before i go when helen entered the drawingroom before dinner knowing that she was very late she found assembled lady davenant beauclerc and the officers but cecilia was not there nor did the punctual general make his appearance the dinnerhour was passed a servant had twice looked in to announce it and seeing neither my lady nor the general had in surprise retired silence prevailedwhat could be the matter so unusual for the general to be late the general came in hurriedvery uncommon in him and after saying a few words in a low voice to lady davenant who immediately went up stairs he begged pardon was very sorry he had kept dinner waiting but lady cecilia had been taken illhad faintedshe was betterhe hoped it was nothing that would signifyshe was lying downhe begged they would go to dinner and to dinner they went and when lady davenant returned she put helens mind at ease by saying it was only a little faintishness from overfatigue she had prescribed rest and cecilia had herself desired to be left quite alone after dinner lady davenant went up again to see her found her not so wellfeverish she would not let helen go to herthey would talk if they were together and she thought it necessary to keep cecilia very quiet if she would but submit to this she would be well again probably in the morning at teatime and in the course of the evening twice cecilia sent to beg to speak to helen but lady davenant and the general joined in requesting her not to go the general went himself to lady cecilia to enforce obedience and he reported that she had submitted with a good grace helen was happily engaged by beauclercs conversation during the rest of the evening it was late before they retired and when she went upstairs felicie said that her lady was asleep and had been asleep for the last two hours and she was sure that after such good rest her ladyship would be perfectly well in the morning without further anxiety about her friend therefore helen went to her own room it was a fine moonlight night and she threw open the shutters and stood for a long time looking out upon the moonlight which she loved and even after she had retired to bed it was long before she could sleep the only painful thought in her mind was of lady davenants approaching departure without her all happiness would be incomplete but still hope and love had much that was delightful to whisper and as she at last sank to sleep beauclercs voice seemed still speaking to her in soft sounds yet the dream which followed was uneasy she thought that they were standing together in the library at the open door of the conservatory by moonlight and he asked her to walk out and when she did not comply all changed and she saw him walking with anotherwith lady castlefort but then the figure changed to one youngermore beautifulit must be as the beating of helens heart in the dream told herit must be lady blanche without seeing helen however they seemed to come on smiling and talking low to each other along the matted alley of the conservatory almost to the very door where she was still as she thought standing with her hand upon the lock and then they stopped and beauclerc pulled from an orangetree a blossom which seemed the very same which helen had given to him that evening he offered it to lady blanche and something he whispered but at this moment the handle of the lock seemed to slip and helen awoke with a start and when she was awake the noise of her dream seemed to continue she heard the real sound of a lock turningher door slowly opened and a white figure appeared helen started up in her bed and awaking thoroughly saw that it was only cecilia in her dressinggown cecilia whats the matter my dear are you worse lady cecilia put her finger on her lips closed the door behind her and said hush hush or youll waken felicie she is sleeping in the dressingroom tonight mamma ordered it in case i should want her and how are you now what can i do for you my dear helen you can do something for me indeed but dont get up lie down and listen to me i want to speak to you sit down then my dear cecilia sit down here beside me no no i need not sit down i am very well standing only let me say what i have to say i am quite well quite well indeed you are not i feel you all trembling you must sit down indeed my dear said helen pressing her she sat down now listen to medo not waste time for i cant stay oh if the general should awake and find me gone what is the matter my dear cecilia only tell me what i can do for you that is the thing but i am afraid now it is come to the point lady cecilia breathed quick and short i am almost afraid to ask you to do this for me afraid my dear cecilia to ask me to do anything in this world for you how can you be afraid tell me only what it is at once i am very foolishi am very weak i know you love mewould do anything for me helen and this is the simplest thing in the world but the greatest favourthe greatest service it is only just to receive a packet which the general will give you in the morning he will ask if it is for you and you will just accept of it i dont ask you to say it is yours or to say a word about itonly receive it for me yes i will to be sure but why should he give it to me and not to yourself oh he thinks and you must let him think it is for you thats all will you promise mebut helen made no answer oh promise me promise me speak for i cant stay i will explain it all to you in the morning she rose to go stay stay cecilia cried helen stopping her stayyou must indeed explain it all to me nowyou must indeed lady cecilia hesitatedsaid she had not time you said helen that you would take the packet and you know you must but i will explain it all as fast as i can you know i fainted but you do not know why i will tell you exactly how it all happenedyou recollect my coming into the library after i was dressed before you went upstairs and giving you a sprig of orange flowers oh yes i was dreaming of it just now when you came in said helen well what of that nothing only you must have been surprised to hear so soon afterwards that i had fainted yes helen said she had been very much surprised and alarmed and again lady cecilia paused well i went from you directly to clarendon to give him a rose which you may remember i had in my hand for him i found him in the study talking to corporal somebody he just smiled as i came in took the rose and said i shall be ready this moment and looking to a table on which were heaps of letters and parcels which granville had brought from town he added i do not know whether there is anything there for you cecilia i went to look and he went on talking to his corporal he was standing with his back to the table helen felt that lady cecilia told all these minute details as if there was some fact to which she feared to come cecilia went on very quickly i did not find anything for myself but in tossing over the papers i saw a packet directed to general clarendon i thought it was a feigned handand yet that i knew itthat i had seen it somewhere lately there was one little flourish that i recollected it was like the writing of that wretched carlos carlos cried helen well the more i looked at it continued lady cecilia the more like i thought it and i was going to say so to the general only i waited till he had done his business but as i was examining it through the outer cover of very thin foreign paper i could distinguish the writing of some of the inside and it was like your hand or like mine you know between our hands there is such a great resemblance there is no telling one from the other helen did not think so but she remained silent at least said cecilia answering her look of doubt at least the general says so he never knows our hands asunder well i perceived that there was something hard insidemore than papers and as i felt it there came from it an uncommon perfumea particular perfume like what i used to have once at the timethat time that i can never bear to think of you know i know said helen and in a low voice she added you mean about colonel daubigny the perfume and altogether i do not know what quite overcame me i had just sense enough to throw the packet from me i made an effort and reached the window and i was trying to open the sash i remember but what happened immediately after that i cannot tell you when i came to myself i was in my husbands arms he was carrying me upstairsand so much alarmed about me he was oh helen i do so love him he laid me on the bed and he spoke so kindly reproaching me for not taking more care of myselfbut so fondly somehow i could not bear it just then and i closed my eyes as his met mine he i knew could suspect nothingbut still he stayed beside me holding my hand then dinner was ready he had been twice summoned it was a relief to me when he left me next i believe my mother came up and felt my pulse and scolded me for overfatiguing myself and for that leap and i pleaded guilty and it was all very well i saw she had not an idea there was anything else mamma really is not suspicious with all her penetrationshe is not suspicious and why did you not tell her all the little you had to tell dear cecilia if you had long ago when i begged of you to do soif you had told your mother all about told her interrupted cecilia told my motheroh no helen helen sighed and feebly said go on well when you were at dinner it came into my poor head that the general would open that parcel before i could see you again and before i could ask your advice and settle with youbefore i could know what was to be done i was so anxious i sent for you twice but lady davenant and the general forbade me to go to you yeslady cecilia said she understood that and she had seen the danger of showing too much impatience to speak to helen she thought it might excite suspicion of her having something particular to say she had therefore refrained from asking again she was not asleep when helen came to bed though felicie thought she was she was much too anxious to sleep till she had seen her husband again she was awake when he came into his room she saw him come in with some letters and packets in his hand by his look she knew all was still safehe had not opened that particular packethe held it among a parcel of military returns in his hand as he came to the side of the bed on tiptoe to see if she was asleepto ask how she did he touched my pulse said lady ceciliaand i am sure he might well say it was terribly quick every instant i thought he would open that packet he threw it however and all the rest down on the table to be read in the morning as usual as soon as he awoke after feeling my pulse again the last thing and satisfying himself that it was betterquieter now said he he fell fast asleep and slept so soundly and i helen looked at her with astonishment and was silent oh speak to me said lady cecilia what do you say helen i say that i cannot imagine why you are so much alarmed about this packet because i am a fool i believe said lady cecilia trying to laugh i am so afraid of his opening it but why said helen what do you think there is in it i have told you surely lettersfoolish letters of mine to that daubigny oh how i repent i ever wrote a line to him and he told me he absolutely swore he had destroyed every note and letter i ever wrote to him he was the most false of human beings he was a very bad mani always thought so said helen but cecilia i never knew that he had any letters of yours oh yes you did my dear at the time do not you recollect i showed you a letter and it was you who made me break off the correspondence i remember your showing me several letters of his said helen but not of yoursonly one or two notesasking for that picture back again which he had stolen from your portfolio yes and about the verses surely you recollect my showing you another letter of mine helen yes but these were all of no consequence there must be more or you could not be so much afraid cecilia of the generals seeing these surely at this moment lady davenants prophecy all she had said about her daughter flashed across helens mind and with increasing eagerness she went on what is there in those letters that can alarm you so much i declare i do not know said cecilia that is the plain truth i cannot recollecti cannot be certain what there is in them but it is not so long ago ceciliaonly two years that is true but so many great events have happened since and such new feelings all that early nonsense was swept out of my mind i never really loved that wretch a gleam of joy came across helens face never never repeated lady cecilia oh i am happy still cried helen i told your mother i was sure of this good heavensdoes she know about this packet no nohow could she but what frightens you my dear cecilia you say there is nothing wrong in the letters nothingnothing then make no wrong out of nothing cried helen if you break confidence with your husband that confidence will never never unite againyour mother says so my mother cried cecilia good heavensso she does suspecttell me helen tell me what she suspects that you did not at firstbefore you were married tell the general the whole truth about colonel daubigny cecilia was silent but it is not yet too late said helen earnestly you can set it all right nowthis is the moment my dearest cecilia do do cried helen do tell him allbid him look at the letters look at them impossible impossible said lady cecilia bid me die rather she turned quite away listen to me cecilia she held her fast you must do it cecilia helen i cannot you can indeed you can said helen only have courage now and you will be happier all your life afterwards do not ask itdo not ask itit is all in vain you are wasting time no nonot wasting time and in short cecilia you must do what i ask of you for it is right and i will not do what you ask of me for it is wrong you will notyou will not cried lady cecilia breathless after all you will not receive the packet for me you will not let the general believe the letters to be yours then i am undone you will not do itthen do not talk to medo not talk to meyou do not know general clarendon if his jealousy were once roused you have no idea what it would be if the man were alive said helen but since he is dead but clarendon would never forgive me for having loved another you said you did not love him nor did i ever really love that man but still clarendon from even seeing those letters might think i did the very fact of having written such letters would be destruction to me with clarendon you do not know clarendon how can i convince you it is impossible for me to tell him at the time he first proposed for meoh how i loved him and feared to lose him one day my mother when i was not by said somethingi do not know what about a first love let fall something about that hateful daubigny and the general came to me in such a state oh helen in such a state i thought it was all at an end he told me he never would marry any woman on earth who had ever loved another i told him i never had and that was true you know but then i went a little beyond perhaps i said i had never thought of anybody else for he made such a point of that in short i was a cowarda fool i little foresawi laughed it off and told him that what mamma had said was all a mistake all nonsense that colonel daubigny was a sort of universal flirtand that was very true i am sure that he had admired us both both you and me but you last you most helen i said oh cecilia how could you say so when you knew he never cared for me in the least forgive me my dear for there was no other way and what harm did it do you or what harm can it ever do you it only makes it the easier for you to help meto save me now and granville continued lady cecilia thinking that was the obstacle in helens mind and granville need never know it helens countenance suddenly changedgranville i never thought of that and now that she did think of it she reproached herself with the selfishness of that fear till this moment she knew her motives had been all singly for cecilias happiness now the fear she felt of this some way hurting her with beauclerc made her less resolute lady cecilia saw her giving way and hurried on oh my dear helen i know i have been very wrong but you would not quite give me up would youoh for my mothers sake consider how it would be with my mother so ill as you saw her i am sure if anything broke out now in my mothers state of health it would be fatal helen became excessively agitated oh helen would you make me the death of that motheroh helen save her and do what you will with me afterwards it will be only for a few hoursonly a few hours repeated lady cecilia seeing that these words made a great impression upon helensave me helen save my mother she sank upon her knees clasping her hands in an agony of supplication helen bent down her head and was silentshe could no longer refuse then i must said she oh thank you bless you cried lady cecilia in an ecstasyyou will take the letters yes helen feebly said yes since it must be so cecilia embraced her thanked her blessed her and hastily left the room but in an instant afterward she returned and said one thing i forgot and i must tell you think of my forgetting it the letters are not signed with my real name they are signed emmahenry and emmaoh folly folly my dear dear friend save me but now and i never will be guilty of the least deception again during my whole life believe me believe me when once my mother is safely gone i will tell clarendon all look at me dear helen look at me and believe me and helen looked at her and helen believed her chapter xv helen slept no more this night when alone in the stillness of the long hours she went over and over again all that had passed what cecilia had said what she had at first thought and afterwards felt all the persuasions by which she had been wrought upon and on the contrary all the reasons by which she ought to be decided backward and forward her mind vibrated and its painful vacillation could not be stilled what am i going to do to tell a falsehood that cannot be right but in the circumstancesyet this is cecilias own way of palliating the fault that her mother so fears in herthat her mother trusted to me to guard her against and now already even before lady davenant has left us i am going to assist cecilia in deceiving her husband and on that very dangerous pointcolonel daubigny lady davenants foreboding having already been so far accomplished struck helen fearfully and her warning voice in the dead silence of that night sounded and her look was upon her so strongly that she for an instant hid her head to get rid of her image but what can i do her own life is at stake no less a motive could move me but this oughtmustshall decide me yet if lady davenant were to know itand i in the last hours i have to pass with herthe last i ever may have with her shall i deceive her but it is not deceit only prudencenecessary prudence what a physician would order what even humanity requires i am satisfied it is quite right quite and i will go to sleep that i may be strong and calm and do it all well in the morning after all i have been too cowardly frightening myself about nothing too scrupulousfor what is it i have promised only to receive the letters as if they were mine not to say that they are mine he will not ask me cecilia thinks he will not ask me but how can she tell if he should what can i do i must then answer that they are mine indeed it is the same thing for i should lead him to believe it as much by my receiving them in silence it will be telling or acting an absolute falsehood and can that ever be right back it came to the same point and in vain her cheek settled on the pillow and she thought she could sleep then with closed eyes she considered how the general would look and speak or not speak what will he think of me when he sees the picturethe letters for he must open the packet but he will not read them no he is too honourable i do not know what is in them there can be nothing however but nonsense cecilia says yet even so loveletters he must know they are and a clandestine correspondence i heard him once express such contempt for any clandestine affair he who is so nice so strict about womens conduct how i shall sink in his esteem well be it so that concerns only myself and it is for his own sake too to save his happiness and cecilia my dear cecilia oh i can bear it and it will be a pride to me to bear it for i am grateful my gratitude shall not be only in words now when i am put to the trial i can do something for my friends yes and i will let the consequences be what they may yet beauclerc that thought was at the bottom of her heart the fear the almost certainty that some way or otherevery way in which she could think of it it would lead to difficulty with beauclerc but this fear was mere selfishness she thought and to counteract it came all her generous all her grateful all her longcherished romantic love of sacrificea belief that she was capable of selfdevotion for the friends she loved and upon the strength of this idea she fixed at last quieted she soothed herself to repose and worn out with reasoning or trying to reason in vain she at last in spite of the morning light dawning upon her through the unclosed shutters in a soft sort of enthusiastic vision fading away fell asleep she slept long when she awoke it was with that indescribable feeling that something painful had happenedthat something dreadful was to be this day she recollected first that lady davenant was to go then came all that had passed with cecilia it was late she saw that her maid had been in the room but had refrained from awakening her she rose and dressed as fast as she could she was to go to lady davenant when her bell rang twice how to appear before one who knew her countenance so well without showing that any thing had happened was her first difficulty she looked in her glass to see whether there was any alteration in her face none that she could see but she was no judge how foolish to think so much about it all she dressed and between times inquired from her maid if she had heard of any change in lady davenants intentions of going had any counterorders about the carriage been given none it was ordered to be at the door by twelve oclock that was well helen said to herself it would all soon be over lady davenant would be safe then she could bear all the rest next she hoped that any perturbation or extraordinary emotion in herself would not be observed in the hurry of departure or would be thought natural at parting with lady davenant so then i come at every turn to some little deceit thought she and i must i must and she sighed it is a sad thing for you maam lady davenants going away said her maid helen sighed again very sad indeed suddenly a thought darted into her mind that the whole danger might be avoided a hope came that the general might not open the packet before lady davenants departure in which case cecilia could not expect that she should abide by her promise as it was only conditional it had been made really on her mothers account cecilia had said that if once her mother was safe out of the house she could then and she would the very next day tell the whole to her husband helen sprang from under the hands of her maid as she was putting up her hair behind and ran to cecilias dressingroom but she was not there it was now her usual time for coming and helen left open the door between them that she might go to her before felicie should be rung for she waited impatiently but no cecilia came the time to her impatience seemed dreadfully long but her maid observed that as her ladyship had not been well yesterday it was no wonder she was later this morning than usual very true but there is somebody coming along the gallery now see if that is lady cecilia no maam mademoiselle felicie mademoiselle felicie said ditto to helens own maid and moreover supposed her lady might not have slept well just then one little peremptory knock at the door was heard bon dieu cest monsieur le gnral exclaimed felicie it was sofelicie went to the door and returned with the generals compliments to miss stanley and he begged to see her as soon as it might suit her convenience in the library before she went into the breakfastroom and after she should have seen lady cecilia who wished to see her immediately helen found lady cecilia in bed looking as if she had been much agitated two spots of carnation colour high up in her cheeks a wellknown sign in her of great emotion helen she cried starting up the moment helen came in he has opened the packet and you see me alive but i do believe i should have died when it came to the point but for youdearest helen i should have been and still but for you i must be undoneand my motheroh if he had gone to her what has happened tell me clearly my dear cecilia and quickly for i must go to general clarendon he has desired to see me as soon as i can after seeing you i know i know said cecilia but he will allow time and you had better be some time with me for he thinks i have all to explain to you this morningand so i have a great deal to say to you sit downquietlyoh if you knew how i have been agitated i am hardly able yet tell anything rightly she threw herself back on the pillows and drew a long breath as if to relieve the oppression of mind and body now i think i can tell it then do my dear ceciliaallpray do and exactlyoh cecilia tell me all every word every look to the utmost as far as i can recollect as if you had been present give me your hand helen how cool you aredelightful but how you tremble never mind said helen but how burning hot your hand is no matter if ever i am well or happy again in this world helen i shall owe it to you after i left you i found the general fast asleep i do not believe he had ever awokei lay awake for hours till past five oclock in the morning i was wide awakefeverish but can you conceive it just then when i was most anxious to be awake when i knew there was but one hournot so much till he would awake and read that packet i felt an irresistible sleepiness come over me i turned and turned and tried to keep my eyes open and pulled and pinched my fingers but all would not do and i fell asleep dreaming that i was awake and how long i slept i cannot tell you so deep so dead asleep i must have been but the instant i did awake i started up and drew back the curtain and i sawoh helen there was clarendon dressedstanding with his arms foldeda letter open hanging from his hand his eyes were fixed upon me waiting watching for my first look he saw me glance at the letter in his hand and then at the packet on the table near the bed for an instant neither of us spoke i could not nor exclaim even but surprised terrified he must have seen i was as i leaned forward holding by the curtains he pulled one of them suddenly back threw open the shutters and the full glare was upon my face i shut my eyesi could not help itand shrank but gathering strength from absolute terror of his silence i spoke i asked for heavens sake clarendon what is the matter why do you look so oh that look of his still fixed on methe same as i once saw before we were marriedonce and but once when he came from my mother to me about this man well i put my hands before my eyes he stepped forward drew them down and placed the open letter before me and then asked me in a terrible sort of suppressed voice cecilia whose writing is this the writing was before my eyes but i literally could not see itit was all a sort of maze he saw i could not read it and calmly bade me take timeexamineis it a forgery a forgerythat had never crossed my mind and for an instant i was tempted to say it was but quickly i saw that would not do there was the miniature and that could not be a forgery no i answered i do not think it is a forgery what then said he so hastily that i could hardly hear and before i could think what to answer he said i must see lady davenant he stepped towards the bell i threw myself upon his armgood heavens do not clarendon if you are not out of your senses i am not out of my senses cecilia i am perfectly calm answer me one word onlyis this your writing oh my dear helen then it was that you saved me i yes forgive me helen i answered there is a handwriting so like that you never can tell it from mine ask me no more clarendon i said i saw a flash of light as it were come across his faceit was hopebut still it was not certainty i saw this oh how quick one sees he pointed to the first words of the letter held his finger under them and his hand trembledthink of his hand trembling read he said and i read how i brought myself to pronounce the words i cannot imagine i read what as i hope for mercy i had no recollection of ever having writtenmy dear too dear henry colonel daubigny said the general i answered yes he looked astonished at my selfpossessionand so was i for another instant his finger rested pressing down there under the words and his eyes on my face as if he would have read into my soul ask me no more i repeated scarcely able to speak and something i said i believe about honour and not betraying you he turned to the signature and putting his hand down upon it asked what name is signed to this letter i answered i have seeni knowi believe it is emma you knew then of this correspondence was his next question i confessed i did he said that was wrong but quite a different affair from having been engaged in it myself or some such word his countenance cleared that pale look of the forehead the fixed purpose of the eye changed oh i could seei understood it all with half a glancesaw the natural colour coming back and tenderness for me returningyet some doubt lingering still he stood and i heard some halffinished sentences he said that you must have been very young at that time i said yes very youngand the man was a most artful man he observed i said yes very artful that was true i am sure clarendon then recollected that you showed some emotion one day when colonel daubigny was first mentionedat that time you know when we heard of his death i said nothing the general went on i could hardly have believed all this of helen stanley he said he questioned no fartherand oh helen what do you think i did next but it was the only thing left me to put an end to doubts which to me must have been fatalforgive me helen tell me what you did said helen cannot you guess you told him positively that i wrote the letters no not so bad i never said that downright falsehoodno i could not but i did almost as bad pray tell me at once my dear cecilia then in the first place i stretched out my hand for the whole packet of letters which lay on the table untouched well well he put them into my hands and said there is no direction on these but to myself i have not looked at any of them except this which in ignorance i first opened i have not read one word of any of the others well said helen and what did you do i said i was not going to read any of the letters that i was only looking fornow helen you knowi told you there was something hard in the parcel something more than papers i was sure what it must bethe miniaturethe miniature of you which i painted you know that i might have it when you were gone and which he stole and pretended before my mother to be admiring as your likeness but he kept it only because it was my painting i opened the paper in which it was folded clarendon darted upon itit is helen and then he said how like how beautiful how unworthy of that man but oh helen think of what an escape i had next there was my namemy initials c d at the bottom of the picture as the painter and that horrible man not content with his initials opposite to mine had on the back written at full length for henry daubignyclarendon looked at it and said between his teeth he is deadthank god said i then he asked me how i came to paint this picture for that man i answeredoh how happy then it was for me that i could tell the whole truth about that at leasti answered that i did not do the picture for colonel daubigny that it never was given to him that he stole it from my portfolio and that we both did what we could to get it back again from him but could not and that you even wanted me to tell my mother but of that i was afraid and clarendon said you were wrong there my dear cecilia i was so touched when i heard him call me his dear cecilia again and in his own dear voice that i burst into tears that was a great relief to me and i kept saying over and over again that i was wrongvery wrong indeed and then he kneeled down beside me and i so felt his tenderness his confiding love for mefor me unworthy as i am the tears streamed from lady cecilias eyes as she spokequite unworthy no no not quite unworthy said helen my poor dear cecilia what you must have felt once continued ceciliaonce helen as my head was lying on his shoulder my face hid i felt so much love so much remorse and knowing i had done nothing really bad i was tempted to whisper all in his ear i felt i should be so much happier for evereverif i could oh that you had my dear cecilia i would give anything upon earth for your sake that you had helen i could noti could not it was too late i should have been undone if i had breathed but a word when he even suspected the truth that lookthat voice was so terrible to see ithear it again i could notoh helen it would have been utter ruinmadness i grant you my dear helen it might have been done at first before i was married oh would to heaven it had but it is useless thinking of that now helen my whole earthly happiness is in your hands this is all i have to say may imay i depend on you yes yes depend upon me my dearest cecilia said helen now let me go lady cecilia held her one instant longer to say that she had asked clarendon to leave it to her to return the letters to save you the embarrassment my dearest helen but he answered he must do this himself and i did not dare to press the matter but you need not be alarmed he will be all gentleness to you he said it is so different do not be afraid afraid for myself said helen oh norest dear cecilia and let me go go then go cried cecilia but for you what would become of my motherof meyou save us all believing this helen hastened to accomplish her purpose resolved to go through with it whatever it might cost her scruples vanished and she felt a sort of triumphant pleasure in the courage of sacrificing herself chapter xvi general clarendon was sitting in the musicroom within the library the door open so that he could see helen the moment she came in and that moment he threw down his book as he rose and their eyes met hers fell beneath his penetrating glance he came forward immediately to meet her with the utmost gentleness and kindness in his whole appearance and manner took her hand and drawing her arm within his said in the most encouraging voice consider me as your brother helen you know you have allowed me so to feel for you and so believe me i do feel this kindness quite overcame her and she burst into tears he hurried her across the library into the inner room seated her and when he had closed the door stood beside her and began as if he had been to blame to apologise for himself you must have been surprised at my having opened letters which did not belong to me but there was no direction no indication that could stop me they were simply in a cover directed to me the purpose of whoever sent them must have been to make me read them the ultimate purpose was i doubt not to ruin lady cecilia clarendon in my opinion or me said helen no miss stanley no that at all events cannot be said the general supposing the letters to be acknowledged by you still it would be quite a different affair but in the first place look at them they may be forgeries you will tell me if they are forgeries and he placed the packet in her hands scarcely looking at the writing she answered no forgeries i am sure they are not the general looked again at the direction of the cover and observed this is a feigned hand whose can it be helen was on the brink of saying that cecilia had told her it was like the writing of carlos now this cover had not to the generals knowledge been seen by cecilia and that one answer might have betrayed all that she was to conceal for he would instantly have asked how and when did cecilia see it and the cause of her fainting would have been then understood by him such hazards in every even the first least step in falsehood such hazard in this first moment but she escaped this peril and helen answered it is something like the writing of the page carlos but i do not think all that direction is his there seem to be two different hands i do not know indeed how it is some time or other it will come out said the general i will keep this cover it will lead to the direction of that boy or of whoever it was that employed him to give her further time the general went on looking at the miniature which he held in his hand this is a beautiful likeness said he and not ill paintedby cecilia was not it helen looked at it and answered yes by cecilia i am glad it is safe said the general restoredcecilia told me the history i know that it was stolen not given by you given said helen oh no stolen base said the general he was base answered helen general clarendon held in his hand along with the picture one letter separated from the rest open he looked at it as if embarrassed while helen spoke the last words and he repeated base yes he certainly was or he would have destroyed these letters again helen was on the point of saying that colonel daubigny had told cecilia he had done so but fortunately her agitation in default of presence of mind kept her silent this is the first letter i opened said the general before i was aware that they were not what i should read i saw only the first words i thought then that i had a right to read them when these letters met my eyes i conceived them to have been written by my wife i had a right to satisfy myself respecting the nature of the correspondence that done i looked no farther i bore my suspensei waited till she awoke so she told me cecilia has told me all but even if she had not in any circumstances who could doubt your honour general clarendon then trust to it miss stanley for the past for the future trust to it you gratify me more than i can expressyou do me justice i wished to return these letters to you with my own hand continued he to satisfy myself in the first place that there was no mistake of that your present candour indeed the first look of that ingenuous countenance was sufficient helen felt that she blushed all over pardon me for distressing you my dear helen it was a matter in which a man must be selfish must in point of honour must in point of feeling i owe to your candour not merely relief from what i could not endure and live but relief from suspicionsuspicion of the truth of one dearer to me than life helen sat as if she had been transfixed i owe to you continued he the happiness of my whole future life then i am happy cried helen happy in this at all events whatever may become of me she had not yet raised her eyes towards the general she felt as if her first look must betray cecilia but she now tried to fix her eyes upon him as he looked anxiously at her and she said thank you thank you general clarendon oh thank you for all the kindness you have shown me but i am the more grieved it makes me more sorry to sink quite in your esteem to sink you do not your candour your truth raises you oh do not say that i do repeated the general and you may believe me i am incapable of deceiving youthis is no matter of compliment between friend and friend i should count a word a look of falsehood treason helens tears stopped and without knowing what she did she began hastily to gather up the packet of letters which she had let fall the general assisted her in putting them into her bag and she closed the strings thanked him and was rising when he went oni beg your indulgence while i say a few words of myself she sat down again immediately oh as many as you please i believe i may say i am not of a jealous temper i am sure you are not said helen i thank you said the general may i ask on what your opinion is founded on what has now passed and on all that i have heard from lady davenant he bowed you may have heard then from lady davenant of some unfortunate circumstances in my own and in a friends family which happened a short time before my marriage helen said she had and of the impression these circumstances made on my mind my consequent resolve never to marry a woman who had ever had any previous attachment helen was breathless at hearing all this repeated were you informed of these particulars said the general yes said helen faintly i am not asking miss stanley whether you approved of my resolution simply whether you heard of it yescertainly thats well it was on an understanding between cecilia and myself on this point that i married did you know this yes said helen some words continued the general once fell from lady davenant concerning this colonel daubigny which alarmed me cecilia satisfied me that her mother was mistaken cecilia solemnly assured me that she had never loved him the general paused helen conceiving that he waited for and required her opinion replied so i always thoughtso i often told lady davenant but at this moment recollecting the words at the beginning of that letter my dear too dear henry helens voice faltered the general saw her confusion but attributed it to her own consciousness had lady davenant not been mistaken resumed he that is to say had there ever beenas might have happened not unnaturallyhad there ever been an attachment in short had cecilia ever loved him and told me so i am convinced that such truth and candour would have satisfied me would have increasedas i now feelincreased my esteem i am at this moment convinced that in spite of my declared resolution i should in perfect confidence have married oh that cecilia had but told him thought helen i should not my dear miss stanley continued the general have thus taken up your time talking of myself had i not an important purpose in view i was desirous to do away in your mind the idea of my great strictnessnot on my own account but on yours i wished to dispel this notion now you will no longer i trust apprehend that my esteem for you is diminished i assure you i can make allowances she was shocked at the idea of allowances yet thanked him for his indulgence and she could hardly refrain from again bursting into tears still by your agitation i see you are afraid of me said he smiling no indeed not afraid of you but shocked at what you must think of me i am not surprised but sorry to see that the alarm i gave my poor cecilia this morning has passed from her mind into yours to her i must have appeared harsh i was severe but when i thought i had been deceived duped can you wonder helen turned her eyes away my dear miss stanley why will not you distinguish the cases are essentially different nine out of ten of the young ladies who marry in these countries do not marry the first object of their fancy and whenever there is as there will be i am sure in your case perfect candour i do not apprehend the slightest danger to the happiness of either party on the contrary i should foretell an increase of esteem and love beauclerc has often beauclercs voice was at this instant heard in the hall compose yourself my dear miss stanleythis way said the general opening a door into the conservatory for he heard beauclercs step now in the library the general followed helen as she left the room and touching the bag that contained the letters said remember whatever may be your hurry lock this up first thank you answered she i will i will and she hastened on and in a moment she was safe across the hall and upstairs without meeting any one and in her own room and the bag locked up in her cabinet lady davenants bell rang as she went to her apartment she looked in at cecilia who started up in her bed all is over said helen all is well i have the letters locked up i cannot stay helen disengaged herself almost forcibly from cecilias embrace and she was in lady davenants room in another minute she bade her good morning as composedly as she could she thought quite as usual but that was impossible so much the better for it would not have been natural this last morning of lady davenants stay when nothing was as usual externally or internally all was preparation for departureher maids packinglady davenant making some last arrangementsin the midst of which she stopped to notice helenpressed her in her arms and after looking once in her face said my poor child it must be so elliott interrupted asking some question purposely to draw off her attention and while she turned about to give some orders to another servant elliott said to miss stanley my lady was not well last night she must be kept from all that can agitate her as much as possible helen at that instant rejoiced that she had done what she had she agreed with elliott she said that all emotion which could be avoided should and upon this principle busied herself and was glad to employ herself in whatever she could to assist the preparations avoiding all conversation with lady davenant you are right my lovequite right said lady davenant the best way is always to employ ones self always to the last yes put up those drawings carefully in this portfolio elliott take silver paper helen they were helens own drawings so all went on and all was safeeven when cecilia was spoken of while the silver paper went over the drawings helen answered that she had seen her she was not well but still not seriously ill though yes said lady davenant only the general is too anxious about hervery naturally he sent me word just now continued she that he has forbidden her to get up before breakfast i will go and see her now dear cecilia i hope she will do wellevery wayi feel sure of it helensure as you do yourself my dearbut what is the matter nothing said helen that was not quite true but she could not help itnothing repeated she only i am anxious my dear lady davenant continued poor helen blundering unaccustomed to evasionsonly i am very anxious you should go soon to cecilia i know she is awake now and you will be hurried after breakfast elliott looked reproachfully at miss stanley for she thought it much better for her lady to be engaged in more indifferent matters till after breakfast when she would have but a few minutes to spend with her daughter so helen correcting herself addedbut perhaps im wrong so do not let me interrupt you in whatever you are doing my dear child said lady davenant you do not know what you are saying or doing yourself this morning but no suspicion was excited in her mind as she accounted for helens perturbation by the sorrow of their approaching separation and by the hurry of her spirits at beauclercs arrival the day before and then came the meeting the general at breakfast which helen dreaded but so composed so impenetrable was he that she could hardly believe that anything could have occurred that morning to agitate him lady davenant after being with her daughter came to take leave of helen and said gravely helen remember what i said of cecilias truth my trust is in you remember if i never see you again by all the love and esteem i bear you and all which you feel for me remember this my last requestprayeradjuration to you support save cecilia at that moment the general came to announce that the carriage was ready promptly he led her away handed her in and the order to drive on was given lady davenants last look her last anxious smile was upon helen and beauclerc as they stood beside each other on the steps and she was gone helen was so excessively agitated that beauclerc did not attempt to detain her from hurrying to her own room where she sat down and endeavoured to compose herself she repeated lady davenants last words support save cecilia and unlocking the cabinet in which she had deposited the fatal letters she seized the bag that contained them and went immediately to cecilia she was in her dressingroom and the general sitting beside her on the sofa upon which she was resting he was sitting directly opposite to helen as she entered she started at the sight of him his eye instantly fell upon the bag and she felt her face suddenly flush he took out his watch said he had an appointment and was gone before helen raised her eyes my dearest friend come to me come close to me cried cecilia and throwing her arms round helen she said oh i am the happiest creature now are you said helen yes that i am and i thank you for it how much i thank you helen it is impossible to express and better i love you than anything upon earth but clarendon himself my best friend my generous helen oh clarendon has been so kind so very kind so sorry for having alarmed me he is a noble charming creature i love him a thousand times better than i ever did am happier than i ever was and all this i owe to you dearest helen but i cannot get your eyes from that bagwhat have you there the letters said helen the letters exclaimed cecilia springing up give them to me seizing and opening the bag oh that dreadful perfume helen open the window and bolt the door my dearboth doors while helen was doing so cecilia struck one little quick blow on a taperlighter it flared and when helen turned one of the letters was in flames and cecilia continued feeding the flame with them as fast as ever it could devour burn burn there there cried she i would not look at any one of them again for the world i know no more what is in them than if i had never written them except those horrid horrid words clarendon saw and showed me i cannot bear to think of it there now continued she as they burned no one can ever know anything more about the matter how glad i am to see them burningburnt safe the smell will go off in a minute or two it is goingyes gone is not it now we may breathe freely but you look as if you did not know whether you were glad or sorry helen i believe it was right the general advised me to lock them up said helen but then did he how thoughtful of him but better to burn them at once i am sure it was not my fault that they were not long ago destroyed i was assured by that abominable manbut no matter we will never think of him again it is done nowno not completely yet said she looking close at the half white half black burnt paper in which words and whole lines still appeared in shrunken but yet quite legible characters one cannot be too careful and she trampled on the burnt paper and scattered the cinders helen was anxious to speak she had something important to say but hesitated she saw that cecilias thoughts were so far from what she wanted to speak of that she could not instantly say it she could not bear to overturn all cecilias present happiness and yet said to herself i musti mustor what may happen hereafter then forcing herself to speak she began your mother is safe now cecilia oh yes and thank you thank you for that then now ceciliayour promise my promise lady cecilias eyes opened in unfeigned astonishment what promiseoh i recollect i promiseddid i my dear cecilia surely you cannot have forgotten how was it you know the reason i consented was to prevent the danger of any shock to lady davenant well i know but what did i promise the words had in reality passed lady cecilias lips at the time without her at all considering them as a promise only as a means of persuasion to bring helen to her point what did i promise repeated she you said as soon as my mother is safe as soon as she is gone i will tell my husband allcecilia you cannot forget what you promised oh no now i remember it perfectly but i did not mean so soon i never imagined you would claim it so soon but some time i certainly will tell him all do not put it off dearest cecilia it must be donelet it be done today today lady cecilia almost screamed i will tell you why said helen today repeated lady cecilia if we let the present now pass continued helen we shall lose both the power and the opportunity believe me i have not the power helen and i do not know what you mean by the opportunity said cecilia we have a reason now to give general clarendona true good reason for what we have done reason cried lady cecilia what can you mean that it was to prevent danger to your mother and now she is safe and if you tell him directly he will see this was really so that is true but i cannotwait till tomorrow at least every day will make it more difficult the deception will be greater and less pardonable if we delay it will become deliberate falsehood a sort of conspiracy between us said helen conspiracy oh helen do not use such a shocking word when it is really nothing at all then why not tell it urged helen because though it is nothing at all in reality yet clarendon would think it dreadfulthough i have done nothing really wrong so i sayso i know cried helen therefore therefore let me take my own time said cecilia how can you urge me so hurrying me so terribly and when i am but just recovered from one misery and when you had made me so happy and when i was thanking you with all my heart helen was much moved but answered as steadily as she could it seems cruel but indeed i am not cruel when you had raised me up continued cecilia to dash me down again and leave me worse than ever not worseno surely not worse when your mother is safe yes safe thank youbut oh helen have you no feeling for your own cecilia the greatest answered helen and her tears said the rest you helen i never could have thought you would have urged me so o cecilia if you knew the pain it was to me to make you unhappy againbut i assure you it is for your own sake dearest cecilia let me tell you all that general clarendon said about it and then you will know my reasons she repeated as quickly as she could all that had passed between her and the general and when she came to this declaration that if cecilia had told him plainly the fact before he would have married with perfect confidence and as he believed with increased esteem and love cecilia started up from the sofa on which she had thrown herself and exclaimed o that i had but known this at the time and i would have told him it is still time said helen time nowimpossible his look this morning oh that look but what is one look my dear cecilia compared with a whole life of confidence and happiness a life of happiness never never for me in that way at least never in that way and no other cecilia believe me i am certain you never could endure to go on concealing this living with him you love so yet deceiving him deceiving do not call it deceiving it is only suppressing a fact that would give him pain and when he can have no suspicion why give him that pain i am afraid of nothing now but this timidity of yoursthis going back just before you came in clarendon was saying how much he admired your truth and candour how much he is obliged to you for saving him from endless misery he said so to me that was what made me so completely happy i saw that it was all right for you as well as me that you had not sunk that you had risen in his esteem but i must sink cecilia in his esteem and now it hangs upon a single pointupon my doing what i cannot do then she repeated what the general had said about that perfect openness which he was sure there would be in this case between her and beauclerc you see what the general expects that i should do yes said cecilia and then indeed she looked much disturbed i am very sorry that this notion of your telling beauclerc came into clarendons headvery very sorry for he will not forget it and yet after all continued she he will never ask you point blank have you told beauclercand still more impossible that he should ask beauclerc about it cecilia said helen if it were only for myself i would say no more there is nothing i would not endurethat i would not sacrificeeven my utmost happinessshe stopped and blushed deeply oh my dearest helen do you think i could let you ever hazard that if i thought there was the least chance of injuring you with granvillei would do any thingi would throw myself at clarendons feet this instant this instanti wish he was here cried helen good heavens do you cried lady cecilia looking at the door with terrorshe thought she heard his step yes if you would but tell himo let me call him oh no no spare mespare me i cannot speak now i could not utter the words i should not know what words to use tell him if you will i cannot may i tell him said helen eagerly no nothat would be worse if anybody tells him it must be myself then you will nowwhen he comes in he is coming cried cecilia general clarendon came to the doorit was bolted in a few minutes said helen lady cecilia did not speak but listened as in agony to his receding footsteps in a few minutes helen did you saythen there is nothing for me now but to diei wish i could diei wish i was dead helen felt she was cruel she began to doubt her own motives she thought she had been selfish in urging cecilia too strongly and going to her kindly she said take your own time my dear cecilia only tell himtell him soon i will i will indeed when i canbut now i am quite exhausted you are indeed said helen how cruel i have beenhow pale you are lady cecilia lay down on the sofa and helen covered her with a soft india shawl trembling so much herself that she could hardly stand thank you thank you dear kind helen tell him i am going to sleep and i am sure i hope i shall helen closed the shuttersshe had now done all she could she feared she had done too much and as she left the room she said to herselfoh lady davenant if you could seeif you knewwhat it cost me end of volume the second volume the third chapter i the overwrought state of helens feelings was relieved by a walk with beauclerc not in the dressed part of the park but in what was generally undiscovered country a dingle a bosky dell which he had found out in his rambles and which though so little distant from the busy hum of men had a wonderful air of romantic seclusion and stillnessthe stillness of evening the sun had not set its rich red light yet lingered on the still remaining autumn tints upon the trees the birds hopped fearlessly from bough to bough as if this sweet spot were all their own the cattle were quietly grazing below or slowly winding their way to the wateringplace by degrees the sounds of evening faded away upon the ear a faint chirrup here and there from the few birds not yet gone to roost and now only the humming of the flies over the water were to be heard it was perfect repose and beauclerc and helen sat down on the bank to enjoy it together the sympathy of the woman he loved especially in his enjoyment of the beauties of nature was to beauclerc an absolute necessary of life nor would he have been contented with that show taste for the picturesque which is as he knew merely one of a modern young ladys many accomplishments helens taste was natural and he was glad to feel it so true and for him here alone expressed with such peculiar heightened feeling as if she had in all nature now a new sense of delight he had brought her here in hopes that she would be struck with this spot not only because it was beautiful in itself and his discovery but because it was like another bushy dell and bosky bourne of which he had been from childhood fond in another place of which he hoped she would soon be mistress soon very soon helen he repeated in a tone which could not be heard by her with indifference he said that some of his friends in london told him that the report of their intended union had been spread everywhereby lady katrine hawksby probably as cecilia when lady castlefort departed had confided to her to settle her mind about beauclerc that he was coming over as miss stanleys acknowledged lover and since the report had been so spread the sooner the marriage took place the better at least it was a plea which beauclerc failed not to urge and helens delicacy failed not to feel she sighedshe smiled the day was namedand the moment she consented to be his nothing could be thought of but him yet even while he poured out all his soulwhile he enjoyed the satisfaction there is in perfect unreservedness of confidence helen felt a pang mix with her pleasure she felt there was one thing she could not tell him he who had told her every thingall his faults and follies oh why thought she why cannot i tell him every thing i who have no secrets of my ownwhy should i be forced to keep the secrets of another in confusion scarcely finished these ideas came across her mind and she sighed deeply beauclerc asked why and she could not tell him she was silent and he did not reiterate the indiscreet question he was sure she thought of lady davenant and he now spoke of the regret he felt that she could not be present at their marriage and lord davenant too beauclerc said he had hoped that lord davenant who loved helen as if she were his own daughter would have been the person to act as her father at the ceremony but the general his friend and hers would now beauclerc said give her to him and would he was sure take pleasure in thus publicly marking his approbation of his wards choice they rose and going on down the path to the rivers side they reached a little cove where he had moored his boat and they returned home by waterthe moon just visible the air so still all so placid so delightful and beauclerc so happy that she could not but be happy yesquite happy too they reached the shore just as the lamps were lighting in the house as they went in they met the general who said in good time and he smiled on helen as she passed it is all settled whispered beauclerc to him and you are to give her away with pleasure said the general as helen went upstairs she said to herself i understand the generals smile he thinks i have followed his advice he thinks i have told alland ii can only be silent there was a great dinner party but the general not thinking cecilia quite equal to it had engaged mrs holdernesse a relation of his own to do the honours of the day lady cecilia came into the drawingroom in the evening but after paying her compliments to the company she gladly followed the generals advice and retired to the musicroom helen went with her and beauclerc followed lady cecilia sat down to play at ecart with him and helen tuned her harp the general came in for a few minutes he said to escape from two young ladies who had talked him half dead about craniology he stood leaning on the mantelpiece and looking over the game lady cecilia wanted counters and she begged beauclerc to look for some which she believed he would find in the drawer of a table that was behind him beauclerc opened the drawer but no sooner had he done so than in admiration of something he discovered there he exclaimed beautiful beautiful and how like it was the miniature of helen and besides the miniature further back in the drawer lady cecilia sawhow quick is the eye of guilty fearcould it beyesone of the fatal lettersthe letter nothing but the picture had yet been seen by the general or by beauclerc lady cecilia stretched behind her husband whose eyes were upon the miniature and closed the drawer it was all she could do it was impossible for her to reach the letter beauclerc holding the picture to the light repeated beautiful who did it whom is it for general look do you know it yes to be sure replied the general miss stanley you have seen it before yes said the general coldly it is very like who did it i did it cried lady cecilia who now recovered her voice you my dear lady cecilia whom for for me is it for me for you it may be hereafter perhaps oh thank you my dear lady cecilia cried beauclerc if you behave well perhaps added she the general heard in his wifes tremulous tone and saw in her half confusion half attempt at playfulness only an amiable anxiety to save her friend and to give her time to recover from her dismay he at once perceived that helen had not followed the course he had suggested that she had not told beauclerc and did not intend that he should be told the whole truth the general looked extremely grave beauclerc gave a glance round the room here is some mystery said he now first seeing helens disconcerted countenance then he turned on the general a look of eager inquiry some mystery certainly said he with which i am not to be made acquainted if there be any mystery said the general with which you are not to be made acquainted i am neither the adviser nor abettor neither in jest nor earnest am i ever an adviser of mystery while her husband thus spoke lady cecilia made another attempt to possess herself of the letter this time she rose decidedly and putting aside the little ecart table which was in her way pressed forward to the drawer saying something about counters her cachemere caught on helens harp and in her eager spring forward it would have been overset but that the general felt turned and caught it what are you about my dear ceciliawhat do you want nothing nothing thank you my dear nothing now then she did not dare to open the drawer or to let him open it and anxiously drew away his attention by pointing to a footstool which she seemed to want could not you ask me for it my dear without disturbing yourself what are men made for beauclerc after a sort of absent effort to join in quest of the footstool had returned eagerly to the picture and looking at it more closely he saw the letters cd written in small characters in one corner and just as his eye turned to the other corner lady cecilia recollecting what initials were there started up and snatched it from his hand oh granville cried she you must not look at this picture any more till i have done something to it beauclerc was trying to catch another look at it when cecilia cried out take it helen take it and she held it up on high but as she held it though she turned the face from him she forgot quite forgot that colonel daubigny had written his name on the back of the picture and there it was in distinct characters such as could be plainly read at that height for henry daubigny beauclerc saw and gave one glance at helen he made no further attempt to reach the picture lady cecilia not aware of what he had seen repeated helen helen why dont you take itnow now helen could not stir the general took the picture from his wifes hand gave it to miss stanley without looking at her and said to lady cecilia pray keep yourself quiet cecilia you have done enough too much today sit down said he rolling her armchair close and seating her keep yourself quiet i begi beg in the tone of i insist she sat down but catching a view of beauclerc was alarmed by his aspectand helen her head was bent down behind the harp lady cecilia did not know yet distinctly what had happened the general pressed her to lean back on the cushions which he was piling up behind her beauclerc made a step towards helen but checking himself he turned to the ecart table those counters after all that we were looking for as he spoke he pulled open the drawer the general with his back to him was standing before lady cecilia she could not see what beauclerc was doing but she heard the drawer open and cried out not there beauclerc no counters thereyou need not look there but before she spoke he had given a sudden pull to the drawer which brought it quite out and all the contents fell upon the floor and there was the fatal letter open and the words my dear too dear henry instantly met his eyes he looked no farther but in that single glance the writing seemed to him to be lady cecilias and quick his eye turned upon her she kept perfectly quiet and appeared to him perfectly composed his eye then darted in search of helen she had sunk upon a seat behind the harp through the harpstrings he caught a glimpse of her face all palecrimsoned it grew as he advanced she rose instantly took up the letter and without speaking or looking at any one tore it to pieces beauclerc in motionless astonishment lady cecilia breathed again the generals countenance expressed i interfere no farther he left the room and beauclerc without another look at helen followed him for some moments after lady cecilia and helen were left alone there was a dead silence lady cecilia sat with her eyes fixed upon the door through which her husband and beauclerc had passed she thought that beauclerc might return but when she found that he did not she went to helen who had covered her face with her hands my dearest friend said lady cecilia thank you thank youyou did the best that was possible o cecilia exclaimed helen to what have you exposed me how did it all happen continued cecilia why was not that letter burnt with the rest how came it there can you tell me i do not know said helen i cannot recollect but after some effort she remembered that in the morning while the general had been talking to her she had in her confusion when she took the packet laid the picture and that letter beside her on the arm of the chair she had in her hurry of putting the other letters into her bag forgotten this and the picture and she supposed that they had fallen between the chair and the wall and that they had been found and put into the tabledrawer by one of the servants helen was hastening out of the room cecilia detained her do not go my dear for that would look as if you were guilty and you know you are innocent at the first sound of your harp beauclerc will returnonly command yourself for one hour or two yes it will only be for an hour or two said helen brightening with hope you will tell the general tonight do you think granville will come back where is the harp keyi dropped ithere it is she began to tune the harp crack went one stringthen another that is lucky said lady cecilia it will give you something to do my love if the people come in the aidedecamp entered i thought i heard harpstrings going said he severalyes said lady cecilia standing full in his way inauspicious sounds for us had omens for my embassymrs holdernesse sent me i know said lady cecilia and you will have the goodness to tell her that miss stanleys harp is unstrung can i be of any use miss stanley said he moving towards the harp no no cried lady cecilia you are in my serviceattend to me dear me lady cecilia i did not hear what you said that is what i complain ofhear me now i am all attention i am sure what are your commands she gave him as many as his head could hold a long message to mrs holdernesse and to miss holdernesse and miss anna about their musicbooks which had been left in the carriage and were to be sent for and duets to be played and glees for the major and lady anne ruthven good heavens i cannot remember any more cried the aidedecamp then go off and say and do all that before you come back again said lady cecilia what amazing presence of mind you have said helen how can you say so much and think of every thing the aidedecamp performed all her behests to admiration and was rewarded by promotion to the high office of turnerover general of the leaves of the music books an office requiring as her ladyship remarked to miss holdernesse prompt eye and ear and all his distinguished gallantry by such compliments she fixed him to the pianoforte while his curiosity and all his feelings being subordinate to his vanity were prevented from straying to miss stanley and her harpstringing a work still doingstill to do all the arrangement succeeded as lady cecilias arrangements usually did helen heard the eternal buzz of conversation and the clang of instruments and then the harmony of music all as in a dream or as at the theatre when the thoughts are absent or the feelings preoccupied and in this dreamy state she performed the operation of putting in the harpstrings quite well and when she was at last called upon by cecilia who gave her due notice and time she sat and played automatically without soul or spiritbut so do so many others it passed charmingly till a door softly opened behind her and she saw the shadow on the wall and some one stood and passed from behind her there was an end of her playing however from her just dread of making a scene she commanded herself so powerfully that except her timidity nothing was observed by the company and that timidity was pitied by the goodnatured mrs holdernesse who said to her daughter anne we must not press miss stanley any more she who is always so obliging is tired now she then made way for helen to pass who thanking her with such a look as might be given for a life saved quitted the harp and the crowd closing behind her happily thought of her no more she retreated to the darkest part of the room and sat down she did not dare to look towards what she most wished to see her eyes were fixed upon the face of the young lady singing and yet she saw not one feature of that face while she knew without looking or seeming to look exactly where beauclerc stood he had stationed himself in a doorway into the drawingroom there leaning back against the wall he stood and never stirred helen was so anxious to get one clear view of the expression of his countenance that at last she ventured to move a little and from behind the broad back of a great man she looked beauclercs eyes met hers how different from their expression when they were sitting on the bank together but a few short hours before he left the doorway instantly and placed himself where helen could see him no more of all the rest of what passed this evening she knew nothing she felt only a sort of astonishment at everybodys gaiety and a sense of the time being intolerably long she thought that all these people never would go awaythat their carriages never would be announced but before it came to that time general clarendon insisted upon lady cecilias retiring i must said he play the tyrant cecilia you have done too much todaymrs holdernesse shall hold your place he carried cecilia off and helen thought or fancied that he looked about for her glad to escape she followed close behind the general did not offer his arm or appear to notice her when she came to the door leading to the staircase there was beauclerc standing with folded arms as in the musicroom he just bowed his head and wished lady cecilia a good night and waited without a word for helen to pass or not to pass as she thought fit she saw by his look that he expected explanation but till she knew what cecilia meant to do how could she explain to say nothingto bear to be suspectedwas all she could do without betraying her friend that word betraythat thought ruled her she passed him good night she could not then say he bowed as she passed and she heard no good nightno sound and there was the general in the hall to be passed also before she could reach the staircase up which cecilia was going when he saw helen with a look of surpriseas it seemed to her of disapproving surprisehe said are you gone miss stanley the look the tone struck cold to her heart he continuedthough i drove cecilia away i did not mean to drive you away too it is early is it i thought it was very late noand if you can i hope you will return there was a meaning in his eye which she well understood thank you said she if i can certainly i hope you can and will oh thank you but i must first see cecilia she was going to say but afraid of implicating her she changed the sentence toi must first consider consider what the devil thought he and his countenance was instantly angrily suited to the thought helen hesitated do not let me detaindistress you farther miss stanley unavailingly and since i shall not have the pleasure of seeing you again this evening concluded he in a constrained voice i have the honour to wish you a good night he returned to the musicroom chapter ii helen instantly went to cecilias room felicie was with her helen expected lady cecilia would dismiss her instantly but mademoiselle was chattering helen had sometimes thought cecilia let her talk too much but tonight it was insufferable helen was too impatient too anxious to bear it cecilia my dear i want to speak to you alone as soon as you can in my own room as soon as possible cecilia answered in a voice not natural and she came but not as soon as possibleshut the door behind her showing that she had not dismissed felicie and with hair dishevelled as if hastening back to her room said i am in a hurry the general ordered me to make haste and not to be an hour undressing i will not keep you a moment said helen i am in as great a hurry as you can be beauclerc is waiting for me waiting for you at this time of night oh my dear he cannot be standing there with his arms folded all this time helen repeated what the general had said and ended with i am determined to return no no lady cecilia said the general could not advise her going back at this time of night and with rapidity and confusion she poured out a multitude of dissuasive arguments some contradicting the others at this time of night the world is not gone and beauclerc is in the midst of them by this time you may be sure you dont think he is standing alone there all this time you could not speak to him before all the worlddont attempt it you would only expose yourself you would make a scene at lastundo all and come to disgrace and ruin me and yourself i know you would helen and if you were to send for himinto the libraryalone the servants would know itand the company gone and after all for you my dear to make the first advance to reconciliation if he is angryi dont think that would be quitedignified quite like you helen the general thinks it right and i am sure he would not advise any thing improperundignified it does not signify cecilia i am determinedi will go trembling she grew absolutely desperate from fear i am afraid you have forgot your promise cecilia you said that if i could bear it for one hour it would be over did you not promise me that if any difficulty came between me and she stopped short she had felt indignant but when she looked at cecilia and saw her tears she could not go on oh helen cried cecilia i do not ask you to pity me you cannot know what i sufferyou are innocentand i have done so wrong you cannot pity me i do i do cried helen from the bottom of my heart only trust me dear cecilia let me go down lady cecilia sprang between her and the door hear me hear me helen do not go tonight and cost what it willcost me what it may since it has come to this between you i will confess all this nighti will tell all to the general and clear you with him and with granville what more can you askwhat more can i do helen and will you go no no my dear cecilia since you promise me this i will not go now be satisfied then and restfor me there is no rest so saying cecilia slowly left the room helen could not sleep this was the second wretched night she had passed in that most miserable of all uncertaintywhether she was right or wrong in the morning to helens astonishment cecilias first words were about a dreamoh my dear helen i have had such a dream i do not usually mind dreams in the least but i must own to you that this has made an impression my dear i can hardly tell it i can scarcely bear to think of it i thought that clarendon and i were sitting together and my hand was on his shoulder and i had worked myself upi was just going to speak he was winding up his watch and i leaned forward to see his face better he looked upand it was not him it was colonel daubigny come to life the door opened clarendon appearedhis eyes were upon me but i do not know what came afterwards all was confusion and fighting and then i was with that nurse my mother recommended and an infant in her arms i was going to take the child when clarendon snatched it and threw it into the flames oh i awoke with a scream how glad you must have been said helen to awake and find it was only a dream but when i screamed continued cecilia clarendon started up and asked if i was in pain not of body i saidand thenoh helen then i thought i would begin not of body i said but of mind then i added i was thinking of helen and beauclerc clarendon said so was i but there is no use in thinking of it we can do no goodthen i said suppose clarendononly suppose that helen without saying any thing were to let this matter pass off with beauclercclarendon answered it would not pass off with beauclercbut said i i do not mean without any explanation at all only suppose that helen did not enter into any particulars do not you think clarendon that things would go on well enoughno he said decidedly nodo you mean said i that things would not go on at alli do not say not at all he answered but well they would not go on i am sure the general is right said helen then continued lady cecilia then i put the question differently i wanted to feel my way to try whether i could possibly venture upon my own confession consider it this way clarendon i said take it for granted that helen did somehow arrange that beauclerc were to be satisfied without any formal explanationformal said hei will not say formal said i but without a full explanation in short suppose that from mere timidity helen could not did not exactly tell him the whole before marriageput it off till afterwardsthen told him all candidly do you think clarendon that if you were in beauclercs place i quite stammered when i came to thisdo you think you could pardon or forgive or esteem or love i intended to end with but he interrupted me withi do not know very shortly and added i hope this is not what miss stanley intends to do oh what did you answer cried helen i said i did not know my dear helen it was the only thing i could say what would clarendon have thought after all my supposes if i had said any thing else he must have seen the truth and that he is not to see said helen and how false he must think me no no for i told him continued lady cecilia that i was sure you wished always to tell the whole truth about everything but that there might be circumstances where you really could not and where i knowing all the circumstances could not advise it he said cecilia i desire you will not advise or interfere any farther in this matter promise me cecilia he spoke sternly and i promised as fast as i could do nothing say nothing more about it he repeated and now after that could i go on helen no indeed i do not think you could my dear cecilia i really think you could not said helen much moved and do you forgive me my dear good but seeing helen change colour lady cecilia following her eye and looking out of the window started up exclaiming there is beauclerc i see him in my mothers walk i will go to him this minute yes i will trust himi will tell him all instantly helen caught hold of her and stopped her surprised cecilia said do not stop me i may never have the courage again if stopped now do not stop me helen i must cecilia general clarendon desired you not to interfere in the matter but this is not interfering only interposing to prevent mischief but cecilia continued helen eagerly another reason has just struck me i wish reasons would not strike you let me go oh helen it is for you and it is for you i speak cecilia said helen as fast as she could if you told beauclerc you never could afterwards tell the general it would be a new difficulty you know the general could never endure your having confessed this to any man but himselftrusted beauclerc rather than your husband cecilia stopped and stood silent my dear cecilia continued helen you must leave me to my own judgment now and breaking from cecilia she left the room she hurried out to meet beauclerc he stopped on seeing her and then came forward with an air of evident deliberation do you wish to speak to me miss stanley miss stanley cried helen is it come to this and without hearing me without hearing you helen was not i ready last night to hear you without hearing you have not you kept me in torture the worst of torturessuspense why did not you speak to me last night i could not why why i cannot tell you said she then i can tell you helen you can and will helen you could not speak to me till you had consultedarrangedsettled what was to be saidwhat not to be saidwhat toldwhat left untold between each half sentence he darted looks at her defying hers to contradictand she could not contradict by word or look you could not speak continued he passionately till you had well determined what was to be toldwhat left untold to me to me helen your confidingdevotedaccepted lover for i protest before heaven had i knelt at the altar with you helen stanley not more yours not more mine could i have deemed younot more secure of your love and truthyour truth for what is love without itnot more secure of perfect felicity could i have been on earth than i was when we two sat together but yesterday evening on that bank your wordsyour looksand still your looksbut what signify tearstears womens tears oh what is womanand what is man that believes in herweaker still hear mehear me hear youno helen do not now ask me to hear youdo not force me to hear youdo not debase do not sully that perfect image of truthdo not sink yourself helen from that height at which it was my entranced felicity to see you leave me one blessed one sacred illusion no cried he with increasing vehemence say nothing of all you have preparednot one arranged word conned over in your midnight and your morning consultations pointing back to the window of her dressingroom where he had seen her and lady cecilia you saw helen began yesam i blind think youi wish i were oh that i could be again the believing fond happy dupe i was but yesterday evening dupe repeated helen but pour out allall dear granville thinksaywhat you willreproachabuse me as you please it is a relieftake itfor i have none to give none cried he his tone suddenly changing no relief to givewhat have you nothing to sayno explanationwhy speak to me then at all to tell you so at onceto end your suspenseto tell you that i cannot explain the midnight consultation and the morning were not to prepare for you excuse or apology but to decide whether i could tell you the whole and since that cannot be i determined not to enter into any explanation i am glad that you do not wish to hear any answer me one question said hethat picturedid you give it to colonel daubigny no that is a question i can answer nohe stole it from cecilias portfolio ask me no more one question more no not one morei cannot tell you anything more she was silent for a moment he withdrew his eyes and she went on granville i must now put your love and esteem for me to the test if that love be what i believe it to be if your confidence in me is what i think it ought to be i am now going to try it there is a mystery which i cannot explain i tell you this and yet i expect you to believe that i am innocent of anything wrong but the concealment there are circumstances which i cannot tell you but why interrupted beauclercought there to be any circumstances which cannot be told to the man to whom you have plighted your faith away with this cannotthis mystery did not i tell you every folly of my lifeevery fault and what is thisin itself nothingconcealment everythingoh helen she was going to say if it concerned only myselfbut that would at once betray cecilia and she went onif it were in my opinion right to tell it to you i would on this point granville leave me to judge and act for myself this is the test to which i put your loveput mine to any test you will but if your confidence in me is not sufficient to endure this trial we can never be happy together she spoke very low but beauclerc listened with such intensity that he could not only distinguish every syllable she said but could distinctly hear the beating of her heart which throbbed violently in spite of all her efforts to be calm can you trust me concluded she i can cried he i cani do by heaven i do i think you an angel and legions of devils could not convince me of the contrary i trust your wordi trust that heavenly countenancei trust entirely he offered and she took his offered hand i trust entirely not one question more shall i asknot a suspicion shall i have you put me to the test you shall find me stand it can you said she you know how much i ask i acknowledge a mystery and yet i ask you to believe that i am not wrong i know said she you shall see and both in happiness once more they returned to the house i love her a thousand times better than ever thought beauclerc for the independence of mind she shows in thus braving my opinion daring to set all upon the castsomething noble in this i am to form my own judgment of her and i will independently of what any other human being may say or think the general with his strict narrow conventional notions has not an idea of the kind of woman i like or of what helen really is he sees in helen only the discreet properbehaved young lady adapted so nicely adapted to her place in society to nitch and notch in and to be of no sort of value out of it give me a being able to stand alone to think and feel decide and act for herself were helen only what the general thinks her she would not be for me while she is what i think her i lovei adore and when he saw his guardian beauclerc declared that though helen had entered into no explanations he was perfectly satisfied the general answered i am glad you are satisfied beauclerc perceived that the general was not and in spite of all that he had just been saying to himself this provoked and disgusted him his theory of his own mind if not quite false was still a little at variance with his practice his guardians opinion swayed him powerfully whenever he believed that it was not designed to influence him when the opinion was repressed he could not rest without drawing it out then you think general said he that some explanation ought to have been made no matter what i think granville the affair is yours if you are satisfied that is all that is necessary then even because left on their own point of suspension to vibrate freely the diamondscales of beauclercs mind began to move from some nice unseen cause of variation but said he general clarendon no one can judge without knowing facts so i apprehend said the general i may be of too easy faith replied beauclercno reply this is a point of honourno denial my dear general if there be anything which weighs with you and which you know and i do not i think as my friend and my guardian you ought to tell it to me pardon me said the general turning away from beauclerc as he spoke and striking first one heel of his boot against the scraper at the halldoor then the otherpardon me granville i cannot admit you to be a better judge than i am myself of what i ought to do or not to do the tone was dry and proud but beauclercs provoked imagination conceived it to be also mysterious the scales of his mind vibrated again but he had said he would trusttrust entirely and he would yet he could not succeed in banishing all doubt till an idea started into his headthat writing was lady cecilias i thought so at the first moment and i let it go again it is hers and helen is keeping her secretbut could lady cecilia be so ungenerousso treacherous however he had declared he would ask no questions he was a man of honour and he would ask nonenone even of himselfa resolution which he found it surprisingly easy to keep when the doubt concerned only lady cecilia whenever the thought crossed his mind he said to himself i will ask nothingsuspect nobody but if it is lady cecilias affair it is all the more generous in helen and so secure in this explanation though he never allowed to himself that he admitted it his trust in helen was easy and complete and his passion for her increased every hour but lady cecilia was disturbed even by the perfect confidence and happiness of beauclercs manner towards helen she could not but fear that he had guessed the truth and it seemed as if everything which happened tended to confirm him in his suspicions for whenever the mind is strongly interested on any subject something alluding to it seems wonderfully yet accidentally to occur in everything that we read or hear in common conversation and so it now happened things were continually said by persons wholly unconcerned which seemed to bear upon her secret lady cecilia frequently felt this with pangs of confusion shame and remorse and though beauclerc did not watch or play the spy upon her countenance he could not help sometimes observing the flitting colourthe guilty changes of countenancethe assumed composure that mind once so artless began to be degradedher spirits sank she felt that she had lost the sunshine of a soul without a mystery the day fixed for the marriage approached lady cecilia had undertaken the superintendence of the trousseau and felicie was in anxious expectation of its arrival helen had written to the collingwoods to announce the intended event asking for the good bishops sanction as her guardian and regretting that he could not perform the ceremony she had received from lady davenant a few lines written just before she sailed warm with all the enthusiasm of her ardent heart and full of expectation that helens lot would be one of the happiest this world could afford all seemed indeed to smile upon her prospects and the only clouds which dimmed the sunshine were cecilias insincerity and her feeling that the general thought her acting unhandsomely and unwisely towards his ward but she consoled herself with the thought that he could not judge of what he did not know that she did not deserve his displeasure that granville was satisfied and if he was why should not general clarendon be so too much more serious however was the pain she felt on cecilias account she reproached herself with betraying the trust lady davenant had reposed in her that dreadful prophecy seemed now accomplishing cecilias natural generosity that for which helen had ever most loved and admired her the brightest fairest parts of her character seemed failing now what could be more selfish than cecilias present conduct towards herself more treacherous to her noble minded her confiding husband the openness the perfect unreserve between the two friends was no longer what it had been helen however felt the constraint between them the less as she was almost constantly with beauclerc and in her young happiness she hoped all would be right cecilia would tell the general and they would be as intimate as affectionate as they had ever been one morning general clarendon stopping cecilia as she was coming down to breakfast announced that he was obliged to set off instantly for london on business which could not be delayed and that she must settle with miss stanley whether they would accompany him or remain at clarendon park he did not know he said how long he might be detained cecilia was astonished and excessively curious she tried her utmost address to discover what was the nature of his business in vain all that remained was to do as he required without more words he left the room and cecilia decided at once that they had better accompany him she dreaded some delay she thought that if the general went alone to town he might be detained heaven knows how long and though the marriage must be postponed at all events yet if they went with the general the ceremony might be performed in town as well as at clarendon park and she with some difficulty convinced helen of this beauclerc feared nothing but delay they were to go lady cecilia announced their decision to the general who immediately set off and the others in a few hours followed him chapter iii in my youth and through the prime of manhood i never entered london without feelings of hope and pleasure it was to me the grand theatre of intellectual activity the field for every species of enterprise and exertion the metropolis of the world of business thought and action there i was sure to find friends and companions to hear the voice of encouragement and praise there society of the most refined sort offered daily its banquets to the mind and new objects of interest and ambition were constantly exciting attention either in politics literature or science these feelings so well described by a man of genius have probably been felt more or less by most young men who have within them any consciousness of talent or any of that enthusiasm that eager desire to have or to give sympathy which especially in youth characterises noble natures but after even one or two seasons in a great metropolis these feelings often change long before they are altered by age granville beauclerc had already persuaded himself that he now detested as much as he had at first been delighted with a london life from his metaphysical habits of mind and from the sensibility of his temper he had been too soon disgusted by that sort of general politeness which as he said takes up the time and place of real friendship and as for the intellectual pleasures they were he said too superficial for him and his notions of independence too were at this time quite incompatible with the conventional life of a great capital his present wish was to live all the year round in the country with the woman he loved and in the society of a few chosen friends helen quite agreed with him in his taste for the country she had scarcely ever known any other life and yet had always been happy and whatever youthful curiosity had been awakened in her mind as to the pleasures of london had been now absorbed by stronger and more tender feelings her fate in life she felt was fixed and wherever the man she loved wished to reside that she felt must be her choice with these feelings they arrived at general clarendons delightful house in town helens apartment and cecilias were on different floors and had no communication with each other it was of little consequence as their stay in town was to be but short yet helen could not help observing that cecilia did not express any regret at it as formerly she would have done it seemed a symptom of declining affection of which every the slightest indication was marked and keenly felt by helen the more so because she had anticipated that such must be the consequence of all that had passed between them and there was now no remedy among the first morning visitors admitted were lady castlefort and lady katrine hawksby they did not as it struck cecilia seem surprised to see that miss stanley was miss stanley still though the day for the marriage had been announced in all the papers as fixed but they did seem now full of curiosity to know how it had come to pass and there was rather too apparent a hope that something was going wrong their first inquisitive look was met by lady cecilias careless glance in reply which said better than words could express nothing the matter do not flatter yourselves then her expertness at general answers which give no information completely baffled the two curious impertinents they could only learn that the day for the marriage was not fixed that it could not be definitively named till some business should be settled by the general law business they supposed of course lady cecilia knew nothing about it lawyers are such provoking wretches with their fast bind fast find such an unconscionable length of time as they do take for their parchment doings heeding nought of that little impatient flapper cupid certain that lady cecilia was only playing with their curiosity yet unable to circumvent her lady katrine changed the conversation and lady castlefort preferred a prayer which was she said the chief object of her visit that lady cecilia and miss stanley would come to her on monday she was to have a few friendsa very small party and independently of the pleasure she should have in seeing them it would be advantageous perhaps to miss stanley as lady castlefort in her softest voice added for from the marriage being postponed even for a few days people might talk and mr beauclerc and miss stanley appearing together would prevent anybodys thinking there was any littlenothing so proper now as for a young lady to appear with her futur so i shall expect you my dear cecilia and miss stanleyand so saying she departed helens objections were all overruled and when the engagement was made known to beauclerc he shrugged and shrank and submitted observing that all men and all women must from the moment they come within the precincts of london life give up their time and their will to an imaginary necessity of going when we do not like it where we do not wish to see those whom we have no desire to see and who do not care if they were never to see us again except for the sake of their own reputation of playing well their own parts in the grand farce of mock civility helen was sorry to have joined in making an engagement for him which he seemed so much to dislike but lady cecilia laughing maintained that half his reluctance was affectation and the other half a loverlike spirit of monopoly in which he should not be indulged and instead of pretending to be indifferent to what the world might think he ought to be proud to show helen as a proof of his taste in dressing helen this night felicie excited by her ladys exhortations displayed her utmost skill mademoiselle felicie had a certain petite mtaphysique de toilette of which she was justly vain she could talk and as much to the purpose as most people of le genre classique and le genre romantique of the different styles of dress that suit different styles of face and while she worked and wondered at the work she made she threw out from time to time her ideas on the subject to form the taste of helens little maid rose who in mute attention held the light and assiduously presented pins not your pin so fast one after de other miss rosetenez tenez cried mademoiselle you tink in england alway too much of your pin in your dress too little of our tastetoo little of our elegance too much of your what you call tidiness or god know what but never you mind dat so much miss rose and you not prim up your little mouth but listen to me never you put in one pin before you ask yourself miss rose what for i do it in every toilette that has taste there is above allteneza charactera sentiment to be support suppose your lady is to be superbe or she will rather be lgante or charmante or intressante or distinguewell dat is all ver well and you dress to that ide one or oderwell very wellbut none of your wat you call odd no no never miss rosedat is not style noble twill only become de petit minois of your english originale i wash my hand of dat always the toilette superbe mademoiselle held to be the easiest of all those which she had named with favour it may be accomplished by any common hands but head is requisite to reach the toilette distingue the toilette superbe requires only costa toilette distingue demands care there was a happiness as well as care in felicies genius for dress which ever keeping the height of fashion in view never lost sight of nature adapting selecting combining to form a perfect whole in which art itself concealed appeared only as she expressed it in the sublime of simplicity in the midst of all her talking however she went on with the essential business and as she finished pronounced prcepte commence exemple achve when they arrived at lady castleforts lady cecilia was surprised to find a line of carriages and noise and crowds of footmen how was this she had understood that it was to be one of those really small parties those select reunions of some few of the high and mighty families who chance to be in town before christmasbut how is this lady cecilia repeated to herself as she entered the hall amazed to find it blazing with light a crowd on the stairs and in the anteroom a crowd as she soon felt of an unusual sort it was not the soft crush of aristocracy they found hard unaccustomed citizen elbowsstrange roundshouldered squarebacked men and women so overdressed so bejewelled so coarseshocking to see impossible to avoid not one figure one face lady cecilia had ever seen before till at last from the midst of the throng emerged a fair forma being as it seemed of other mould certainly of different caste it was one of cecilias former intimateslady emily greville whom she had not seen since her return from abroad joyfully they met and stopped and talked she was hastening away lady emily said after having been an hour on duty lady castlefort had made it a point with her to stay after dinner she had dined there and had stayed and now guard was relieved but who are all these people what is all this my dear lady emily asked cecilia do not you know louisa has trapped you into coming then tonight without telling you how it is not a word did she tell me i expected to meet only our own world a very different world you perceive this a sort of farce this is to the double distress a comedyin short one of lord castleforts brothers is going to stand for the city and citizens and citoyennes must be propitiated when an election is in the case all other things give place and besides he has just married the daughter of some amazing merchant worth i dont know how many plums so le petit bossu who is proud of his brother for he is reckoned the genius of the family made it a point with louisa to do this she put up her eyebrows and stood out as long as she could but lord castlefort had his way for he holds the purse you knowand so she was forced to make a party for these goths and vandals and of course she thought it best to do it directly out of season you know when nobody will see itand she consulted me whether it should be large or small i advised a large party by all means as crowded as possible yes yes i understand said cecilia to hide the shame in the multitude vastly well very fair all this except the trapping us into it who have nothing to do with it nothing to do with it pardon me cried lady emily it could not have been done without us entrapping usdo not you understand that we are the baits to the traps bringing those animals here wild beasts or tame only to meet one another would have been doing business no how we are what they are come for to see or to have it to say that they have seen the exclusives exquisites or transcendentals or whatever else they call us lady emily grevilles carriage was now called in the anteroom i must go but first make me known to your friend miss stanley you see i know her by instinct but lady emily grevilles carriage now resounded reiteratedly and gentlemen with cloaks stood waiting and as she put hers on lady emily stooped forward and whispered i do not believe one word of what they say of her and she was off and lady cecilia stood for an instant looking after her and considering what she could mean by those last words concluding however that she had not heard aright or had missed some intervening name and that these words in short could not possibly apply to helen lady cecilia turned to her they resumed their way onward and at length they reached the grand receptionroom in the middle of that brilliantly lighted saloon immediately under the centre chandelier was ample verge and space enough reserved for the lite of the world circle it was not nor square nor form regularly defined yet the bounds were guarded there was no way of getting to the further end of the saloon or to the apartments open in the distance beyond it except by passing through this enclosed space in which one fair entrance was practicable and one ample exit full in view on the opposite side several gentlemen of fashionable bearing held the outposts of this privileged place at back of sofa or side of fauteuil stationary or wandering near some chosen few were within two caryatides gentlemen leaned one on each side of the fireplace and in the centre of the rug stood a remarkably handsome man of fine figure perfectly dressed his whole air exquisitely scornful excruciatingly miserable and loftily abstract twas wonderful twas strange twas passing strange how one so lost to all sublunary concerns so far above the follies of inferior mortals as he looked came hereso extremely welldressed too how happened it so nauseating the whole as he seemed so wishing that the business of the world were done with halfclosed dreamy eyelids he looked silent down upon two ladies who sat opposite to him rallying abusing and admiring him to his vanitys content they gave him his choice of three names lennuy le frondeur or le blas lennuy he shook his head too common he would have none of it le frondeur no too much trouble he shrugged his abhorrence le blas he allowed might be too true but would they hazard a substantive verb he would give them fourandtwenty hours to consider and he would take twentyfour himself to decide they should have his definitive tomorrow and he was sliding away but lady castlefort as he passed her cried going lord beltravers going are you in an accent of surprise and disappointment and she whispered i am hard at work here acting receiver general to these city worthies and you do not pity mecruel and she looked up with languishing eyes that so begged for sympathy he threw upon her one look of commiseration reproachful pity you yes but why will you do these things and why did you bring me here to do this horrid sort of work and he vanished lady cecilia clarendon and miss stanley now appeared in the offing and now reached the straits lady castlefort rose with vivacity extraordinary and went forward several steps dear cecilia miss stanley so good mr beauclerc so happy the general could not so sorry then with hand pressed on hers miss stanley so kind of you to come lady grace give me leavemiss stanleylady grace bland and in a whisper lord beltravers aunt lady grace with a haughty drawback motion and a supercilious arching of her brows was happy to have the honour honour nasally prolonged and some guttural sounds followed but further words if words they were which she syllabled between snuffling and mumbling were utterly unintelligible and helen without being very happy or happy at all only returned bend for bend lady cecilia then presented her to a group of sister graces standing near the sofas of mammas and chaperonsnot each a different grace but similar each indeed upon the very same identical pattern air of younglady fashionwellbred and apparently wellnatured no sooner was miss stanley made known to them by lady cecilia than smiling just enough not a muscle too much they moved the ranks opened softly but sufficiently and helen was in the group amongst them but not of themand of this she became immediately sensible though without knowing how or why one of these daughters had had expectations last season from having been frequently mr beauclercs partner and the mother was now fanning herself opposite to him but helen knew nought of this to her all was apparently soft smooth and smiling while whenever any of the unprivileged multitude the city monsters passed near this highborn highbred group they looked as though the rights of pride were infringed and smiling scorn they dropped from halfclosed lips such syllables of withering contempt as they thought these vulgar victims merited careless if they heard or not rather rejoicing to see the sufferers wince beneath the wounds which they inflicted in their pride and pomp of sway pride thought helen was it pride if pride it was how unlike what she had been taught to consider the proper pride of aristocracy how unlike that noble sort which she had seen admired and loved helen fancied what lady davenant would have thought how ignoble how mean how vulgar she would have considered these sneers and scoffs from the nobly to the lowly born how unworthy of their rank and station in society they who ought to be the first in courtesy because the first in place as these thoughts passed rapidly in helens mind she involuntarily looked towards beauclerc but she was so encompassed by her present companions that she could not discover him had she been able to see his countenance she would have read in it at once how exactly he was at that instant feeling with her more indignant than herself for his high chivalrous devotion to the fair could ill endure the readiness with which the gentlemen attendants at ottoman or sofa lent their aid to mock and to embarrass every passing party of the city tribe mothers and their hapless daughtertrain at this instant lady bearcroft who if she had not good breeding certainly had goodnature came up to beauclerc and whispered earnestly and with an expression of strong interest in her countenance as you love her do not heed one word you hear anybody say this night for its all on purpose to vex you and i am certain as you are its all falseall envy and there she goes envy herself in the black jaundice continued she looking at lady katrine hawksby who passed at that instant good heavens cried beauclerc what can no no interrupted lady bearcroft no no do not askbetter not best you should know no moreonly keep your temper whatever happens go you up the hill like the man in the tale and let the black stones bawl themselves hoarsedumb go you on and seize your pretty singing thinking birdthe sooner the better so fare you well and she disappeared in the crowd beauclerc to whom she was perfectly unknown though she had made him out totally at a loss to imagine what interest she could take in helen or in him or what she could possibly mean rather inclined to suppose she was a mad women and he forgot everything else as he saw helen with lady cecilia emerging from the bevy of young ladies and approaching him they stopped to speak to some acquaintance and he tried to look at helen as if he were an indifferent spectator and to fancy what he should think of her if he saw her now for the first time he thought that he should be struck not only with her beauty but with her graceful airher ingenuous countenance so expressive of the freshness of natural sensibility she was exquisitely well dressed too and that as felicie observed goes for much even with your most sensible men altogether he was charmed whether considering her as with the eyes of an unbiased stranger or with his own and all he heard confirmed and although he would not have allowed it strengthened his feelings he heard it said that though there were some as handsome women in the room there were none so interesting and some of the young men added as lovely as lady blanche but with more expression a citizen with whom beauclerc could have shaken hands on the spot said theres one of the highbreds now thats wellbred too in the height of the rapture of his feelings he overtook lady cecilia who telling him that they were going on to another room delivered helen to his care and herself taking the arm of some ready gentleman they proceeded as fast as they could through the crowd to the other end of the room this was the first time helen had ever seen lady cecilia in public where certainly she appeared to great advantage not thinking about herself but ever willing to be pleased so bright so gay she was sunshine which seemed to spread its beams wherever she turned and she had something to say to everybody or to answer quick to whatever they said or looked happy always in the propos of the moment little there might be perhaps in what she said but there was all that was wanted just what did for the occasion in others there often appeared a distress for something to say or a dead dullness of countenance opposite to you from others a too fast hazarded broadside of questions and answersglads and sorrys in chainshots that did no execution because there was no good aimcongratulations and condolences playing at cross purposesthese were mistakes misfortunes which could never occur in lady cecilias natural grace and acquired tact of manner helen was amused as she followed her in watching the readiness with which she knew how to exchange the necessary counters in the commerce of society she was amused till her attention was distracted by hearing as she and beauclerc passed the whispered wordsi promessi sposilookla belle fiance these words were repeated as they went on and lady cecilia heard some one say i thought it was broken off that was all slander then she recollected lady emilys words and terrified lest helen should hear more ofshe knew not what she began to talk to her as fast as she could while they were stopped in the doorway by a crowd she succeeded for the moment with helen she had not heard the last speech and she could not as long as lady cecilia spoke hear more but beauclerc again distinguished the words belle fiance and as he turned to discover the speaker a fat matron near him asked who is it and the daughter answered it is that handsome girl with the white rose in her hairhush said the brother on whose arm she leaned handsome is that handsome does handsome does thought beauclerc and the mysterious warning of his unknown friend recurred to him he was astonished alarmed furious but the whispering party had passed on and just then lady cecilia descrying mr churchill in the distance she made towards him conversation sure to be had in abundance from him he discerned them from afar and was happily prepared both with a ready bit of wit and with a proper greeting his meeting with lady cecilia was of course just the same as ever he took it up where he left off at clarendon park no difference no hiatus his bow to beauclerc and helen to helen and beauclerc joined in one little sweep of a congratulatory motion was incomparable it said everything that a bow could say and more it implied such a happy freedom from envy or jealousy such a polite acquiescence in the decrees of fate such a philosophic indifference such a cool sarcastic superiority to the event and he began to lady cecilia with one of his prepared impromptus at the instant your ladyship came up i am afraid i started actually in a trance i do believe methought i waswhere do you think in the temple of jaggernaut why said lady cecilia smiling methought continued horace that i was in the temple of jaggernautthat one strange day in the year when ill castes meet when all distinction of castes and ranks is forgottenthe abomination of mixing them all together permitted for their sins no doubthigh caste and low from the abandoned paria to the brahmin prince from their billingsgate and farringilon without suppose up to their st jamess street and grosvenor square mingle mingle ye who mingle may white spirits and grey black spirits and blue now pray look around is not this jaggernaut night with lady castlefort and you said lady cecilia are not you the great jaggernaut himself driving over all in your triumphant chariot of sarcasm and crushing all the victims in your way this took place with horace it put him in spirits in train and he fired away at lady castlefort whom he had been flattering loutrance five minutes before i so admire that acting of sacrifice in your belle cousine tonight pasta herself could not do it better there is a look of oh ye just gods what a victim am i and with those upturned eyes so charming well and seriously it is a sad sacrifice fathers have flinty hearts by parental prescription but husbandspetit bossus especiallyshould have mercy for their own sakes they should not strain their marital power too far but said lady cecilia it is curious that one born and bred such an ultra exclusive as louisa castlefort should be obliged after her marriage immediately to open her doors and turn ultra liberale or an universal suffragistall in consequence of these msalliances true true said churchill with a solemn pathetic shake of the head gentlemen and noblemen should consider before they make these low matches to save their studs or their souls or their entailed estates whatever be the necessity there can be no apology for outraging all biensance necessity has no law but it should have some decency think of bringing upon a foolish elder brotherbut we wont be personal no dont pray horace said lady cecilia moving on but think only think my dear lady cecilia think what it must be to be howdyedoed and to be dear sistered by such bodies as these in public sad sad said lady cecilia the old french nobility continued churchill used to call these low moneymatches mettre du fumier sur nos terres dirty work at best said lady cecilia but still said horace it might be done with decency if not with majesty but in the midst of all this said lady cecilia i want some ice very much for myself and for helen more i have a notion we shall find some here replied he if you will come on this wayin this sanctum sanctorum of lady katrines he led them on to a little inner apartment where as he said lady katrine hawksby and her set do always scandal take and sometimes teatea and punch continued he you know in london now is quite la franaise and it is astonishing to me who am but a man what strong punch ladies can take only when it is iced said lady cecilia smiling be it so said hevery refreshing ice and more refreshing scandal and here we have both in perfection scandal hot and hot and ice cold and cold by this time they had reached the entrance to what he called lady katrines sanctum sanctorum where she had gathered round the iced punch and teatable a select party whom she had drawn together with the promise of the other half of a halfpublished reporta report in which i promessi sposi and la belle fiance were implicated stop here one moment cried churchill one moment longer let us see before we are seen look in look in pray at this group lady katrine herself on the sofa finger upholding forth and the deaf old woman stretching forward to hear while the other with the untasted punch sits suspended in curiosity what can it be she says or seems to say now now see the pretty ones hands and eyes uplifted and the ugly one with that look of horror is exclaiming you dont say so my dear lady katrine admirable creatures cant and scandal personified i wish wilkie were hereworth any money to him and he should call it the scandal party said lady cecilia he told me he never could venture upon a subject unless he could give it a good name at this moment lady katrine having finished her story rose and awaking from the abstraction of malice she looked up and saw helen and lady cecilia and as she came forward churchill whispered between them nownow we are going comfortably to enjoy no doubt madame de sevigns pleasure de mal dire du prochain at the right hour too churchill left them there lady katrine welcoming her victimsher unsuspicious victimshe slid off to the friends round the teatable to learn from cant what scandal had been telling beauclerc was gone to inquire for the carriage the instant helen appeared all eyes were fixed upon her and belle fiance was murmured round and cecilia heardhes much to be pitied at this moment lord castlefort went up to helen she had always been a favourite of his he was grateful to her for her constant kindness to him and peevish though the little man might be he had a good heart and he showed it now by instantly taking helen out of the midst of the starers and begging her opinion upon a favourite picture of his a madonnawas it a raffaelle or was it not he and mr churchill he said were at issue about it in short no matter what he said it engrossed helens attention so that she could not hear any thing that passed and could not be seen by the starers and he detained her in conversation till beauclerc came to saythe carriage is ready lady cecilia is impatient lord castlefort opened a door that led at once to the staircase so that they had not to recross all the rooms but got out immediately the smallest service merits thanks and helen thanked lord castlefort by a look which he appreciated even in the few words which beauclerc had said as he announced the carriage she had perceived that he was agitated and as he attended her in silence down the stairs his look was grave and preoccupied she saw he was displeased and she thought he was displeased with her when he had put them into the carriage he wished them good night are not you coming with us cried lady cecilia no he thanked her he had rather walk and he addedi shall not see you at breakfasti am engaged home said lady cecilia drawing up the glass with a jerk helen looked out anxiously beauclerc had turned away but she caught one more glance of his face as the lamp flared upon itshe saw and she was sure thatsomething is very much the matteri am certain of it nonsense my dear helen said lady cecilia the matter is that he is tired to death as i am sure i am theres more than that said helen he is angryand she sighed now helen do not torment yourself about nothing said cecilia who not being sure whether beauclerc had heard anything had not looked at his countenance or remarked his tone her mind was occupied with what had passed while helen was looking at the madonna lady cecilia had tried to make out the meaning of these extraordinary starings and whisperingslady katrine would not tell her any thing distinctly but said strange reportsso sorry it had got into the papers those vile libellous papers of course she did not believeof miss stanley after all nothing very bada little awkward onlymight be hushed up better not talk of it tonight but i will try cecilia in the morning to find those paragraphs for you lady cecilia determined to go as early as possible in the morning and make out the whole and had she plainly told this to helen it would have been better for all parties but she continued to talk of the people they had seen to hide her thoughts from helen who all the time felt as in a feverish dream watching the lights of the carriage flit by like fiery eyes while she thought only of the strange words she had heard and why they should have made beauclerc angry with her at last they were at home as they went in lady cecilia inquired if the general had come inyes he had been at home for some time and was in bed this was a relief helen was glad not to see any one or to be obliged to say anything more that night lady cecilia bade her be a good child and go to sleep how much helen slept may be left to the judgment of those who have any imagination chapter iv miladi a une migranie affreuse this morning said felicie addressing herself on the stairs to rose mille amitis de sa part to your young lady miss rose and miladi recommend to her to follow a good example and to take her breakfast in her bed and then to take one good sleep till you shall hear midi sonn miss stanley however was up and dressed at the time when this message was brought to her and a few minutes afterwards a footman came to the door to give notice that the general was in the breakfastroom waiting to know whether miss stanley was coming down or not the idea of a ttetet breakfast with him was not now quite so agreeable as it would have been to her formerly but she went down the general was standing with his back to the fire newspapers hanging from his hand his look ominously grave after good mornings had been exchanged with awful solemnity helen ventured to hope that there was no bad public news no public news whatever said the general next she was sorry to hear that cecilia had such a bad headache tired last night said the general it was indeed a tiresome disagreeable party said helen hoping this would lead to how so or why but the general drily answered not the london season and went on eating his breakfast in silence such a constraint and awe came upon her that she felt it would be taking too great a liberty in his present mood to put sugar and cream into his tea as she was wont in happier times she set sugarbowl and cream before him and whether he understood or noticed not her feelings she could not guess he sugared and creamed and drank and thought and spoke not helen put out of his way a supernumerary cup to which he had already given a push and she said mr beauclerc does not breakfast with us so i suppose said the general as he is not here he said he was engaged to breakfast with some of his friends i suppose said the general there the dialogue came to a full stop and breakfast uncomfortably on her part and with a preoccupied air on his went on in absolute silence at length the general signified to the servant who was in waiting by a nod and a look towards the door that his further attendance was dispensed with at another time helen would have felt such a dismissal as a relief for she disliked and recollected that her uncle particularly disliked the fashion of having servants waiting at a family breakfast which he justly deemed unsuited to our good old english domestic habits but somehow it happened that at this moment she was rather sorry when the servant left the room he returned however in a moment with something which he fancied to be yet wanting the general after glancing at whatever he had brought said that will do cockburn we want nothing more cockburn placed a screen between him and the fire the general put it aside and looking at him said sternlycockburn no intelligence must ever go from my house to any newspapers cockburn bowednone shall sir if i can prevent it none ever did from me general none must ever go from anyone in my familylook to it cockburn bowed again respectfully but with a look of reservation of right of remonstrance answered by a look from his master of no more must be said yet cockburn was a favourite he had lived in the family from the time he was a boy he moved hastily towards the door and having turned the handle rested upon it and said general i cannot answer for others then cockburn i must find somebody who can cockburn disappeared but after closing the door the veteran opened it again stood and said stoutly though seemingly with some impediment in his throatgeneral clarendon do me the justice to give me full powers whatever you require say such are your orders from me and that you have full power to dismiss whoever disobeys cockburn bowed and withdrew satisfied another silence when the general hastily finishing his breakfast took up the newspaper and said i wished to have spared you the pain of seeing these miss stanley but it must be done now there have appeared in certain papers paragraphs alluding to beauclerc and to you these scandalous papers i never allow to enter my house but i was informed that there were such paragraphs and i was obliged to examine into them i am sorry to find that they have some of them been copied into my paper today he laid the newspaper before her the first words which struck her eye were the dreaded whispers of last night the paragraph was as follows in a few days will be published the memoirs of the late colonel d comprising anecdotes and original loveletters which will explain the mysterious allusions lately made in certain papers to la belle fiance and i promessi sposi what exclaimed helen the letters published the general had turned from her as she read and had gone to his writingdesk which was at the furthest end of the room he unlocked it and took from it a small volume and turning over the leaves as he slowly approached helen he folded down some pages laid the volume on the table before her and then said before you look into these scandalous memoirs miss stanley let me assure you that nothing but the necessity of being empowered by you to say what is truth and what is falsehood could determine me to give you this shock she was scarcely able to put forward her hand yet took the book opened it looked at it saw letters which she knew could not be cecilias but turning another leaf she pushed it from her with horror it was the letterbeginning with my deartoo dear henry in print cried she in print published not published yet that i hope to be able to prevent said the general whether she heard whether she could hear him he was not certain her head was bent down her hands clasping her forehead he waited some minutes then sitting down beside her with a voice of gentleness and of commiseration yet of steady determination he went oni must speak and you must hear me helen for your own sake and for beauclercs sake speak cried she i hear hear then the words of a friend who will be true to you through lifethrough life and death if you will be but true to yourself helen stanleya friend who loves you as he loves beauclerc but he must do more he must esteem you as he esteems beauclerc incapable of any thing that is false helen listened with her breath suspended not a word in reply then i ask she put her hand upon his arm as if to stop him she had a foreboding that he was going to ask something that she could not without betraying cecilia answer if you are not yet sufficiently collected i will wait take your own timemy question is simplei ask you to tell me whether all these letters are yours or not no cried helen these letters are not mine not all said the general this first one i know to be yours because i saw it in your handwriting but i am certain all cannot be yours now will you show me which are and which are not i will take them to my own room and consider and examine why not look at them here miss stanley she wanted to see cecilia she knew she could never answer the question without consulting her but that she could not say still she had no other resource so conquering her trembling she rose and said i would rather go to not to cecilia said he to that i object what can cecilia do for you what can she advise but what i advise that the plain truth should be told if i could o if i could cried helen what can you mean pardon me miss stanley but surely you can tell the plain fact you can recollect what you have writtenat least you can know what you have not written you have not yet even looked beyond a few of the letterspray be composedbe yourself this business it was that brought me to town i was warned by that young lady that poetess of mr churchills whom you made your friend by some kindness at clarendon parki was warned that there was a book to come out these memoirs of colonel daubigny which would contain letters said to be yours a publication that would be highly injurious to you i need not enter into details of the measures i consequently took but i ascertained that sir thomas daubigny the elder brother of the colonel knows nothing more of the matter than that he gave a manuscript of his brothers which he had never read to be published the rest is a miserable intrigue between booksellers and literary manufacturers i know not whom i have not been able to get to the bottom of it sufficient for my present purpose i know and must tell you you have enemies who evidently desire to destroy your reputation of course to break your marriage for this purpose the slanderous press has been set at work the gossiping part of the public has had its vile curiosity excited the publication of this book is expected in a few days this is the only copy yet completed i believe and this i could not get from the bookseller till this morning i am now going to have every other copy destroyed directly oh my dear dear friend how can i thank you her tears gushed forth thank me not by words helen but by actions no tears summon your soulbe yourself o if i could but retrieve one false stepshe suddenly checked herself he stood aghast for an instant then recovering himself as he looked upon her and marked the nature of her emotion he said there can be no false step that you could ever have taken that cannot be retrieved there can have been nothing that is irretrievable except falsehood falsehood no cried she i will not say what is falsetherefore i will not say anything then since you cannot speak continued the general will you trust me with the letters themselves have you brought them to town with you the original letters yes those in the packet which i gave to you at clarendon park they are burned allone this first letter i saw you tear did you burn all the rest they are burned repeated she colouring all over she could not say i burned them he thought it a poor evasion they are burned continued he that is you burned them unfortunate i must then recur to my first appeal take this pencil and mark i pray you the passages that are yours i may be called on to prove the forgery of these passages if you do not show me and truly which are yours and which are not how can i answer for you helen one hour said helenonly leave me for one hour and it shall be done why this cowardly delay i ask only one houronly leave me for one hour i obey miss stanley since it must be so i am gone he went and helen felt how sunk she was in his opinionsunk for ever she feared but she could not think distinctly her mind was stunned she felt that she must wait for somebody but did not at first recollect clearly that it was for cecilia she leaned back on the sofa and sank into a sort of dreamy state how long she remained thus unconscious she knew not but she was roused at last by the sound as she fancied of a carriage stopping at the door she started up but it was gone or it had not been she perceived that the breakfast things had been removed and turning her eyes upon the clock she was surprised to see how late it was she snatched up the pages which she hated to touch and ran upstairs to cecilias roomdoor boltedshe gave a hasty tapno answer another louder no answer she ran into the dressingroom for felicie who came with a face of mystery and the smile triumphant of one who knows what is not to be known but the smile vanished on seeing miss stanleys face bon dieu miss stanleyhow pale mais quest ce que cest mon dieu quest ce que cest donc is lady cecilias door bolted within side said helen no only lock by me said mademoiselle felicie miladi charge me not to tell you she was not dere and i had de presentiment you might go up to look for her in her room her head is got better quite she is all up and dress she is gone out in the carriage and will soon be back no doubt i know not to where she go but in my opinion to my lady katrine if you please you not mention i say dat as miladi charge me not to speak of dis to you apparemment quelque petit mystre poor helen felt as if her last hope was gone and now in a contrary extreme from the dreamy torpor in which she had been before she was seized with a nervous impatience for the arrival of cecilia though whether to hope or fear from it she did not distinctly know she went to the drawingroom and listened and listened and watched and watched and looked at the clock and felt a still increasing dread that the general might return before lady cecilia and that she should not have accomplished her promise she became more and more impatient as it grew later the rolling of carriages increased and their noise grew louder and continually as they came near she expected that one would stop at the door she expected and expected and feared and grew sick with fear long deferred at last one carriage did stop and then came a thundering knocklouder she thought than usual but before she could decide whether it was cecilia or not the roomdoor opened and the servant had scarcely time to say that two ladies who did not give their names had insisted upon being let upwhen the two ladies entered one in the extreme of foreign fashion but an englishwoman of assured and not prepossessing appearance the other half hid behind her companion and all timidity struck helen as the most beautiful creature she had ever beheld a thousand pardons for forcing your doors said the foremost lady but i bear my apology in my hand a precious little box of roman cameos from a friend of lady cecilia clarendons which i was desired to deliver myself helen was of course sorry that lady cecilia was not at home i presume i have the honour of speaking to miss stanley continued the assured lady and she gave her card comtesse de st cymon then halfturning to the beauty who now became visibleallow me to mentionlady blanche forrester at that name helen did not start but she felt as if she had received an electric shock how she went through the necessary forms of civility she knew not but even in the agony of passion the little habits of life hold their sway the customary motions were made and words pronounced yet when helen looked at that beautiful lady blanche and saw how beautiful there came a spasm at her heart the comtesse in answer to her look towards a chair did not choose to sit downcould not staywould not intrude on miss stanley so they stood helen supporting herself as best she could and preserving apparently perfect composure seeming to listen to what farther madame de st cymon was saying but only the sounds reached her ear and a general notion that she spoke of the box in her hand she gave helen some message to lady cecilia explanatory of her waiting or not waiting upon her ladyship to all which helen answered with proper signs of civility and while the comtesse was going on she longed to look again at lady blanche but dared not she saw a half curtsey and a receding motion and she knew they were going and she curtsied mechanically she felt inexpressible relief when madame de st cymon turned her back and moved towards the door then helen looked again at lady blanche and saw again her surpassing beauty and perfect tranquillity the tranquillity gave her courage it passed instantaneously into herself through her whole existence the comtesse stopped in her way out to look at a china table ha beautiful svreenamelby jaquetot is it not helen was able to go forward and answer to all the questions asked not one word from the lady blanche but she wished to hear the sound of her voice she triedshe spoke to her but to whatever helen said no answer came but the sweetest of smiles the comtesse with easy assurance and impertinent illbreeding looked at all that lay in her way and took up and opened the miniature pictures that were on the table lady cecilia clarendoncharmingblanche you never saw her yet quite charming is it not not a word from lady blanche but a smile a guido smile another miniature taken up by the curious comtesse ah very like indeed not flattered though do you know it blancheeh it was beauclerc lady blanche then murmured some few words indistinctly in a very sweet voice but showed no indication of feeling except as helen gave one glance she thought she saw a slight colour like the inside of a shell delicately beautiful but it might be only the reflection from the crimson silk curtain near which she stood it was gone and the picture put down and in a lively tone from the comtesse au revoir and exit a graceful bend from the silent beauty and the vision vanished helen stood for some moments fixed to the spot where they left her she questioned her inmost thoughts why was i struck so much so strangely with that beautyso painfully it cannot be envy i never was envious of any one though so many i have seen so much handsomer than myself jealousy surely not for there is no reason for itno possibility of danger yet now alas when he has so much cause to doubt me perhaps he might change he seemed so displeased last night and he has never been here all the morning she recollected the look and accent of madame de st cymon as she said the words au revoir helen did not like the words or the look she did not like anything about madame de st cymon something so assured so impertinent and all that unintelligible message about those cameosa mere excuse for making this unseasonable pushing visitjust pushing for the acquaintance the general will never permit it thoughthat is one comfort but why do i say comfort back went the circle of her thoughts to the same pointwhat can i dothe general will return he will find i have not obeyed him but what can be done till cecilia returns if she were but here i could markwe could settle o cecilia where are you but thought she i had better look at the whole i will have courage to read these horrible letters to prevent all hazard of further interruption she now went into an inner room bolted the doors and sat down to her dreaded task and there we leave her chapter v that fortune is not nice in her morality that she frequently favours those who do not adhere to truth more than those who do we have early had occasion to observe but whether fortune may not be in this as in all the rest treacherous and capricious whether she may not by her first smiles and favours lure her victims on to their cost to their utter undoing at last remains to be seen it is time to inquire what has become of lady cecilia clarendon before we follow her on her very early morning visit to her cousins we must take leave to pause one moment to remark not in the way of moralising by any means but simply as a matter of history that the first little fib in which lady cecilia as a customary licence of speech indulged herself the moment she awoke this morning though it seemed to answer its purpose exactly at the time occasioned her ladyship a good deal of superfluous toil and trouble during the course of the day in reply to the first question her husband had asked or in evasion of that question she had answered my dear love dont ask me any questions for i have such a horrid headache that i really can hardly speak now a headache such as she had at that moment certainly never silenced any woman slighter could not bescarce enough to swear by there seemed no great temptation to prevarication either for the generals question was not of a formidable nature not what the lawyers call a leading question rather one that led to nothing it was only had you a pleasant party at lady castleforts last night my dear cecilia but with that prescience with which some nicely foresee how the truth seemingly most innocent may do harm her ladyship foreboded that if she answered straight forwardnothat might lead towhy how or whereforeand this might bring out the history of the strange rude manner in which la belle fiance had been received that need not necessarily have followed but even if it had it would have done her no harmrather would have served at once her purpose in the best manner possible as time will show her husband unsuspicious man asked no more questions and only gave her the very advice she wished him to give that she should not get up to breakfastthat she should rest as long as she could farther as if to forward her schemes even without knowing them he left the house early and her headache conveniently going off she was dressed with all despatchcarriage at the door as soon as husband out of sight and away she went as we have seen without helens hearing seeing or suspecting her so well contrived and executed project she was now in good spirits the infection of fear which she had caught perhaps from the too sensitive helen last night she had thrown off this morning it was a sunny day and the bright sunshine dispelled as ever with her any black notions of the night all melancholy ideas whatsoever she had all the constitutional hopefulness of good animal spirits but though no fears remained curiosity was as strong as ever she was exceedingly eager to know what had been the cause of all these strange appearances she guessed it must be some pitiful jealousy of lady katrinessome poor spite against helen anything that should really give beauclerc uneasiness she now sincerely believed to be out of the question nonsenseonly helen and beauclercs love of tormenting themselvesquite nonsense and nonsense three times ejaculated quite settled the matter and assured her in the belief that there could be nothing serious to be apprehended in five minutes she should be at the bottom of all things and in half an hour return triumphant to helen and make her laugh at her cowardly self the carriage rolled on lady cecilias spirits rising as she moved rapidly onwards so that by the time she arrived at lady castleforts she was not only in good but in high spirits to her askings not at home never echoed even at hours undue such as the present she privileged penetrated accordingly unquestioned unquestioning the alert step was let down opened wide was the halldoor and lightly tripped she up the steps but the first look into the hall told her that company was in the house alreadyyesa breakfastall were in the breakfastroom except lady castlefort not yet come downabove the footman believed in her boudoir to the boudoir cecilia went but lady castlefort was not there and cecilia was surprised to hear the sound of music in the drawingroom lady castleforts voice singing while she waited in the next room for the song to be finished cecilia turned over the books on the table richly gilt and beautifully bound except one in a brown paper parcel which seemed unsuited to the table yet excited more attention than all the others because it was directed privatefor lady katherine hawksbyto be returned before two oclock what could it be thought lady cecilia but her attention was now attracted by the song which lady castlefort seemed to be practising the words were distinctly pronounced uncommonly distinctly so as to be plainly heard had we never loved so kindly hail we never loved so blindly never met or never parted we had neer been brokenhearted as cecilia listened she cast her eyes upon a card which lay on the tablelord beltravers and a new light flashed upon her a light favourable to her present purpose for since the object was altered with lady castlefort since it was not beauclerc any longer there would be no further illwill towards helen lady castlefort was not of the violent vindictive sort with her there was no longlasting dpit amoureux she was not that fury a woman scorned but that blessed spirit a woman believing herself always admired soft silly soothnot one of the hard wicked is louisa thought cecilia and as lady castlefort slowly opening the door entered timid as if she knew some particular person was in the room cecilia could not help suspecting that louisa had intended her song for other ears than those of her dear cousin and that the superb negligence of her dress was not unstudied but that wellprepared wellaccording sentimental air changed instantly on seeingnot the person expected and with a start she exclaimed cecilia clarendon louisa castlefort cried lady cecilia answering that involuntary start of confusion with a wellacted start of admiration louisa castlefort si belle si belle so beautifully dressed beautifully dressednothing extraordinary said lady castlefort advancing with a half embarrassed half nonchalant airone must make something of a toilette de matin you know when one has people to breakfast so elegant so negligent continued lady cecilia there is the point said lady castlefort i cannot bear any thing that is studied in costume for dress is really a matter of so little consequence i never bestow a thought upon it angelique rules my toilette as she pleases angelique has the taste of an angel fresh from paris cried lady cecilia and now tell me cecilia pursued lady castlefort quite in good humour tell me my dear to what do i owe this pleasure what makes you so matinale it must be something very extraordinary not at all only a little matter of curiosity then from lady castlefort who had hitherto as if in absence of mind stood there was a slight wont you sit motion no no i cant sit cant stay said lady cecilia a look quickly visible and quickly suppressed showed lady castleforts sense of relief then came immediately greater pressing to sit down pray do not be in such a hurry but i am keeping you have you breakfasted taken coffee in my own room said lady castlefort but you have people to breakfast must not you go down no no i shall not go down for this is katrines affair as i will explain to you lady cecilia was quite content without any explanation and sitting down she drew her chair close to lady castlefort and said now my dear my little matter of curiosity stay my dear first i must tell you about katrinenow confidentiallyvery lady cecilia ought to have been aware that when once her dear cousin louisas little heart opened and she became confidential very it was always of her own domestic grievances she began to talk and that once the sluice opened out poured from the deep reservoir the longcollected minute drops of months and years you have no idea what a life i lead with katrinenow she is grown blue is she said lady cecilia quite indifferent deep blue shocking and this is a blue breakfast and all the people at it are true bores and a blue bore is as horace churchill says one of the most mischievous creatures breathing and he tells me the only way of hindering them from doing mischief is by ringing them but first you must get rings now in this case for katrine not a ring to be had for love or money so there is no hope for me no hope for me thought lady cecilia throwing herself back in her chair submissive but not resigned if it had but pleased heaven continued lady castlefort in its mercy to have sent katrine a husband of any kind what a blessing it would have been if she could but have been married to any bodynow any body any body is infinitely obliged to you said cecilia but since that is out of the question let us say no more about itno use no use that is the very thing of which i complain the very thing which must everever make me miserable well well my dear cried lady cecilia no longer capable of patience do not be miserable any more just now never mind katrine just now never mind her easy for you to say cecilia who do not live with katrine hawksby and do not know what it is to have such a plague of a sister watching onewatching every turn every look one givesworse than a jealous husband can i say more no cried cecilia therefore say no more about it i understand it all perfectly and i pity you from the bottom of my heart so now my dear louisa i tell you my dear cecilia pursued lady castlefort continuing her own thoughts i tell you katrine is envious of me envy has been her fault from a child envy of poor me envy in the first place of whatever good looks it pleased providence to give me a glance at the glassand now katrine envies me for being lady castlefort heaven knows now cecilia and you know she need not envy me so when she looks at lord castlefort that is what she sometimes says herself which you know is very wrong of her to say to meunnecessary too when she knows i had no more hand in my marriage than heart cecilia could not forbear saying than heart readily responded lady castlefort never was a truer word said never was there a more complete sacrifice than my mother made of me you know cecilia a poor young innocent helpless sacrifice if ever there was one upon earth to a coronet said lady cecilia absolutely dragged to the altar continued lady castlefort in mechlin lace that was some comfort said cecilia laughing and she laughed on in hope of cutting short this sad chapter of sacrifices but lady castlefort did not understand raillery upon this too tender point i dont know what you mean by mechlin lace cried she pettishly is this your friendship for me cecilia cecilia justly in fear of losing the reward of all her large layout of flattery fell to protesting the tenderest sympathy but only now it was all over why make her heart bleed about what could not be helped cannot be helped oh there is the very thing i must ever ever mourn the embroidered cambric handkerchief was taken out of the bag no tears indeed came but there were sobs and cecilia not knowing how far it might go apprehending that her ladyship meditated hysterics seized a smellingbottle threw out the stopper and presented it close under the nostrils the good sels poignans dangleterre of which felicie always acknowledged the unrivalled potency did their business effectually back went the head with an exclamation of thats enough oh oh too much too much cecilia are you better my dear inquired cecilia but indeed you must not give way to low spirits indeed you must not so now to change the conversation louisa not so fast lady cecilia not yet and now louisa went on with a medical maundering as to low spirits my dear cecilia i must say i agree with sir sib pennyfeather who tells me it is not mere common low spirits but really all mind too much mind mind preying upon my nerves oh i knew it myself at first he thought it was rather constitutional poor dear sir sib he is very clever sir sib and i convinced him he was wrong and so we agreed that it was all upon my mindall all at that instant a green parrot who had been half asleep in the corner awoke on lady castleforts pronouncing in an elevated tone all all and conceiving himself in some way called upon answered poll poll bit osugar poll no small difficulty had lady cecilia at that moment in keeping her risible muscles in order but she did for helens sake and she was rewarded for after lady castlefort had all unconscious of ridicule fed poll from her amber bonbonniere and sighed out once more mind too much mind she turned to cecilia and said but my dear you wanted something you had something to ask me at once and as fast as she could speak lady cecilia poured out her business about helen stanley she told of the illbred manner in which helen had been received last night inquired why the words promessi sposi and belle fiance were so oddly repeated as if they had been watchwords and asked what was meant by all those strange whisperings in the sanctum sanctorum katrines set observed lady castlefort coolly just like them just like her i should not care about it in the least said lady cecilia if it were only katrines illnature or their illbreeding illbreeding always recoils on the illbred and does nobody else any harm but i should be glad to be quite clear that there is nothing more at the bottom lady castlefort made no reply but took up a bunch of seals and looked at each of them one after another lady cecilia more afraid now than she had yet been that there was something at the bottom still bravely went on what is it if you know tell me at once nay ask katrine said lady castlefort no i ask you i would rather ask you for you are goodnatured louisaso tell me but i dare say it is only slander said the goodnatured louisa slander repeated lady cecilia slander did you say yes what is there to surprise you so much in that word did you never hear of such a thing i am sure i hear too much of it katrine lives and breathes and fattens upon it as churchill says she eats slander drinks slander sleeps upon slander but tell me what of helen that is all i want to hear cried lady cecilia slander of helen stanley what is it that katrine says about poor helen what spite what vengeance can she have against her tell me tell me if you would ask one question at a time i might be able to answer you said lady castlefort do not hurry me so you fidget my nerves first as to the spite you know yourself that katrine from the beginning never could endure helen stanley for my part i always rather liked her than otherwise and shall defend her to the last defend her but katrine was always jealous of her and lately worse than ever for getting into her place as she says with you that made her hate her all the more let her hate on that will never make me love helen the less so i told her and besides miss stanley is going to be married to be surewell and katrine naturally hates every body that is going to be married if you were to see the state she is in always reading the announcements of marriages in high life churchill i do believe had miss stanleys intended match put into every paper continually on purpose for the pleasure of plaguing katrine and if you could have seen her long face when she saw it announced in the court gazettegood authority you knowreally it was pitiable i dont care i dont care about thatoh pray go on to the facts about helen well but the fact is as i tell you you wanted to know what sufficient cause for vengeance and am not i telling you if you would not get into such a state of excitementas sir sib says excitements should be avoided la my dear continued lady castlefort looking up at her with unfeigned astonishment what agitation why if it were a matter that concerned yourself it concerns my friend and that is the same thing so one says butyou look really such a colour no matter what colour i look cried cecilia go on do you never read the papers said lady castlefort sometimes said lady cecilia but i have not looked at a paper these three days was there any thing particular tell me my dear tell you as if i could remember by heart all the scandalous paragraphs i read she looked round the room and not seeing the papers said i do not know what has become of those papers but you can find them when you go home she mentioned the names of two papers noted for being personal scandalous and scurrilous are those the papers you mean cried lady cecilia the general never lets them into the house that is a pitythats hard upon you for then you never are as you see au courant du jour and all your friends might be abused to death without your knowing it if some kind person did not tell you do tell me then the substance i dont want the words but the words are all somehow it is nothing without the words in her now excited state of communicativeness lady castlefort rose and looked all about the room for the papers saying they were here they were there all yesterday katrine had them showing them to lady masham in the morning and to all her blue set afterwardslord knows what she has done with them so tiresome looking for things how i hate it she rang the bell and inquired from the footman if he knew what had become of the papers of course he did not know could not imagineservants never know nor can imagine what have become of newspapersbut he would inquire while he went to inquire lady castlefort sank down again into her bergre and again fell into admiration of cecilias state of impatience how curious you are now i am never really curious about any thing that does not come home to myself i have so little interest about other people this was said in all the simplicity of selfishness not from candour but from mere absence of shame and utter ignorance of what others thinkwhat others feel which always characterises and often betrays the selfish even where the head is best capable of supplying the deficiencies of the heart but louisa castlefort had no head to hide her want of heart while cecilia who had both head and heart looked down upon her cousin with surprise pity and contempt quick succeeding each other in a sort of parenthesis of feeling as she moved her eyes for a moment from the door on which they had been fixed and to which they recurred while she stood waiting for the appearance of those newspapers the footman entered with them in mr landrums room they were my lady lady cecilia did not hear a word that was said nor did she see that the servant laid a note on the table it was well that louisa had that note to read and to answer while cecilia looked at the paragraphs in these papers else her start must have been seen her exclamation must have been heard it must have been marked that the whole character of her emotion changed from generous sympathy with her friend to agony of fear for herself the instant she cast her eyes on that muchread paper she saw the name of colonel daubigny all the rest swam before her eyes lady castlefort without looking up from her writing askedwhat day of the month cecilia could not answer but recalled to herself by the sound of the voice she now tried to readshe scarcely read the words but some way took the sense into her mind at a glance chapter vi the first of these paragraphs caught the eye by its title in capital letters la belle fiance though quite unknown in the london world this young lady cannot fail to excite some curiosity among our fashionables as the successful rival of one whom the greatest painter of the age has pronounced to be the fairest of the fairthe lady b f this new helen is we understand of a respectable family niece to a late dean distinguished for piety much and virt more it was reported that the niece was a great heiress but after the proposal had been made it was discovered that virt had made away with every shilling of her fortune this made no difference in the eyes of her inamorato who is as rich as he is generous and who saw with the eyes of a youth of age tomorrow his guardian a wary general demurredbut nursery tactics prevailed the young lady though she had never been out bore the victory from him of many campaigns the day for the marriage was fixed as announced by usbut we are concerned to state that a postponement of this marriage for mysterious reasons has taken place delicacy forbids us to say more at present delicacy however did not prevent their saying in the next paper in a paragraph headed mystery solved we understand that in the course of a few days will appear the memoirs of the late colonel dy or reminiscences of a rou well known in the fashionable world this little volume bids fair to engross the attention of the higher circles as it contains besides innumerable curious personal and secret anecdotes the original love letters of a certain belle fiance now residing with a noble family in grosvenor square lady cecilia saw at once the whole dreadful dangerher own letters to colonel daubigny they must he how could they have got them they would be seen by her husbandpublished to the whole worldif the general found out they were hers he would cast her off for ever if they were believed to be helenshelen was undone sacrificed to her folly her cowardice oh if i had but told clarendon he would have stopped this dreadful dreadful publication and what falsehoods it might contain she did not even dare to think all was remorse terror confusionfixed to the spot like one stupified she stood lady castlefort did not see itshe had been completely engrossed with what she had been writing she was now looking for her most sentimental seal and not till she had pressed that seal down and examined the impression did she look up or notice ceciliathen struck indeed with a sense of something unusualmy dear said she you have no idea how odd you lookso strange ceciliaquite bahie giving two pulls to the bell as she spoke and her eyes on the door impatient for the servant she addedafter all cecilia helen stanley is no relation evenonly a friend take this note to the footman who answered the bell and the moment he left the room continuing in the same tone to lady cecilia she saidyou will have to give her up at lastthats all so you had better make your mind up to it when lady cecilia tried to speak she felt her tongue cleave to the roof of her mouth and when she did articulate it was in a sort of hoarse sound is the book published she held the paper before lady castleforts eyes and pointed to the name she could not utter daubignys bookis it published do you mean said lady castlefort absolutely published i cannot say but it is all in print i know i do not understand about publishing theres something about presentation copies i know katrine was wild to have one before any body else so she is to have the first copy i know and i believe is to have it this very morning for the people at this breakfast it is to be the bonne bouche of the business what has katrine to do with itoh tell me quick dear me cecilia what a fuss you are inyou make me quite nervous to look at you you had better go down to the breakfastroom and you will hear all about it from the fountainhead has katrine the book or not cried lady cecilia bless me i will inquire my dear if you will not look so dreadful she rang and coolly askeddid that man that bookseller stone send any parcel or book this morning do you know for lady katrine yes my lady landrum had a parcel for lady katrineit is on the table i believe very well the man left the room lady cecilia darted on the brown paper parcel she had seen directed to lady katrine and seized it before the amazed louisa could prevent her stop stop cried she springing forward stop cecilia katrine will never forgive me but lady cecilia seizing a penknife cut the first knot oh cecilia i am undone if katrine comes in make haste make haste i can only let you have a peep or two we must do it up again as well as ever continued lady castlefort while lady cecilia fast as possible went on cut cut cutting the packthread to bits and she tore off the brown paper cover then one of silver paper that protected the silk binding lady castlefort took up the outer cover and read to be returned before two oclockwhat can that mean then it is only lent not her own katrine will not understand thiswill be outrageously disappointed im sure i dont care but here is a note from stone however which may explain it she opened and readstones respectsexisting circumstances make it necessary her ladyships copy should be returned will be called for at two oclock cecilia cecilia make haste but katrine does not know yetstill she may come up lady castlefort rang and inquired have they done breakfast breakfast is over my lady said the servant who answered the bell but landrum thinks the gentlemen and ladies will not be up immediately on account of one of the ladies being performing a poem very well very good added her ladyship as the man left the room then cecilia you will have time enough for when once they begin performing as sylvester calls it there is no end of it oh heavens cried cecilia as she turned over the pages oh heavens what is here such absolute falsehood shocking shocking she exclaimed as she looked on terrified at what she saw absolutely falsea forgery whereabouts are you said lady castlefort approaching to read along with her oh do not read it cried cecilia and she hastily closed the book what signifies shutting the book my dear said louisa as if you could shut peoples eyes i know what it is i have read it read it read it i really can read though it seems to astonish you but it is not published one can read in manuscript and did you see the manuscript i had a glimpse yesi know more than katrine thinks i know o tell me louisa tell me all cried cecilia i will but you must never tell that i told it to you speak speak cried cecilia it is a long story said lady castlefort make it short then o tell me quick louisa there is a literary dessous des cartes said lady castlefort a little vain of knowing a literary dessous des cartes churchill being at the head of every thing of that sort you know the bookseller brought him the manuscript which sir thomas daubigny had offered him and wanted to know whether it would do or not mr churchills answer was that it would never do without more pepper and salt meaning gossip and scandal and all that but you are reading on cecilia not listening to me i am listening indeed then never tell how i came to know every thing katrines maid has a lover who is as she phrases it one of the gentlemen connected with the press now my angelique who cannot endure katrines maid tells me that this man is only a wondermaker a halfcrown paragraph writer so through angelique and indeed from another person she stopped and then went onthrough angelique it all came up to me all what cried cecilia go on go on to the facts i will if you will not hurry me so the letters were not in miss stanleys handwriting no i am sure of that said cecilia copies were all that they pretended to be so they may be forgeries after all you see but how did katrine or mr churchill come by the copies i have a notion but of this i am not quite surei have a notion from something i was told byin short i suspect that carlos lady davenants page somehow got at them and gave them or had them given to the man who was to publish the book lady katrine and churchill laid their heads together here in this very sanctum sanctorum they thought i knew nothing but i knew every thing i do not believe horace had anything to do with it except saying that the loveletters would be just the thing for the public if they were bad enough i remember too that it was he who added the second title reminiscences of a rou and said something about alliterations artful aid and now concluded lady castlefort it is coming to the grand catastrophe as katrine calls it she has already told the story and today she was to give all her set what she calls ocular demonstration cecilia now quick finish they will be here this instant give me the book let me do it up this minute no no let me put it up cried lady cecilia keeping possession of the book and the brown paper i am a famous hand at doing up a parcel as famous as any bond street shopman your hands are not made for such work any body but lady castlefort would have discerned that lady cecilia had some further design and she was herself afraid it would be perceived but taking courage from seeing what a fool she had to deal with lady cecilia went on more boldly louisa i must have more packthread this is all cut to bits i will ring and ask for some no no do not ring for the footman he might observe that we had opened the parcel cannot you get a string without ringing look in that basket none there i know said lady castlefort without stirring in your own room then angelique has some how do you know i know never mind how go and she will give you packthread i must have it before katrine comes up so go louisa go go in the imperative mood operated and she went she did not know why that instant lady cecilia drew the book out of the halffolded paper and quick quick tore out page after pageevery page of those letters that concerned herself or helen and into the fire thrust them and as they blazed held them down bravelyhad the boldness to wait till all was black all the while she trembled but stood it and they were burnt and the book in its brown paper cover was left on the table and she down stairs before lady castleforts dressingroom door opened and she crossed the hall without meeting a soul except the man in waiting there the breakfastroom was at the back of the house looking into the gardens and her carriage at the frontdoor had never been seen by lady katrine or any of her blue set she cleared out of the house into her carriageand offto the park said sheshe was off but just in time the whole tribe came out of the breakfast room before she had turned the corner of the street she threw herself back in the carriage and took breath congratulating herself upon this hairbreadth scape for this hour this minute she had escapedshe was reprieved and now what was next to be done this was but a momentary reprieve another copy would be hadno not till tomorrow though the sound of the words that had been read from the booksellers note by lady castlefort though scarcely noticed at the time recurred to her now and there was hope something might today be done to prevent the publication it might still be kept for ever from her husbands and from beauclercs knowledge one stratagem had succeededothers might she took a drive round the park to compose the excessive flurry of her spirits letting down all the glasses she had the fresh air blowing upon her and ere she was half round she was able to think of what yet remained to do money oh any money she could command she would give to prevent this publication she was not known to the booksellerno matter money is money from whatever hand she would trust the matter to no one but herself and she would go immediatelynot a moment to be lostto stones the booksellers arrived do not give my name only say a lady wants to speak to mr stone the people at mr stones did not know the livery or the carriage but such a carriage and such a lady commanded the deference of the shopman please to walk in madam and by the time she had walked in the man changed madam into your ladyshipmr stone will be with your ladyship in a momentonly in the warehouse if your ladyship will please to walk up into the back drawingroomtheres a fire the maid followed to blow it and while the bellows wheezed and the fire did not burn lady cecilia looked out of the window in eager expectation of seeing mr stone returning from the warehouse with all due celerity no mr stone however appeared but there was a good fire in the middle of the courtyard as she observed to the maid who was plying the wheezing bellows and who answered that they had had a great fire there this hour past burning of papers and at that moment a man came out with his arms full of a huge pilesheets of a book lady cecilia sawit was thrown on the fire then came out and stood before the firecould she he mistakenimpossibleit was like a dreamthe general cecilias first thought was to run away before she should be seen but the next moment that thought was abandoned for the time to execute it was now past the messenger sent across the yard had announced that a lady in the back drawingroom wanted mr stone eyes had looked upthe general had seen and recognised her and all she could now do was to recognise him in return which she did as eagerly and gracefully as possible the general came up to her directly not a little astonished that she whom he fancied at home in her bed incapacitated by a headache that had prevented her from speaking to him should be here so far out of her usual haunts and as it seemed out of her elementwhat can bring you here my dear cecilia the same purpose which if i rightly spell brought you here my dear general and her eye intelligently glanced at the burning papers in the yard do you know then cecilia what those papers are how did you know lady cecilia told her history keeping as strictly to facts as the nature of the case admitted her headache of course she had found much better for the sleep she had taken she had set off she told him as soon as she was able for lady castleforts to inquire into the meaning of the strange whispers of the preceding night then she told of the scandalous paragraphs she had seen how she had looked over the book and how successfully she had torn out and destroyed the whole chapter and then how hoping to be able to prevent the publication she had driven directly to mr stones her husband with confiding admiring eyes looked at her and listened to her and thought all she said so natural so kind that he could not but love her the more for her zeal of friendship though he blamed her for interfering in defiance of his caution had you consulted me or listened to me my dear cecilia this morning i could have saved you all this trouble i should have told you that i would settle with stone and stop the publication as i have done but that copy which had been sent to lady katrine surely i did some good there by burning those pages for if once it had got among her set it would have spread like wildfire you know clarendon he acknowledged this and said smilingbe satisfied with yourself my love i acknowledge that you made there a capital coup de main just then in came mr stone with an account in his hand which the general stepped forward to receive and after one glance at the amount he took up a pen wrote and signed his name to a cheque on his banker mr stone received it bowed obsequiously and assured the general that every copy of the offensive chapter had been withdrawn from the book and burntthat copy excepted which you have yourself general and that which was sent to lady katrine hawksby which we expect in every minute and it shall be sent to grosvenor square immediately i will bring it myself to prevent all danger the general who knew there was no danger there smiled at cecilia and told the bookseller that he need take no further trouble about lady katrines copy the man bowed and looking again at the amount of the cheque retired well satisfied you come home with me my dear clarendon do not you said lady cecilia they drove off on their way the general saidit is always difficult to decide whether to contradict or to let such publications take their course but in the present case to stop the scandal instantly and completely was the only thing to be done there are cases of honour when women are concerned where law is too slow it must not be remedy it must be prevention if the finger of scorn dares to point it must becut off after a pause of grave thought he addedupon the manner in which helen now acts will depend her happinessher characterher whole future life lady cecilia summoned all her power to prevent her from betraying herself the danger was great for she could not command her fears so completely as to hide the look of alarm with which she listened to the general but in his eyes her agitation appeared no more than was natural for her to feel about her friend my love continued he if helen is worthy of your affection she will show it now her only resource is in perfect truth tell her so ceciliaimpress it upon her mind would to heaven i had been able to convince her of this at first speak to her strongly cecilia as you love her impress upon her that my esteem beauclercs love the happiness of her life depend upon her truth as he repeated these words the carriage stopped at their own door chapter vii we left helen in the back drawingroom the door bolted and beginning to read her dreaded task the paragraphs in the newspapers we have seen were sufficiently painful but when she came to the book itselfto the lettersshe was in consternation greater even than what she had felt in the generals presence under the immediate urgency of his eye and voice her conviction was that in each of these letters there were some passages some expressions which certainly were cecilias but mixed with others which as certainly were not hers the internal evidence appeared to her irresistibly strong and even in those passages which she knew to be cecilias writing it too plainly appeared that however playfully however delicately expressed there was more of real attachment for colonel daubigny than cecilia had ever allowed helen to believe and she felt that cecilia must shrink from general clarendons seeing these as her letters after she had herself assured him that he was her first love the falsehood was here so indubitable so proved that helen herself trembled at the thought of cecilias acknowledging the plain facts to her husband the time for it was past now that they were in print published perhaps how must he feel if even candid confession were made to him and made for the best motives it would to him appear only forced by necessityforced as he would say to himself because her friend would not submit to be sacrificed such were helens thoughts on reading the two or three first letters but as she went on her alarm increased to horror she saw things which she felt certain cecilia could never have written yet truth and falsehood were so mixed up in every paragraph circumstances which she herself had witnessed so misrepresented that it was all to her inextricable confusion the passages which were to be marked could not now depend upon her opinion her belief they must rest upon cecilia s integrityand could she depend upon it the impatience which she had felt for lady cecilias return now faded away and merged in the more painful thought that when she did come the suspense would not endthe doubts would never be satisfied she lay down upon the sofa and tried to rest kept herself perfectly still and resolved to think no more and as far as the power of the mind over itself can stay the everrising thoughts she controlled hers and waited with a sort of forced desperate composure for the event suddenly she heard that knock that ring which she knew announced lady cecilias return but not cecilia alone she heard the general also coming upstairs but cecilia first who did not stop for more than an instant at the drawingroom doorshe looked in as helen guessed and seeing that no one was there ran very quickly up the next flight of stairs next came the generalon hearing his step helens anxiety became so intense that she could not at the moment he came near catch the sound or distinguish which way he went strained beyond its power the faculty of hearing seemed suddenly to failall was confusion an indistinct buzz of sounds the next moment however recovering she plainly heard his step in the front drawingroom and she knew that he twice walked up and down the whole length of the room as if in deep thought each time as he approached the folding doors she was breathless at last he stopped his hand was on the lockshe recollected that the door was bolted and as he turned the handle she in a powerless voice called to tell him but not hearing her he tried again and as the door shook she again tried to speak but could not still she heard though she could not articulate she heard him say miss stanley are you there can i see you but the wordsthe voice seemed to come from afarsounded dull and strange she tried to rise from her seatfound a difficultymade an effortstood upshe summoned resolutionstruggledhurried across the roomdrew back the boltthrew open the doorand that was all she could do in that effort strength and consciousness failedshe fell forward and fainted at the generals feet he raised her up and laid her on the sofa in the inner room he rang for her maid and went upstairs to prevent cecilias being alarmed he took the matter coolly he had seen many fainting young ladies he did not like themhis own cecilia exceptedin his mind always excepted from every unfavourable suspicion regarding the sex helen on the contrary was at present subject to them all and under the cloud of distrust he saw in a bad light every thing that occurred the same appearances which in his wife he would have attributed to the sensibility of true feeling he interpreted in helen as the consciousness of falsehood the proof of cowardly duplicity he went back at once to his original prejudice against her when as he first thought she had been forced upon him in preference to his own sister he had been afterwards convinced that she had been perfectly free from all double dealing yet now he slid back again as people of his character often do to their first opinion i thought so at first and i find as i usually do that my first thought was right what had been but an adverse feeling was now considered as a prescient judgment and he did not go upstairs the quicker for these thoughts but calmly and coolly when he reached lady cecilias dressingroom knocked at the door and with all the precautions necessary to prevent her from being alarmed told her what had happened you had better not go down my dear cecilia i beg you will not miss stanley has her own maid all the assistance that can be wanted my dear it is not fit for you i desire you will not go down but lady cecilia would not listen could not be detained she escaped from her husband and ran down to helen excessively alarmed she was and well she might be knowing herself to be the cause and not certain in any way how it might end she found helen a little recovered but still pale as white marble and when lady cecilia took her hand it was still quite cold she came to herself but very slowly for some minutes she did not recover perfect consciousness or clear recollection she saw figures of persons moving about her she felt them as if too near and wished them away wanted air but could not say what she wished she would have moved but her limbs would not obey her will at last when she had with effort half raised her head it sunk back again before she could distinguish all the persons in the room the shock of cold water on her forehead revived her then coming clearly to power of perception she saw cecilia bending over her but still she could not speak and yet she understood distinctly saw the affectionate anxiety too in her little maid roses countenance she felt that she loved rose and that she could not endure felicie who had now come in and was making exclamations and advising various remedies all of which when offered helen declined it was not merely that felicies talking and tone of voice and superabundant action were too much for her but that helen had at this moment a sort of intuitive perception of insincerity and of exaggeration in that dreamy state hovering between life and death in which people are on coming out of a swoon it seems as if there was need for a firm hold of reality the senses and the understanding join in the struggle and become most acute in their perception of what is natural or what is unnatural true or false in the expressions and feelings of the bystanders lady cecilia understood her look and dismissed felicie with all her smellingbottles rose though not ordered away judiciously retired as soon as she saw that her services were of no further use and that there was something upon her young ladys mind for which hartshorn and sal volatile could be of no avail cecilia would have kissed her forehead but helen made a slight withdrawing motion and turned away her face the next instant however she looked up and taking cecilias hand pressed it kindly and said you are more to be pitied than i am sit down sit down beside me my poor cecilia how you tremble and yet you do not know what is coming upon you yes yes i doi do cried lady cecilia and she eagerly told helen all that had passed ending with the assurance that the publication had been completely stopped by her dear clarendon that the whole chapter containing the letters had been destroyed that not a single copy had got abroad the only one in existence is this said she taking it up as she spoke and she made a movement as if going to tear out the leaves but helen checked her hand that must not be the general desired and almost breathless yet distinctly she repeated what the general had said that he might be called upon to prove which parts were forged and which true and that she had promised to mark the passages so now cecilia here is a pencil and mark what is and what is not yours lady cecilia instantly took the pencil and in great agitation obeyed oh my dear helen some of these the general could not think yours very wicked these people have beenso the general said he was sure he knew all could not be yours finish my dear cecilia interrupted helen finish what you have to do and in this last trial give me this one proof of your sincerity be careful in what you are now doing mark trulyoh cecilia every word you recollectas your conscience tells you will you cecilia this is all i ask as i am to answer for itwill you most fervently she protested she would she had no difficulty in recollecting in distinguishing her own and at first she marked truly and was glad to separate what was at worst only foolish girlish nonsense from things which had been interpolated to make out the romance things which never could have come from her mind there is some comfort in having our own faults overshadowed outdone by the greater faults of others and here it was flagrant wickedness in the editor and only weakness and imprudence in the writer of the real letters lady cecilia continually solaced her conscience by pointing out to helen as she went on the folly literally the folly of the deception she had practised on her husband and her exclamations against herself were so vehement that helen would not add to her pain by a single reproach since she had decided that the time was past for urging her confession to the general she now only said look to the future cecilia the past we cannot recall this will be a lesson you can never forget oh never never can i forget it you have saved me helen tears and protestations followed these words and at the moment they were all sincere and yet can it be believed even in this last trial when it came to this last proof lady cecilia was not perfectly true she purposely avoided putting her mark of acknowledgment to any of those expressions which most clearly proved her love for colonel daubigny for she still said to herself that the time might come though at present it could not be when she might make a confession to her husbandin his joy at the birth of a son she thought she might venture she still looked forward to doing justice to her friend at some future period and to make this easierto make this possibleas she said to herself she must now leave out certain expressions which might if acknowledged remain for ever fixed in clarendons mind and for which she could never be forgiven helen when she looked over the pages observed among the unmarked passages some of those expressions which she had thought were cecilias but she concluded she was mistaken she could not believe that her friend could at such a moment deceive her and she was even ashamed of having doubted her sincerity and her words look and manner now gave assurance of perfect unquestioning confidence this delicacy in helen struck lady cecilia to the quick ever apt to be more touched by her refined feelings than by any strong appeal to her reason or her principles she was now shocked by the contrast between her own paltering meanness and her friends confiding generosity as this thought crossed her mind she stretched out her hand again for the book took up the pencil and was going to mark the truth but the impulse past cowardice prevailed and cowardice whispered helen is looking at me helen sees at this moment what i am doing and after having marked them as not mine how can i now acknowledge themit is too lateit is impossible i have done as you desired continued she helen to the best of my ability i have marked all this but what can it signify now my dear except helen interrupted her take the book to the general this moment will you and tell him that all the passages are marked as he desired stay i had better write she wrote upon a slip of paper a message to the same effect having well considered the words by which she might without further step in deception save her friend and take upon herself the whole blamethe whole hazardous responsibility when cecilia gave the marked book to general clarendon he said as he took it i am glad she has done this though it is unnecessary now as i was going to tell her if she had not fainted unnecessary because i have now in my possession the actual copies of the original letters i found them here on my return that good little poetess found them for me at the printersbut she could not discoveri have not yet been able to trace where they came from or by whom they were copied o let me see them cried lady cecilia not yet my love said he you would know nothing more by seeing them they are in a feigned hand evidently but interrupted cecilia you cannot want the book now when you have the letters themselves and she attempted to draw it from his hand for she instantly perceived the danger of the discrepancies between her marks and the letters being detected she made a stronger effort to withdraw the book but he held it fast leave it with me now my dear i want it it will settle my opinion as to helens truth slowly and absolutely sickened with apprehension lady cecilia withdrew when she returned to helen and found how pale she was and how exhausted she seemed she entreated her to lie down again and try to rest yes i believe i had better rest before i see granville said helen where can he have been all day with some friend of his i suppose said cecilia and she insisted on helens saying no more and keeping herself perfectly quiet she farther suggested that she had better not appear at dinner it will be only a family party some of the generals relations miss clarendon is to be here and she is one you know trying to the spirits and she is not likely to be in her most suave humour this evening as she has been under a course of the toothache and has been all day at the dentists helen readily consented to remain in her own room though she had not so great a dread of miss clarendon as lady cecilia seemed to feel lady cecilia was indeed in the greatest terror lest miss clarendon should have heard some of these reports about helen and beauclerc and would in her blunt way ask directly what they meant and go on with some of her pointblank questions which cecilia feared might be found unanswerable however as miss clarendon had only just come to town from wales and come only about her teeth she hoped that no reports could have reached her and cecilia trusted much to her own address and presence of mind in moments of danger in turning the conversation the way it should go but things were now come to a point where none of the little skilful interruptions or lucky hits by which she had so frequently profited could avail her farther than to delay what must be passion and character pursue their course unalterably unimpeded by small external circumstances interrupted they may be in their progress but as the stream opposed bears against the obstacle sweeps it away or foams and passes by before lady cecilias toilette was finished her husband was in her dressingroom came in without knockinga circumstance so unusual with him that mademoiselle felicies eyes opened to their utmost orbit and without waiting for word or look she vanished leaving the bracelet half clasped on her ladys arm cecilia said the general he spoke in so stern a tone that she trembled from head to foot her last falsehood about the lettersall her falsehoods all her concealments were she thought discovered unable to support herself she sank into his arms he seated her and went on in a cool inexorable tone cecilia i am determined not to sanction by any token of my public approbation this marriage which i no longer in my private conscience desire or approve i will not be the person to give miss stanley to my ward lady cecilia almost screamed her selfish fears forgotten she felt only terror for her friend she exclaimed clarendon will you break off the marriage oh helen what will become of her clarendon what can you mean i mean that i have compared the passages that helen marked in the book with those copies of the letters which were given to the bookseller before the interpolations were madethe letters as miss stanley wrote them the passages in the letters and the passages marked in the book do not agree oh but she might have forgotten it might be accident cried cecilia overwhelmed with confusion no cecilia pursued the general in a tone which made her heart die within herno cecilia it is not accident it is design i perceive that every strong expression every word in short which could show her attachment to that man has been purposely marked as not her own and the letters themselves prove that they were her own the truth is not in her in an agitation which prevented all power of thought cecilia exclaimed she mistookshe mistook i could not i am sure recollect she asked me if i remembered any she consulted you then she asked my advicetold me that i particularly requested her interrupted the general not to ask your advice i desired her not to speak to you on the subjectnot to consult you deceitdoubledealing in every thing she does i find no no it is my fault every thing i say and do is wrong cried lady cecilia i recollect nowit was just after her fainting when i brought the book and when she took it to mark she really was not able it was not that she consulted me but i forced my counsel upon her i looked over the letters and said what i thoughtif anybody is wrong it is i clarendon oh do not visit my sins upon helen so cruellydo not make me the cause of her ruin innocent creature i assure you if you do this i never could forgive myself the general looked at her in silence she did not dare to meet his eyes desperately anxious as she was to judge by his countenance what was passing within he clasped for her that bracelet which her trembling hands were in vain attempting to close poor thing how its heart beats said her husband pressing her to him as he sat down beside her cecilia thought she might venture to speakyou know my dear clarendon i never opposeinterfere withany determination of yours when once it is fixed this is fixed interrupted the general but after all you have done for her this very day for which i am sure shei am sure i thank you from my soul would you now undo it all she is saved from public shame said the general from private contempt i cannot save her who can save those who have not truth but my determination is fixed it is useless to waste words on the subject esther is come i must go to her and now cecilia i conjure you when you see beauclerci have not seen him all dayi do not know where he has beeni conjure youi command you not to interfere between him and helen but you would not have me give her up i should be the basest of human beings i do not know what you mean cecilia you have done for her all that an honourable friend could do i am not an honourable friend was cecilias bitter consciousness as she pressed her hand upon her heart which throbbed violently with contending fears you have done all that an honourable friend could do more must not be done continued the general and now recollect cecilia that you are my wife as well as miss stanleys friend and as he said these words he left the room chapter viii that knowing french minister louvois whose power is said to have been maintained by his surpassing skill in collecting and spreading secret and swift intelligence had in his pay various classes of unsuspected agents dancingmasters fencingmasters languagemasters milliners hairdressers and barbersdentists he would have added had he lived to our times and not all paris could have furnished him with a person better suited to his purpose than the most fashionable london dentist of the day st leger swift never did frenchman exceed him in volubility of utterance or in gesture significant supplying all that words might fear or fail to tell never was he surpassed by prattling barber or privileged hunchback in ancient or modern story arabian or persian but he was not a malicious only a coxcomb scandalmonger triumphing in his savoir dire st leger swift was known to everybodyknew everybody in london that was to be or was not to be known every creature dead or alive that ever had been or was about to be celebrated fashionable or rich or clever or notorious rou or murderer about to be married or about to be hangedfor that last class of persons enjoys in our days a strange kind of heroic celebrity of which voltaire might well have been jealous st leger was of course hand and glove with all the royal family every illustrious personageevery most illustrious personagehad in turn sat in his chair he had had all their heads in their turns in his hands and he had capital anecdotes and sayings of each with which he charmed away the sense of pain in loyal subjects but with scandal for the fair was he specially provided never did man or woman skim the surface tittletattle of society or dive better breathless into family mysteries none with more careless air could at the same time talk and listenextract your news and give you his on dit or tell the secret which you first reveal there was in him and about him such an air of reckless cordial coxcombry it warmed the coldest threw the most cautious off their guard brought out family secrets as if he had been one of your familyyour secret purpose as though he had been a secular father confessor as safe every thing told to st leger swift he would swear to you as if known only to yourself he would swear and you would believe unless peculiarly constituted as was the lady who this morning took her seat in his chair miss clarendon she was accompanied by her aunt mrs pennant ha old lady and young lady fresh from the country both i see persons of familyof condition said st leger to himself on that point his practised eye could not mistake even at first glance and accordingly it was really doing himself a pleasure and these ladies as he conceived it a pleasure a service and an honour to put them immediately on their arrival in town au courant du jour whether to pull or not to pull a tooth that had offended was the professional question before him miss clarendon threw back her head and opened her mouth fine teeth fine nothing to complain of here surely said st leger as fine a show of ivory as ever i beheld pon my reputation i know many a fine lady who would giveall but her eyes for such a set i must have this tooth out said miss clarendon pointing to the offender i see certainly maam as you say i hope sir you dont think it necessary said her tenderhearted aunt if it could be any way avoided by all means madam as you say we must do nothing without consideration i have considered my dear aunt said miss clarendon i have not slept these three nights but you do not consider that you caught cold getting up one night for me and it may be only an accidental cold my dear esther i should be so sorry if you were to lose a tooth dont be in a hurry once gone you cannot get it back again never was a truer wiser word spoken madam said st leger swiftly whisking himself round and as if looking for some essential implement may be a mere twinge accidental cold rheumatism or may bemy dear madam to the aunt i will trouble you let me pass i beg pardonone word with you and with his back to the patient in the chair while he rummaged among ivoryhandled instruments on the table he went on in a low voice to the auntis she nervous is she nervous eh eh eh mrs pennant looked but

must be peremptory impossible i could hurtcant conceivedid not touchonly making a perquisitioninquisitionsay what you please but you are nervous maam i am only taking a general survey aproposgeneral surveygenerala friend of mine general clarendon is just come to town my ears must have played me false but i thought my man said something like clarendon when he showed you up no answer from miss clarendon who held her mouth open wide as desired resolved not to satisfy his curiosity but to let him blunder on be that as it may general clarendons come to townfine teeth he has tooand a fine kettle of fishnot very elegant but expressive stillhe and his ward have made of that marriage announced fine young man though that beauclercfinest young man almost i ever saw but here mr st leger swift starting suddenly withdrawing his hand from miss clarendons mouth exclaimed my finger maam but never mind never mind all in the days work casualtycontingenciesno consequence but as i was saying mr granville beauclerc then poured out on the encouragement of one look of curiosity from mrs pennant all the on dits of lady katrine hawksby and all her chorus and all the best authorities and st leger swift was ready to pledge himself to the truth of every word he positively knew that the marriage was off and thought as everybody did that the young gentleman was well off too for besides the young ladys great fortune turning out not a sousand here he supplied the halftold tale by a drawnup ugly face and shrugging gesture shocking shocking all came to an clatesclandre a scene quite last night i am told at my friend lady castleforts sadsadso young a lady but to give you a general idea love letters to come out in the memoirs of that fashionable roufriend of mine toofine fellow as ever breathedonly a littleyou understand colonel daubignypoor datibigny heighoonly if the book comes outmiss stanley mrs pennant looked at her niece in benevolent anxiety miss clarendon was firmly silent but st leger catching from the expression of both ladies countenances that they were interested in the contrary direction to what he had anticipated turned to the right about and observed this may be all scandal one of the innumerable daily false reports that are always flying about town scandal all i have no doubtyour head a little to the right if you pleaseand the publication will be stopped of course and the young ladys friendsyou are interested for her i see so am ialways am for the young and fair thats my foible and indeed confidentially i can inform youif you could keep your head still my dear madam but miss clarendon could bear it no longer starting from under his hand she exclaimed no more thank youno more at present sir we can call another dayno more and added as she hastily left the room better bear the toothache and ran down stairs mrs pennant slipped into the dentists hand as he pulled the bell a double fee for though she did not quite think he deserved it much yet she felt it necessary to make amends for her nieces way of running off which might not be thought quite civil thank you maamthank ye maamnot the least occasiondont say a word about ityoung ladys nervous said so from the first nerves nerves allopen the door therenerves all were the last words at the top of the stairs st leger swift was heard to say and the first words of kind mrs pennant as soon as she was in the carriage and had drawn up the glass were do you know esther my dear i am quite sorry for this poor miss stanley though i dont know her yet as you described her to me she was such a pretty young interesting creature i am quite sorry i dont believe a word of it said miss clarendon but even to have such things said must be so distressing to her and to her lover your friend mr beauclercso very distressing i hope they are not such fools as to be distressed about such stuff all this insufferable talking mans invention i dare say why do people tell such things said mrs pennant but my dear esther even supposing it to be all false it is shocking to have such things spoken of i pity the poor young lady and her lover do you not think my dear we shall be able to inquire into the truth of the matter from your brother this evening he must know he ought to know about it whether the report be true or false he should hear of it he can best judge what should be done if any thing should be done my dear miss clarendon quite agreed with all this indeed she almost always agreed with this aunt of hers who perhaps from the peculiar gentleness of her manner joined to a simplicity and sincerity of character she could never doubt had an ascendency over her which no one at first view could have imagined they had many country commissions to execute this morning which naturally took up a good deal of aunt pennants attention but between each return from shop to carriage in the intervals between one commission off her hands and another on her mind she returned regularly to that poor miss stanley and those loveletters and she sighed dear kindhearted old lady she had always a heart as well as a hand open as day to melting charitycharity in the most enlarged sense of the word charity in judging as well as charity in giving she was all indulgence for human nature for youth and love especially we must take care my dear esther said she to be at general clarendons early as you will like to have some little time with him to yourself before any one else arrivesshall you not my dear certainly replied miss clarendon i shall learn the truth from my brother in five minutes if lady cecilia does not come between us nay my dear esther i cannot think so ill of lady cecilia i cannot believe no my dear aunt i know you cannot think ill of any body stay till you know lady cecilia clarendon as i do if there is any thing wrong in this business you will find that some falsehood of hers is at the bottom of it oh my dear do not say so before you know perhaps as you thought at first we shall find that it is all only a mistake of that giddy dentists for your brothers sake try to think as well as you can of his wife she is a charming agreeable creature i am sure youve only seen her once my dear aunt said miss clarendon for my brothers sake i would give up half her agreeableness for one ouncefor one scrupleof truth well well take it with some grains of allowance my dear niece and at any rate do not suffer yourself to be so prejudiced as to conceive she can be in fault in this business we shall see today said miss clarendon i will not be prejudiced but i remember hearing at florence that this colonel daubigny had been an admirer of lady cecilias i will get at the truth with this determination and in pursuance of the resolve to be early they were at general clarendons full a quarter of an hour before the arrival of any other company but lady cecilia entered so immediately after the general that miss clarendon had no time to speak with her brother alone determined however as she was to get at the truth without preface or even smoothing her way to her object she rushed into the middle of things at once have you heard any reports about miss stanley brother yes and you lady cecilia yes what have you heard lady cecilia was silent looked at the general and left it to him to speak as much or as little as he pleased she trusted to his laconic mode of answering which without departing from truth defied curiosity her trust in him upon the present occasion was however a little disturbed by her knowledge of his being at this moment particularly displeased with helen but had she known the depths as well as she knew the surface of his character her confidence in his caution would have been increased instead of being diminished by this circumstance helen was lost in his esteem but she was still under his protection her secrets were not only sacred but as far as truth and honour could admit he would still serve and save her impenetrable therefore was his look and brief was his statement to his sister a rascally bookseller had been about to publish a book in which were some letters which paragraphs in certain papers had led the public to believe were miss stanleys the publication had been stopped the offensive chapter suppressed and the whole impression destroyed but brother pursued miss clarendon were the letters miss stanleys or not you know i do not ask from idle curiosity but from regard for miss stanley and she turned her inquiring eyes full upon lady cecilia i believe my dear esther said lady cecilia i believe we had better say no more you had better inquire no further that must be a bad case which can bear no inquiry said miss clarendon which cannot admit any further question even from one most disposed to think well of the person concerneda desperately bad case bad no esther it would be cruel of you so to conclude and falsely it would bemight be indeed esther my dear esther her husbands eyes were upon lady cecilia and she did not dare to justify helen decidedly her imploring look and tone and her confusion touched the kind aunt but did not stop the impenetrable niece falsely do you say do you say lady cecilia that it would be to conclude falsely perhaps not falsely though upon the data given to me the data may be false data i do not know what you mean exactly esther said lady cecilia in utter confusion i mean exactly what i say pursued miss clarendon that if i reason wrong and come to a false conclusion or what you call a cruel conclusion it is not my fault but the fault of those who do not plainly tell me the facts she looked from lady cecilia to her brother and from her brother to lady cecilia on her brother no effect was produced calm unalterable looked he as though his face had been turned to stone lady cecilia struggled in vain to be composed i wish i could tell you esther said she but facts cannot alwaysall factseven the most innocentthat is even with the best intentionscannot always be all told even in the defence of ones best friend if this be the best defence you can make for your best friend i am glad you will never have to defend me and i am sorry for helen stanley oh my dear esther said her aunt with a remonstrating look for though she had not distinctly heard all that was said she saw that things were going wrong and that esther was making them worse indeed esther my dear we had better let this matter rest let this matter rest repeated miss clarendon that is not what you would say my dear aunt if you were to hear any evil report of me if any suspicion fell like a blast on my character you would never say let it rest fire lighted in her brothers eyes and the stone face was all animated and he looked sudden sympathy and he cried you are right sister in principle but wrong infact set me right where only i am wrong then cried she he turned to stone again and her aunt in a low voice said not now now or never said the sturdy champion it is for miss stanleys character you are interested for her are not you aunt certainly i am indeed but we do not know all the circumstanceswe cannot but we must you do not know brother how public these reports are mr st leger swift the dentist has been chattering to us all morning about them so to go to the bottom of the business at once will you lady cecilia answer me one straightforward question straightforward question what is coming thought lady cecilia her face flushed and taking up a handscreen she turned away as if from the scorching fire but it was not a scorching fire as everybody or at least as miss clarendon could see the face turned away from miss clarendon was full in view of aunt pennant who was on her other side and she seeing the distressed state of the countenance pitied and gently laying her hand upon lady cecilias arm said in her soft low voice this must be a very painful subject to you lady cecilia i am sorry for you thank you said lady cecilia pressing her hand with quick gratitude for her sympathy it is indeed to me a painful subject for helen has been my friend from childhood and i have so much reason for loving her many contending emotions struggled in cecilias countenance and she could say no more but what she had said what she had looked had been quite enough to interest tenderly in her favour that kind heart to which it was addressed and cecilias feeling was true at the instant she forgot all but helen the screen was laid down tears stood in her eyesthose beautiful eyes if i could but tell you the wholeoh if i could without destroying miss clarendon at this moment placed herself close opposite to cecilia and speaking so low that neither her brother nor her aunt could hear her said without destroying yourself or your friendwhich lady cecilia could not speak you need noti am answered said miss clarendon and returning to her place she remained silent for some minutes the general rang and inquired if mr beauclerc had come in no the general made no observation and then began some indifferent conversation with mrs pennant in which lady cecilia forced herself to join she dreaded even miss clarendons silencethat grim reposeand well she might daubignys memoirs i think was the title of the book aunt that the dentist talked of that is the book you burnt is not it brothera chapter in that book yes said the general and again miss clarendon was silent for though she well recollected what she had heard at florence and however strong were her suspicions she might well pause for she loved her brother before every thing but truth and justiceshe loved her brother too much to disturb his confidence i have no proof thought she i might destroy his happiness by another word and i may be wrong but shall not we see miss stanley said mrs pennant lady cecilia was forced to explain that helen was not very well would not appear till after dinnernothing very much the mattera little faintish fainted said the general yes quite worn outshe was at lady castleforts last nightsuch a crowd she went on to describe its city horrors but where is mr beauclerc all this time said miss clarendon has he fainted too or is he faintish not likely said lady cecilia faint heart never won fair lady he is not of the faintish sort at this moment a thundering knock at the door announced the rest of the company and never was company more welcome but beauclerc did not appear before dinner was served however a note came from him to the general lady cecilia stretched out her hand for it and read my dear friendsi am obliged to dine out of town i shall not return tonight but you will see me at breakfasttime tomorrow yours ever granville beauclerc cockburn now entered with a beautiful bouquet of hothouse flowers which he said mr beauclercs man had brought with the note and which were he said for miss stanley lady cecilias countenance grew radiant with joy and she exclaimed give them to mei must have the pleasure of taking them to her myself and she flew off with them aunt pennant smiled on her as she passed and turning to her niece as lady cecilia left the room said what a bright creature so warm so affectionate miss clarendon was indeed struck with the indisputably natural sincere satisfaction and affection in cecilias countenance and herself of such a different nature could not comprehend the possibility of such contradiction in any character she could not imagine the existence of such variable transitory feelingsshe could not believe any human being capable of sacrificing her friend to save herself while she still so loved her victim could still feel such generous sympathy for her she determined at least to suspend her judgment she granted lady cecilia a reprieve from her terrific questions and her as terrific looks cecilia recovered her presence of mind and dinner went off delightfully to her at least with the sense of escape in recovered selfpossession and spirits light to every joy in tune from the goodbreeding of the company there was no danger that the topic she dreaded should be touched upon whatever reports might have gone forth whatever any one present might have heard nothing would assuredly be said of her friend miss stanley to her or before her unless she or the general introduced the subject and she was still more secure of his discretion than of her own the conversation kept safe on londondinner generalities and frivolities yet often things that were undesignedly said touched upon the tabood matter and those who knew when where and how it touched looked at or from one another and almost equally dangerous was either way of looking such perfect neutrality of expression is not given to all men in these emergencies as to general clarendon the dessert over out of the dinnerroom and in the drawingroom the ladies alone together things were not so pleasant to lady cecilia curiosity peeped out more and more in great concern about miss stanleys health and when ladies trifled over their coffee and saw through all things with their halfshut eyes they asked and lady cecilia answered and parried and explained and her conscience winced and her countenance braved and miss clarendon listened with that dreadfully good memory that positive pointblank recollection which permits not the slightest variation of statement her doubts and her suspicions returned but she was silent and sternly silent she remained the rest of the evening chapter ix if trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ and that they are no one since the time of othello could ever doubt it may be some consolation to observe on the credit side of human nature that to those who are not cursed with a jealous infirmity trifles light as air are often confirmations strong of the constancy of affection well did lady cecilia know this when she was so eager to be the bearer of the flowers which were sent by beauclerc she foresaw and enjoyed the instant effect the quick smile and blush of delight with which that bouquet was received by helen oh thank you how kind of him and alls well was her immediate conclusion when she saw his note she never even took notice that he did not particularly mention her the flowers from him were enough she knew his sincerity so well trusted to it so completely that she was quite sure if he had been angry with her he would not have sent these tokens of his loveslight tokens though they were allsufficient for her her fears had taken but one direction and in that direction they were all dispelled he would be at breakfast tomorrow when she should know where he had been and what had detained him from her the whole of this day she told cecilia that she was now quite well but that she would not attempt to go down stairs and cecilia left her happy so far at least and when she was alone with her flowers she doubly enjoyed them inhaling the fragrance of each which she knew he particularly liked and thanking him in her heart for the careful choice for she was certain that they were not accidentally put together some of them were associated with little circumstances known only to themselves awakening recollections of bright happy moments and selected she was sure with reference to a recent conversation they had had on the language of flowers whether helen fancied half this or whether it was all true it had the effect of soothing and pleasing her anxious agitated mind and she was the more ready to indulge in that pleasant reverie from all that she had previously suffered herself and all that she feared beauclerc had yet to endure she knew too well how much these reports would affect himand hear them he must she considered what trials he had already borne and might still have to bear for her sake whatever course she might now pursue though soon very soon the whole would be told to him yet still though she might stand clear in his eyes as to the main points he must and would blame her weakness in first consenting to this deceptionhe who was above deceit she had not absolutely told but she had admitted a falsehood she had acted a falsehood this she could not extenuate her motive at first to save lady davenants life was good but then her weakness afterwards in being persuaded time after time by cecilia could not well be excused she was conscious that she had sunk step by step dragged down that slippery path by cecilia instead of firmly making a stand as she ought to have done and upholding by her own integrity her friends failing truth with returning anguish of selfreproach she went over and over these thoughts she considered the many unforeseen circumstances that had occurred so much public shame so much misery had been brought upon herself and on all she loved by this one false step and how much more might still await her notwithstanding all that best of friends the general had done she recollected how much he had done for herthinking of her too as he must with lowered esteem and that was the most painful thought of allto beauclerc she could and would soon clear her truth but to the generalnever perhaps completely her head was leaning on her hand as she was sitting deep in these thoughts when she was startled by an unusual knock at her door it was cockburn with a packet which general clarendon had ordered him to deliver into miss stanleys own hands the instant she saw the packet she knew that it contained the book and on opening it she found manuscript letters inserted between the marked pages and there was a note from general clarendon she trembledshe foreboded ill the note began by informing miss stanley how the enclosed manuscript letters came into general clarendons hands from a person whom miss stanley had obliged and who had hoped in return to do her some service the general next begged miss stanley to understand that these letters had been put into his possession since his conversation with her at breakfast time his only design in urging her to mark her share in the printed letters had been to obtain her authority for serving her to the best of his ability but he had since compared themand then came references without comment to the discrepancies between the marked passages the uniform character of the omissions followed only by a single note of admiration at each from the generals pen and at last in cold polite phrase came his regret that he had not been able to obtain that confidence which he had trusted he had deserved and his renunciation of all future interference in her affairsor concerns had been written but a broad dash of the pen had erased the superfluous words and then came the inevitable conclusion on which helens eyes fixed and remained immovable for some timethat determination which general clarendon had announced to his wife in the first heat of indignation but which lady cecilia had hoped could be evaded changed postponedwould not at least be so suddenly declared to helen therefore she had given her no hint had in no way prepared her for the blowand with the full force of astonishment it came upon hergeneral clarendon cannot have the pleasure he had proposed to himself of giving miss stanley at the altar to his ward he cannot by any public act of his attest his consent to that marriage of which in his private opinion he no longer approves and he is right o cecilia was helens first thought when she could think after this shocknot of her marriage not of herself not of beauclerc but of cecilias falsehoodcecilias selfish cowardice she thought and could not conceive it possiblecould not believe it though it was there incredibleyet provedtheretherebefore her eyesbrought home keen to her heart after all at such a timeafter her most solemn promise with so little temptation so utterly falsewith every possible motive that a good mind could have to be truein this last trialher friends whole character at stakeungenerousbase o cecilia how different from what i thought youor how changed and i have helped to bring her to thisii have been the causei will not stay in this housei will leave her to save herto save myselfsave my own truth and my own real characterlet the rest go as it willthe world think what it may farther and farther lower and lower i have gone i will not go loweri will struggle up again at any risk at any sacrifice this is a sacrifice lady davenant would approve of she said that if ever i should be convinced that general clarendon did not wish me to be his guestif he should ever cease to esteem mei should go that instantand i will go but where to whom could she fly to whom turn the collingwoods were gone all her uncles friends passed rapidly through her recollection since she had been living with general and lady cecilia clarendon several had written to invite her but helen knew a little more of the world now than formerly and she felt that there was not one no not one of all these to whom she could now at her utmost need turn and say i am in distress receive me my character is attacked defend me my truth is doubted believe in me and her heart beating with anxiety she tried to think what was to be done there was an old mrs medlicott who had been a housekeeper of her uncles living at seven oaksshe would go thereshe should be safeshe should be independent she knew that she was then in town and was to go to seven oaks the next day she resolved to send rose early in the morning to mrs medlicotts lodging which was near grosvenor square to desire her to call at general clarendons as she went out of town at eight oclock she could then go with her to seven oaks and by setting out before cecilia could be up she should avoid seeing her again there are minds which totally sink and others that wonderfully rise under the urgency of strong motive and of perilous circumstance it is not always the mind apparently strongest or most daring that stands the test the firm of principle are those most courageous in time of need helen had determined what her course should be and once determined she was calm she sat down and wrote to general clarendon miss stanley regrets that she cannot explain to general clarendon the circumstances which have so much displeased him she assures him that no want of confidence has been on her part the cause but she cannot expect that without further explanation he should give her credit for sincerity she feels that with his view of her conduct and in his situation his determination is rightthat it is what she has deservedthat it is just towards his ward and due to his own character she hopes however that he will not think it necessary to announce to mr beauclerc his determination of withdrawing his approbation and consent to his marriage when she informs him that it will now never be by her claimed or accepted she trusts that general clarendon will permit her to take upon herself the breaking off this union she encloses a letter to mr beauclerc which she begs may be given to him tomorrow general clarendon will find she has dissolved their engagement as decidedly as he could desire and that her decision will be irrevocable and since general clarendon has ceased to esteem her miss stanley cannot longer accept his protection or encroach upon his hospitality she trusts that he will not consider it as any want of respect that she has resolved to retire from his family as soon as possible she is certain of having a safe and respectable home with a former housekeeper of her uncle dean stanleys who will call for her at eight oclock tomorrow and take her to seven oaks where she resides miss stanley has named that early hour that she may not meet mr beauclerc before she goes she wishes also to avoid the struggle and agony of parting with lady cecilia she entreats general clarendon will prevent lady cecilia from attempting to see her in the morning and permit her to go unobserved out of the house at her appointed hour so now farewell my dear friendyes friend this last time you must permit me to call you for such i feel you have ever been and ever would have been to me if my folly would have permitted believe menotwithstanding the deception of which i acknowledge i have been guilty towards you general clarendoni venture to say believe me i am not ungrateful at this instant my heart swells with gratitude while i pray that you may be happyhappy as you deserve to be but you will read this with disdain as mere idle words so be it farewell helen stanley next she was to write to beauclerc himself her letter was as follows with my whole heart dear granville i thank you for the generous confidence you have shown towards me and for the invariable steadiness of your faith and love for your sake i rejoice one good has at least resulted from the trials you have gone through you must now and hereafter feel sure of your own strength of mind with me it has been different for i have not a strong mind i have been all weakness and must now be miserable but wicked i will not beand wicked i should be if i took advantage of your confiding love i must disappoint your affection but your confidence i will not betray when i put your love to that test which it has so nobly stood i had hoped that a time would come when all doubts would be cleared up and when i could reward your constancy by the devotion of my whole happy lifebut that hope is past i cannot prove my innocencei will no longer allow you to take it upon my assertion i cannot indeed with truth even assert that i have done no wrong for though i am not false i have gone on step by step in deception and might go on i know not how far nor to what dreadful consequences if i did not now stopand i do stop on my own head be the penalty of my faultupon my own happinessmy own character i will not involve yourstherefore we part you have not yet heard all that has been said of me but you soon will and you will feel as i do that i am not fit to be your wife your wife should not be suspected i have beeni am all the happiness i can ever have in this world must be henceforth in the thought of having saved from miseryif not secured the happiness of those i love leave me this hopeoh granville do not tell me do not make me believe that you will never be happy without me you willindeed you will i only pray heaven that you may find love as true as mine and strength to abide by the truth do not write to medo not try to persuade me to change my determination it is irrevocable further writing or meeting could be only useless anguish to us both give me the sole consolation i can now have and which you alone can givelet me hear from cecilia that you and your nobleminded guardian are after i am gone as good friends as you were before you knew me i shall be gone from this house before you are here again i cannot stay where i can do no good and might do much evil by remaining even a few hours longer as it is comfort your generous heart on my account with the assurance that i am sustained by the consciousness that i am now to the best of my power doing right adieu granville be happy you canyou have done no wrong be happy and that will console your affectionate helen stanley this enclosed to general clarendon she sent by cockburn who delivered it to his master immediately though she could perfectly depend upon her maid roses fidelity helen did not tell her that she was going away in the morning to avoid bringing her into any difficulty if she were questioned by lady cecilia and besides no note of preparation would be heard or seen she would take with her only sufficient for the day and would leave rose to pack up all that belonged to her after her departure and to follow her thanks to her own late discretion she had no money difficultiesno debts but such as rose could settle and she had now only to write to cecilia but she had not yet recovered from the tumult of mind which the writing to the general and to beauclerc had caused she lay down upon the sofa and closing her trembling eyelids she tried to compose herself sufficiently to think at least of what she was to say as she passed the table in going to the sofa she without perceiving it threw down some of the flowers they caught her eye and she said to herself lie there lie there granvilles last gifts last gifts to me all over now lie there and wither joys that are passed wither all happiness for me gone lie there and wither and dieand so shall i soon i hopeif that only hope is not wrong some one knocked at the door she started up and said i cannot see you cecilia a voice not cecilias a voice she did not recollect answered it is not cecilia let me see you i come from general clarendon helen opened the door and sawmiss clarendon her voice had sounded so much lower and gentler than usual that helen had not guessed it to be hers she was cloaked as if prepared to go away and in the outer room was another lady seated with her back towards them and with her cloak on also my aunt pennantwho will wait for me as she is a stranger she would not intrude upon you miss stanley but will you allow me one minute helen surprised begged miss clarendon to come in moved a chair towards her and stood breathless with anxiety miss clarendon sat down and resuming her abruptness of tone said i feel that i have no right to expect that you should have confidence in me and yet i do i believe in your sincerity even from the little i know of you and i have a notion you believe in mine do you i do i wish it had pleased heaven continued miss clarendon that my brother had married a woman who could speak truth but you need not be afraid i will not touch on your secrets on any matter you have in keeping my honour as well as yours will command my silenceas will also my brothers happiness which i have somewhat at heart not that i think it can be preserved by the means you take but this is not what i came to say you mean to go away from this house tomorrow morning yes said helen you are right i would not stay where i did not esteem or where i had reason to believe that i was not esteemed you are quite right to go and to go directly but not to your old housekeeper why not said helen because though i dare say she is vastly respectablean excellent person in her way i am convincedyet my brother says she might not be thought just the sort of person to whom you should go nownot just the thing for you at present though at another time it would be very well and condescending but now when you are attacked you must look to appearancesin short my brother will not allow you to go to this old ladys boardinghouse or cottage or whatever it may be at seven oaks he must be able to say for you where you are gone you must be with me you must be at llansillen llansillen is a place that can be named you must be with mewith general clarendons sister you mustyou will i am sure my dear miss stanley i never was so happy in having a house of my own as at this moment you will not refuse to return with my aunt and me to llansillen and make our home yours we will try and make it a happy home to you try you see the sense of it the world can say nothing when you are known to be with miss clarendon and you will i hope feel the comfort of it out of the stir and din of this london world i know you like the country and llansillen is a beautiful placeromantic too a fine castle an excellent library beautiful conservatory famous for our conservatories we are in south wales and no neighbourssingular blessing and my aunt pennant you will love her so will you try come say that you will but helen could not she could only press the hand that miss clarendon held out to her there is nothing more touching more overcoming than kindness at the moment the heart is sunk in despair but did general clarendon really wish you to ask me said helen when she could speak did he think so much and so carefully for me to the last and with such a bad opinion as he must have of me but there you know he is wrong it is like himself continued helen consistent in protecting me to the last oh to lose such a friend not lost only mislaid said miss clarendon you will find him again some fair day or other truth always comes to light meanwhile all is settled i must run and tell my aunt and bless the fates and lady emily greville that lady cecilia did not come up in the middle of it luckily she thinks i am gone and knows nothing of my being with you for my brother explained all this to me in his study after we had left the saloon and he desires me to say that his carriage shall be ready for you at your hour at eight oclock we shall expect you and now farewell till tomorrow she was gone and her motto might well be though in a different acceptation from that of our greatest modern politiciantout faire sans paratre but before helen could go to rest she must write to lady cecilia and her thoughts were in such perplexity and her feelings in such conflict that she knew not how to begin at last she wrote only a few hasty lines of farewell and referred for her determination and for all explanations to her letter to the general it came to farewell dear cecilia dear yes still dear she was to helenshe must be as lady davenants daughterstill dear for her own sake was cecilia the companion of her childhood who had shown her such generous affection early such fondness always who was so charming with so many good qualities so much to win loveloved she must be still farewell cecilia may you be happy but as helen wrote these words she thought it impossible she could scarcely in the present circumstances wish it possible that cecilia should be happy how could she unless her conscience had become quite callous she gave her note to rose with orders to deliver it herself to lady cecilia tonight when she should demand admittance and soon she came the very instant lady emily greville went awaybefore helen was in bed she heard cecilia at her door she left her to parley with roseheard her voice in the first instance eager peremptory for admittance then a sudden silence helen comprehended that she had opened her noteand in another instant she heard her retreating step on seeing the first words referring for explanation to helens letter to the general panicstruck lady cecilia hurried to her own room to read the rest privately helen now tried to recollect whether every thing had been said written done that ought to be done and at last went to bed and endeavoured to sleep for a few hours chapter x helen was just dressed and had given her last orders to her bewildered maid when she heard a knock at the door and mademoiselle felicies voice she could not at this instant endure to hear her heartless exclamatory speeches she would not admit her mademoiselle felicie gave rose a note for her young ladyit was from cecilia dearest helenthe general will not allow me to take leave of you this morning but i shall certainly go to you in the course of today i cannot understand or make you understand any thing till i see you i will see you today your affectionate cecilia i understand it too well thought helen the carriage was announced helen was ready she hurried into it and she was gone and thus she parted from the friend of her childhoodthe friend she had but a few months before met with such joy such true affection and her own affection was true to the last as helen drove from the door she saw the generalyes it certainly was the general riding offat this unusual hourwas it to avoid her but she was in too great anguish to dwell upon that or any other circumstance her only thought now was to subdue her emotion before she was seen by miss clarendon and mrs pennant and by the time she arrived she thought she had quite recovered herself and was not aware that any traces of tears remained but to mrs pennants sympathising eyes they were visible and after the first introductions and salutations were over that kind lady as she seated her at the breakfasttable gently pressing her hand said poor thing no wonderparting with old friends for new is a sad trial but you know we shall become old friends in time we will make what haste we can my dear miss stanley and esther will help me to make you forget that you have not known us all your life there is very little to be known no mysteries that is one comfort said miss clarendon so now to breakfast you are very punctual miss stanley and that is a virtue which aunt pennant likes and can estimate to a fraction of a minute with that excellent watch of hers there was some history belonging to that familywatch which then came out and then the conversation turned upon little family anecdotes and subjects which were naturally interesting to the aunt and niece and not exciting to helen whose mind they saw needed quiet and freedom from all observation from the first awkwardness of her situation from the sense of intrusion and the suddenness of change she was thus as far as possible gradually and almost imperceptibly relieved by their perfect goodbreeding as well as goodnature from their making no effort to show her particular attention she felt received at once into their family as one of themselves and yet though there was no effort she perceived in the most minute circumstances the same sort of consideration which would be shown to an intimate friend they not only did not expect but did not wish that she should make any exertion to appear to be what she could not be they knew the loneliness of heart she must feel the weight that must be upon her spirits they left her then quite at liberty to be with them or alone as she might like and she was glad to be alone with her own thoughts they soon fixed upon beauclerc she considered how he would feel what he would think when he should receive her letter she pictured his looks while reading it considered whether he would write immediately or attempt notwithstanding her prohibition to see her he would know from general clarendon that is if the general thought proper to tell him where she was and that she would remain all this day in town though her determination was fixed whether he wrote or came to abide by her refusal and for the unanswerable reasons which she had given or which she had laid down to herself yet she could not and who loving as she did could help wishing that beauclerc should desire to see her again she hoped that he would make every effort to change her resolution even though it might cost them both pain yet in some pain there is pleasure or to be without it is a worse kind of suffering helen was conscious of the inconsistency in her mind and sighed and endeavoured to be reasonable and to do her justice there was not the slightest wavering as to the main point she thought that the general might perhaps have some relenting towards her hope would come into her mind though she tried to keep it out she had nothing to expect she repeatedly said to herself except that either cecilia would send or the general would call this morning and rose must come at all events the morning passed on however and no one came so soon as helen had expected she was sitting in a back room where no knocks at the door could be heard but she would have been called surely if general clarendon had come he had come but he had not asked for her he had at first inquired only for his sister but she was not at home gone to the dentists the general then desired to see mrs pennant and when she supposed that she had not heard rightly and that miss stanley must be the person he wished to see he had answered by no means i particularly wish not to see miss stanley i beg to see mrs pennant alone it fell to the lot of this gentlehearted lady to communicate to helen the dreadful intelligence he brought a duel had taken place when helen had seen the general riding off he was on his way to chalk farm just as the carriage was coming round for miss stanley mr beauclercs groom had requested in great haste to see the general he said he was sure something was going wrong about his master he had heard the words chalk farm the general was off instantly but before he reached the spot the duel had been fought a duel between beauclerc and mr churchill beauclerc was safe but mr churchill was dangerously wounded the medical people present could not answer for his life at the time the general saw him he was speechless but when beauclerc and his second lord beltravers had come up to him he had extended his hand in token of forgiveness to one or the other but to which he had addressed the only words he had uttered could not be ascertained the words were you are not to blameescapefly both had fled to the continent general clarendon said that he had no time for explanations he had not been able to get any intelligible account of the cause of the affair lord beltravers had named miss stanley but beauclerc had stopped him and had expressed the greatest anxiety that miss stanleys name should not be implicated should not be mentioned he took the whole blame upon himselfsaid he would writethere was no time for more mrs pennant listened with the dread of losing a single word but however brief his expressions the generals manner of speaking notwithstanding the intensity of his emotion was so distinct that every word was audible except the name of lord beltravers which was not familiar to her she asked again the name of mr beauclercs second lord beltravers the general repeated with a forcible accent and loosening his neckcloth with his finger he added rascal as i always told beauclerc that he was and so he will find himtoo late except this exacerbation the general was calmly reserved in speech and mrs pennant felt that she could not ask him a single question beyond what he had communicated when he rose to go which he did the moment he had finished what he had to say she had however courage enough to hope that they should soon hear again when the general should learn something more of mr churchill certainly he would let her know whatever he could learn of mr churchills state her eyes followed him to the door with anxious eagerness to penetrate farther into what his own opinion of the danger might be his rigidity of composure made her fear that he had no hope otherwise certainly he would have said something he opened the door again and returning said depend upon it you shall hear how he is my dear mrs pennant before you leave town tomorrow we will not go tomorrow she replied we will stay another day at least poor miss stanley will be so anxious i advise you not to stay in town another day my dear madam you can do no good by it if mr churchill survive this day he will linger long i am assured take helentake miss stanley out of town as soon as may be better go tomorrow as you had determined but it will be so long my dear generalone momentif we go it will be so long before we can hear any further news of your ward i will write to miss stanleyoh thank you to my sister he looked back to say and repeated distinctly to my sister very wellthank you at all events mrs pennant saw that in general clarendons present disposition towards miss stanley the less she said of him the better and she confined herself strictly to what she had been commissioned to say and all she could do was to prevent the added pain of suspense it was told to helen in the simplest shortest manner possiblebut the facts were dreadful beauclerc was safesafe but under what circumstances and it was for me i am sure cried helen i am sure it was for me i was the cause i am the cause of that mans deathof beauclercs agony for some time helen had not power or thought for any other idea the promise that they should hear as soon as they could learn any thing more of mr churchills state was all she could rely upon or recur to when her maid rose arrived from general clarendons she said that when lady cecilia heard of the duel she had been taken very ill but had since recovered sufficiently to drive out with the general miss clarendon assured helen there was no danger it is too deep a misfortune for lady cecilia her feelings have not depth enough for it you will see you need not be afraid for her helen the circumstances which led to the duel were not clearly known till long afterwards but may be now related the moment beauclerc had parted from helen when he turned away at the carriage door after the party at lady castleforts he went in search of one who as he hoped could explain the strange whispers he had heard the person of whom he went in search was his friend his friend as he deemed him lord beltravers churchill had suggested that if any body knew the bottom of the matter except that origin of all evil lady katrine herselfit must be lord beltravers with whom lady castlefort was it was said fortement prise and as horace observed the secrets of scandal are common property between lovers much modern love being cemented by hate without taking in the full force of this observation in its particular application to the hatred which lord beltravers might feel to miss stanley as the successful rival of his sister blanche beauclerc hastened to act upon his suggestion his lordship was not at home his people thought he had been at lady castleforts did not know where he might be if not there at some gamblinghouse beauclerc at last found him and lord beltravers was sufficiently vexed in the first place at being there found for he had pretended to his friend granville that he no longer played his embarrassment was increased by the questions which beauclerc so suddenly put to him but he had nonchalante impudence enough to brave it through and he depended with good reason on beauclercs prepossession in his favour he protested he knew nothing about it and he returned churchills charge by throwing the whole blame upon him said he knew he was in league with lady katrinementioned that one morning sometime ago he had dropped in unexpectedly early at lady castleforts and had been surprised to find the two sisters contrary to their wont togethertheir heads and horace churchills over some manuscript which was shuffled away as he entered this was true all but the shuffling away and here it is necessary to form a clear notion clearer than lord beltravers will give of the different shares of wrong of wrong knowingly and unknowingly perpetrated by the several scandalmongers concerned in this affair lord beltravers could be in no doubt as to his own share for he it was who had furnished the editor of colonel daubignys memoirs with the famous letters when carlos lady davenants runaway page escaped from clarendon park having changed his name he got into the service of sir thomas daubigny who was just at this time arranging his brothers papers now it had happened that carlos had been concealed behind the screen in lady davenants room the day of her first conversation with helen about colonel daubigny and he had understood enough of it to perceive that there was some mystery about the colonel with either helen or lady cecilia and chancing one day soon after he entered sir thomass service to find his escritoire open he amused himself with looking over his papers among which he discovered the packet of lady cecilias letters carlos was not perfectly sure of the handwriting he thought it was lady cecilias but when he found the miniature of miss stanley along with them he concluded that the letters must be hers and having special reasons for feeling vengeance against helen and certain at all events of doing mischief he sent them to general clarendon not however forgetting his old trade he copied them first this was just at the time when lord beltravers returned from abroad after his sisters divorce he by some accident found out who carlos was and whence he came and full of his own views for his sister he crossexamined him as to every thing he knew about miss stanley and partly by bribes partly by threats of betraying him to lady davenant he contrived to get from him the copied letters carlos soon after returned with his master to portugal and was never more heard of lord beltravers took these purloined copies of the letters thus surreptitiously obtained to the editor into whose hands sir thomas daubigny who knew nothing of books or bookmaking had put his brothers memoirs this editor as has been mentioned had previously consulted mr churchill and in consequence of his pepper and salt hint lord beltravers himself made those interpolations which he hoped would ruin his sisters rival in the eyes of her lover mr churchill however except this hint and except his vanity in furnishing a good title and his coxcombry of literary patronage and his general hope that helens name being implicated in such a publication would avenge her rejection of himself had had nothing to do with the business this lord beltravers well knew and yet when he found that the slander made no impression upon beauclerc and that he was only intent upon discovering the slanderer he with dexterous treachery contrived to turn the tables upon churchill and to direct all beauclercs suspicion towards him he took his friend home with him and showed him all the newspaper paragraphsparagraphs which he himself had written yes this man of romantic friendship this blaz this hero oppressed with his own sensibility could condescend to write anonymous scandal to league with newsmongers and to bribe waitingwomen to supply him with information for mademoiselle felicie had through lady katrines maid told all and more than all she knew of what passed at general clarendons and on this foundation did he construct those paragraphs which he hoped would blast the character of the woman to whom his dearest friend was engaged and now he contrived to say all that could convince beauclerc that mr churchill was the author of these very paragraphs and hot and rash beauclerc rushed on to that conclusion he wrote a challenge to churchill and as soon as it was possible in the morning he sent it by lord beltravers mr churchill named sir john luttrell as his friend lord beltravers would enter into no terms of accommodation the challenge was accepted chalk farm appointed as the place of meeting and the time fixed for eight oclock next morning and thus partly by his own warmth of temper and partly by the falsehood of others was beauclerc urged on to the action he detested to be the thing he hated duelling and duellists had from the time he could think been his abhorrence and now he was to end his life or to take the life of a fellowcreature perhaps in a duel there was a dread interval and it was during the remainder of this day and night that beauclerc felt most strongly compared with all other earthly ties his attachment his passionate love for helen at every pause at every close of other thoughts forced upon him his mind recurred to helenwhat helen would feelwhat helen would thinkwhat she would sufferand in the most and in the least important things his care was for her he recalled the last look that he had seen at the carriagedoor when they parted recollected that it expressed anxiety was conscious that he had turned away abruptlythat in the preoccupied state of his mind he had not spoken one word of kindnessand that this might be the last impression of him left on her mind he knew that her anxiety would increase when all that day must pass without his return and it was then he thought of sending her those flowers which would he knew reassure her better than any words he could venture to write meanwhile his false friend coldly calculated what were the chances in his sisters favour and when churchill fell and even in the hurry of their immediate departure lord beltravers wrote to madame de st cymon over whom the present state of her affairs gave him command to order her to set out immediately and to take blanche with her to paris without asking the consent of that fool and prude her aunt lady grace it was well for poor helen even in the dreadful uncertainty in which she left london that she did not know all these circumstances it may be doubted indeed whether we should be altogether happier in this life if that worst of evils as it is often called suspense were absolutely annihilated and if human creatures could clearly see their fate or even know what is most likely to happen chapter xi according to the generals advice mrs pennant did not delay her journey and helen left london the next day with her and miss clarendon the last bulletin of mr churchill had been that he was still in great danger and a few scarce legible lines helen had received from cecilia saying that the general would not allow her to agitate herself by going to take leave of her that she was glad that helen was to be out of town till all blew over and that she was so much distracted by this horrible event she scarcely knew what she wrote as they drove out of town miss clarendon in hopes of turning helens thoughts went on talking unless said she we could like madame de genlis promote the postboys into agents of mystery and romance we have but little chance i am afraid of any adventures on our journey to llansillen my dear miss stanley she inveighed against the stupid safety convenience luxury and expedition of travelling nowadays all over england even in wales so that one might sleep the whole way from hyde park corner to llansillen gate said she and have no unconscionably long nap either no difficulties on the road nothing to complain of at inns no enjoying ones dear delight in being angry no opportunity even of showing ones charming resignation dreadfully bad this for the nervous and bilious for all the real use and benefit of travelling is done away all too easy for my taste one might as well be a doll or a dolt or a parcel in the coach helen would have been glad to have been considered merely as a parcel in the coach during the whole journey she took no notice of any thing till they came within a few miles of llansillen then endeavouring to sympathise with her companions she looked out of the carriage window at the prospect which they admired but however charming llansillen had not for helen the chief charm of early fond old associations with a happy home to her it was to be she doubted not as happy as kindness could make it but still it was new and in that thought that feeling there was something inexpressibly melancholy and the contrast at this moment between her sensations and those of her companions made the pain the more poignant they perceived this and were silent helen was grateful for this consideration for her but she could not bear to be a constraint upon them therefore she now exerted herself sat forwardadmired and talked when she was scarcely able to speak by the time they came to llansillen gate however she could say no more she was obliged to acknowledge that she was not well and when the carriage at last stopped at the door there was such a throbbing in her temples and she was altogether so ill that it was with the greatest difficulty she could leaning on miss clarendons arm mount the high steps to the halldoor she could scarcely stand when she reached the top but making an effort she went on crossed the slippery floor of that great hall and came to the foot of the black oak staircase of which the steps were so very low that she thought she could easily go up but found it impossible and she was carried directly up to miss clarendons own room no other having been yet prepared the rosy welsh maids looked with pity on the pale stranger they hurried to and fro talking welsh to one another very fast and helen felt as if she were in a foreign land and in a dream the end of the matter was that she had a low fever which lasted long it was more dispiriting than dangerousmore tedious than alarming her illness continued for many weeks during which time she was attended most carefully by her two new friendsby miss clarendon with the utmost zeal and activityby mrs pennant with the greatest solicitude and tenderness her history for these weeksindeed for some months afterwardscan be only the diary of an invalid and of a convalescent miss clarendon meanwhile received from her brother punctually once a week bulletins of churchills health the surgical details the fears of the formation of internal abscess reports of continual exfoliations of bone were judiciously suppressed and the laconic general reported only much the samenot progressingcannot be pronounced out of danger these bulletins were duly repeated to helen whenever she was able to hear them and at last she was considered well enough to read various letters which had arrived for her during her illness several were from lady cecilia but little in them the first was full only of expressions of regret and selfreproach in the last she said she hoped soon to have a right to claim helen back again this underlined passage helen knew alluded to the promise she had once made that at the birth of her child all should be told but words of promise from cecilia had lost all valueall power to excite even hope as she said to herself as she read the words and sighed one of her letters mentioned what she would have seen in the first newspaper she had opened that lady blanche forrester was gone with her sister the comtesse de st cymon to paris to join her brother lord beltravers but lady cecilia observed that helen need not be alarmed by this paragraph which she was sure was inserted on purpose to plague her lady cecilia seemed to take it for granted that her rejection of beauclerc was only a ruse damour and went on with her usual hopes now vague and more vague every letterthat things would end well sometime somehow or other helen only sighed on reading these letters and quick as she glanced her eye over them threw them from her on the bed and miss clarendon said ay you know her now i see helen made no reply she was careful not to make any comment which could betray how much or what sort of reason she had to complain of lady cecilia but miss clarendon confident that she had guessed pretty nearly the truth was satisfied with her own penetration and then after seeming to doubt for a few moments she put another letter into helens hand and with one of those looks of tender interest which sometimes softened her countenance she left the room the letter was from beauclerc it appeared to have been written immediately after he had received helens letter and was as follows not write to you my dearest helen renounce my claim to your hand submit to be rejected by you my affianced bride no nevernever doubt suspicionsuspicion of youyou angel as you areyou who have devoted sacrificed yourself to others no helen my admiration my love my trust in you are greater than they ever were and do i dare to say these words to you i who am perhaps a murderer i ought to imitate your generosity i ought not to offer you a hand stained with bloodi ought at least to leave you free till i know when i may return from banishment i have written this at the first instant i have been able to command during my hurried journey and as you know something of what led to this unhappy business you shall in my next letter hear the whole till then adieu granville beauclerc the next day when she thought helen sufficiently recovered from the agitation of reading beauclercs letter aunt pennant produced one letter more which she had kept for the last because she hoped it would give pleasure to her patient helen sat up in her bed eagerly and stretched out her hand the letter was directed by general clarendon but that was only the outer cover they knew for he had mentioned in his last dispatch to his sister that the letter enclosed for miss stanley was from lady davenant helen tore off the cover but the instant she saw the inner direction she sank hack turned and hid her face on the pillow it was directedto mrs granville beauclerc lady davenant had unfortunately taken it for granted that nothing could have prevented the marriage aunt pennant blamed herself for not having foreseen and prevented this accident which she saw distressed poor helen so much but miss clarendon wondered that she was so shocked and supposed she would get over it in a few minutes or else she must be very weak there was nothing that tended to raise her spirits much in the letter itself to make amends for the shock the direction had given it contained but a few lines in lady davenants own handwriting and a postscript from lord davenant she wrote only to announce their safe arrival at petersburgh as she was obliged to send off her letter before she had received any dispatches from england and she concluded with i am sure the first will bring me the joyful news of beauclercs happiness and yours my dear child lord davenants postscript added that in truth lady davenant much needed such a cordial for that her health had suffered even more than he had feared it would he repented that he had allowed her to accompany him to such a rigorous climate all that could be said to allay the apprehensions this postscript might excite was of course said in the best way by aunt pennant but it was plain that helen did not recover during the whole of this day from the shock she had felt from that foolish direction as miss clarendon said she could not be prevailed upon to rise this day though miss clarendon after feeling her pulse had declared that she was very well able to get up it was very bad for her to remain in bed this was true no doubt and miss clarendon remarked to her aunt that she was surprised to find miss stanley so weak her aunt replied that it was not surprising that she should be rather weak at present after such a long illness weakness of body and mind need not go together said miss clarendon need not perhaps said her aunt but they are apt to do so it is to be hoped the weakness of mind will go with the weakness of body and soon said miss clarendon we must do what we can to strengthen and fatten her poor thing said mrs pennant fatten the body rather easier than to strengthen the mind strength of mind cannot be thrown in as you would throw in the bark or the chicken broth only have patience with her said mrs pennant and you will find that she will have strength of mind enough when she gets quite well only have patience during helens illness miss clarendon had been patient but now that she was pronounced convalescent she became eager to see her quite well in time of need miss clarendon had been not only the most active and zealous but a most gentle anddoubt it who maysoftstepping softvoiced nurse but now when doctor tudor had assured them that all fever was gone and agreed with her that the patient would soon be well if she would only think so miss clarendon deemed it high time to use something more than her milder influence to become if not a rugged at least a stern nurse and she brought out some of her rigid lore i intend that you should get up in seasonable time today helen said she as she entered her room do you said helen in a languid voice i do said miss clarendon and i hope you do not intend to do as you did yesterday to lie in bed all day helen turned sighed and mrs pennant said yesterday is over my dear estherno use in talking of yesterday only to secure our doing better today maam replied miss clarendon with prompt ability helen was all submission and she got up and that was well miss clarendon went in quest of arrowroot judiciously and aunt pennant stayed and nourished her patient meanwhile with the fostering dew of praise and let her dress as slowly and move as languidly as she liked though miss clarendon had admonished her not to dawdle as soon as she was dressed helen went to the window and threw up the sash for the first time to enjoy the fresh air and to see the prospect which she was told was beautiful and she saw that it was beautiful and though it was still winter she felt that the air was balmy and the sun shone bright and the grass began to be green for spring approached but how different to her from the springtime of former years nature the same but all within herself how changed and all which used to please and to seem to her most cheerful now came over her spirits with a sense of sadnessshe felt as if all the life of life was gone tears filled her eyes large tears rolled slowly down as she stood fixed seeming to gaze from that window at she knew not what aunt pennant unperceived stood beside her and let the tears flow unnoticed they will do her good they are a great relief sometimes miss clarendon returned and the tears were dried but the glaze remained and miss clarendon saw it and gave a reproachful look at her aunt as much as to say why did you let her cry and her aunts look in reply was i could not help it my dear eat your arrowroot was all that transpired to helen and she tried to eat but could not and miss clarendon was not well pleased for the arrowroot was good and she had made it she felt miss stanleys pulse and said that it was as good a pulse as could be only low and a little fluttered do not flutter it any more then esther my dear said mrs pennant what am i doing or saying maam that should flutter anybody that has common sense some people dont like to have their pulse felt said aunt pennant those people have not common sense replied the niece i believe i have not common sense said helen sense you have enoughresolution is what you want helen i tell you i know said helen too true true but not too truenothing can be too true true said helen with languid submission helen was not in a condition to chop logic or ever much inclined to it now less than ever and least of all with miss clarendon so able as she was there is something very provoking sometimes in perfect submission because it is unanswerable but the langour not the submission afforded some cause for further remark and remonstrance helen you are dreadfully languid today sadly said helen if you could have eaten more arrowroot before it grew cold you would have been better but if she could not my dear esther said aunt pennant could not maam as if people could not eat if they pleased but if people have no appetite my dear i am afraid eating will not do much good i am afraid my dear aunt you will not do miss stanley much good said miss clarendon shaking her head you will only spoil her i am quite spoiled i believe said helen you must unspoil me esther not so very easy said esther but i shall try for i am a sincere friend i am sure of it said helen then what more could be said nothing at that timehelens look was so sincerely grateful and gentle as a lamb as aunt pennant observed and esther was not a wolf quiteat heart not at all miss clarendon presently remarked that miss stanley really did not seem glad to be betterglad to get well helen acknowledged that instead of being glad she was rather sorry if it had pleased heaven i should have been glad to die nonsense about dying and worse than nonsense cried miss clarendon when you see that it did not please heaven that you should die i am content to live said helen content to be sure you are said miss clarendon is this your thankfulness to providence i am resignedi am thankfuli will try to be more sobut cannot be glad general clarendons bulletins continued with little variation for some time they were always to his sisterhe never mentioned beauclerc but confined himself to the few lines or words necessary to give his promised regular accounts of mr churchills state the sum of which continued to be for a length of time much the samenot in immediate dangercannot be pronounced out of danger not very consolatory helen felt but while there is life there is hope as aunt pennant observed yes and fear said helen and her hopes and fears on this subject alternated with fatiguing reiteration and with a total incapacity of forming any judgment beauclercs letter of explanation arrived and other letters came from him from time to time which as they were only repetitions of hopes and fears as to churchills recovery and of uncertainty as to what might be his own future fate only increased helens misery and as even their expressions of devoted attachment could not alter her own determination while she felt how cruel her continued silence must appear they only agitated without relieving her mind mrs pennant sympathised with and soothed her and knew how to sooth and how to raise and to sustain a mind in sorrow suffering under disappointed affection and sunk almost to despondency for aunt pennant besides her softness of manner and her quick intelligent sympathy had power of consolation of a higher sort beyond any which this world can give she was very religious of a cheerfully religious turn of mindof that truly christian spirit which hopeth all things when she was a child somebody asked her if she was bred up in the fear of the lord she said no but in the love of god and so she was in that love which casteth out fear and now the mildness of her piety and the whole tone and manner of her speaking and thinking reminded helen of that good dear uncle by whom she had been educated she listened with affectionate reverence and she truly and simply said you do me goodi think you have done me a great deal of goodand you shall see it and she did see it afterwards and miss clarendon thought it was her doing and so her aunt let it pass and was only glad the good was done the first day helen went down to the drawingroom she found there a man who looked as she thought at first glance like a tradesmansome person she supposed come on business standing waiting for miss clarendon or mrs pennant she scarcely looked at him but passed on to the sofa beside which was a little table set for her and on it a beautiful workbox which she began to examine and admire not nigh so handsome as i could have wished it then for you miss heleni ask pardon miss stanley helen looked up surprised at hearing herself addressed by one whom she had thought a stranger but yet she knew the voice and a reminiscence came across her mind of having seen him somewhere before old david price maam maybe you forget him you being a child at that time but since you grew up you have been the saving of me and many more stepping quite close to her he whispered that he had been paid under her goodnesss order by mr james along with the other creditors that had been left helen by this time recollected who the poor welshman wasan upholsterer and cabinetmaker who had been years before employed at the deanery never having been paid at the time a very considerable debt had accumulated and having neither note nor bond price said that he had despaired of ever obtaining the amount of his earnings he had however since the deans death been paid in full and had been able to retire to his native village which happened to be near llansillen and most grateful he was and as soon as he perceived that he was recognised his gratitude became better able to express itself not well however could it make its way out for some time between crying and laughing and between two languages he was at first scarcely intelligible whenever much moved david price had recourse to his native welsh in which he was eloquent and mrs pennant on whom knowing that she understood him his eyes turned was good enough to interpret for him and when once fairly set agoing there was danger that poor davids garrulous gratitude should flow for ever but it was all honest not a word of flattery and his old face was in a glow and radiant with feeling and the joy of telling miss helen all how and about it particularly concerning the last day when mr james paid him and them and all of them that was a day miss stanley ought to have seen pity she could not have witnessed it it would have done her good to the latest hour of her life pity she should never see the faces of many some poorer they might have been than himself many richer that would have been ruined for ever but for her for his own part he reckoned himself one of the happiest of them all in being allowed to see her face to face and he hoped as soon as she was able to get out so farbut it was not so farshe would come to see how comfortable he was in his own house it ended at last in his giving a shove to the workbox on the table which though nothing worth otherwise he knew she could not mislike on account it was made out of all the samples of wood the dean her uncle had given to him in former times notwithstanding the immoderate length of his speeches and the impossibility he seemed to find of ending his visit helen was not much tired and when she was able to walk so far mrs pennant took her to see david price and in a most comfortable house she found him and every one in that house down to the youngest child gathered round her by degrees some more some less shy but all with gratitude beaming and smiling in their faces it was delightful to helen for there is no human heart so engrossed by sorrow so over whelmed by disappointment so closed against hope of happiness that will not open to the touch of gratitude chapter xii but there was still in helens inmost soul one deceitful hope she thought she had pulled it up by the roots many times and the last time completely but still a little fibre lurked and still it grew again it was the hope that cecilia would keep that last promise though at the moment helen had flung from her the possibility yet now she took it up again and she thought it was possible that cecilia might be true to her word if her child should be born alive and if it should be a boy it became a heartbeating suspense as the time approached and every day the news might be expected the post came in but three times a week at llansillen and every post day miss clarendon repeated her prophecy to her aunt you will see maam the child will be born in good time and alive you who have always been so much afraid for lady cecilia will find she has not feeling enough to do her any harm in due time came a note from the general a boy child and mother doing well give me joy the joy to miss clarendon was much increased by the triumph in her own perfectly right opinion mrs pennants was pure affectionate joy for the father and for lady cecilia for whom all sinner as she was in her nieces eyes this good soul had compassion helens anxiety to hear again and again every post was very natural the aunt thought quite superfluous the niece deemed it lady cecilia would do very well no doubt she prophesied again and laughed at the tremor the eagerness with which helen every day asked if there was any letter from cecilia at last one came the first in her own handwriting and it was to helen herself and it extinguished all hope helen could only articulate oh cecilia her emotion her disappointment were visible but unaccountable she could give no reason for it to miss clarendon whose wondering eye was upon her nor even to sympathising aunt pennant could she breathe a word without betraying cecilia she was silent and there was all that day and many succeeding days a hopelessness of languor in her whole appearance there was as miss clarendon termed it a backsliding in her recovery which grieved aunt pennant and helen had to bear imputation of caprice and of indolence from miss clarendon but even that eye immediately upon her that eye more severe than ever had not power to rouse her her soul was sunk within nothing farther to hope there was a dead calm and the stillness and loneliness of llansillen made that calm almost awful the life of great excitation which she had led previous to her illness rendered her more sensible of the change of the total want of stimulus the walks to prices cottage had been repeated but though it was a very bright spot the eye could not always be fixed upon it bodily exertion being more easy to her now than mental she took long walks and came in boasting how far she had been and looking quite exhausted and miss clarendon wondered at her wandering out alone then she tried to walk with miss clarendon and she was more tired though the walks were shorterand that was observed and was not agreeable either to the observer or to the observed helen endeavoured to make up for it she followed miss clarendon about in all her various occupations from flowergarden to conservatory and from conservatory to pheasantry and to all her pretty cottages and her schools and she saw and admired all the good that esther did so judiciously and with such extraordinary such wonderful energy nothing wonderful in it miss clarendon said and as she ungraciously rejected praise however sincere and required not sympathy helen was reduced to be a mere silent stupid useless standerby and she could not but feel this a little awkward she tried to interest herself for the poor people in the neighbourhood but their language was unintelligible to her and hers to them and it is hard work trying to make objects for oneself in quite a new place and with a preoccupying sorrow in the mind all the time it was not only hard work to helen but it seemed labour in vainbringing soil by handfulls to a barren rock where after all no plant will take root miss clarendon thought that labour could never be in vain one morning when it must be acknowledged that helen had been sitting too long in the same position with her head leaning on her hand miss clarendon in her abrupt voice asked how much longer helen do you intend to sit there doing only what is the worst thing in the world for youthinking helen started and said she feared she had been sitting too long idle if you wish to know how long i can tell you said miss clarendon just one hour and thirteen minutes by the stop watch said helen smiling by my watch said grave miss clarendon and in the mean time look at the quantity of work i have done and done so nicely said helen looking at it with admiration oh do not think to bribe me with admiration i would rather see you do something yourself than hear you praise my doings if i had anybody to work for i have so few friends now in the world who would care for anything i could do but i will tryyou shall see my dear esther by and bye by and bye no nonow i cannot bear to see you any longer in this halfalive halfdead state i know said helen that all you say is for my good i am sure your only object is my happiness your happiness is not in my power or in yours but it is in your power to deserve to be happy by doing what is rightby exerting yourselfthat is my object for i see you are in danger of being lost in indolence now you have the truth and the whole truth many a truth would have come mended from miss clarendons tongue if it had been uttered in a softer tone and if she had paid a little more attention to times and seasons but she held it the sacred duty of sincerity to tell a friend her faults as soon as seen and without circumlocution the next day helen set about a drawing she made it an object to herself to try to copy a view of the dear deanery in the same style as several beautiful drawings of miss clarendons while she looked over her portfolio several of her old sketches recalled remembrances which made her sigh frequently miss clarendon heard her and saidi wish you would cure yourself of that habit of sighing it is very bad for you i know it said helen despondency is not penitence continued esther reverie is not reparation she felt as desirous as ever to make helen happy at llansillen but she was provoked to find it impossible to do so of a strong body herself capable of great resistance powerful reaction under disappointment or grief she could ill make allowance for feebler health and spiritsperhaps feebler character for great misfortunes she had great sympathy but she could not enter into the details of lesser sorrows especially any of the sentimental kind which she was apt to class altogether under the headsorrows of my lord plumcake an expression which had sovereignly taken her fancy and which her aunt did not relish or quite understand mrs pennant was indeed as complete a contrast to her niece in these points as nature and habit joined could produce she was naturally of the most exquisitely sympathetic mimosasensibility shrinking and expanding to the touch of others joy or woe and instead of having by long use worn this out she had preserved it wonderfully fresh in advanced years but notwithstanding the contrast and seemingly incompatible difference between this aunt and niece the foundations of their characters both being good sound and true they lived on together well and loved each other dearly they had seldom differed so much on any point as in the present case as to their treatment of their patient and their guest scarcely a day passed in which they did not come to some mutual remonstrance and sometimes when she was by which was not pleasant to her as may be imagined yet perhaps even these little altercations and annoyances though they tried helens temper or grieved her heart at the moment were of use to her upon the whole by drawing her out of herself besides these daily vicissitudesmade by human temper manner and charactersupplied in some sort the total want of events and broke the monotony of these tedious months the generals bulletins however became at last more favourable mr churchill was decidedly better his physician hoped he might soon be pronounced out of danger the general said nothing of beauclerc but that he was he believed still at paris and from this time forward no more letters came from beauclerc to helen as his hopes of churchills recovery increased he expected every day to be released from his banishment and was resolved to write no more till he could say that he was free but helen though she did not allow it to herself felt this deeply she thought that her determined silence had at last convinced him that all pursuit of her was vain and that he submitted to her rejection she told herself it was what should be and yet she felt it bitterly lady cecilias letters did not mention him indeed they scarcely told anything they had become short and constrained the general she said advised her to go out more and her letters often concluded in haste with carriage at the door and all the usual excuses of a london life one day when helen was sitting intently drawing miss clarendon said helen so suddenly that she started and looked round miss clarendon was seated on a low stool at her aunts feet with one arm thrown over her great dogs neck he had laid his head on her lap and resting on him she looked up with a steadiness a fixity of repose which brought to helens mind raphaels beautiful figure of fortitude leaning on her lion she thought she had never before seen miss clarendon look so handsome so graceful so interesting she took care not to say so however helen continued miss clarendon do you remember the time when i was at clarendon park and quitted it so abruptly my reasons were good whatever my manner was the opinion of the world i am not apt to fear for myself or even for my brother but to the whispers of conscience i do listen helen i was conscious that certain feelings in my mind were too strongin me you would scarcely believe ittoo tender i had no reason to think that granville beauclerc liked me it was therefore utterly unfit that i should think of him i felt this i left clarendon park and from that moment i have refused myself the pleasure of his society i have altogether ceased to think of him this is the only way to conquer a hopeless attachment but you helen though you have commanded him never to attempt to see you again have not been able to command your own mind since mr churchill is so much better you expect that he will soon be pronounced out of dangeryou expect that mr beauclerc will come overcome here and be at your feet i expect nothing said helen in a faltering voice and then added resolutely i cannot foresee what mr beauclerc may do but of this be assured miss clarendon that until i stand as i once stood and as i deserve to stand in the opinion of your brother unless above all i can bring proofs to granvilles confiding heart that i have ever been unimpeachable of conduct and of mind and in all but one circumstance truetrue as yourself esthernever never though your brother and all the world consented never till i myself felt that i was proved to be as worthy to be his wife as i think i am would i consent to marry himno not though my heart were to break i believe it said mrs pennant and i wishoh how i wish that lady cecilia were hanged as she deserves said miss clarendon so do i i am sure but that is nothing to the present purpose no indeed said helen helen continued esther remember that lady blanche forrester is at paris helen shrank lady cecilia tells you there is no danger i say there is why should you say so my dear esther said her aunt has not this friend of yours always deceived misled you helen she can have no motive for deceiving me in this said helen i believe her believe her then cried miss clarendon believe her and do not believe me and take the consequences i have done helen sighed but though she might feel the want of the charm of lady cecilias suavity of manner of her agreeable and her agreeing temper yet she felt the safe solidity of principle in her present friend and admired esteemed and loved without fear of change her unblenching truth pretty ornaments of gold cannot be worked out of the native ore to fashion the rude mass some alloy must be used and when the slight filigree of captivating manner comes to be tested against the sterling worth of unalloyed sincerity weighed in the just balance of adversity we are glad to seize the solid gold and leave the ornaments to those that they deceive the fear about lady blanche forrester was however soon set at rest and this time lady cecilia was right a letter from her to helen announced that lady blanche was marriedactually married and not to granville beauclerc but to some other english gentleman at paris no matter whom lord beltravers and madame de st cymon disappointed had returned to london lady cecilia had seen lord beltravers and heard the news from him there could be no doubt of the truth of the intelligence and scarcely did helen herself rejoice in it with more sincerity than did miss clarendon and helen loved her for her candour as well as for her sympathy time passed on week after week rolled away at last general clarendon announced to his sister but without one word to helen that mr churchill was pronounced out of danger the news had been sent to his ward the general said and he expected granville would return from his banishment immediately quite taken up in the first tumult of her feelings at this intelligence helen scarcely observed that she had no letter from cecilia but even aunt pennant was obliged to confess in reply to her nieces observation that this was certainly very odd but we shall soon hear some explanation i hope miss clarendon shook her head she said that she had always thought how matters would end she judged from her brothers letters that he began to find out that he was not the happiest of men yet nothing to that effect was ever said by him one phrase only excepted in his letter to her on her last birthday which began with in our happy days my dear esther miss clarendon said nothing to helen upon this subject she refrained altogether from mentioning lady cecilia two three postdays passed without bringing any letter to helen the fourth very early in the morning long before the usual time for the arrival of the post rose came into her room with a letter in her hand saying from general clarendon maam his own man mr cockburn has just this minute arrived maamfrom london with a trembling hand helen tore the letter open not one word from general clarendon it was only a cover containing two notes one from lord davenant to the general the other from lady davenant to helen lord davenant said that lady davenants health had declined so alarmingly after their arrival at petersburgh that he had insisted upon her return to england and that as soon as the object of his mission was completed he should immediately follow her a vessel he said containing letters from england had been lost so that they were in total ignorance of what had occurred at home and indeed it appeared from the direction of lady davenants note to helen written on her landing in england that she had left russia without knowing that the marriage had been broken off or that helen had quitted general clarendons she wrotelet me see you and granville once more before i die be in london at my own house to meet me i shall be there as soon as i can be moved the initials only of her name were signed elliot added a postscript saying that her lady had suffered much from an unusually long passage and that she was not sure what day they could be in town there was nothing from lady ceciliacockburn said that her ladyship had not been at home when he set out that his master had ordered him to travel all night to get to llansillen as fast as possible and to make no delay in delivering the letter to miss stanley to set out instantly to be in town at her house to meet lady davenant was of course helens immediate determination general clarendon had sent his travelling carriage for her and under the circumstances her friends could have no wish but to speed her departure miss clarendon expressed surprise at there being no letter from lady cecilia and would see and question cockburn herself but nothing more was to be learned than what he had already told that the packet from lady davenant had come by express to his master after lady cecilia had driven out as it had been her custom of late almost every day to kensington to see her child nothing could be more natural mrs pennant thought and she only wondered at esthers unconvinced look of suspicion nothing surely can be more natural my dear esther to which esther replied very likely maam helen was too much hurried and too much engrossed by the one idea of lady davenant to think of what they said at parting she had scarcely time even to thank her two friends for all their kindness but they understood her feelings and as miss clarendon said words on that point were unnecessary aunt pennant embraced her again and again and then let her go saying i must not detain you my dear but i must said miss clarendon for one moment there is one point on which my parting words are necessary helen keep clear of lady cecilias affairs whatever they may be hear none of her secrets helen wished she had never heard any did not believe there were any more to hear but she promised herself and miss clarendon that she would observe this excellent counsel and now she was in the carriage and on her road to town and now she had leisure to breathe and to think and to feel her thoughts and feelings however could be only repetitions of fears and hopes about lady davenant and uncertainty and dread of what would happen when she should require explanation of all that had occurred in her absence and how would lady cecilia he able to meet her mothers penetrationill or well lady davenant was so clearsighted and how shall i thought helen without plunging deeper in deceit avoid revealing the truth shall i assist cecilia to deceive her mother in her last moments or shall i break my promise betray cecilias secret and at last be the death of her mother by the shock it is astonishing how often the mind can go over the same thoughts and feelings without coming to any conclusion any ease from racking suspense in the mean time on rolled the carriage and cockburn according to his masters directions got her over the ground with all conceivable speed chapter xiii when they were within the last stage of london the carriage suddenly stopped and helen who was sitting far back deep in her endless reverie started forwardcockburn was at the carriagedoor my lady coming to meet you miss stanley it was cecilia herself but cecilia so changed in her whole appearance that helen would scarcely have known her she was so much struck that she hardly knew what was said but the carriagedoors were opened and lady cecilia was beside her and cockburn shut the door without permitting one moments delay and on they drove lady cecilia was excessively agitated helen had not power to utter a word and was glad that cecilia went on speaking very fast though she spoke without appearing to know well what she was saying of helens goodness in coming so quickly of her fears that she would never have been in timebut she was in timeher mother had not yet arrived clarendon had gone to meet her on the road she believedshe was not quite certain that seemed very extraordinary to helen not quite certain said she no i am not replied cecilia and she coloured her very pale cheek flushed but she explained not at all she left that subject and spoke of the friends helen had left at llansillenthen suddenly of her mothers returnher hopesher fearsand then without going on to the natural idea of seeing her mother and of how soon they should see her began to talk of beauclercof mr churchills being quite out of dangerof the generals expectation of beauclercs immediate return and then my dearest helen said she all will be oh i do not know how it will be cried she her tone changing suddenly and from the breathless hurry in which she had been running on sinking at once to a low broken tone and speaking very slowly i cannot tell what will become of any of us we can never be happy againany one of us and it is all my doingand i cannot die oh helen when i tell you she stopped and miss clarendons warning counsel all her own past experience were full in helens mind and after a moments silence she stopped cecilia just as she seemed to have gathered power to speak and begged that she would not tell her any thing that was to be kept secret she could not would not hear any secrets she turned her head aside and let down the glass and looked out as if determined not to be compelled to receive this confidence have you then lost all interest all affection for me helen i deserve itbut you need not fear me now helen i have done with deception would to heaven i had never begun with it it was the tone and look of truthshe steadily fixed her eyes upon helenand instead of the bright beams that used to play in those eyes there was now a dark deepseated sorrow almost despair helen was touched to the heart it was indeed impossible for her it would have been impossible for any one who had any feeling to have looked upon lady cecilia clarendon at that moment and to have recollected what she had so lately been without pity the friend of her childhood looked upon her with all the poignant anguish of compassion oh my dear cecilia how changed helen was not sensible that she uttered the words how changed changed yes i believe i am said lady cecilia in a calm voice very much changed in appearance but much more in reality my mind is more altered than my person oh helen if you could see into my mind at this moment and know how completely it is changedbut it is all in vain now you have suffered and suffered for me but your sufferings could not equal mine you lost love and happiness but still conscious of deserving both i had both at my command and i could enjoy neither under the consciousness the torture of remorse helen threw her arms round her and exclaimed do not think of meall will be wellsince you have resolved on the truth all will yet be well cecilia sighed deeply and went oni am sure helen you were surprised that my child was born alive at least i was i believe its mother had not feeling enough to endanger its existence well clarendon has that comfort at all events and as a boy it will never put him in mind of his mother well helen i had hopes of myself to the last minute i really and truly hoped as i told you that i should have had courage to tell him all when i put the child into his arms but his joyi could not dash his joyi could notand then i thought i never could i knew you would give me up i gave up all hope of myself i was very unhappy and clarendon thought i was very ill and i acknowledge that i was anxious about you and let all the blame fall on you innocent generous creaturei heard my husband perpetually upbraiding you when he saw me illall he said the consequences of your falsehoodand all the time i knew it was my own my dear helen it is impossible to tell you all the daily hourly necessities for dissimulation which occurred every day you know we were to send to inquire for mr churchill and every day when clarendon brought me the bulletin he pitied me and blamed you and the double dealing in my countenance he never suspectedalways interpreted favourably oh such confidence as he had in meand how it has been wasted abused then letters from beauclerchow i bore to hear them read i cannot conceive and at each time that i escaped i rejoiced and reproached myselfand reproached myself and rejoiced i succeeded in every effort at deception and was cursed by my own success encouraged to proceed i soon went on without shame and without fear the general heard me defending you against the various reports which my venomous cousin had circulated and he only admired what he called my amiable zeal his love for me increased but it gave me no pleasure for helen now i am going to tell you an extraordinary turn which my mind took for which i cannot accounti can hardly believe itit seems out of human naturemy love for him decreasednot only because i felt that he would hate me if he discovered my deceit but because he was lowered in my estimation i had always had as every body has even my mother the highest opinion of his judgment to that judgment i had always looked up it had raised me in my own opinion it was a motive to me to be equal to what he thought me but now that motive was gone i no longer looked up to him his credulous affection had blinded his judgmenthe was my dupe i could not reverencei could not love one who was my dupe but i cannot tell you how shocked i was at myself when i felt my love for him decrease every time i saw him i thought myself a monster i had grown use to every thing but thatthat i could not endure it was a darkness of the minda coldness it was as if the sun had gone out of the universe it was moreit was worseit was as if i was alone in the world home was a desert to me i went out every evening sometimes but rarely clarendon accompanied me he had become more retired his spirits had declined with mine and though he was glad i should go out and amuse myself yet he was always exact as to the hours of my return i was often latelater than i ought to have been and i made a multitude of paltry excuses this it was i believe which first shook his faith in my truth but i was soon detected in a more decided failure you know i never had the least taste for play of any kind you may remember i used to be scolded for never minding what i was about at ecart in short i never had the least love for itit wearied me but now that my spirits were gone it was a sort of intoxication in which i cannot say i indulgedfor it was no indulgence but to which i had recourse louisa castlefort you know was always fond of playgot into her first difficulties by that meansshe led me on i lost a good deal of money to her and did not care about it as long as i could pay but presently it came to a time when i could not pay without applying to the general i applied to him but under false pretencesto pay this bill or that or to buy something which i never bought this occurred so often and to such extent that he suspectedhe discovered how it went he told me so he spoke in that low suppressed that terrible voice which i had heard once before i said i know not what in deprecation of his anger i am not angry cecilia said he i caught his hand and would have detained him he withdrew that hand and looking at me exclaimed beautiful creature half those charms would i give for truth he left the room and there was contempt in his look all my loveall my reverence returned for him in an instant but what could i say he never recurred to the subject and now when i saw the struggle in his mind my passion for him returned in all its force people who flattered me often you know said i was fascinating and i determined to use my powers of fascination to regain my husbands heart how little i knew that heart i dressed to please himoh i never dressed myself with such care in my most coquettish daysi gave a splendid ball i dressed to please himhe used to be delighted with my dancing he had said no matter what but i wanted to make him say itfeel it again he neither said nor felt it i saw him standing looking at me and at the close of the dance i heard from him one sigh i was more in love with him than when first we were married and he saw it but that did not restore me to his confidencehis esteem nothing could have done that butwhat i had not one step in dissimulation led to another after lord beltravers returned from paris on lady blanches marriage i used to meet him continually at louisa castleforts as for play that was over with me for ever but i went to louisas continually because it was the gayest house i could go to i used to meet lord beltravers there and he pretended to pay me a vast deal of attention to which i was utterly indifferent but his object was to push his sister into society again by my means he took advantage of that unfortunate note which i had received from madame de st cymon when she was at old forest he wanted me to admit her among my acquaintance he urged it in every possible way and was excessively vexed that it would not do not that he cared for her he often spoke of her in a way that shocked me but it hurt his pride that she should be excluded from the society to which her rank entitled her i had met her at louisas once or twice but when i found that for her brothers sake she was always to be invited i resolved to go there no more and i made a merit of this with clarendon he was pleased he said that is well that is right my dear cecilia and he went out more with me one night at the opera the comtesse de st cymon was in the box opposite to us no lady with her only some gentlemen she watched me i did all i could to avoid her eye but at an unlucky moment she caught mine bent forward and had the assurance to bow the general snatched the operaglass from my hand made sure who it was and then said to me how does that woman dare to claim your notice lady cecilia i am afraid there must have been some encouragement on your part none said i nor ever shall be you see i take no notice but you must have taken notice or this could never be no indeed persisted i helen i really forgot at the moment that first unfortunate note an instant afterwards i recollected it and the visit about the cameos but that was not my fault i had to be sure dropped a card in return at her door and i ought to have mentioned that but i really did not recollect it till the words had passed my lips and then it was too late and i did not like to go back and spoil my case by an exception the general did not look quite satisfied he did not receive my assertions as implicitly as formerly he left the box afterwards to speak to some one and while he was gone in came lord beltravers after some preliminary nothings he went directly to the point and said in an assured manner i believe you do not know my sister at this distance she has been endeavouring to catch your eye the comtesse de st cymon does me too much honour said i with a slight inclination of the head and elevation of the eyebrow which spoke sufficiently plainly unabashed and with a most provoking almost sneering look he replied madame de st cymon had wished to say a few words to your ladyship on your own account am i to understand this cannot be on my own account said i i do not in the least understand your lordship i am not sure said he that i perfectly comprehend it but i know that you sometimes drive to kensington and sometimes take a turn in the gardens there my sister lives at kensington and could not she without infringing etiquette meet you in your walk and have the honour of a few words with you something she wants to say to you and here he lowered his voice about a locket and colonel daubigny excessively frightened and hearing some one at the door i answered i do not know i believe i shall drive to kensington tomorrow he bowed delighted and relieved me from his presence that instant the moment afterwards general clarendon came in he asked me was not that lord beltravers whom i met yes said i he came to reproach me for not noticing his sister and i answered him in such a manner as to make him clear that there was no hope you did right said he if you did so my mind was in such confusion that i could not quite command my countenance and i put up my fan as if the lights hurt me cecilia said he take care what you are about remember it is not my request only but my command to my wife he laid solemn stress on the words that she should have no communication with this woman my dear clarendon i have not the least wish i do not ask what your wishes may be i require only your obedience never have i heard such austere words from him i turned to the stage and i was glad to seize the first minute i could to get away but what was to be done if i did not go to kensington there was this locket and i knew not what standing out against me i knew that this wretched woman had had colonel daubigny in her train abroad and supposed that he musttreacherous profligate as he washave given the locket to her and now i was so afraid of its coming to clarendons eyes or earsand yet why should i have feared his knowing about it colonel daubigny stole it just as he stole the picture i had got it for you do you recollect perfectly said helen and your mother missed it yes continued lady cecilia o that i had had the sense to do nothing about it but i was so afraid of its somehow bringing everything to light my cowardicemy consciencemy consciousness of that first fatal falsehood before my marriage has haunted me at the most critical moments it has risen against me and stood like an evil spirit threatening me from the right path i went to kensington trusting to my own good fortune which had so often stood me in stead but madame de st cymon was too cunning for me and so interested so mean she actually bargained for giving up the locket she hinted that she knew colonel daubigny had never been your lover and ended by saying she had not the locket with her and though i made her understand that the general would never allow me to receive her at my own house yet she hoped i could manage an introduction for her to some of my friends and that she would bring the locket on monday if i would in the mean time try at least with lady emily greville and mrs holdernesse i felt her meanness and yet i was almost as mean myself for i agreed to do what i could monday came clarendon saw me as i was going out and as he handed me into the carriage he asked me where i was going to kensington i said and addedoh helen i am ashamed to tell you i addedi am going to see my child and there i found madame de st cymon and i had to tell her of my failure with lady emily and mrs holdernesse i softened their refusal as much as i could but i might have spared myself the trouble for she only retorted by something about english prudery at this moment a shower of rain came on and she insisted upon my taking her home come in said she when the carriage stopped at her door if you will come in i will give it to you now and you need not have the trouble of calling again i had the folly to yield though i saw that it was a trick to decoy me into her house and to make it pass for a visit it all flashed upon me and yet i could not resist for i thought i must obtain the locket at all hazards i resolved to get it from her before i left the house and then i thought all would be finished she looked triumphant as she followed me into her saloon and gave a malicious smile which seemed to say you see you are visiting me after all after some nonsensical conversation meant to detain me i pressed for the locket and she produced it it was indeed the very one that had been made for youbut just at that instant while she still held it in her band the door suddenly opened and clarendon stood opposite to me i heard madame de st cymons voice but of what she said i have no idea i heard nothing but the single word rain and with scarcely strength to articulate i attempted to follow up that excuse clarendons look of contemptbut he commanded himself advanced calmly to me and said i came to kensington with these letters they have just arrived by express lady davenant is in englandshe is ill he gave me the packet and left the room and i heard the sound of his horses feet the next instant as he rode off i broke from madame de st cymon forgetting the locket and everything i asked my servants which way the general had gone to town i perceived that he must have been going to look for me at the nurses and had seen the carriage at madame de st cymons door i hastened after him and then i recollected that i had left the locket on the table at madame de st cymons that locket for which i had hazardedlosteverything the moment i reached home i ran to clarendons room he was not there and oh helen i have not seen him since from some orders which he left about horses i suppose he went to meet my mother i dared not follow him she had desired me to wait for her arrival at her own house all yesterday all last night helen what i have suffered i could not bear it any longer and then i thought of coming to meet you i thought i must see you before my mother arrivedmy mother but clarendon will not have met her till today oh helen you feel all that i fearall that i foresee lady cecilia sank back and helen overwhelmed with all she had heard could for some time only pity her in silence and at last could only suggest that the general would not have time for any private communication with lady davenant as her woman would be in the carriage with her and the general was on horseback it was late in the day before they reached town as they came near grosvenor square cockburn inquired whether they were to drive home or to lady davenants to my mothers certainly and as fast as you can lady davenant had not arrived but there were packages in the hall her courier and her servants who said that general clarendon was with her but not in the carriage he had sent them on no message for lady cecilia but that lady davenant would be in town this night to nightsome hours still of suspense as long as there were arrangements to be made anything to do or to think of but that meeting of which they dared not think it was endurable but too soon all was settled nothing to be done but to wait and watch to hear the carriages roll past and listen and start and look at each other and sink back disappointed lady cecilia walked from the sofa to the window and looked out and back againcontinually continually till at last helen begged her to sit down she sat down before an old pianoforte of her mothers on which her eyes fixed it was one on which she had often played with helen when they were children happy innocent days said she i never shall we be so happy again helen but i cannot think of it she rose hastily and threw herself on the sofa a servant who had been watching at the halldoor came inthe carriage my lady lady davenant is coming lady cecilia started up they ran down stairs the carriage stopped and in the imperfect light they saw the figure of lady davenant scarcely altered leaning upon general clarendons arm the first sound of her voice was feebler softer than formerlyquite tender when she said as she embraced them both by turns my dear children you have accomplished your journey lady davenant better than you expected said the general something struck her in the tone of his voice she turned quickly saw her daughter lay her hand upon his arm and saw that arm withdrawn they all entered the saloonit was a blaze of light lady davenant shading her eyes with her hand looked round at the countenances which she had not yet seen lady cecilia shrank back the penetrating eyes turned from her glanced at helen and fixed upon the general what is all this cried she helen threw her arms round lady davenant let us think of you first and onlybe calm lady davenant broke from her and pressing forwards exclaimed i must see my daughterif i have still a daughter cecilia the general moved lady cecilia who had sunk upon a chair behind him attempted to rise lady davenant stood opposite to her the light was now full upon her face and figure and her mother saw how it was changed and looking back at helen she said in a low awful tone i see it the black spot has spread scarcely had lady davenant pronounced these words when she was seized with violent spasms the general had but just time to save her from falling he could not leave her all was terror even her own woman so long used to these attacks said it was the worst she had ever seen and for some time evidently feared it would terminate fatally at last slowly she came to herself but perfectly in possession of her intellects she sat up looked round saw the agony in her daughters countenance and holding out her hand to her said cecilia if there is anything that i ought to know it should be said now cecilia caught her mothers hand and threw herself upon her knees helen helen stay cried she do not go clarendon he stood leaning against the chimneypiece motionless while cecilia in a faltering voice began her voice gaining strength she went on and poured out alleven from the very beginning that first suppression of the truth that first cowardice then all that followed from that one falsehoodalleven to the last degradation when in the power in the presence of that bad woman her husband found and left her she shuddered as she came to the thought of that look of his and not daring not having once dared while she spoke to turn towards him her eyes fixed upon her mothers but as she finished speaking her head sank she laid her face on the sofa beside her she felt her mothers arm thrown over her and she sobbed convulsively there was silence i have still a daughter were the first words that broke the silence not such as i might have had but that is my own fault oh mother i have still a daughter repeated lady davenant there is continued she turning to general clarendon there is a redeeming power in truth she may yet be more worthy to be your wife than she has ever yet been never exclaimed the general his countenance was rigid as iron then suddenly it relaxed and going up to helen he said i have done you injustice miss stanley i have been misled i have done you injustice and by heaven i will do you public justice cost me what it will beauclerc will be in england in a few days at the altar i will give you to him publicly in the face of all the world will i mark my approbation of his choice publicly will i repair the wrong i have done you i will see his happiness and yours before i leave england for ever lady cecilia started up clarendon was all she could say yes lady cecilia clarendon said he all the stern fixedness of his face returning at onceyes lady cecilia clarendon we separate now and for ever then turning from her he addressed lady davenant i shall be ordered on some foreign service your daughter lady davenant will remain with you while i am still in england unless you wish otherwise leave my daughter with me my dear general till my death said lady davenant she spoke calmly but the general after a respectfulan affectionate pressure of the hand she held out to him said that may be far distant i trust in god and we shall at all events meet again the day of helens marriage and if that day is to be a happy day to me cried helen to me or to your own beloved ward general clarendon it must be happy to cecilia as happy as she has left it in my power to make her when i am gone my fortune name it not as happiness for my daughter interrupted lady davenant or you do her injustice general clarendon i name it but to do her justice said he it is all that she has left it in my power to give and then his long suppressed passion suddenly bursting forth he turned to cecilia all i can give to one so falsefalse from the first moment to the lastfalse to meto me who so devotedly fondly blindly loved her he rushed out of the room then lady davenant taking her daughter in her arms said my child return to me she sank back exhausted mrs elliott was summoned she wished them all out of the room and said so but lady davenant would have her daughter stay beside her and with cecilias hand in hers she fell into a profound slumber chapter xiv on awaking in the morning after some longexpected event has happened we feel in doubt whether it has really occurred or whether it is all a dream then comes the awful sense of waking truth and the fear that what has been done or said is irremediable and then the astonishment that it really is done it is over helen repeated to herself repeated aloud before she could well bring herself from that state of half belief before she could recover her stunned faculties characters which she thought she perfectly understood had each appeared in these new circumstances different from what she had expected from cecilia she had scarcely hoped even at the last moment for such perfect truth in her confession from lady davenant not so much indulgence not all that tenderness for her daughter from the general less violence of expression more feeling for cecilia he had not allowed the merit of her candour her courage at the last it was a perfectly voluntary confession all that concerned colonel daubigny and the letters could never have been known to the general by any other means disappointed love confidence duped and his pride of honour had made him forget himself in anger even to cruelty helen thought he would feel this hereafter fancied he must feel it even now but that though he might relent he would not recede though he might regret that he had made the determination he would certainly abide by it that which he had resolved to do would certainly be donethe separation between him and cecilia would take place and though all was clear and bright in helens own prospects the generals esteem restored his approbation to be publicly marked beauclerc to be convinced of her perfect innocence beauclerc freed from all fear and danger returning all love and joy yet she could not be happyit was all mixed with bitterness anguish for cecilia she had so often so forcibly urged her to this confession and now it was made did helen regret that it was made no independently of her own cleared character she was satisfied even for cecilias sake for it was right whatever were the consequences it was right and in the confusion and discordance of her thoughts and feelings this was the only fixed point to this conclusion she had come but had not been able farther to settle her mind when she was told that lady davenant was now awake and wished to see her lady davenant renovated by sleep appeared to helen even when she saw her by daylight scarcely altered in her looks there was the same life and energy and elasticity and strength helen hoped not only of mind but of body and quick as that hope rose as she stood beside her bed and looked upon her lady davenant marked it and said you are mistaken my dear helen i shall not last long i am now to consider how i am to make the most of the little life that remains how to repair as far as may be as far as can be in my last days the errors of my youth you know helen what i mean and it is now no time to waste words therefore i shall not begin by wasting upon you helen any reproaches foolish generous weak creature that you are and as the best of human beings will ever bei must be content with you as you are and so continued she in a playful tone we must love one another perhaps all the better for not being too perfect and indeed my poor child you have been well punished already and the worst of criminals need not be punished twice of the propensity to sacrifice your own happiness for others you will never be cured but you will i trust in future when i am gone never to return be true to yourself now as to my daughter lady davenant then went over with helen every circumstance in cecilias confession and showed how in the midst of the shock she had felt at the disclosure of so much falsehood hope for her daughters future truth had risen in her mind even from the courage and fulness and exactness of her confession and it is not continued she a sudden reformation i have no belief in sudden reformations i think i see that this change in cecilias mind has been some time working out by her own experience of the misery the folly the degradation of deceit helen earnestly confirmed this from her own observations and from the expressions which had burst forth in the fulness of cecilias heart and strength of her conviction when she told her all that had passed in her mind that is well pursued lady davenant but principles cannot be depended upon till confirmed by habit and cecilias nature is so variableimpressions on her are easily even deeply made but all in sand they may shift with the next tidemay be blown away by the next wind oh no exclaimed helen there is no danger of that i see the impression deepening every hour from your kindness and helen hesitated and besides besides said lady davenant usually comes as the arrireban of weak reasons you mean to say that the sight of my sufferings must strengthen must confirm all her principlesher taste for truth yes continued she in her most firm tone cecilias being with me during my remaining days will be painful but salutary to her she sees as you do that all the falsehood meant to save me has been in vain that at last the shock has only hastened my end it must be so helen look at it steadily in the best point of viewthe evil you cannot avert take the good and be thankful for it and ceciliahow did she feel wretched she was but still in her wretchedness there was within her a relieved conscience and the sustaining power of truth and she had now the support of her mothers affection and the consolation of feeling that she had at last done helen justice to her really generous affectionate disposition there was in the return of her feelings to their natural course an indescribable sense of relief broken crushed as were all her own hopes her sympathy even in the depths of her misery now went pure free from any windings of deceit direct to helens happy prospects in which she shared with all the eagerness of her warm heart beauclerc arrived found the general at home expecting him and in his guardians countenance and voice he saw and heard only what was natural to the man the general was prepared and beauclerc was himself in too great impatience to hear the facts to attend much to the manner in which things were told lady davenant has returned ill her daughter is with her and helen and helen and you may be happy beauclerc if there be truth in woman said the general go to heryou will find i can do justice go and return when you can tell me that your weddingday is fixed and beauclerc he called after him let it be as soon as possible the only unnecessary advice my dear guardian has ever given me beauclerc laughing replied the generals prepared composure had not calculated upon this laugh this slight jest his features gave way beauclerc struck with a sudden change in the generals countenance released his hand from the congratulatory shake in which its power failed the general turned away as if to shun inquiry and beauclerc however astonished respected his feelings and said no more he hastened to lady davenant with all a lovers speedwith all a lovers joy saw the first expression in helens eyes and with all a friends sorrow for lady davenant and for the general heard all that was to be told of lady cecilias affairs her mother undertook the explanation cecilia herself did not appear in the first rush of beauclercs joy in helens cleared fame he was ready to forgive all the deceit yes to forgive all but it was such forgiveness as contempt can easily grant which can hardly be received by any soul not lost to honour this lady davenant felt and felt so keenly that helen trembled for her she remained silent pressing her hand upon her heart which told her sense of approaching danger it was averted by the calmness the truth the justice with which helen spoke to beauclerc of cecilia as she went on lady davenants colour returned and beauclercs ready sympathy went with her as far as she pleased till she came to one point from which he instantly started back helen proposed if beauclerc would consent to put off their marriage till the general should be reconciled to cecilia attempt it not helen cried lady davenant delay not for any consideration your marriage must be as soon as possible for my sake for ceciliasmark mefor cecilias sake as soon as possible let it be it is but justice that her conscience should be so far relieved let her no longer obstruct your union let me have the satisfaction of seeing it accomplished name the day helen i may not have many to live the day the earliest possible was named by helen and the moment it was settled lady davenant hurried beauclerc away sayingreturn to general clarendonspare him suspenseit is all we can do for him the generals wishes in this and in all that followed were to be obeyed he desired that the marriage should be public that all should be bidden of rank fashion and noteall their family connections lady katrine hawksby he especially named to do justice to helen seemed the only pleasurable object now remaining to him in speaking to beauclerc he never once named lady cecilia it seemed a tacit compact between him and beauclerc that her name should not be pronounced they talked of lady davenant the general said he did not think her in such danger as she seemed to consider herself to be his opinion was he declared confirmed by his own observation by the strength of mind and of body which she had shown since her arrival in england beauclerc could only hope that he was right and the general went on to speak of the service upon which he was to be employed said that all arrangements laying an emphasis upon the word would be transacted by his man of business he spoke of what would happen after he quitted england and left his ward a legacy of some favourite horse which he used to ride at clarendon park and seemed to take it for granted that beauclerc and helen would be sometimes there when he was gone then having cleared his throat several times the general desired that lady cecilias portrait which he designated only as the picture over the chimneypiece in my room should be sent after him and taking leave of beauclerc he set off for clarendon park where he was to remain till the day before the weddingthe day following he had fixed for his departure from england when beauclerc was repeating this conversation to helen lady davenant came into the room just as he was telling these last particulars she marked the smile the hope that was excited but shook her head and said raise no false hopes in my daughters mind i conjure you and she turned the conversation to other subjects beauclerc had been to see mr churchill and of that visit lady davenant wished to hear as to health beauclerc said that mr churchill had recovered almost perfectly but there remains and i fear will always remain a little lameness not disabling but disfiguringan awkwardness in moving which to a man of his personal pretensions is trying to the temper but after noticing the impediment as he advanced to meet me he shook my hand cordially and smiling said you see i am a marked man i always wished to be so you know so pray do not repent my good friend he saw i was too much moved for jesting then he took it more seriously but still kindly assuring me that i had done him real service it is always of service he said to be necessitated to take time for quiet reflection of which he had had sufficient in his hours of solitary confinementthis little adversity had left him leisure to be good and then continued beauclerc churchill adverting to our foolish quarrel to clear that off my mind threw the whole weight of the blame at once comfortably upon the absenton beltravers churchill said we had indeed been a couple of bravely blind fools he ought as he observed to have recollected in time that a full hot horse who being allowed his way selfmettle tires him so that was good and horace in perfect goodhumour with me and himself and all the world played on with the past and the future glad he had no more of his bones to exfoliate glad after so many months of failure in the first intention to find himself in a whole skin and me safe returned from transportationspoke of helen seriously said that his conduct to her was the only thing that weighed upon his mind but he hoped that his sincere penitence and his months of suffering would be considered as sufficient atonement for his having brought her name before the public and he finished by inviting himself to our wedding if it were only for the pleasure of seeing what sort of a face lady katrine hawksby will have upon the occasionit was told of a celebrated statesman jealous of his colleagues horace says that every commonly good speech cost him a twinge of the gout and every uncommonly good one sent him to bed with a regular fit now horace protests that every commonly decent marriage of her acquaintance costs lady katrine at least a sad headache but miss stanleys marriage likely as it is to be so happy after all as he politely said foredooms poor lady katrine to a months heartache at the least and a face full ell long whether in his penitence he had forsworn slander or not it was plain that churchill had not lost either his taste talent or power of sarcasm and of this beauclerc could have given and in time gave further illustrations but it was in a case which came home to him rather too nearly and on which his reports did not flow quite so fluentlytouching lord beltravers it was too tender a subject beauclerc was ashamed of himself for having been so deceived when after all his guardian had done to save his fortune after all that noble sacrifice had been made he found that it was to no good end but for the worst purpose possible lord beltravers as it was now clear never had the slightest intention of living in that house of his ancestors on which beauclerc had lavished his thousands ay and tens of thousands but while he was repairing and embellishing and furnishing old forest fit for an english aristocrat of the first water the lord beltravers at the gamingtable pledged it and lost it and sold it and it went to the hammer this came out in the first fury of lord beltravers upon his sisters marriage at paris and then and there beauclerc first came to the perception that his good friend had predestined him and his fortune for the lady blanche whom all the time he considered as a fool and a puppet and for whom he had not the slightest affection it was all for his own interested purposes beauclerc suddenly opened his eyes wide and saw it all at once how it had happened that they had never seen it before notwithstanding all that the general on one side and lady davenant on the other had done to force them open was incomprehensible but as lady davenant observed a sort of cataract comes over the best eyes for a time and the patient will not suffer himself to be couched and if you struggle to perform the operation that is to do him good against his will it is odds but you blind him for life helen could not however understand how granville could have been so completely deceived except that it had been impossible for him to imagine the exquisite meanness of that mans mind there cried beauclerc you see my fault was having too little instead of too much imagination lady davenant smiled and said it has been admirably observed that it is among men as among certain tribes of animals it is sometimes only necessary that one of the herd should step forward and lead the way to make all the others follow with alacrity and submission and i solve the whole difficulty thus i suppose that lord beltravers just following beauclercs lead succeeded in persuading him that he was a man of genius and a noble fellow by allowing all beauclercs own paradoxes adopting all his ultraoriginal opinions and in short sending him back the image of his own mind till granville had been caught by it and had fairly fallen in love with ita mental metaphysical narcissus footnote lord mahon after all continued lady davenant smiling of all the follies of youth the dangerous folly of trying to do goodthat for which you stand convicted may be the most easily pardoned the most safely left to time and experience to cure you know granville that ever since the time of alexander the greats great tutor the characteristic faults of youth and age have been the too much and the too little in youth the too much confidence in others and in themselves the too much of enthusiasmtoo much of benevolencein age alas too little and with this youth who has the too much in every thingwhat shall we do with him helen take him for better for worse you must and i must love him as i have done from his childhood a little while longerto the end of my life a little longer to the end of her life said beauclerc to himself as leaning on the back of helens chair he looked at lady davenant i cannot believe that she whom i see before me is passing away to be with us but a little longer so full of life as she appears such energy divine no no she will live live long and as his eyes looked that hope helen caught it and yet she doubted and sighed but still she had hope cecilia had none she was sitting behind her mother she looked up at helen and shook her head she had seen more of her mothers danger she had been with her in nights of fearful struggle she had been with her just after she had written to lord davenant what she must have felt to be a farewell letterletter too which contained the whole history of cecilias deception and helens difficulties subjects so agitating that the writing of them had left her mother in such a state of exhaustion that cecilia could think only with terror for her yet she exerted all her power over herself to hide her anguish not only for her mothers but for helens sake the preparations for the wedding went on pressed forward by lady davenant as urgently as the general could desire the bridesmaids were to be lady emily grevilles younger sister lady susan and at helens particular request miss clarendon full of joy wonder and sympathy in wedding haste miss clarendon and mrs pennant arrived both delighted that it was all happily settled for helen which most it was scarcely possible to say but which most curious as to the means by which it had been settled it was very possible to see when miss clarendon had secured a private moment with helen she began now tell metell me everything about yourself helen could only repeat what the general had already written to her sisterthat he was now convinced that the reports concerning miss stanley were false his esteem restored his public approbation to be given beauclerc satisfied and her rejection honourably retracted i will ask you no more helen by word or look said esther i understand it all my brother and lady cecilia are separated for life and now let us go to aunt pennant she will not annoy you by her curiosity but how she will be able to manage her sympathy amongst you with these crossing demands i know not lady cecilias wretchedness will almost spoil my aunts joy for youit cannot be pure joy pure joy how far from it helens sigh told and miss clarendon had scarcely patience enough with lady cecilia to look at her again had scarcely seconded at least with good grace a suggestion of mrs pennants that they should prevail on lady cecilia to take a turn in the park with them she looked so much in want of fresh air we can go now my dear esther you know before it is time for that picture sale at which you are to be before two oclock lady davenant desired cecilia to go helen will be with me do my dear cecilia go she went and before the awkwardness of miss clarendons silence ceased and before mrs pennant had settled which glass or which blind was best up or down lady cecilia burst into tears thanked aunt pennant for her sympathy and now above the fear of miss clarendonabove all fear but that of doing further wrong by concealment she at once told the whole truth that they might as well as the general do full justice to helen and that they might never never blame clarendon for the separation which was to be that he should have mentioned nothing of her conduct even to his sister was not surprising i know his generous nature said cecilia but i never knew yours till this moment cecilia cried miss clarendon embracing her my sister nowseparation or not but there need be no separation said kind aunt pennant cecilia sighed and miss clarendon repeated you will find in me a sister at all events she now saw cecilia as she really wasfaults and virtues perhaps indeed in this moment of revulsion of feeling in the surprise of gratified confidence she overvalued lady cecilias virtues and was inclined to do her more than justice in her eagerness to make generous reparation for unjust suspicion chapter xv after setting down lady cecilia at her mothers the aunt and niece proceeded to the picture sale which miss clarendon was eager to attend as she was in search of a pendant to a famous berghem she possessed and while she was considering the picture she had the advantage of hearing a story which seemed indeed to be told for the amusement of the whole room by a party of fashionables who were standing near hera wonderful story of a locket which was going about it was variously told but all agreed in one pointthat a young married lady of high rank had never dared to appear in the world since her husband had seen this locket in her handsit had brought out somethingsomething which had occurred before marriageand here mysterious nods were interchanged another version stated that the story had not yet been fully explained to the husband that he had found the locket on the table in a room that he had suddenly entered where he discovered her kneeling to the person in questionthe person in question being sometimes a woman and sometimes a man then leaned forward stretching her scraggy neck one who had good reason to believe that the husband would soon speak outthe public would soon hear of a separation and everybody must be satisfied that there could not be a separation without good grounds miss clarendon inquired from a gentleman near them who the lady was with the outstretched scraggy necklady katrine hawksby miss clarendon knew her only by reputation she did not know miss clarendon either by reputation or by sight and she went on to say she would venture any wager that the separation would take place within a month in short there could be no doubt that before marriageand she ended with a look which gave a deathblow to the reputation exceedingly shocked miss clarendon not only from a sense of justice to lady cecilia but from feeling for her brothers honour longed to reply in defence but she constrained herself for once and having been assured by lady cecilia that all had been confessed to her mother she thought that lady davenant must be the best person to decide what should be done she went to her house immediately sent in word that she begged to see lady davenant for two or three minutes alone was admitted cecilia immediately vacated the chair beside her mothers bed and left the room miss clarendon felt some difficulty in beginning but she forced herself to repeat all she had heard then lady davenant started up in her bed and the colour of life spread over her face thank you thank you miss clarendon a second time i have to thank you for an inestimable service it is well for cecilia that she made the whole truth known to us bothmade you her friend now we can act for her i will have that locket from madame de st cymon before the sun goes down now lady davenant had madame de st cymon completely in her power from her acquaintance with a disgraceful transaction which had come to her knowledge at florence the locket was surrendered returned with humble assurances that madame de st cymon now perfectly understood the thing in its true light and was quite convinced it had been stolen not given lady davenant glanced over her note with scorn and was going to throw it from her into the fire but did not when miss clarendon called upon her again that evening as she had appointed she showed it to her and desired that she would when her brother arrived next day tell him what she had heard what lady davenant had done and how the locket was now in her possession some people who pretend to know maintain that the passion of love is of such an allengrossing nature that it swallows up every other feeling but we who judge more justly of our kind hold differently and rather believe that love in generous natures imparts a strengthening power a magnetic touch to every good feeling helen was incapable of being perfectly happy while her friend was miserable and even beauclerc in spite of all the suffering she had caused could not help pitying lady cecilia and he heartily wished the general could be reconciled to her yet it was a matter in which he could not properly interfere he did not attempt it lady davenant determined to give a breakfast to all the bridal party after the marriage in her state of health helen and cecilia remonstrated but lady davenant had resolved upon it and at last they agreed it would be better than parting at the churchdoorbetter that she should at her own house take leave of helen and beauclerc who would set out immediately after the breakfast for thorndale and now equipages were finished and wedding paraphernalia sent homethe second time that weddingdresses had been furnished for miss stanleyand never once were these looked at by the bride elect nor even by cecilia but to see that all was as it should bethat seen she sighed and passed on felicies ecstasies were no more to be heard we forgot to mention that she had before helens return from llansillen departed dismissed in disgrace and happy was it for lady cecilia and helen to be relieved from her jabbering and not exposed to her spying and reporting nevertheless the gloom that hung over the world above could not but be observed by the world below it was however naturally accounted for by lady davenants state of health and by the anxiety which lady cecilia must feel for the general who as it had been officially announced by mr cockburn was to set out on foreign service the day after the marriage lady cecilia notwithstanding the bright hopefulness of her temper and her habits of sanguine belief that all would end well in which she and her good fortune had any concern seemed now in this respect to have changed her nature and ever since her husbands denunciations had continued quite resigned to misery and submissive to the fate which she thought she had deserved she was much employed in attendance upon her mother and thankful that she was so permitted to be she never mentioned her husbands name and if she alluded to him or to what had been decreed by him it was with an emotion that scarcely dared to touch the point she spoke most of her child and seemed to look to the care of him as her only consolation the boy had been brought from kensington for lady davenant to see and was now at her house cecilia once said she thought he was very like his father and hoped that he would at least take leave of his boy at the last to that last hourthat hour when she was to see her husband once more when they were to meet but to part to meet first at the wedding ceremony and at a breakfast in a public companyaltogether painful as it must be yet she looked forward to it with a sort of longing ardent impatience true it will be dreadful yet stillstill i shall see him again see him once again and he cannot part with his once so dear cecilia without some wordsome look different from his last the evening before the day on which the wedding was to be lady cecilia was in lady davenants room sitting beside the bed while her mother slept suddenly she was startled from her still and ever the same recurring train of melancholy thoughts by a sound which had often made her heart beat with joyher husbands knock she ran to the window opened it and was out on the balcony in an instant his horse was at the door he had alighted and was going up the steps she leaned over the rails of the balcony and as she leaned a flower she wore broke offit fell at the generals feet he looked up and their eyes met there he stood waiting on those steps some minutes for an answer to his inquiry how lady davenant was and when the answer was brought out by elliott whom as it seemed he had desired to see he remounted his horse and rode away without ever again looking up to the balcony lady davenant had awakened and when cecilia returned on hearing her voice her mother as the light from the halfopen shutters shone upon her face saw that she was in tears she kneeled down by the side of the bed and wept bitterly she made her mother understand how it had been not that i hoped more but stillstill to feel it so oh mother i am bitterly punished then lady davenant seizing those clasped hands and raising herself in her bed fixed her eyes earnestly upon cecilia and askedwould you ceciliatell me would you if it were now this moment in your powerwould you retract your confession retract impossible do you repentregret having made it cecilia repentregret having made it no mother no replied cecilia firmly i only regret that it was not sooner made retractimpossible i could wish to retract the only right thing i have done the only thing that redeems me in my inmost soul from uttermost contempt no rather would i be as i am and lose that noble heart than hold it as i did unworthily there is mother as you saidas i feel a sustaininga redeeming power in truth her mother threw her arms round her come to my heart my child closeclose to my heart heaven bless you you have my blessingmy thanks cecilia yes my thanksfor now i knowi feel my dear daughter that my neglect of you in childhood has been repaired you make me forgive myself you make me happy you have my thanksmy blessingmy warmest blessing a smile of delight was on her pale face and tears ran down as cecilia answeredoh mother mother blind that i have been why did not i sooner know this tenderness of your heart and why my child did i not sooner know you the fault was mine the suffering has been yoursnot yours alone though suffer no more for me mother for now after this come what may i can bear it i can be happy even if there she paused and then eagerly looking into her mothers eyes she asked what do you say mother about him do you think i may hope i dare not bid you hope replied her mother do you bid me despair no despair in this world is only for those who have lost their own esteem who have no confidence in themselves for those who cannot repent reform and trust my child you must not despair now leave me to myself continued she open a little more of the shutter and put that book within my reach as soon as miss clarendon heard that her brother had arrived in town she hastened to him and as lady davenant had desired told him of all the reports that were in circulation and of all that lady cecilia had spontaneously confided to her esther watched his countenance as she spoke and observed that he listened with eager attention to the proofs of exactness in cecilia but he said nothing and whatever his feelings were his determination she could not doubt was still unshaken even she did not dare to press his confidence miss clarendon reported to lady davenant that she had obeyed her command and she described as nearly as she could all that she thought her brothers countenance expressed lady davenant seemed satisfied and this night she slept as she told cecilia in the morning better than she had done since she returned to england and this was the day of trial the hour came and lady davenant was in the church with her daughter this marriage was to be as described in olden times celebrated with all the lustre and pomp imaginable and so it was for helens sake helen the pale bride beautiful the whispers ran as she appeared but too pale leaning on general clarendons arm she was led up the aisle to the altar he felt the tremor of her arm on his but she looked composed and almost firm she saw no one individual of the assembled numbers not even cecilia or lady davenant she knelt at the altar beside him to whom she was to give her faith and general clarendon in the face of all the world proudly gave her to his ward and she without fear low and distinctly pronounced the sacred vow and as helen rose from her knees the sun shone out and a ray of light was on her face and it was lovely every heart said soevery heart but lady katrine hawksbysand why do we think of her at such a moment and why does lady davenant think of her at such a moment yet she did she looked to see if she were present and she bade her to the breakfast and now all the salutations were given and received and all the murmur of congratulations rising the living tide poured out of the church and then the noise of carriages and all drove off to lady davenants and lady davenant had gone through it all so far well and lady cecilia knew that it had been and her eyes had been upon her husband and her heart had been full of another day when she had knelt beside him at the altar and did he too think of that day she could not tell his countenance discovered no emotion his eyes never once turned to the place where she stood and she was now to see him for one hour but one hour longer and at a public breakfast but still she was to see him and now they are all at breakfast the attention of some was upon the bride and bridegroom of others on lady cecilia and on the general of others on lady davenant and of many on themselves lady davenant had beauclerc on one side general clarendon on the other and her daughter opposite to him lady katrine was there with her tristeful visage as churchill justly called it and more tristeful it presently became when breakfast was over seizing her moment when conversation flagged and when there was a pause implying what is to be said or done next lady davenant rose from her seat with an air of preparation and somewhat of solemnityall eyes were instantly upon her she drew out a locket which she held up to public view then turning to lady katrine hawksby she saidthis bauble has been much talked of i understand by your ladyship but i question whether you have ever yet seen it or know the truth concerning it this locket was stolen by a worthless man given by him to a worthless woman from whom i have obtained it and now i give it to the person for whom it was originally destined she advanced towards helen and put it round her neck this done her colour flittedher hand was suddenly pressed to her heart yet she commandedabsolutely commanded the paroxysm of pain the general was at her side her daughter helen and beauclerc were close to her instantly she was just able to walk she slowly left the roomand was no more seen by the world she suffered herself to be carried up the steps into her own apartment by the general who laid her on the sofa in her dressingroom she looked round on them and saw that all were there whom she loved but there was an alteration in her appearance which struck them all and most the general who had least expected it she held out her hand to him and fixing her eyes upon him with deathful expression calmly smiled and saidyou would not believe this could be but now you see it must be and soon we have no time to lose continued she and moving very cautiously and feebly she halfraised herselfyes said she a moment is granted to me thank heaven she rose with sudden power and threw herself on her knees at the generals feet it was done before he could stop her for gods sake cried he lady davenanti conjure you she would not be raised no said she here i die if i appeal to you in vainto your justice general clarendon to which as far as i know none ever appealed in vainand shall i be the firsta mother for her childa dying mother for your wifefor my dear cecilia once dear to you his face was instantly covered with

for ever if now her husband protect her not her husband turned and clasped her in his arms lady davenant rose and blessed himblessed them both they knelt beside her and she joined their hands now said she i give my daughter to a husband worthy of her and she more worthy of that noble heart than when first his her only fault was minemy early neglect it is repairedi die in peace you make my last
