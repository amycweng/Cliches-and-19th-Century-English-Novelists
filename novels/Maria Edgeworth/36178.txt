early lessons part x price six pence the little dog trusty the orange man and the cherry orchard being the tenth part of early lessons by the author of the parent's assistant six volumes london printed for j johnson no st paul's churchyard by h bryer bridewell hospital bridge street the little dog trusty or the liar and the boy of truth very very little children must not read this story for they cannot understand it they will not know what is meant by a liar and a boy of truth very little children when they are asked a question say yes and no without knowing the meaning of the words but you children who can speak quite plain and who can tell by words what you wish for and what you want and what you have seen and what you have done you who understand what is meant by the words i have done it or i have not you may read this story for you can understand it frank and robert were two little boys about eight years old whenever frank did any thing wrong he always told his father and mother of it and when any body asked him about any thing which he had done or said he always told the truth so that every body who knew him believed him but nobody who knew his brother robert believed a word which he said because he used to tell lies whenever he did any thing wrong he never ran to his father and mother to tell them of it but when they asked him about it he denied it and said he had not done the things which he had done the reason that robert told lies was because he was afraid of being punished for his faults if he confessed them he was a coward and could not bear the least pain but frank was a brave boy and could bear to be punished for little faults his mother never punished him so much for such little faults as she did robert for the lies which he told and which she found out afterward one evening these two little boys were playing together in a room by themselves their mother was ironing in a room next to them and their father was out at work in the fields so there was nobody in the room with robert and frank but there was a little dog trusty lying by the fire side trusty was a pretty playful little dog and the children were very fond of him come said robert to frank there is trusty lying beside the fire asleep let us go and waken him and he will play with us o yes do let us said frank so they both ran together towards the hearth to waken the dog now there was a basin of milk standing upon the hearth and the little boys did not see where abouts it stood for it was behind them as they were both playing with the dog they kicked it with their feet and threw it down and the basin broke and all the milk ran out of it over the hearth and about the floor and when the little boys saw what they had done they were very sorry and frightened but they did not know what to do they stood for some time looking at the broken basin and the milk without speaking robert spoke first so we shall have no milk for supper to night said he and he sighed no milk for supper why not said frank is there no more milk in the house yes but we shall have none of it for do not you remember last monday when we threw down the milk my mother said we were very careless and that the next time we did so we should have no more and this is the next time so we shall have no milk for supper to night well then said frank we must do without it that's all we will take more care another time there's no great harm done come let us run and tell my mother you know she bid us always tell her directly when we broke any thing so come said he taking hold of his brother's hand i will come just now said robert don't be in such a hurry frank can't you stay a minute so frank staid and then he said come now robert but robert answered stay a little longer for i dare not go yet i am afraid little boys i advise you never be afraid to tell the truth never say stay a minute and stay a little longer but run directly and tell of what you have done that is wrong the longer you stay the more afraid you will grow till at last perhaps you will not dare to tell the truth at all hear what happened to robert the longer he staid the more unwilling he was to go to tell his mother that he had thrown the milk down and at last he pulled his hand away from his brother and cried i won't go at all frank can't you go by yourself yes said frank so i will i am not afraid to go by myself i only waited for you out of good nature because i thought you would like to tell the truth too yes so i will i mean to tell the truth when i am asked but i need not go now when i do not choose it and why need you go either can't you wait here surely my mother can see the milk when she comes in frank said no more but as his brother would not come he went without him he opened the door of the next room where he thought his mother was ironing but when he went in he saw that she was gone and he thought she was gone to fetch some more clothes to iron the clothes he knew were hanging on the bushes in the garden so he thought his mother was gone there and he ran after her to tell what had happened now whilst frank was gone robert was left in the room by himself and all the while he was alone he was thinking of some excuses to make to his mother and he was sorry that frank was gone to tell her the truth he said to himself if frank and i both were to say that we did not throw down the basin she would believe us and we should have milk for supper i am very sorry frank would go to tell her about it just as he said this to himself he heard his mother coming down stairs oh ho said he to himself then my mother has not been out in the garden and so frank has not met her and cannot have told her so now i may say what i please then this naughty cowardly boy determined to tell his mother a lie she came into the room but when she saw the broken basin and the milk spilled she stopped short and cried so so what a piece of work is here who did this robert i don't know ma'am said robert in a very low voice you don't know robert tell me the truth i shall not be angry with you child you will only lose the milk at supper and as for the basin i would rather have you break all the basins i have than tell me one lie so don't tell me a lie i ask you robert did you break the basin no ma'am i did not said robert and he coloured as red as fire then where's frank did he do it no mother he did not said robert for he was in hopes that when frank came in he should persuade him to say that he did not do it how do you know said his mother that frank did not do it because because because ma'am said robert hesitating as liars do for an excuse because i was in the room all the time and i did not see him do it then how was the basin thrown down if you have been in the room all the time you can tell then robert going on from one lie to another answered i suppose the dog must have done it did you see him do it says his mother yes said this wicked boy trusty trusty said his mother turning round and trusty who was lying before the fire drying his legs which were wet with the milk jumped up and came to her then she said fie fie trusty and she pointed to the milk get me a switch out of the garden robert trusty must be beat for this robert ran for the switch and in the garden he met his brother he stopped him and told him in a great hurry all that he had said to his mother and he begged of him not to tell the truth but to say the same as he had done no i will not tell a lie said frank what and is trusty to be beat he did not throw down the milk and he shan't be beat for it let me go to my mother they both ran toward the house robert got first home and he locked the house door that frank might not come in he gave the switch to his mother poor trusty he looked up as the switch was lifted over his head but he could not speak to tell the truth just as the blow was falling upon him frank's voice was heard at the window stop stop dear mother stop cried he as loud as ever he could call trusty did not do it let me in i and robert did it but do not beat robert let us in let us in cried another voice which robert knew to be his father's i am just come from work and here's the door locked robert turned as pale as ashes when he heard his father's voice for his father always whipped him when he told a lie his mother went to the door and unlocked it what's all this cried his father as he came in so his mother told him all that had happened how the milk had been thrown down how she had asked robert whether he had done it and he said that he had not nor that frank had not done it but that trusty the dog had done it how she was just going to beat trusty when frank came to the window and told the truth where is the switch with which you were going to beat trusty said the father then robert who saw by his father's look that he was going to beat him fell upon his knees and cried for mercy saying forgive me this time and i will never tell a lie again but his father caught hold of him by the arm i will whip you now said he and then i hope you will not so robert was whipped till he cried so loud with the pain that the whole neighbourhood could hear him there said his father when he had done now go to supper you are to have no milk to night and you have been whipped see how liars are served then turning to frank come here and shake hands with me frank you will have no milk for supper but that does not signify you have told the truth and have not been whipped and every body is pleased with you and now i'll tell you what i will do for you i will give you the little dog trusty to be your own dog you shall feed him and take care of him and he shall be your dog you have saved him a beating and i'll answer for it you'll be a good master to him trusty trusty come here trusty came then frank's father took off trusty's collar to morrow i'll go to the brazier's added he and get a new collar made for your dog from this day forward he shall always be called after you frank and wife whenever any of the neighbours' children ask you why the dog trusty is to be called frank tell them this story of our two boys let them know the difference between a liar and a boy of truth the orange man or the honest boy and the thief charles was the name of the honest boy and ned was the name of the thief charles never touched what was not his own this is being an honest boy ned often took what was not his own this is being a thief charles's father and mother when he was a very little boy had taught him to be honest by always punishing him when he meddled with what was not his own but when ned took what was not his own his father and mother did not punish him so he grew up to be a thief early one summer's morning as charles was going along the road to school he met a man leading a horse which was laden with panniers the man stopped at the door of a public house which was by the road side and he said to the landlord who came to the door i won't have my horse unloaded i shall only stop with you whilst i eat my breakfast give my horse to some one to hold here on the road and let the horse have a little hay to eat the landlord called but there was no one in the way so he beckoned to charles who was going by and begged him to hold the horse oh said the man but can you engage him to be an honest boy for these are oranges in my baskets and it is not every little boy one can leave with oranges yes said the landlord i have known charles from the cradle upwards and i never caught him in a lie or a theft all the parish knows him to be an honest boy i'll engage your oranges will be as safe with him as if you were by yourself can you so said the orange man then i'll engage my lad to give you the finest orange in my basket when i come from breakfast if you'll watch the rest whilst i am away yes said charles i will take care of your oranges so the man put the bridle into his hand and he went into the house to eat his breakfast charles had watched the horse and the oranges about five minutes when he saw one of his school fellows coming towards him as he came nearer charles saw that it was ned ned stopped as he passed and said good morrow to you charles what are you doing there whose horse is that and what have you got in the baskets there are oranges in the baskets said charles and a man who has just gone into the inn here to eat his breakfast bid me take care of them and so i did because he said he would give me an orange when he came back again an orange cried ned are you to have a whole orange i wish i was to have one however let me look how large they are saying this ned went towards the pannier and lifted up the cloth that covered it la what fine oranges he exclaimed the moment he saw them let me touch them to feel if they are ripe no said charles you had better not what signifies it to you whether they are ripe you know since you are not to eat them you should not meddle with them they are not yours you must not touch them not touch them surely said ned there's no harm in touching them you don't think i mean to steal them i suppose so ned put his hand into the orange man's basket and he took up an orange and he felt it and when he had felt it he smelled it it smells very sweet said he and it feels very ripe i long to taste it i will only just suck one drop of juice at the top saying these words he put the orange to his mouth little boys who wish to be honest beware of temptation do not depend too much upon yourselves and remember that it is easier to resolve to do right at first than at last people are led on by little and little to do wrong the sight of the oranges tempted ned to touch them the touch tempted him to smell them and the smell tempted him to taste them what are you about ned cried charles taking hold of his arm you said you only wanted to smell the orange do put it down for shame don't say for shame to me cried ned in a surly tone the oranges are not yours charles no they are not mine but i promised to take care of them and so i will so put down that orange oh if it comes to that i won't said ned and let us see who can make me if i don't choose it i'm stronger than you i am not afraid of you for all that replied charles for i am in the right then he snatched the orange out of ned's hand and he pushed him with all his force from the basket ned immediately returning hit him a violent blow which almost stunned him still however this good boy without minding the pain persevered in defending what was left in his care he still held the bridle with one hand and covered the basket with his other arm as well as he could ned struggled in vain to get his hands into the pannier again he could not and finding that he could not win by strength he had recourse to cunning so he pretended to be out of breath and to desist but he meant as soon as charles looked away to creep softly round to the basket on the other side cunning people though they think themselves very wise are almost always very silly ned intent upon one thing the getting round to steal the oranges forgot that if he went too close to the horse's heels he should startle him the horse indeed disturbed by the bustle near him had already left off eating his hay and began to put down his ears but when he felt something touch his hind legs he gave a sudden kick and ned fell backwards just as he had seized the orange ned screamed with the pain and at the scream all the people came out of the public house to see what was the matter and amongst them came the orange man ned was now so much ashamed that he almost forgot the pain and wished to run away but he was so much hurt that he was obliged to sit down again the truth of the matter was soon told by charles and as soon believed by all the people present who knew him for he had the character of being an honest boy and ned was known to be a thief and a liar so nobody pitied ned for the pain he felt he deserves it says one why did he meddle with what was not his own pugh he is not much hurt i'll answer for it said another and if he was it's a lucky kick for him if it keeps him from the gallows says a third charles was the only person who said nothing he helped ned away to a bank for brave boys are always good natured oh come here said the orange man calling him come here my honest lad what you got that black eye in keeping my oranges did you that's a stout little fellow said he taking him by the hand and leading him into the midst of the people men women and children had gathered around and all the children fixed their eyes upon charles and wished to be in his place in the mean time the orange man took charles's hat off his head and filled it with fine china oranges there my little friend said he take them and god bless you with them if i could but afford it you should have all that is in my basket then the people and especially the children shouted for joy but as soon as there was silence charles said to the orange man thank'e master with all my heart but i can't take your oranges only that one i earned take the rest back again as for a black eye that's nothing but i won't be paid for it no more than for doing what's honest so i can't take your oranges master but i thank you as much as if i had them saying these words charles offered to pour the oranges back into the basket but the man would not let him then said charles if they are honestly mine i may give them away so he emptied the hat amongst the children his companions divide them amongst you said he and without waiting for their thanks he pressed through the crowd and ran towards home the children all followed him clapping their hands and thanking him the little thief came limping after nobody praised him nobody thanked him he had no oranges to eat nor had he any to give away people must be honest before they can be generous ned sighed as he went towards home and all this said he to himself was for one orange it was not worth while no it is never worth while to do wrong little boys who read this story consider which would you rather have been the honest boy or the thief the cherry orchard marianne was a little girl of about eight years old she was remarkably good tempered she could bear to be disappointed or to be contradicted or to be blamed without looking or feeling peevish or sullen or angry her parents and her school mistress and companions all loved her because she was obedient and obliging marianne had a cousin a year younger than herself named owen who was an ill tempered boy almost every day he was crying or pouting or in a passion about some trifle or other he was neither obedient nor obliging his playfellows could not love him for he was continually quarrelling with them he would never either when he was at play or at work do what they wished but he always tried to force them to yield to his will and his humour one fine summer's evening marianne and owen were setting out with several of their little companions to school it was a walk of about a mile from the town in which their fathers and mothers lived to the school house if they went by the high road but there was another way through a lane which was a quarter of a mile shorter marianne and most of the children liked to go by the lane because they could gather the pretty flowers which grew on the banks and in the hedges but owen preferred going by the high road because he liked to see the carts and carriages and horsemen which usually were seen upon this road just when they were setting out owen called to marianne who was turning into the lane marianne said he you must not go by the lane to day you must go by the road why must not i go by the lane to day said marianne you know yesterday and the day before and the day before that we all went by the high road only to please you and now let us go by the lane because we want to gather some honey suckles and dog roses to fill our dame's flower pots i don't care for that i don't want to fill our dame's flower pots i don't want to gather honey suckles and dog roses i want to see the coaches and chaises on the road and you must go my way marianne must oh you should not say must replied marianne in a gentle tone no indeed cried one of her companions you should not nor should you look so cross that is not the way to make us do what you like and besides said another what right has he always to make us do as he pleases he never will do any thing that we wish owen grew quite angry when he heard this and he was just going to make some sharp answer when marianne who was good natured and always endeavoured to prevent quarrels said let us do what he asks this once and i dare say he will do what we please the next time we will go by the high road to school and we can come back by the lane in the cool of the evening to please marianne whom they all loved they agreed to this proposal they went by the high road but owen was not satisfied because he saw that his companions did not comply for his sake and as he walked on he began to kick up the dust with his feet saying i'm sure it is much pleasanter here than in the lane i wish we were to come back this way i'm sure it is much pleasanter here than in the lane is not it marianne marianne could not say that she thought so owen kicked up the dust more and more do not make such a dust dear owen said she look how you have covered my shoes and my clean stockings with dust then say it is pleasanter here than in the lane i shall go on making this dust till you say that i cannot say that because i do not think so owen i'll make you think so and say so too you are not taking the right way to make me think so you know that i cannot think this dust agreeable owen persisted and he raised continually a fresh cloud of dust in spite of all that marianne or his companions could say to him they left him and went to the opposite side of the road but wherever they went he pursued at length they came to a turnpike gate on one side of which there was a turn stile marianne and the rest of the children passed one by one through the turn stile whilst owen was emptying his shoes of dust when this was done he looked up and saw all his companions on the other side of the gate holding the turn stile to prevent him from coming through let me through let me through cried he i must and will come through no no owen said they must will not do now we have you safe here are ten of us and we will not let you come through till you have promised that you will not make any more dust owen without making any answer began to kick and push and pull and struggle with all his might but in vain he struggled pulled pushed and kicked he found that ten people are stronger than one when he felt that he could not conquer them by force he began to cry and he roared as loud as he possibly could no one but the turnpike man was within hearing and he stood laughing at owen owen tried to climb the gate but he could not get over it because there were iron spikes at the top only promise that you will not kick up the dust and they will let you through said marianne owen made no answer but continued to struggle till his whole face was scarlet and till both his wrists ached he could not move the turn stile an inch well said he stopping short now you are all of you joined together you are stronger than i but i am as cunning as you he left the stile and began to walk homewards where are you going you will be too late at school if you turn back and go by the lane said marianne i know that very well but that will be your fault and not mine i shall tell our dame that you all of you held the turn stile against me and would not let me through and we shall tell our dame why we held the turn stile against you replied one of the children and then it will be plain that it was your fault perhaps owen did not hear this for he was now at some distance from the gate presently he heard some one running after him it was marianne oh i am so much out of breath with running after you i can hardly speak but i am come back said this good natured girl to tell you that you will be sorry if you do not come with us for there is something that you like very much just at the turn of the road a little beyond the turnpike gate something that i like very much what can that be come with me and you shall see said marianne that is both rhyme and reason come with me and you shall see she looked so good humoured as she smiled and nodded at him that he could not be sullen any longer i don't know how it is cousin marianne said he but when i am cross you are never cross and you can always bring me back to good humour again you are so good humoured yourself i wish i was like you but we need not talk any more of that now what is it that i shall see on the other side of the turnpike gate what is it that i like very much don't you like ripe cherries very much yes but they do not grow in these hedges no but there is an old woman sitting by the road side with a board before her which is covered with red ripe cherries red ripe cherries let us make haste then cried owen he ran on as fast as he could but as soon as the children saw him running they also began to run back to the turn stile and they reached it before he did and they held it fast as before saying promise you will not kick up the dust or we will not let you through the cherries are very ripe said marianne well well i will not kick up the dust let me through said owen they did so and he kept his word for though he was ill humoured he was a boy of truth and he always kept his promises he found the cherries looked red and ripe as marianne had described them the old woman took up a long stick which lay on the board before her bunches of cherries were tied with white thread to this stick and as she shook it in the air over the heads of the children they all looked up with longing eyes a halfpenny a bunch who will buy who will buy who will buy nice ripe cherries cried the old woman the children held out their halfpence and give me a bunch and give me a bunch was heard on all sides here are eleven of you said the old woman and there are just eleven bunches on this stick she put the stick into marianne's hand as she spoke marianne began to untie the bunches and her companions pressed closer and closer to her each eager to have the particular bunches which they thought the largest and the ripest several fixed upon the uppermost which looked indeed extremely ripe you cannot all have this bunch said marianne to which of you must i give it you all wish for it give it to me give it to me was the first cry of each but the second was keep it yourself marianne keep it yourself now owen see what it is to be good natured and good humoured like marianne said cymon the eldest of the boys who stood near him we all are ready to give up the ripest cherries to marianne but we should never think of doing so for you because you are so cross and disagreeable i am not cross now i am not disagreeable now replied owen and i do not intend to be cross and disagreeable any more this was a good resolution but owen did not keep it many minutes in the bunch of cherries which marianne gave to him for his share there was one which though red on one side was entirely white and hard on the other this cherry is not ripe and here's another that has been half eaten away by the birds oh marianne you gave me this bad bunch on purpose i will not have this bunch somebody must have it said cymon and i do not see that it is worse than the others we shall all have some cherries that are not so good as the rest but we shall not grumble and look so cross about it as you do give me your bad cherries and i will give you two out of my fine bunch instead of them said the good natured marianne no no no cried the children marianne keep your own cherries are not you ashamed owen said cymon how can you be so greedy greedy i am not greedy cried owen angrily but i will not have the worst cherries i will have another bunch he tried to snatch another bunch from the stick cymon held it above his head owen leaped up reached it and when his companions closed round him exclaiming against his violence he grew still more angry he threw the stick down upon the ground and trampled upon every bunch of the cherries in his fury scarcely knowing what he did or what he said when his companions saw the ground stained with the red juice of their cherries which he had trampled under his feet they were both sorry and angry the children had not any more halfpence they could not buy any more cherries and the old woman said that she could not give them any as they went away sorrowfully they said owen is so ill tempered that we will not play with him or speak to him or have any thing to do with him owen thought that he could make himself happy without his companions and he told them so but he soon found that he was mistaken when they arrived at the school house their dame was sitting in the thatched porch before her own door reading a paper that was printed in large letters my dears said she to her little scholars here is something that you will be glad to see but say your lessons first one thing at a time duty first and pleasure afterwards which ever of you says your lesson best shall know first what is in this paper and shall have the pleasure of telling the good news owen always learned his lessons very well and quickly he now said his lesson better than any of his companions said theirs and he looked round him with joy and triumph but no eye met his with pleasure nobody smiled upon him no one was glad that he had succeeded on the contrary he heard those near him whisper i should have been very glad if it had been marianne who had said her lesson because she is so good natured the printed paper which owen read aloud was as follows on thursday evening next the gate of the cherry orchard will be opened and all who have tickets will be let in from six o'clock till eight price of tickets six pence the children wished extremely to go to this cherry orchard where they knew that they might gather as many cherries as they liked and where they thought that they should be very happy sitting down under the trees and eating fruit but none of these children had any money for they had spent their last halfpence in paying for those cherries which they never tasted those cherries which owen in the fury of his passion trampled in the dust the children asked their dame what they could do to earn six pence a piece and she told them that they might perhaps be able to earn this money by plaiting straw for hats which they had all been taught to make by their good dame immediately the children desired to set to work owen who was very eager to go to the cherry orchard was the most anxious to get forward with the business he found however that nobody liked to work along with him his companions said we are afraid that you should quarrel with us we are afraid that you should fly into a passion about the straws as you did about the cherries therefore we will not work with you will not you then i will work by myself said owen and i dare say that i shall have done my work long before you have any of you finished yours for i can plait quicker and better than any of you it was true that owen could plait quicker and better than any of his companions but he was soon surprised to find that his work did not go on so fast as theirs after they had been employed all the remainder of this evening and all the next day owen went to his companions and compared his work with theirs how is this said he how comes it that you have all done so much and i have not done nearly so much though i work quicker than any one of you and i have worked as hard as i possibly could what is the reason that you have done so much more than i have because we have all been helping one another and you have had no one to help you you have been obliged to do every thing for yourself but still i do not understand how your helping one another can make such a difference said owen i plait faster than any of you his companions were so busy at their work that they did not listen to what he was saying he stood behind marianne in a melancholy posture looking at them and trying to find out why they went on so much faster than he could he observed that one picked the outside off the straws another cut them to the proper length another sorted them and laid them in bundles another flattened them another the youngest of the little girls who was not able to do any thing else held the straws ready for those who were plaiting another cut off the rough ends of the straws when the plaits were finished another ironed the plaits with a hot smoothing iron others sewed the plaits together each did what he could do best and quickest and none of them lost any time in going from one work to another or in looking for what they wanted on the contrary owen had lost a great deal of time in looking for all the things that he wanted he had nobody to hold the straws ready for him as he plaited therefore he was forced to go for them himself every time he wanted them and his straws were not sorted in nice bundles for him the wind blew them about and he wasted half an hour at least in running after them besides this he had no friend to cut off the rough ends for him nor had he any one to sew the plaits together and though he could plait quickly he could not sew quickly for he was not used to this kind of work he wished extremely for marianne to do it for him he was once a full quarter of an hour in threading his needle of which the eye was too small then he spent another quarter of an hour in looking for one with a larger eye and he could not find it at last and nobody would lend him another when he had done sewing he found that his hand was out for plaiting that is he could not plait so quickly after his fingers had just been used to another kind of work and when he had been smoothing the straws with a heavy iron his hand trembled afterwards for some minutes during which time he was forced to be idle thus it was that he lost time by doing every thing for himself and though he lost but few minutes or seconds in each particular yet when all these minutes and seconds were added together they made a great difference how fast how very fast they go on and how merrily said owen as he looked at his former companions i am sure i shall never earn sixpence for myself before thursday and i shall not be able to go to the cherry orchard i am very sorry that i trampled on your cherries i am very sorry that i was so ill humoured i will never be cross any more he is very sorry that he was so ill humoured he is very sorry that he trampled on our cherries cried marianne do you hear what he says he will never be cross any more yes we hear what he says answered cymon but how can we be sure that he will do as he says oh cried another of his companions he has found out at last that he must do as he would be done by aye said another and he finds that we who are good humoured and good natured to one another do better even than he who is so quick and so clever but if besides being so quick and so clever he was good humoured and good natured said marianne he would be of great use to us he plaits a vast deal faster than mary does and mary plaits faster than any of us come let us try him let him come in amongst us no no no cried many voices he will quarrel with us and we have no time for quarrelling we are all so quiet and happy without him let him work by himself as he said he would owen went on working by himself he made all the haste that he possibly could but thursday came and his work was not nearly finished his companions passed by him with their finished work in their hands each as they passed said what have not you done yet owen and then they walked on to the table where their dame was sitting ready to pay them their sixpences she measured their work and examined it and when she saw that it was well done she gave to each of her little workmen and workwomen the sixpence which they had earned and she said i hope my dears that you will be happy this evening they all looked joyful and as they held their sixpences in their hands they said if we had not helped one another we should not have earned this money and we should not be able to go to the cherry orchard poor owen whispered marianne to her companions look how melancholy he is sitting there alone at his work see his hands tremble so that he can scarcely hold the straws he will not have nearly finished his work in time he cannot go with us he should not have trampled upon our cherries and then perhaps we might have helped him said cymon let us help him though he did trample on our cherries said the good natured marianne he is sorry for what he did and he will never be so ill humoured or ill natured again come let us go and help him if we all help we shall have his work finished in time and then we shall all be happy together as marianne spoke she drew cymon near to the corner where owen was sitting and all her companions followed before we offer to help him let us try whether he is now inclined to be good humoured and good natured yes yes let us try that first said his companions owen you will not have done time enough to go with us said cymon no indeed said owen i shall not therefore i may as well give up all thoughts of it it is my own fault i know well but as you cannot go yourself you will not want your pretty little basket will you lend it to us to hold our cherries yes i will with pleasure cried owen jumping up to fetch it now he is good natured i am sure said marianne this plaiting of yours is not nearly so well done as ours said cymon look how uneven it is yes it is rather uneven indeed replied owen cymon began to untwist some of owen's work and owen bore this trial of his patience with good temper oh you are pulling it all to pieces cymon said marianne this is not fair yes it is fair said cymon for i have undone only an inch and i will do as many inches for owen as he pleases now that i see he is good humoured marianne immediately sat down to work for owen and cymon and all his companions followed her example it was now two hours before the time when the cherry orchard was to be opened and during these two hours they went on so expeditiously that they completed the work owen went with them to the cherry orchard where they spent the evening all together very happily as he was sitting under a tree with his companions eating the ripe cherries he said to them thank you all for helping me i should not have been here now eating these ripe cherries if you had not been so good natured to me i hope i shall never be cross to any of you again whenever i feel inclined to be cross i will think of your good nature to me
