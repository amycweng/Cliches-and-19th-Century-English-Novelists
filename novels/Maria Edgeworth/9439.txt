volumes with engravings on steel a prudence undeceiving undeceived that nor too little nor too much believed that scornd unjust suspicions coward fear and without weakness knew to be sincere lord lytteltons monody on his wife preface the prevailing taste of the public for anecdote has been censured and ridiculed by critics who aspire to the character of superior wisdom but if we consider it in a proper point of view this taste is an incontestable proof of the good sense and profoundly philosophic temper of the present times of the numbers who study or at least who read history how few derive any advantage from their labours the heroes of history are so decked out by the fine fancy of the professed historian they talk in such measured prose and act from such sublime or such diabolical motives that few have sufficient taste wickedness or heroism to sympathize in their fate besides there is much uncertainty even in the best authenticated ancient or modern histories and that love of truth which in some minds is innate and immutable necessarily leads to a love of secret memoirs and private anecdotes we cannot judge either of the feelings or of the characters of men with perfect accuracy from their actions or their appearance in public it is from their careless conversations their halffinished sentences that we may hope with the greatest probability of success to discover their real characters the life of a great or of a little man written by himself the familiar letters the diary of any individual published by his friends or by his enemies after his decease are esteemed important literary curiosities we are surely justified in this eager desire to collect the most minute facts relative to the domestic lives not only of the great and good but even of the worthless and insignificant since it is only by a comparison of their actual happiness or misery in the privacy of domestic life that we can form a just estimate of the real reward of virtue or the real punishment of vice that the great are not as happy as they seem that the external circumstances of fortune and rank do not constitute felicity is asserted by every moralist the historian can seldom consistently with his dignity pause to illustrate this truth it is therefore to the biographer we must have recourse after we have beheld splendid characters playing their parts on the great theatre of the world with all the advantages of stage effect and decoration we anxiously beg to be admitted behind the scenes that we may take a nearer view of the actors and actresses some may perhaps imagine that the value of biography depends upon the judgment and taste of the biographer but on the contrary it may be maintained that the merits of a biographer are inversely as the extent of his intellectual powers and of his literary talents a plain unvarnished tale is preferable to the most highly ornamented narrative where we see that a man has the power we may naturally suspect that he has the will to deceive us and those who are used to literary manufacture know how much is often sacrificed to the rounding of a period or the pointing of an antithesis that the ignorant may have their prejudices as well as the learned cannot be disputed but we see and despise vulgar errors we never bow to the authority of him who has no great name to sanction his absurdities the partiality which blinds a biographer to the defects of his hero in proportion as it is gross ceases to be dangerous but if it be concealed by the appearance of candour which men of great abilities best know how to assume it endangers our judgment sometimes and sometimes our morals if her grace the duchess of newcastle instead of penning her lords elaborate eulogium had undertaken to write the life of savage we should not have been in any danger of mistaking an idle ungrateful libertine for a man of genius and virtue the talents of a biographer are often fatal to his reader for these reasons the public often judiciously countenance those who without sagacity to discriminate character without elegance of style to relieve the tediousness of narrative without enlargement of mind to draw any conclusions from the facts they relate simply pour forth anecdotes and retail conversations with all the minute prolixity of a gossip in a country town the author of the following memoirs has upon these grounds fair claims to the public favour and attention he was an illiterate old steward whose partiality to the family in which he was bred and born must be obvious to the reader he tells the history of the rackrent family in his vernacular idiom and in the full confidence that sir patrick sir murtagh sir kit and sir condy rackrents affairs will be as interesting to all the world as they were to himself those who were acquainted with the manners of a certain class of the gentry of ireland some years ago will want no evidence of the truth of honest thadys narrative to those who are totally unacquainted with ireland the following memoirs will perhaps be scarcely intelligible or probably they may appear perfectly incredible for the information of the ignorant english reader a few notes have been subjoined by the editor and he had it once in contemplation to translate the language of thady into plain english but thadys idiom is incapable of translation and besides the authenticity of his story would have been more exposed to doubt if it were not told in his own characteristic manner several years ago he related to the editor the history of the rackrent family and it was with some difficulty that he was persuaded to have it committed to writing however his feelings for the honour of the family as he expressed himself prevailed over his habitual laziness and he at length completed the narrative which is now aid before the public the editor hopes his readers will observe that these are tales of other times that the manners depicted in the following pages are not those of the present age the race of the rackrents has long since been extinct in ireland and the drunken sir patrick the litigious sir murtagh the fighting sir kit and the slovenly sir condy are characters which could no more be met with at present in ireland than squire western or parson trulliber in england there is a time when individuals can bear to be rallied for their past follies and absurdities after they have acquired new habits and a new consciousness nations as well as individuals gradually lose attachment to their identity and the present generation is amused rather than offended by the ridicule that is thrown upon its ancestors probably we shall soon have it in our power in a hundred instances to verify the truth of these observations when ireland loses her identity by an union with great britain she will look back with a smile of goodhumoured complacency on the sir kits and sir condys of her former existence contents castle rackrent glossary footnotes essay on

irish incognito conclusion appendix footnotes an essay on the noble science of selfjustification ennui the dun castle rackrent monday morninga having out of friendship for the family upon whose estate praised be heaven i and mine have lived rentfree time out of mind voluntarily undertaken to publish the memoirs of the rackrent family i think it my duty to say a few words in the first place concerning myself my real name is thady quirk though in the family i have always been known by no other than honest thadyafterward in the time of sir murtagh deceased i remember to hear them calling me old thady and now im come to poor thady for i wear a long great coat winter and summer which is very handy as i never put my arms into the sleeves they are as good as new though come holantide next ive had it these seven years it holds on by a single button round my neck cloak fashion to look at me you would hardly think poor thady was the father of attorney quirk he is a high gentleman and never minds what poor thady says and having better than fifteen hundred a year landed estate looks down upon honest thady but i wash my hands of his doings and as i have lived so will i die true and loyal to the family the family of the rackrents is i am proud to say one of the most ancient in the kingdom every body knows this is not the old family name which was oshaughlin related to the kings of irelandbut that was before my time my grandfather was driver to the great sir patrick oshaughlin and i heard him when i was a boy telling how the castle rackrent estate came to sir patrick sir tallyhoo rackrent was cousingerman to him and had a fine estate of his own only never a gate upon it it being his maxim that a car was the best gate poor gentleman he lost a fine hunter and his life at last by it all in one days hunt but i ought to bless that day for the estate came straight into the family upon one condition which sir patrick oshaughlin at the time took sadly to heart they say but thought better of it afterwards seeing how large a stake depended upon it that he should by act of parliament take and bear the surname and arms of rackrent now it was that the world was to see what was in sir patrick on coming into the estate he gave the finest entertainment ever was heard of in the country not a man could stand after supper but sir patrick himself who could sit out the best man in ireland let alone the three kingdoms itselfb he had his house from one years end to another as full of company as ever it could hold and fuller for rather than be left out of the parties at castle rackrent many gentlemen and those men of the first consequence and landed estates in the country such as the oneils of ballynagrotty and the moueygawls of mount juliets town and oshannons of new town tullyhog made it their choice often and often when there was no room to be had for love nor money in long winter nights to sleep in the chickenhouse which sir patrick had fitted up for the purpose of accommodating his friends and the public in general who honoured him with their company unexpectedly at castle rackrent and this went on i cant tell you how longthe whole country rang with his praiseslong life to him im sure i love to look upon his picture now opposite to me though i never saw him he must have been a portly gentlemanhis neck something short and remarkable for the largest pimple on his nose which by his particular desire is still extant in his picture said to be a striking likeness though taken when young he is said also to be the inventor of raspberry whiskey which is very likely as nobody has ever appeared to dispute it with him and as there still exists a broken punchbowl at castle rackrent in the garret with an inscription to that effecta great curiosity a few days before his death he was very merry it being his honours birthday he called my grandfather in god bless him to drink the companys health and filled a bumper himself but could not carry it to his head on account of the great shake in his hand on this he cast his joke saying what would my poor father say to me if he was to pop out of the grave and see me now i remember when i was a little boy the first bumper of claret he gave me after dinner how he praised me for carrying it so steady to my mouth heres my thanks to hima bumper toast then he fell to singing the favourite song he learned from his fatherfor the last time poor gentlemanhe sung it that night as loud and as hearty as ever with a chorus he that goes to bed and goes to bed sober falls as the leaves do falls as the leaves do and dies in october but he that goes to bed and goes to bed mellow lives as he ought to do lives as he ought to do and dies an honest fellow sir patrick died that night just as the company rose to drink his health with three cheers he fell down in a sort of fit and was carried off they sat it out and were surprised on inquiry in the morning to find that it was all over with poor sir patrick never did any gentleman live and die more beloved in the country by rich and poor his funeral was such a one as was never known before or since in the county all the gentlemen in the three counties were at it far and near how they flocked my great grandfather said that to see all the women even in their red cloaks you would have taken them for the army drawn out then such a fine whillaluhc you might have heard it to the farthest end of the county and happy the man who could get but a sight of the hearse but whod have thought it just as all was going on right through his own town they were passing when the body was seized for debta rescue was apprehended from the mob but the heir who attended the funeral was against that for fear of consequences seeing that those villains who came to serve acted under the disguise of the law so to be sure the law must take its course and little gain had the creditors for their pains first and foremost they had the curses of the country and sir murtagh rackrent the new heir in the next place on account of this affront to the body refused to pay a shilling of the debts in which he was countenanced by all the best gentlemen of property and others of his acquaintance sir murtagh alleging in all companies that he all along meant to pay his fathers debts of honour but the moment the law was taken of him there was an end of honour to be sure it was whispered but none but the enemies of the family believe it that this was all a sham seizure to get quit of the debts which he had bound himself to pay in honour its a long time ago theres no saying how it was but this for certain the new man did not take at all after the old gentleman the cellars were never filled after his death and no open house or any thing as it used to be the tenants even were sent away without their whiskeyd i was ashamed myself and knew not what to say for the honour of the family but i made the best of a bad case and laid it all at my ladys door for i did not like her any how nor any body else she was of the family of the skinflints and a widow it was a strange match for sir murtagh the people in the country thought he demeaned himself greatlye but i said nothing i knew how it was sir murtagh was a great lawyer and looked to the great skinflint estate there however he overshot himself for though one of the coheiresses he was never the better for her for she outlived him manys the long dayhe could not see that to be sure when he married her i must say for her she made him the best of wives being a very notable stirring woman and looking close to every thing but i always suspected she had scotch blood in her veins any thing else i could have looked over in her from a regard to the family she was a strict observer for self and servants of lent and all fast days but not holidays one of the maids having fainted three times the last day of lent to keep soul and body together we put a morsel of roast beef into her mouth which came from sir murtaghs dinner who never fasted not he but somehow or other it unfortunately reached my ladys ears and the priest of the parish had a complaint made of it the next day and the poor girl was forced as soon as she could walk to do penance for it before she could get any peace or absolution in the house or out of it however my lady was very charitable in her own way she had a charity school for poor children where they were taught to read and write gratis and where they were kept well to spinning gratis for my lady in return for she had always heaps of duty yarn from the tenants and got all her household linen out of the estate from first to last for after the spinning the weavers on the estate took it in hand for nothing because of the looms my ladys interest could get from the linen board to distribute gratis then there was a bleachyard near us and the tenant dare refuse my lady nothing for fear of a lawsuit sir murtagh kept hanging over him about the watercourse with these ways of managing tis surprising how cheap my lady got things done and how proud she was of it her table the same way kept for next to nothingf duty fowls and duty turkeys and duty geese came as fast as we could eat em for my lady kept a sharp lookout and knew to a tub of butter every thing the tenants had all round they knew her way and what with fear of driving for rent and sir murtaghs lawsuits they were kept in such good order they never thought of coming near castle rackrent without a present of something or othernothing too much or too little for my ladyeggs honey butter meal fish game grouse and herrings fresh or salt all went for something as for their young pigs we had them and the best bacon and hams they could make up with all young chickens in spring but they were a set of poor wretches and we had nothing but misfortunes with them always breaking and running away this sir murtagh and my lady said was all their former landlord sir patricks fault who let em all get the half years rent into arrear there was something in that to be sure but sir murtagh was as much the contrary way for let alone making english tenantsg of them every soul he was always driving and driving and pounding and pounding and cantingh and canting and replevying and replevying and he made a good living of trespassing cattle there was always some tenants pig or horse or cow or calf or goose trespassing which was so great a gain to sir murtagh that he did not like to hear me talk of repairing fences then his heriots and dutyworki brought him in something his turf was cut his potatoes set and dug his hay brought home and in short all the work about his house done for nothing for in all our leases there were strict clauses heavy with penalties which sir murtagh knew well how to enforce so many days duty work of man and horse from every tenant he was to have and had every year and when a man vexed him why the finest day he could pitch on when the cratur was getting in his own harvest or thatching his cabin sir murtagh made it a principle to call upon him and his horse so he taught em all as he said to know the law of landlord and tenant as for law i believe no man dead or alive ever loved it so well as sir murtagh he had once sixteen suits pending at a time and i never saw him so much himself roads lanes bogs wells ponds eelwires orchards trees tithes vagrants gravelpits sandpits dunghills and nuisances every thing upon the face of the earth furnished him good matter for a suit he used to boast that he had a lawsuit for every letter in the alphabet how i used to wonder to see sir murtagh in the midst of the papers in his office why he could hardly turn about for them i made bold to shrug my shoulders once in his presence and thanked my stars i was not born a gentleman to so much toil and trouble but sir murtagh took me up short with his old proverb learning is better than house or land out of fortynine suits which he had he never lost one but seventeenj the rest he gained with costs double costs treble costs sometimes but even that did not pay he was a very learned man in the law and had the character of it but how it was i cant tell these suits that he carried cost him a power of money in the end he sold some hundreds a year of the family estate but he was a very learned man in the law and i know nothing of the matter except having a great regard for the family and i could not help grieving when he sent me to post up notices of the sale of the feesimple of the lands and appurtenances of timoleague i know honest thady says he to comfort me what im about better than you do im only selling to get the ready money wanting to carry on my suit with spirit with the nugents of carrickashaughlin he was very sanguine about that suit with the nugents of carrickashaughlin he could have gained it they say for certain had it pleased heaven to have spared him to us and it would have been at the least a plump two thousand ayear in his way but things were ordered otherwise for the best to be sure he dug up a fairymount against my advice and had no luck afterwards though a learned man in the law he was a little too incredulous in other matters i warned him that i heard the very banshee that my grandfather heard under sir patricks window a few days before his death but sir murtagh thought nothing of the banshee nor of his cough with a spitting of blood brought on i understand by catching cold in attending the courts and overstraining his chest with making himself heard in one of his favourite causes he was a great speaker with a powerful voice but his last speech was not in the courts at all he and my lady though both of the same way of thinking in some things and though she was as good a wife and great economist as you could see and he the best of husbands as to looking into his affairs and making money for his family yet i dont know how it was they had a great deal of sparring and jarring between them my lady had her privy purseand she had her weed ashesl and her sealing moneym upon the signing of all the leases with something to buy gloves besides and besides again often took money from the tenants if offered properly to speak for them to sir murtagh about abatements and renewals now the weed ashes and the glove money he allowed her clear perquisites though once when he saw her in a new gown saved out of the weed ashes he told her to my face for he could say a sharp thing that she should not put on her weeds before her husbands death but in a dispute about an abatement my lady would have the last word and sir murtagh grew madn i was within hearing of the door and now i wish i had made bold to step in he spoke so loud the whole kitchen was out on the stairso all on a sudden he stopped and my lady too something has surely happened thought iand so it was for sir murtagh in his passion broke a bloodvessel and all the law in the land could do nothing in that case my lady sent for five physicians but sir murtagh died and was buried she had a fine jointure settled upon her and took herself away to the great joy of the tenantry i never said any thing one way or the other whilst she was part of the family but got up to see her go at three oclock in the morning its a fine morning honest thady says she good bye to ye and into the carriage she stepped without a word more good or bad or even halfacrown but i made my bow and stood to see her safe out of sight for the sake of the family then we were all bustle in the house which made me keep out of the way for i walk slow and hate a bustle but the house was all hurryskurry preparing for my new master sir murtagh i forgot to notice had no childer so the rackrent estate went to his younger brother a young dashing officer who came amongst us before i knew for the life of me whereabouts i was in a gig or some of them things with another spark along with him and led horses and servants and dogs and scarce a place to put any christian of them into for my late lady had sent all the featherbeds off before her and blankets and household linen down to the very knife cloths on the cars to dublin which were all her own lawfully paid for out of her own money so the house was quite bare and my young master the moment ever he set foot in it out of his gig thought all those things must come of themselves i believe for he never looked after any thing at all but harumscarum called for every thing as if we were conjurers or he in a publichouse for my part i could not bestir myself any how i had been so much used to my late master and mistress all was upside down with me and the new servants in the servants hall were quite out of my way i had nobody to talk to and if it had not been for my pipe and tobacco should i verily believe have broke my heart for poor sir murtagh but one morning my new master caught a glimpse of me as i was looking at his horses heels in hopes of a word from him and is that old thady says he as he got into his gig i loved him from that day to this his voice was so like the family and he threw me a guinea out of his waistcoat pocket as he drew up the reins with the other hand his horse rearing too i thought i never set my eyes on a finer figure of a man quite another sort from sir murtagh though withal to me a family likeness a fine life we should have led had he stayed amongst us god bless him he valued a guinea as little as any man money to him was no more than dirt and his gentleman and groom and all belonging to him the same but the sporting season over he grew tired of the place and having got down a great architect for the house and an improver for the grounds and seen their plans and elevations he fixed a day for settling with the tenants but went off in a whirlwind to town just as some of them came into the yard in the morning a circular letter came next post from the new agent with news that the master was sailed for england and he must remit l to bath for his use before a fortnight was at an end bad news still for the poor tenants no change still for the better with them sir kit rackrent my young master left all to the agent and though he had the spirit of a prince and lived away to the honour of his country abroad which i was proud to hear of what were we the better for that at home the agent was one of your middle men who grind the face of the poor and can never bear a man with a hat upon his head he ferreted the tenants out of their lives not a week without a call for money drafts upon drafts from sir kit but i laid it all to the fault of the agent for says i what can sir kit do with so much cash and he a single man but still it went rents must be all paid up to the day and afore no allowance for improving tenants no consideration for those who had built upon their farms no sooner was a lease out but the land was advertised to the highest bidder all the old tenants turned out when they spent their substance in the hope and trust of a renewal from the landlord all was now let at the highest penny to a parcel of poor wretches who meant to run away and did so after taking two crops out of the ground then fining down the years rent came into fashionp any thing for the ready penny and with all this and presents to the agent and the driverq there was no such thing as standing it i said nothing for i had a regard for the family but i walked about thinking if his honour sir kit knew all this it would go hard with him but hed see us righted not that i had any thing for my own share to complain of for the agent was always very civil to me when he came down into the country and took a great deal of notice of my son jason jason quirk though he be my son i must say was a good scholar from his birth and a very cute lad i thought to make him a priestr but he did better for himself seeing how he was as good a clerk as any in the county the agent gave him his rent accounts to copy which he did first of all for the pleasure of obliging the gentleman and would take nothing at all for his trouble but was always proud to serve the family byandby a good farm bounding us to the east fell into his honours hands and my son put in a proposal for it why shouldnt he as well as another the proposals all went over to the master at the bath who knowing no more of the land than the child unborn only having once been out a grousing on it before he went to england and the value of lands as the agent informed him falling every year in ireland his honour wrote over in all haste a bit of a letter saying he left it all to the agent and that he must let it as well as he could to the best bidder to be sure and send him over l by return of post with this the agent gave me a hint and i spoke a good word for my son and gave out in the country that nobody need bid against us so his proposal was just the thing and he a good tenant and he got a promise of an abatement in the rent after the first year for advancing the half years rent at signing the lease which was wanting to complete the agents l by the return of the post with all which my master wrote back he was well satisfied about this time we learned from the agent as a great secret how the money went so fast and the reason of the thick coming of the masters drafts he was a little too fond of play and bath they say was no place for a young man of his fortune where there were so many of his own countrymen too hunting him up and down day and night who had nothing to lose at last at christmas the agent wrote over to stop the drafts for he could raise no more money on bond or mortgage or from the tenants or any how nor had he any more to lend himself and desired at the same time to decline the agency for the future wishing sir kit his health and happiness and the compliments of the season for i saw the letter before ever it was sealed when my son copied it when the answer came there was a new turn in affairs and the agent was turned out and my son jason who had corresponded privately with his honour occasionally on business was forthwith desired by his honour to take the accounts into his own hands and look them over till further orders it was a very spirited letter to be sure sir kit sent his service and the compliments of the season in return to the agent and he would fight him with pleasure tomorrow or any day for sending him such a letter if he was born a gentleman which he was sorry for both their sakes to find too late he was not then in a private postscript he condescended to tell us that all would be speedily settled to his satisfaction and we should turn over a new leaf for he was going to be married in a fortnight to the grandest heiress in england and had only immediate occasion at present for l as he would not choose to touch his ladys fortune for travelling expenses home to castle rackrent where he intended to be wind and weather permitting early in the next month and desired fires and the house to be painted and the new building to go on as fast as possible for the reception of him and his lady before that time with several words besides in the letter which we could not make out because god bless him he wrote in such a flurry my heart warmed to my new lady when i read this i was almost afraid it was too good news to be true but the girls fell to scouring and it was well they did for we soon saw his marriage in the paper to a lady with i dont know how many tens of thousand pounds to her fortune then i watched the postoffice for his landing and the news came to my son of his and the bride being in dublin and on the way home to castle rackrent we had bonfires all over the country expecting him down the next day and we had his coming of age still to celebrate which he had not time to do properly before he left the country therefore a great ball was expected and great doings upon his coming as it were fresh to take possession of his ancestors estate i never shall forget the day he came home we had waited and waited all day long till eleven oclock at night and i was thinking of sending the boy to lock the gates and giving them up for that night when there came the carriages thundering up to the great hall door i got the first sight of the bride for when the carriage door opened just as she had her foot on the steps i held the flams full in her face to light her at which she shut her eyes but i had a full view of the rest of her and greatly shocked i was for by that light she was little better than a blackamoor and seemed crippled but that was only sitting so long in the chariot youre kindly welcome to castle rackrent my lady says i recollecting who she was did your honour hear of the bonfires his honour spoke never a word nor so much as handed her up the stepshe looked to me no more like himself than nothing at all i know i took him for the skeleton of his honour i was not sure what to say next to one or tother but seeing she was a stranger in a foreign country i thought it but right to speak cheerful to her so i went back again to the bonfires my lady says i as she crossed the hall there would have been fifty times as many but for fear of the horses and frightening your ladyship jason and i forbid them please your honour with that she looked at me a little bewildered will i have a fire lighted in the stateroom tonight was the next question i put to her but never a word she answered so i concluded she could not speak a word of english and was from foreign parts the short and the long of it was i couldnt tell what to make of her so i left her to herself and went straight down to the servants hall to learn something for certain about her sir kits own man was tired but the groom set him a talking at last and we had it all out before ever i closed my eyes that night the bride might well be a great fortuneshe was a jewish by all accounts who are famous for their great riches i had never seen any of that tribe or nation before and could only gather that she spoke a strange kind of english of her own that she could not abide pork or sausages and went neither to church or mass mercy upon his honours poor soul thought i what will become of him and his and all of us with his heretic blackamoor at the head of the castle rackrent estate i never slept a wink all night for thinking of it but before the servants i put my pipe in my mouth and kept my mind to myself for i had a great regard for the family and after this when strange gentlemens servants came to the house and would begin to talk about the bride i took care to put the best foot foremost and passed her for a nabob in the kitchen which accounted for her dark complexion and every thing the very morning after they came home however i saw plain enough how things were between sir kit and my lady though they were walking together arm in arm after breakfast looking at the new building and the improvements old thady said my master just as he used to do how do you do very well i thank your honours honour said i but i saw he was not well pleased and my heart was in my mouth as i walked along after him is the large room damp thady said his honour oh damp your honour how should it but be as dry as a bone says i after all the fires we have kept in it day and night its the barrackroomt your honours talking on and what is a barrackroom pray my dear were the first words i ever heard out of my ladys lips no matter my dear said he and went on talking to me ashamed like i should witness her ignorance to be sure to hear her talk one might have taken her for an innocentu for it was whats this sir kit and whats that sir kit all the way we went to be sure sir kit had enough to do to answer her and what do you call that sir kit said she that that looks like a pile of black bricks pray sir kit my turf stack my dear said my master and bit his lip where have you lived my lady all your life not to know a turf stack when you see it thought i but i said nothing then byandby she takes out her glass and begins spying over the country and whats all that black swamp out yonder sir kit says she my bog my dear says he and went on whistling its a very ugly prospect my dear says she you dont see it my dear says he for weve planted it out when the trees grow up in summer time says he where are the trees said she my dear still looking through her glass you are blind my dear says he what are these under your eyes these shrubs said she trees said he may be they are what you call trees in ireland my dear said she but they are not a yard high are they they were planted out but last year my lady says i to soften matters between them for i saw she was going the way to make his honour mad with her they are very well grown for their age and youll not see the bog of allyballycarrickoshaughlin atallatall through the skreen when once the leaves come out but my lady you must not quarrel with any part or parcel of allyballycarrickoshaughlin for you dont know how many hundred years that same bit of bog has been in the family we would not part with the bog of allyballycarrickoshaughlin upon no account at all it cost the late sir murtagh two hundred good pounds to defend his title to it and boundaries against the olearys who cut a road through it now one would have thought this would have been hint enough for my lady but she fell to laughing like one out of their right mind and made me say the name of the bog over for her to get it by heart a dozen timesthen she must ask me how to spell it and what was the meaning of it in englishsir kit standing by whistling all the while i verily believed she laid the corner stone of all her future misfortunes at that very instant but i said no more only looked at sir kit there were no balls no dinners no doings the country was all disappointedsir kits gentleman said in a whisper to me it was all my ladys own fault because she was so obstinate about the cross what cross says i is it about her being a heretic oh no such matter says he my master does not mind her heresies but her diamond cross its worth i cant tell you how much and she has thousands of english pounds concealed in diamonds about her which she as good as promised to give up to my master before he married but now she wont part with any of them and she must take the consequences her honeymoon at least her irish honeymoon was scarcely well over when his honour one morning said to me thady buy me a pig and then the sausages were ordered and here was the first open breakingout of my ladys troubles my lady came down herself into the kitchen to speak to the cook about the sausages and desired never to see them more at her table now my master had ordered them and my lady knew that the cook took my ladys part because she never came down into the kitchen and was young and innocent in housekeeping which raised her pity besides said she at her own table surely my lady should order and disorder what she pleases but the cook soon changed her note for my master made it a principle to have the sausages and swore at her for a jew herself till he drove her fairly out of the kitchen then for fear of her place and because he threatened that my lady should give her no discharge without the sausages she gave up and from that day forward always sausages or bacon or pig meat in some shape or other went up to table upon which my lady shut herself up in her own room and my master said she might stay there with an oath and to make sure of her he turned the key in the door and kept it ever after in his pocket we none of us ever saw or heard her speak for seven years after that he carried her dinner himself then his honour had a great deal of company to dine with him and balls in the house and was as gay and gallant and as much himself as before he was married and at dinner he always drank my lady rackrents good health and so did the company and he sent out always a servant with his compliments to my lady rackrent and the company was drinking her ladyships health and begged to know if there was any thing at table he might send her and the man came back after the sham errand with my lady rackrents compliments and she was very much obliged to sir kitshe did not wish for any thing but drank the companys health the country to be sure talked and wondered at my ladys being shut up but nobody chose to interfere or ask any impertinent questions for they knew my master was a man very apt to give a short answer himself and likely to call a man out for it afterwards he was a famous shot had killed his man before he came of age and nobody scarce dared look at him whilst at bath sir kits character was so well known in the country that he lived in peace and quietness ever after and was a great favourite with the ladies especially when in process of time in the fifth year of her confinement my lady rackrent fell ill and took entirely to her bed and he gave out that she was now skin and bone and could not last through the winter in this he had two physicians opinions to back him for now he called in two physicians for her and tried all his arts to get the diamond cross from her on her deathbed and to get her to make a will in his favour of her separate possessions but there she was too tough for him he used to swear at her behind her back after kneeling to her to her face and call her in the presence of his gentleman his stiffnecked israelite though before he married her that same gentleman told me he used to call her how he could bring it out i dont know my pretty jessica to be sure it must have been hard for her to guess what sort of a husband he reckoned to make her when she was lying to all expectation on her deathbed of a broken heart i could not but pity her though she was a jewish and considering too it was no fault of hers to be taken with my master so young as she was at the bath and so fine a gentleman as sir kit was when he courted her and considering too after all they had heard and seen of him as a husband there were now no less than three ladies in our county talked of for his second wife all at daggers drawn with each other as his gentleman swore at the balls for sir kit for their partneri could not but think them bewitched but they all reasoned with themselves that sir kit would make a good husband to any christian but a jewish i suppose and especially as he was now a reformed rake and it was not known how my ladys fortune was settled in her will nor how the castle rackrent estate was all mortgaged and bonds out against him for he was never cured of his gaming tricks but that was the only fault he had god bless him my lady had a sort of fit and it was given out she was dead by mistake this brought things to a sad crisis for my poor masterone of the three ladies showed his letters to her brother and claimed his promises whilst another did the same i dont mention names sir kit in his defence said he would meet any man who dared to question his conduct and as to the ladies they must settle it amongst them who was to be his second and his third and his fourth whilst his first was still alive to his mortification and theirs upon this as upon all former occasions he had the voice of the country with him on account of the great spirit and propriety he acted with he met and shot the first ladys brother the next day he called out the second who had a woodenleg and their place of meeting by appointment being in a new ploughed field the woodenleg man stuck fast in it sir kit seeing his situation with great candour fired his pistol over his head upon which the seconds interposed and convinced the parties there had been a slight misunderstanding between them thereupon they shook hands cordially and went home to dinner together this gentleman to show the world how they stood together and by the advice of the friends of both parties to reestablish his sisters injured reputation went out with sir kit as his second and carried his message next day to the last of his adversaries i never saw him in such fine spirits as that day he went outsure enough he was within amesace of getting quit handsomely of all his enemies but unluckily after hitting the toothpick out of his adversarys finger and thumb he received a ball in a vital part and was brought home in little better than an hour after the affair speechless on a handbarrow to my lady we got the key out of his pocket the first thing we did and my son jason ran to unlock the barrackroom where my lady had been shut up for seven years to acquaint her with the fatal accident the surprise bereaved her of her senses at first nor would she believe but we were putting some new trick upon her to entrap her out of her jewels for a great while till jason bethought himself of taking her to the window and showed her the men bringing sir kit up the avenue upon the handbarrow which had immediately the desired effect for directly she burst into tears and pulling her cross from her bosom she kissed it with as great devotion as ever i witnessed and lifting up her eyes to heaven uttered some ejaculation which none present heard but i take the sense of it to be she returned thanks for this unexpected interposition in her favour when she had least reason to expect it my master was greatly lamented there was no life in him when we lifted him off the barrow so he was laid out immediately and waked the same night the country was all in an uproar about him and not a soul but cried shame upon his murderer who would have been hanged surely if he could have been brought to his trial whilst the gentlemen in the country were up about it but he very prudently withdrew himself to the continent before the affair was made public as for the young lady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident however innocently she could never show her head after at the balls in the county or any place and by the advice of her friends and physicians she was ordered soon after to bath where it was expected if any where on this side of the grave she would meet with the recovery of her health and lost peace of mind as a proof of his great popularity i need only add that there was a song made upon my masters untimely death in the newspapers which was in every bodys mouth singing up and down through the country even down to the mountains only three days after his unhappy exit he was also greatly bemoaned at the curraghv where his cattle were well known and all who had taken up his bets were particularly inconsolable for his loss to society his stud sold at the cantx at the greatest price ever known in the county his favourite horses were chiefly disposed of amongst his particular friends who would give any price for them for his sake but no ready money was required by the new heir who wished not to displease any of the gentlemen of the neighbourhood just upon his coming to settle amongst them so a long credit was given where requisite and the cash has never been gathered in from that day to this but to return to my ladyshe got surprisingly well after my masters decease no sooner was it known for certain that he was dead than all the gentlemen within twenty miles of us came in a body as it were to set my lady at liberty and to protest against her confinement which they now for the first time understood was against her own consent the ladies too were as attentive as possible striving who should be foremost with their morning visits and they that saw the diamonds spoke very handsomely of them but thought it a pity they were not bestowed if it had so pleased god upon a lady who would have become them better all these civilities wrought little with my lady for she had taken an unaccountable prejudice against the country and every thing belonging to it and was so partial to her native land that after parting with the cook which she did immediately upon my masters decease i never knew her easy one instant night or day but when she was packing up to leave us had she meant to make any stay in ireland i stood a great chance of being a great favourite with her for when she found i understood the weathercock she was always finding some pretence to be talking to me and asking me which way the wind blew and was it likely did i think to continue fair for england but when i saw she had made up her mind to spend the rest of her days upon her own income and jewels in england i considered her quite as a foreigner and not at all any longer as part of the family she gave no vails to the servants at castle rackrent at parting notwithstanding the old proverb of as rich as a jew which she being a jewish they built upon with reason but from first to last she brought nothing but misfortunes amongst us and if it had not been all along with her his honour sir kit would have been now alive in all appearance her diamond cross was they say at the bottom of it all and it was a shame for her being his wife not to show more duty and to have given it up when he condescended to ask so often for such a bit of a trifle in his distresses especially when he all along made it no secret he married for money but we will not bestow another thought upon her this much i thought it lay upon my conscience to say in justice to my poor masters memory tis an ill wind that blows nobody no goodthe same wind that took the jew lady rackrent over to england brought over the new heir to castle rackrent here let me pause for breath in my story for though i had a great regard for every member of the family yet without compare sir conolly commonly called for short amongst his friends sir condy rackrent was ever my great favourite and indeed the most universally beloved man i had ever seen or heard of not excepting his great ancestor sir patrick to whose memory he amongst other instances of generosity erected a handsome marble stone in the church of castle rackrent setting forth in large letters his age birth parentage and many other virtues concluding with the compliment so justly due that sir patrick rackrent lived and died a monument of old irish hospitality continuation of the memoirs of the rackrent family history of sir conolly rackrent sir condy rackrent by the grace of god heiratlaw to the castle rackrent estate was a remote branch of the family born to little or no fortune of his own he was bred to the bar at which having many friends to push him and no mean natural abilities of his own he doubtless would in process of time if he could have borne the drudgery of that study have been rapidly made kings counsel at the least but things were disposed of otherwise and he never went the circuit but twice and then made no figure for want of a fee and being unable to speak in public he received his education chiefly in the college of dublin but before he came to years of discretion lived in the country in a small but slated house within view of the end of the avenue i remember him bare footed and headed running through the street of oshaughlins town and playing at pitch and toss ball marbles and what not with the boys of the town amongst whom my son jason was a great favourite with him as for me he was ever my whiteheaded boy oftens the time when i would call in at his fathers where i was always made welcome he would slip down to me in the kitchen and love to sit on my knee whilst i told him stories of the family and the blood from which he was sprung and how he might look forward if the then present man should die without childer to being at the head of the castle rackrent estate this was then spoke quite and clear at random to please the child but it pleased heaven to accomplish my prophecy afterwards which gave him a great opinion of my judgment in business he went to a little grammarschool with many others and my son amongst the rest who was in his class and not a little useful to him in his book learning which he acknowledged with gratitude ever after these rudiments of his education thus completed he got ahorseback to which exercise he was ever addicted and used to gallop over the country while yet but a slip of a boy under the care of sir kits huntsman who was very fond of him and often lent him his gun and took him out ashooting under his own eye by these means he became well acquainted and popular amongst the poor in the neighbourhood early for there was not a cabin at which he had not stopped some morning or other along with the huntsman to drink a glass of burnt whiskey out of an eggshell to do him good and warm his heart and drive the cold out of his stomach the old people always told him he was a great likeness of sir patrick which made him first have an ambition to take after him as far as his fortune should allow he left us when of an age to enter the college and there completed his education and nineteenth year for as he was not born to an estate his friends thought it incumbent on them to give him the best education which could be had for love or money and a great deal of money consequently was spent upon him at college and temple he was a very little altered for the worse by what he saw there of the great world for when he came down into the country to pay us a visit we thought him just the same man as ever hand and glove with every one and as far from high though not without his own proper share of family pride as any man ever you see latterly seeing how sir kit and the jewish lived together and that there was no one between him and the castle rackrent estate he neglected to apply to the law as much as was expected of him and secretly many of the tenants and others advanced him cash upon his note of hand value received promising bargains of leases and lawful interest should he ever come into the estate all this was kept a great secret for fear the present man hearing of it should take it into his head to take it ill of poor condy and so should cut him off for ever by levying a fine and suffering a recovery to dock the entaily sir murtagh would have been the man for that but sir kit was too much taken up philandering to consider the law in this case or any other these practices i have mentioned to account for the state of his affairs i mean sir condys upon his coming into the castle rackrent estate he could not command a penny of his first years income which and keeping no accounts and the great sight of company he did with many other causes too numerous to mention was the origin of his distresses my son jason who was now established agent and knew every thing explained matters out of the face to sir conolly and made him sensible of his embarrassed situation with a great nominal rentroll it was almost all paid away in interest which being for convenience suffered to run on soon doubled the principal and sir condy was obliged to pass new bonds for the interest now grown principal and so on whilst this was going on my son requiring to be paid for his trouble and many years service in the family gratis and sir condy not willing to take his affairs into his own hands or to look them even in the face he gave my son a bargain of some acres which jell out of lease at a reasonable rent jason set the land as soon as his lease was sealed to under tenants to make the rent and got two hundred ayear profit rent which was little enough considering his long agency he bought the land at twelve years purchase two years afterwards when sir condy was pushed for money on an execution and was at the same time allowed for his improvements thereon there was a sort of huntinglodge upon the estate convenient to my son jasons land which he had his eye upon about this time and he was a little jealous of sir condy who talked of setting it to a stranger who was just come into the countrycaptain moneygawl was the man he was son and heir to the moneygawls of mount juliets town who had a great estate in the next county to ours and my master was loth to disoblige the young gentleman whose heart was set upon the lodge so he wrote him back that the lodge was at his service and if he would honour him with his company at castle rackrent they could ride over together some morning and look at it before signing the lease accordingly the captain came over to us and he and sir condy grew the greatest friends ever you see and were for ever out ashooting or hunting together and were very merry in the evenings and sir condy was invited of course to mount juliets town and the family intimacy that had been in sir patricks time was now recollected and nothing would serve sir condy but he must be three times aweek at the least with his new friends which grieved me who knew by the captains groom and gentleman how they talked of him at mount juliets town making him quite as one may say a laughingstock and a butt for the whole company but they were soon cured of that by an accident that surprised em not a little as it did me there was a bit of a scrawl found upon the waitingmaid of old mr moneygawls youngest daughter miss isabella that laid open the whole and her father they say was like one out of his right mind and swore it was the last thing he ever should have thought of when he invited my master to his house that his daughter should think of such a match but their talk signified not a straw for as miss isabellas maid reported her young mistress was fallen over head and ears in love with sir condy from the first time that ever her brother brought him into the house to dinner the servant who waited that day behind my masters chair was the first who knew it as he says though its hard to believe him for he did not tell it till a great while afterwards but however its likely enough as the thing turned out that he was not far out of the way for towards the middle of dinner as he says they were talking of stageplays having a playhouse and being great playactors at mount juliets town and miss isabella turns short to my master and says have you seen the playbill sir condy no i have not said he then more shame for you said the captain her brother not to know that my sister is to play juliet tonight who plays it better than any woman on or off the stage in all ireland i am very happy to hear it said sir condy and there the matter dropped for the present but sir condy all this time and it great while afterwards was at a terrible nonplus for he had no liking not he to stageplays nor to miss isabella either to his mind as it came out over a bowl of whiskeypunch at home his little judy mquirk who was daughter to a sisters son of mine was worth twenty of miss isabella he had seen her often when he stopped at her fathers cabin to drink whiskey out of the eggshell out hunting before he came to the estate and as she gave out was under something like a promise of marriage to her any how i could not but pity my poor master who was so bothered between them and he an easyhearted man that could not disoblige nobody god bless him to be sure it was not his place to behave ungenerous to miss isabella who had disobliged all her relations for his sake as he remarked and then she was locked up in her chamber and forbid to think of him any more which raised his spirit because his family was as he observed as good as theirs at any rate and the rackrents a suitable match for the moneygawls any day in the year all which was true enough but it grieved me to see that upon the strength of all this sir condy was growing more in the mind to carry off miss isabella to scotland in spite of her relations as she desired its all over with our poor judy said i with a heavy sigh making bold to speak to him one night when he was a little cheerful and standing in the servants hall all alone with me as was often his custom not at all said he i never was fonder of judy than at this present speaking and to prove it to you said he and he took from my hand a halfpenny change that i had just got along with my tobacco and to prove it to you thady says he its a toss up with me which i should marry this minute her or mr moneygawl of mount juliets towns daughterso it is oh boo boo says i making light of it to see what he would go on to next your honours joking to be sure theres no compare between our poor judy and miss isabella who has a great fortune they say im not a man to mind a fortune nor never was said sir condy proudly whatever her friends may say and to make short of it says he im come to a determination upon the spot with that he swore such a terrible oath as made me cross myself and by this book said he snatching up my ballad book mistaking it for my prayer book which lay in the window and by this book says he and by all the books that ever were shut and opened its come to a tossup with me and ill stand or fall by the toss and so thady hand me over that pin out of the inkhorn and he makes a cross on the smooth side of the halfpenny judy mquirk says he her mark god bless him his hand was a little unsteadied by all the whiskey punch he had taken but it was plain to see his heart was for poor judy my heart was all as one as in my mouth when i saw the halfpenny up in the air but i said nothing at all and when it came down i was glad i had kept myself to myself for to be sure now it was all over with poor judy judys out a luck said i striving to laugh im out a luck said he and i never saw a man look so cast down he took up the halfpenny off the flag and walked away quite soberlike by the shock now though as easy a man you would think as any in the wide world there was no such thing as making him unsay one of these sort of vows which he had learned to reverence when young as i well remember teaching him to toss up for bogberries on my knee so i saw the affair was as good as settled between him and miss isabella and i had no more to say but to wish her joy which i did the week afterwards upon her return from scotland with my poor master my new lady was young as might be supposed of a lady that had been carried off by her own consent to scotland but i could only see her at first through her veil which from bashfulness or fashion she kept over her face and am i to walk through all this crowd of people my dearest love said she to sir condy meaning us servants and tenants who had gathered at the hack gate my dear said sir condy theres nothing for it but to walk or to let me carry you as far as the house for you see the back road is too narrow for a carriage and the great piers have tumbled down across the front approach so theres no driving the right way by reason of the ruins plato thou reasonest well said she or words to that effect which i could no ways understand and again when her foot stumbled against a broken bit of a carwheel she cried out angels and ministers of grace defend us well thought i to be sure if shes no jewish like the last she is a mad woman for certain which is as bad it would have been as well for my poor master to have taken up with poor judy who is in her right mind any how she was dressed like a mad woman moreover more than like any one i ever saw afore or since and i could not take my eyes off her but still followed behind her and her feathers on the top of her hat were broke going in at the low back door and she pulled out her little bottle out of her pocket to smell to when she found herself in the kitchen and said i shall faint with the heat of this odious odious place my dear its only three steps across the kitchen and theres a fine air if your veil was up said sir condy and with that threw hack her veil so that i had then a full sight of her face she had not at all the colour of one going to faint but a fine complexion of her own as i then took it to be though her maid told me after it was all put on but even complexion and all taken in she was no way in point of good looks to compare to poor judy and with all she had a quality toss with her but may be it was my overpartiality to judy into whose place i may say she stepped that made me notice all this to do her justice however she was when we came to know her better very liberal in her housekeeping nothing at all of the skinflint in her she left every thing to the housekeeper and her own maid mrs jane who went with her to scotland gave her the best of characters for generosity she seldom or ever wore a thing twice the same way mrs jane told us and was always pulling her things to pieces and giving them away never being used in her fathers house to think of expense in any thing and she reckoned to be sure to go on the same way at castle rackrent but when i came to inquire i learned that her father was so mad with her for running off after his locking her up and forbidding her to think any more of sir condy that he would not give her a farthing and it was lucky for her she had a few thousands of her own which had been left to her by a good grandmother and these were very convenient to begin with my master and my lady set out in great style they had the finest coach and chariot and horses and liveries and cut the greatest dash in the county returning their wedding visits and it was immediately reported that her father had undertaken to pay all my masters debts and of course all his tradesmen gave him a new credit and every thing went on smack smooth and i could not but admire my ladys spirit and was proud to see castle rackrent again in all its glory my lady had a fine taste for building and furniture and playhouses and she turned every thing topsyturvy and made the barrackroom into a theatre as she called it and she went on as if she had a mint of money at her elbow and to be sure i thought she knew best especially as sir condy said nothing to it one way or the other all he asked god bless him was to live in peace and quietness and have his bottle or his whiskey punch at night to himself now this was little enough to be sure for any gentleman but my lady couldnt abide the smell of the whiskey punch my dear says he you liked it well enough before we were married and why not now my dear said she i never smelt it or i assure you i should never have prevailed upon myself to marry you my dear i am sorry you did not smell it but we cant help that now returned my master without putting himself in a passion or going out of his way but just fair and easy helped himself to another glass and drank it off to her good health all this the butler told me who was going backwards and forwards unnoticed with the jug and hot water and sugar and all he thought wanting upon my masters swallowing the last glass of whiskey punch my lady burst into tears calling him an ungrateful base barbarous wretch and went off into a fit of hysterics as i think mrs jane called it and my poor master was greatly frightened this being the first thing of the kind he had seen and he fell straight on his knees before her and like a goodhearted cratur as he was ordered the whiskey punch out of the room and bid em throw open all the windows and cursed himself and then my lady came to herself again and when she saw him kneeling there bid him get up and not forswear himself any more for that she was sure he did not love her and never had this we learned from mrs jane who was the only person left present at all this my dear returns my master thinking to be sure of judy as well he might whoever told you so is an incendiary and ill have em turned out of the house this minute if youll only let me know which of them it was told me what said my lady starting upright in her chair nothing at all nothing at all said my master seeing he had overshot himself and that my lady spoke at random but what you said just now that i did not love you bella who told you that my own sense she said and she put her handkerchief to her face and leant back upon mrs jane and fell to sobbing as if her heart would break why now bella this is very strange of you said my poor master if nobody has told younothing what is it you are taking on for at this rate and exposing yourself and me for this way oh say no more say no more every word you say kills me cried my lady and she ran on like one as mrs jane says raving oh sir condy sir condy i that had hoped to find in you why now faith this is a little too much do bella try to recollect yourself my dear am not i your husband and of your own choosing and is not that enough oh too much too much cried my lady wringing her hands why my dear come to your right senses for the love of heaven see is not the whiskey punch jug and bowl and all gone out of the room long ago what is it in the wide world you have to complain of but still my lady sobbed and sobbed and called herself the most wretched of women and among other outoftheway provoking things asked my master was he fit for company for her and he drinking all night this nettling him which it was hard to do he replied that as to drinking all night he was then as sober as she was herself and that it was no matter how much a man drank provided it did no ways affect or stagger him that as to being fit company for her he thought himself of a family to be fit company for any lord or lady in the land but that he never prevented her from seeing and keeping what company she pleased and that he had done his best to make castle rackrent pleasing to her since her marriage having always had the house full of visitors and if her own relations were not amongst them he said that was their own fault and their prides fault of which he was sorry to find her ladyship had so unbecoming a share so concluding he took his candle and walked off to his room and my lady was in her tantarums for three days after and would have been so much longer no doubt but some of her friends young ladies and cousins and second cousins came to castle rackrent by my poor masters express invitation to see her and she was in a hurry to get up as mrs jane called it a play for them and so got well and was as finely dressed and as happy to look at as ever and all the young ladies who used to be in her room dressing of her said in mrs janes hearing that my lady was the happiest bride ever they had seen and that to be sure a lovematch was the only thing for happiness where the parties could any way afford it as to affording it god knows it was little they knew of the matter my ladys few thousands could not last for ever especially the way she went on with them and letters from tradesfolk came every post thick and threefold with bills as long as my arm of years and years standing my son jason had em all handed over to him and the pressing letters were all unread by sir condy who hated trouble and could never be brought to hear talk of business but still put it off and put it off saying settle it any how or bid em call again tomorrow or speak to me about it some other time now it was hard to find the right time to speak for in the mornings he was abed and in the evenings over his bottle where no gentleman chooses to be disturbed things in a twelvemonth or so came to such a pass there was no making a shift to go on any longer though we were all of us well enough used to live from hand to mouth at castle rackrent one day i remember when there was a power of company all sitting after dinner in the dusk not to say dark in the drawingroom my lady having rung five times for candles and none to go up the housekeeper sent up the footman who went to my mistress and whispered behind her chair how it was my lady says he there are no candles in the house bless me says she then take a horse and gallop off as fast as you can to carrick ofungus and get some and in the mean time tell them to step into the playhouse and try if there are not some bits left added sir condy who happened to be within hearing the man was sent up again to my lady to let her know there was no horse to go but one that wanted a shoe go to sir condy then i know nothing at all about the horses said my lady why do you plague me with these things how it was settled i really forget but to the best of my remembrance the boy was sent down to my son jasons to borrow candles for the night another time in the winter and on a desperate cold day there was no turf in for the parlour and above stairs and scarce enough for the cook in the kitchen the little gossoon was sent off to the neighbours to see and beg or borrow some but none could he bring back with him for love or money so as needs must we were forced to trouble sir condywell and if theres no turf to be had in the town or country why what signifies talking any more about it cant ye go and cut down a tree which tree please your honour i made bold to say any tree at all thats good to burn said sir condy send off smart and get one down and the fires lighted before my lady gets up to breakfast or the house will be too hot to hold us he was always very considerate in all things about my lady and she wanted for nothing whilst he had it to give well when things were tight with them about this time my son jason put in a word again about the lodge and made a genteel offer to lay down the purchasemoney to relieve sir condys distresses now sir condy had it from the best authority that there were two writs come down to the sheriff against his person and the sheriff as ill luck would have it was no friend of his and talked how he must do his duty and how he would do it if it was against the first man in the country or even his own brother let alone one who had voted against him at the last election as sir condy had done so sir condy was fain to take the purchasemoney of the lodge from my son jason to settle matters and sure enough it was a good bargain for both parties for my son bought the feesimple of a good house for him and his heirs for ever for little or nothing and by selling of it for that same my master saved himself from a gaol every way it turned out fortunate for sir condy for before the money was all gone there came a general election and he being so well beloved in the county and one of the oldest families no one had a better right to stand candidate for the vacancy and he was called upon by all his friends and the whole county i may say to declare himself against the old member who had little thought of a contest my master did not relish the thoughts of a troublesome canvass and all the illwill he might bring upon himself by disturbing the peace of the county besides the expense which was no trifle but all his friends called upon one another to subscribe and they formed themselves into a committee and wrote all his circular letters for him and engaged all his agents and did all the business unknown to him and he was well pleased that it should be so at last and my lady herself was very sanguine about the election and there was open house kept night and day at castle rackrent and i thought i never saw my lady look so well in her life as she did at that time there were grand dinners and all the gentlemen drinking success to sir condy till they were carried off and then dances and balls and the ladies all finishing with a raking pot of tea in the morningz indeed it was well the company made it their choice to sit up all nights for there were not half beds enough for the sights of people that were in it though there were shakedowns in the drawingroom always made up before sunrise for those that liked it for my part when i saw the doings that were going on and the loads of claret that went down the throats of them that had no right to be asking for it and the sights of meat that went up to table and never came down besides what was carried off to one or tother below stairs i couldnt but pity my poor master who was to pay for all but i said nothing for fear of gaining myself illwill the day of election will come some time or other says i to myself and all will be over and so it did and a glorious day it was as any i ever had the happiness to see huzza huzza sir condy rackrent for ever was the first thing i hears in the morning and the same and nothing else all day and not a soul sober only just when polling enough to give their votes as became em and to stand the browbeating of the lawyers who came tight enough upon us and many of our freeholders were knocked off having never a freehold that they could safely swear to and sir condy was not willing to have any man perjure himself for his sake as was done on the other side god knows but no matter for that some of our friends were dumbfounded by the lawyers asking them had they ever been upon the ground where their freeholds lay now sir condy being tender of the consciences of them that had not been on the ground and so could not swear to a freehold when crossexamined by them lawyers sent out for a couple of cleavesfull of the sods of his farm of gulteeshinnagh and as soon as the sods came into town he set each man upon his sod and so then ever after you know they could fairly swear they had been upon the ground we gained the day by this piece of honestya i thought i should have died in the streets for joy when i seed my poor master chaired and he bareheaded and it raining as hard as it could pour but all the crowds following him up and down and he bowing and shaking hands with the whole town is that sir condy rackrent in the chair says a stranger man in the crowd the same says i who else should it he god bless him and i take it then you belong to him says he not at all says i but i live under him and have done so these two hundred years and upwards me and mine its lucky for you then rejoins he that he is where he is for was he any where else but in the chair this minute hed be in a worse place for i was sent down on purpose to put him up and heres my order for so doing in my pocket it was a writ that villain the wine merchant had marked against my poor master for some hundreds of an old debt which it was a shame to be talking of at such a time as this put it in your pocket again and think no more of it any ways for seven years to come my honest friend says i hes a member of parliament now praised be god and such as you cant touch him and if youll take a fools advice id have you keep out of the way this day or youll run a good chance of getting your deserts amongst my masters friends unless you choose to drink his health like every body else ive no objection to that in life said he so we went into one of the public houses kept open for my master and we had a great deal of talk about this thing and that and how is it says he your master keeps on so well upon his legs i heard say he was off holantide twelvemonth past never was better or heartier in his life said i its not that im after speaking of said he but there was a great report of his being ruined no matter says i the sheriffs two years running were his particular friends and the subsheriffs were both of them gentlemen and were properly spoken to and so the writs lay snug with them and they as i understand by my son jason the custom in them cases is returned the writs as they came to them to those that sent em much good may it do them with a word in latin that no such person as sir condy rackrent bart was to be found in those parts oh i understand all those ways better no offence than you says he laughing and at the same time filling his glass to my masters good health which convinced me he was a warm friend in his heart after all though appearances were a little suspicious or so at first to be sure says he still cutting his joke when a mans over head and shoulders in debt he may live the faster for it and the better if he goes the right way about it or else how is it so many live on so well as we see every day after they are ruined how is it says i being a little merry at the time how is it but just as you see the ducks in the chickenyard just after their heads are cut off by the cook running round and round faster than when alive at which conceit he fell a laughing and remarked he had never had the happiness yet to see the chickenyard at castle rackrent it wont be long so i hope says i youll be kindly welcome there as every body is made by my master there is not a freer spoken gentleman or a better beloved high or low in all ireland and of what passed after this im not sensible for we drank sir condys good health and the downfall of his enemies till we could stand no longer ourselves and little did i think at the time or till long after how i was harbouring my poor masters greatest of enemies myself this fellow had the impudence after coming to see the chickenyard to get me to introduce him to my son jason little more than the man that never was born did i guess at his meaning by this visit he gets him a correct list fairly drawn out from my son jason of all my masters debts and goes straight round to the creditors and buys them all up which he did easy enough seeing the half of them never expected to see their money out of sir condys hands then when this baseminded limb of the law as i afterward detected him in being grew to be sole creditor over all he takes him out a custodiam on all the denominations and subdenominations and every cartonb and half carton upon the estate and not content with that must have an execution against the masters goods and down to the furniture though little worth of castle rackrent itself but this is a part of my story im not come to yet and its bad to be forestalling ill news flies fast enough all the world over to go back to the day of the election which i never think of but with pleasure and tears of gratitude for those good times after the election was quite and clean over there comes shoals of people from all parts claiming to have obliged my master with their votes and putting him in mind of promises which he could never remember himself to have made one was to have a freehold for each of his four sons another was to have a renewal of a lease another an abatement one came to be paid ten guineas for a pair of silver buckles sold my master on the hustings which turned out to be no better than copper gilt another had a long bill for oats the half of which never went into the granary to my certain knowledge and the other half were not fit for the cattle to touch but the bargain was made the week before the election and the coach and saddle horses were got into order for the day besides a vote fairly got by them oats so no more reasoning on that head but then there was no end to them that were telling sir condy he had engaged to make their sons excisemen or high constables or the like and as for them that had bills to give in for liquor and beds and straw and ribands and horses and postchaises for the gentlemen freeholders that came from all parts and other counties to vote for my master and were not to be sure to be at any charges there was no standing against all these and worse than all the gentlemen of my masters committee who managed all for him and talked how theyd bring him in without costing him a penny and subscribed by hundreds very genteelly forgot to pay their subscriptions and had laid out in agents and lawyers fees and secret service money the lord knows how much and my master could never ask one of them for their subscription you are sensible nor for the price of a fine horse he had sold one of them so it all was left at his door he could never god bless him again i say bring himself to ask a gentleman for money despising such sort of conversation himself but others who were not gentlemen born behaved very uncivil in pressing him at this very time and all he could do to content em all was to take himself out of the way as fast as possible to dublin where my lady had taken a house fitting for him as a member of parliament to attend his duty in there all the winter i was very lonely when the whole family was gone and all the things they had ordered to go and forgot sent after them by the car there was then a great silence in castle rackrent and i went moping from room to room hearing the doors clap for want of right locks and the wind through the broken windows that the glazier never would come to mend and the rain coming through the roof and best ceilings all over the house for want of the slater whose bill was not paid besides our having no slates or shingles for that part of the old building which was shingled and burnt when the chimney took fire and had been open to the weather ever since i took myself to the servants hall in the evening to smoke my pipe as usual but missed the bit of talk we used to have there sadly and ever after was content to stay in the kitchen and boil my little potatoes and put up my bed there and every postday i looked in the newspaper but no news of my master in the house he never spoke good or bad but as the butler wrote down word to my son jason was very ill used by the government about a place that was promised him and never given after his supporting them against his conscience very honourably and being greatly abused for it which hurt him greatly he having the name of a great patriot in the country before the house and living in dublin too were not to be had for nothing and my son jason said sir condy must soon be looking out for a new agent for ive done my part and can do no moreif my lady had the bank of ireland to spend it would go all in one winter and sir condy would never gainsay her though he does not care the rind of a lemon for her all the while now i could not bear to hear jason giving out after this manner against the family and twenty people standing by in the street ever since he had lived at the lodge of his own he looked down howsomever upon poor old thady and was grown quite a great gentleman and had none of his relations near him no wonder he was no kinder to poor sir condy than to his own kith or kin in the spring it was the villain that got the list of the debts from him brought down the custodiam sir condy still attending his duty in parliament and i could scarcely believe my own old eyes or the spectacles with which i read it when i was shown my son jasons name joined in the custodiam but he told me it was only for forms sake and to make things easier than if all the land was under the power of a total stranger well i did not know what to think it was hard to be talking ill of my own and i could not but grieve for my poor masters fine estate all torn by these vultures of the law so i said nothing but just looked on to see how it would all end it was not till the month of june that he and my lady came down to the country my master was pleased to take me aside with him to the brewhouse that same evening to complain to me of my son and other matters in which he said he was confident i had neither art nor part he said a great deal more to me to whom he had been fond to talk ever since he was my whiteheaded boy before he came to the estate and all that he said about poor judy i can never forget but scorn to repeat he did not say an unkind word of my lady but wondered as well he might her relations would do nothing for him or her and they in all this great distress he did not take any thing long to heart let it be as it would and had no more malice or thought of the like in him than a child that cant speak this night it was all out of his head before he went to his bed he took his jug of whiskey punchmy lady was grown quite easy about the whiskey punch by this time and so i did suppose all was going on right betwixt them till i learnt the truth through mrs jane who talked over their affairs to the housekeeper and i within hearing the night my master came home thinking of nothing at all but just making merry he drank his bumper toast to the deserts of that old curmudgeon my fatherinlaw and all enemies at mount juliets town now my lady was no longer in the mind she formerly was and did no ways relish hearing her own friends abused in her presence she said then why dont they show themselves your friends said my master and oblige me with the loan of the money i condescended by your advice my dear to ask its now three posts since i sent off my letter desiring in the postscript a speedy answer by the return of the post and no account at all from them yet i expect theyll write to me next post says my lady and that was all that passed then but it was easy from this to guess there was a coolness betwixt them and with good cause the next morning being postday i sent off the gossoon early to the postoffice to see was there any letter likely to set matters to rights and he brought back one with the proper postmark upon it sure enough and i had no time to examine or make any conjecture more about it for into the servants hall pops mrs jane with a blue bandbox in her hand quite entirely mad dear maam and whats the matter says i matter enough says she dont you see my bandbox is wet through and my best bonnet here spoiled besides my ladys and all by the rain coming in through that gallery window that you might have got mended if youd had any sense thady all the time we were in town in the winter sure i could not get the glazier maam says i you might have stopped it up any how says she so i did maam to the best of my ability one of the panes with the old pillowcase and the other with a piece of the old stage green curtain sure i was as careful as possible all the time you were away and not a drop of rain came in at that window of all the windows in the house all winter maam when under my care and now the familys come home and its summer time i never thought no more about it to be sure but dear its a pity to think of your bonnet maam but heres what will please you maam a letter from mount juliets town for my lady with that she snatches it from me without a word more and runs up the back stairs to my mistress i follows with a slate to make up the window this window was in the long passage or gallery as my lady gave out orders to have it called in the gallery leading to my masters bedchamber and hers and when i went up with the slate the door having no lock and the bolt spoilt was ajar after mrs jane and as i was busy with the window i heard all that was saying within well whats in your letter bella my dear says he youre a long time spelling it over wont you shave this morning sir condy says she and put the letter into her pocket i shaved the day before yesterday says he my dear and thats not what im thinking of now but any thing to oblige you and to have peace and quietness my dearand presently i had the glimpse of him at the cracked glass over the chimneypiece standing up shaving himself to please my lady but she took no notice but went on reading her book and mrs jane doing her hair behind what is it youre reading there my dearphoo ive cut myself with this razor the mans a cheat that sold it me but i have not paid him for it yet what is it youre reading there did you hear me asking you my dear the sorrows of werter replies my lady as well as i could hear i think more of the sorrows of sir condy says my master joking like what news from mount juliets town no news says she but the old story over again my friends all reproaching me still for what i cant help now is it for marrying me said my master still shaving what signifies as you say talking of that when it cant be helpd now with that she heaved a great sigh that i heard plain enough in the passage and did not you use me basely sir condy says she not to tell me you were ruined before i married you tell you my dear said he did you ever ask me one word about it and had not you friends enough of your own that were telling you nothing else from morning to night if youd have listened to them slanders no slanders nor are my friends slanderers and i cant bear to hear them treated with disrespect as i do says my lady and took out her pocket handkerchief they are the best of friends and if i had taken their advice but my father was wrong to lock me up i own that was the only unkind thing i can charge him with for if he had not locked me up i should never have had a serious thought of running away as i did well my dear said my master dont cry and make yourself uneasy about it now when its all over and you have the man of your own choice in spite of em all i was too young i know to make a choice at the time you ran away with me im sure says my lady and another sigh which made my master half shaved as he was turn round upon her in surprise why bell says he you cant deny what you know as well as i do that it was at your own particular desire and that twice under your own hand and seal expressed that i should carry you off as i did to scotland and marry you there well say no more about it sir condy said my lady pettish likei was a child then you know and as far as i know youre little better now my dear bella to be talking in this manner to your husbands face but i wont take it ill of you for i know its something in that letter you put into your pocket just now that has set you against me all on a sudden and imposed upon your understanding its not so very easy as you think it sir condy to impose upon my understanding said my lady my dear says he i have and with reason the best opinion of your understanding of any man now breathing and you know i have never set my own in competition with it till now my dear bella says he taking her hand from her book as kind as could betill now when i have the great advantage of being quite cool and you not so dont believe one word your friends say against your own sir condy and lend me the letter out of your pocket till i see what it is they can have to say take it then says she and as you are quite cool i hope it is a proper time to request youll allow me to comply with the wishes of all my own friends and return to live with my father and family during the remainder of my wretched existence at mount juliets town at this my poor master fell back a few paces like one that had been shot youre not serious bella says he and could you find it in your heart to leave me this way in the very middle of my distresses all alone but recollecting himself after his first surprise and a moments time for reflection he said with a great deal of consideration for my lady well bella my dear i believe you are right for what could you do at castle rackrent and an execution against the goods coming down and the furniture to be canted and an auction in the house all next week so you have my full consent to go since that is your desire only you must not think of my accompanying you which i could not in honour do upon the terms i always have been since our marriage with your friends besides i have business to transact at home so in the mean time if we are to have any breakfast this morning let us go down and have it for the last time in peace and comfort bella then as i heard my master coming to the passage door i finished fastening up my slate against the broken pane and when he came out i wiped down the window seat with my wig and bade him a good morrow as kindly as i could seeing he was in trouble though he strove and thought to hide it from me this window is all racked and tattered says i and its what im striving to mend it is all racked and tattered plain enough says he and never mind mending it honest old thady says he it will do well enough for you and i and thats all the company we shall have left in the house byandby im sorry to see your honour so low this morning says i but youll be better after taking your breakfast step down to the servants hall said he and bring me up the pen and ink into the parlour and get a sheet of paper from mrs jane for i have business that cant brook to be delayed and come into the parlour with the pen and ink yourself thady for i must have you to witness my signing a paper i have to execute in a hurry well while i was getting of the pen and inkhorn and the sheet of paper i ransacked my brains to think what could be the papers my poor master could have to execute in such a hurry he that never thought of such a thing as doing business afore breakfast in the whole course of his life for any man living but this was for my lady as i afterwards found and the more genteel of him after all her treatment i was just witnessing the paper that he had scrawled over and was shaking the ink out of my pen upon the carpet when my lady came in to breakfast and she started as if it had been a ghost as well she might when she saw sir condy writing at this unseasonable hour that will do very well thady says he to me and took the paper i had signed to without knowing what upon the earth it might be out of my hands and walked folding it up to my lady you are concerned in this my lady rackrent said he putting it into her hands and i beg youll keep this memorandum safe and show it to your friends the first thing you do when you get home but put it in your pocket now my dear and let us eat our breakfast in gods name what is all this said my lady opening the paper in great curiosity its only a bit of a memorandum of what i think becomes me to do whenever i am able says my master you know my situation tied hand and foot at the present time being but that cant last always and when im dead and gone the land will be to the good thady you know and take notice its my intention your lady should have a clear five hundred a year jointure off the estate afore any of my debts are paid oh please your honour says i i cant expect to live to see that time being now upwards of fourscore years of age and you a young man and likely to continue so by the help of god i was vexed to see my lady so insensible too for all she said was this is very genteel of you sir condy you need not wait any longer thady so i just picked up the pen and ink that had tumbled on the floor and heard my master finish with saying you behaved very genteel to me my dear when you threw all the little you had in your own power along with yourself into my hands and as i dont deny but what you may have had some things to complain ofto be sure he was thinking then of judy or of the whiskey punch one or tother or bothand as i dont deny but you may have had something to complain of my dear it is but fair you should have something in the form of compensation to look forward to agreeably in future besides its an act of justice to myself that none of your friends my dear may ever have it to say against me i married for money and not for love that is the last thing i should ever have thought of saying of you sir condy said my lady looking very gracious then my dear said sir condy we shall part as good friends as we met so alls right i was greatly rejoiced to hear this and went out of the parlour to report it all to the kitchen the next morning my lady and mrs jane set out for mount juliets town in the jaunting car many wondered at my ladys choosing to go away considering all things upon the jaunting car as if it was only a party of pleasure but they did not know till i told them that the coach was all broke in the journey down and no other vehicle but the car to be had besides my ladys friends were to send their coach to meet her at the cross roads so it was all done very proper my poor master was in great trouble after my lady left us the execution came down and every thing at castle rackrent was seized by the gripers and my son jason to his shame be it spoken amongst them i wondered for the life of me how he could harden himself to do it but then he had been studying the law and had made himself attorney quirk so he brought down at once a heap of accounts upon my masters head to cash lent and to ditto and to ditto and to ditto and oats and bills paid at the milliners and linendrapers and many dresses for the fancy balls in dublin for my lady and all the bills to the workmen and tradesmen for the scenery of the theatre and the chandlers and grocers bills and tailors besides butchers and bakers and worse than all the old one of that base wine merchants that wanted to arrest my poor master for the amount on the election day for which amount sir condy afterwards passed his note of hand bearing lawful interest from the date thereof and the interest and compound interest was now mounted to a terrible deal on many other notes and bonds for money borrowed and there was besides hush money to the subsheriffs and sheets upon sheets of old and new attorneys bills with heavy balances as per former account furnished brought forward with interest thereon then there was a powerful deal due to the crown for sixteen years arrear of quitrent of the townlands of carrickshaughlin with drivers fees and a compliment to the receiver every year for letting the quitrent run on to oblige sir condy and sir kit afore him then there were bills for spirits and ribands at the election time and the gentlemen of the committees accounts unsettled and their subscription never gathered and there were cows to be paid for with the smith and farriers bills to be set against the rent of the demesne with calf and hay money then there was all the servants wages since i dont know when coming due to them and sums advanced for them by my son jason for clothes and boots and whips and odd moneys for sundries expended by them in journeys to town and elsewhere and pocketmoney for the master continually and messengers and postage before his being a parliament man i cant myself tell you what besides but this i know that when the evening came on the which sir condy had appointed to settle all with my son jason and when he comes into the parlour and sees the sight of bills and load of papers all gathered on the great diningtable for him he puts his hands before both his eyes and cried out merciful jasus what is it i see before me then i sets an armchair at the table for him and with a deal of difficulty he sits him down and my son jason hands him over the pen and ink to sign to this mans bill and tother mans bill all which he did without making the least objections indeed to give him his due i never seen a man more fair and honest and easy in all his dealings from first to last as sir condy or more willing to pay every man his own as far as he was able which is as much as any one can do well says he joking like with jason i wish we could settle it all with a stroke of my grey goose quill what signifies making me wade through all this ocean of papers here cant you now who understand drawing out an account debtor and creditor just sit down here at the corner of the table and get it done out for me that i may have a clear view of the balance which is all i need be talking about you know very true sir condy nobody understands business better than yourself says jason so ive a right to do being born and bred to the bar says sir condy thady do step out and see are they bringing in the things for the punch for weve just done all we have to do for this evening i goes out accordingly and when i came back jason was pointing to the balance which was a terrible sight to my poor master pooh pooh pooh says he heres so many noughts they dazzle my eyes so they do and put me in mind of all i suffered larning of my numeration table when i was a boy at the dayschool along with you jasonunits tens hundreds tens of hundreds is the punch ready thady says he seeing me immediately the boy has the jug in his hand its coming up stairs please your honour as fast as possible says i for i saw his honour was tired out of his life but jason very short and cruel cuts me off withdont be talking of punch yet a while its no time for punch yet a bitunits tens hundreds goes he on counting over the masters shoulder units tens hundreds thousands aaah hold your hand cries my master where in this wide world am i to find hundreds or units itself let alone thousands the balance has been running on too long says jason sticking to him as i could not have done at the time if youd have given both the indies and cork to boot the balance has been running on too long and im distressed myself on your account sir condy for money and the thing must be settled now on the spot and the balance cleared off says jason ill thank you if youll only show me how says sir condy theres but one way says jason and thats ready enough when theres no cash what can a gentleman do but go to the land how can you go to the land and it under custodiam to yourself already says sir condy and another custodiam hanging over it and no one at all can touch it you know but the custodees sure cant you sell though at a loss sure you can sell and ive a purchaser ready for you says jason have ye so said sir condy thats a great point gained but theres a thing now beyond all that perhaps you dont know yet barring thady has let you into the secret sarrah bit of a secret or any thing at all of the kind has he learned from me these fifteen weeks come st johns eve says i for we have scarce been upon speaking terms of late but what is it your honour means of a secret why the secret of the little keepsake i gave my lady rackrent the morning she left us that she might not go back emptyhanded to her friends my lady rackrent im sure has baubles and keepsakes enough as those bills on the table will show says jason but whatever it is says he taking up his pen we must add it to the balance for to be sure it cant be paid for no nor cant till after my decease said sir condy thats one good thing then colouring up a good deal he tells jason of the memorandum of the five hundred ayear jointure he had settled upon my lady at which jason was indeed mad and said a great deal in very high words that it was using a gentleman who had the management of his affairs and was moreover his principal creditor extremely ill to do such a thing without consulting him and against his knowledge and consent to all which sir condy had nothing to reply but that upon his conscience it was in a hurry and without a moments thought on his part and he was very sorry for it but if it was to do over again he would do the same and he appealed to me and i was ready to give my evidence if that would do to the truth of all he said so jason with much ado was brought to agree to a compromise the purchaser that i have ready says he will be much displeased to be sure at the incumbrance on the land but i must see and manage him heres a deed ready drawn up we have nothing to do but to put in the consideration money and our names to it and how much am i going to sellthe lands of oshaughlins town and the lands of gruneaghoolaghan and the lands of crookagnawaturgh says he just reading to himselfandoh murder jason sure you wont put this inthe castle stable and appurtenances of castle rackrent oh murder says i clapping my hands this is too bad jason why so said jason when its all and a great deal more to the back of it lawfully mine was i to push for it look at him says i pointing to sir condy who was just leaning back in his armchair with his arms falling beside him like one stupified is it you jason that can stand in his presence and recollect all he has been to us and all we have been to him and yet use him so at the last who will you find to use him better i ask you said jason if he can get a better purchaser im content i only offer to purchase to make things easy and oblige him though i dont see what compliment i am under if you come to that i have never had asked or charged more than sixpence in the pound receivers fees and where would he have got an agent for a penny less oh jason jason how will you stand to this in the face of the county and all who know you says i and what will people think and say when they see you living here in castle rackrent and the lawful owner turned out of the seat of his ancestors without a cabin to put his head into or so much as a potatoe to eat jason whilst i was saying this and a great deal more made me signs and winks and frowns but i took no heed for i was grieved and sick at heart for my poor master and couldnt but speak heres the punch says jason for the door opened heres the punch hearing that my master starts up in his chair and recollects himself and jason uncorks the whiskey set down the jug here says he making room for it beside the papers opposite to sir condy but still not stirring the deed that was to make over all well i was in great hopes he had some touch of mercy about him when i saw him making the punch and my master took a glass but jason put it back as he was going to fill again saying no sir condy it shant be said of me i got your signature to this deed when you were halfseas over you know your name and handwriting in that condition would not if brought before the courts benefit me a straw wherefore let us settle all before we go deeper into the punchbowl settle all as you will said sir condy clapping his hands to his ears but let me hear no more im bothered to death this night youve only to sign said jason putting the pen to him take all and be content said my master so he signed and the man who brought in the punch witnessed it for i was not able but crying like a child and besides jason said which i was glad of that i was no fit witness being so old and doting it was so bad with me i could not taste a drop of the punch itself though my master himself god bless him in the midst of his trouble poured out a glass for me and brought it up to my lips not a drop i thank your honours honour as much as if i took it though and i just set down the glass as it was and went out and when i got to the streetdoor the neighbours childer who were playing at marbles there seeing me in great trouble left their play and gathered about me to know what ailed me and i told them all for it was a great relief to me to speak to these poor childer that seemed to have some natural feeling left in them and when they were made sensible that sir condy was going to leave castle rackrent for good and all they set up a whillalu that could be heard to the farthest end of the street and one fine boy he was that my master had given an apple to that morning cried the loudest but they all were the same sorry for sir condy was greatly beloved amongst the childer for letting them go anutting in the demesne without saying a word to them though my lady objected to them the people in the town who were the most of them standing at their doors hearing the childer cry would know the reason of it and when the report was made known the people one and all gathered in great anger against my son jason and terror at the notion of his coming to be landlord over them and they cried no jason no jason sir condy sir condy sir condy rackrent for ever and the mob grew so great and so loud i was frightened and made my way back to the house to warn my son to make his escape or hide himself for fear of the consequences jason would not believe me till they came all round the house and to the windows with great shouts then he grew quite pale and asked sir condy what had he best do ill tell you what youd best do said sir condy who was laughing to see his fright finish your glass first then lets go to the window and show ourselves and ill tell em or you shall if you please that im going to the lodge for change of air for my health and by my own desire for the rest of my days do so said jason who never meant it should have been so but could not refuse him the lodge at this unseasonable time accordingly sir condy threw up the sash and explained matters and thanked all his friends and bid em look in at the punchbowl and observe that jason and he had been sitting over it very good friends so the mob was content and he sent em out some whiskey to drink his health and that was the last time his honours health was ever drunk at castle rackrent the very next day being too proud as he said to me to stay an hour longer in a house that did not belong to him he sets off to the lodge and i along with him not many hours after and there was great bemoaning through all oshaughlins town which i stayed to witness and gave my poor master a full account of when i got to the lodge he was very low and in his bed when i got there and complained of a great pain about his heart but i guessed it was only trouble and all the business let alone vexation he had gone through of late and knowing the nature of him from a boy i took my pipe and whilst smoking it by the chimney began telling him how he was beloved and regretted in the county and it did him a deal of good to hear it your honour has a great many friends yet that you dont know of rich and poor in the county says i for as i was coming along the road i met two gentlemen in their own carriages who asked after you knowing me and wanted to know where you was and all about you and even how old i was think of that then he wakened out of his doze and began questioning me who the gentlemen were and the next morning it came into my head to go unknown to any body with my masters compliments round to many of the gentlemens houses where he and my lady used to visit and people that i knew were his great friends and would go to cork to serve him any day in the year and i made bold to try to borrow a trifle of cash from them they all treated me very civil for the most part and asked a great many questions very kind about my lady and sir condy and all the family and were greatly surprised to learn from me castle rackrent was sold and my master at the lodge for health and they all pitied him greatly and he had their good wishes if that would do but money was a thing they unfortunately had not any of them at this time to spare i had my journey for my pains and i not used to walking nor supple as formerly was greatly tired but had the satisfaction of telling my master when i got to the lodge all the civil things said by high and low thady says he all youve been telling me brings a strange thought into my head ive a notion i shall not be long for this world any how and ive a great fancy to see my own funeral afore i die i was greatly shocked at the first speaking to hear him speak so light about his funeral and he to all appearance in good health but recollecting myself answered to be sure it would be as fine a sight as one could see i dared to say and one i should be proud to witness and i did not doubt his honours would be as great a funeral as ever sir patrick oshaughlins was and such a one as that had never been known in the county afore or since but i never thought he was in earnest about seeing his own funeral himself till the next day he returns to it again thady says he as far as the wake goes sure i might without any great trouble have the satisfaction of seeing a bit of my own funeral well since your honours honours so bent upon it says i not willing to cross him and he in trouble we must see what we can do so he fell into a sort of a sham disorder which was easy done as he kept his bed and no one to see him and i got my shister who was an old woman very handy about the sick and very skilful to come up to the lodge to nurse him and we gave out she knowing no better that he was just at his latter end and it answered beyond any thing and there was a great throng of people men women and childer and there being only two rooms at the lodge except what was locked up full of jasons furniture and things the house was soon as full and fuller than it could hold and the heat and smoke and noise wonderful great and standing amongst them that were near the bed but not thinking at all of the dead i was started by the sound of my masters voice from under the great coats that had been thrown all at top and i went close up no one noticing thady says he ive had enough of this im smothering and cant hear a word of all theyre saying of the deceased god bless you and lie still and quiet says i a bit longer for my shisters afraid of ghosts and would die on the spot with fright was she to see you come to life all on a sudden this way without the least preparation so he lays him still though well nigh stifled and i made all haste to tell the secret of the joke whispering to one and tother and there was a great surprise but not so great as we had laid out it would and arent we to have the pipes and tobacco after coming so far tonight said some but they were all well enough pleased when his honour got up to drink with them and sent for more spirits from a shebeanhouse where they very civilly let him have it upon credit so the night passed off very merrily but to my mind sir condy was rather upon the sad order in the midst of it all not finding there had been such a great talk about himself after his death as he had always expected to hear the next morning when the house was cleared of them and none but my shister and myself left in the kitchen with sir condy one opens the door and walks in and who should it be but judy mquirk herself i forgot to notice that she had been married long since whilst young captain moneygawl lived at the lodge to the captains huntsman who after a whilst listed and left her and was killed in the wars poor judy fell off greatly in her good looks after her being married a year or two and being smokedried in the cabin and neglecting herself like it was hard for sir condy himself to know her again till she spoke but when she says its judy mquirk please your honour dont you remember her oh judy is it you says his honour yes sure i remember you very well but youre greatly altered judy sure its time for me says she and i think your honour since i seen you lastbut thats a great while agois altered too and with reason judy says sir condy fetching a sort of a sigh but hows this judy he goes on i take it a little amiss of you that you were not at my wake last night ah dont be being jealous of that says she i didnt hear a sentence of your honours wake till it was all over or it would have gone hard with me but i would have been at it sure but i was forced to go ten miles up the country three days ago to a wedding of a relation of my owns and didnt get home till after the wake was over but says she it wont be so i hope the next time please your honour that we shall see judy says his honour and may be sooner than you think for for ive been very unwell this while past and dont reckon any way im long for this world at this judy takes up the corner of her apron and puts it first to one eye and then to tother being to all appearance in great trouble and my shister put in her word and bid his honour have a good heart for she was sure it was only the gout that sir patrick used to have flying about him and he ought to drink a glass or a bottle extraordinary to keep it out of his stomach and he promised to take her advice and sent out for more spirits immediately and judy made a sign to me and i went over to the door to her and she said i wonder to see sir condy so low has he heard the news what news says i didnt ye hear it then says she my lady rackrent that was is kiltd and lying for dead and i dont doubt but its all over with her by this time mercy on us all says i how was it the jaunting car it was that ran away with her says judy i was coming home that same time from biddy mguggins marriage and a great crowd of people too upon the road coming from the fair of crookaghnawaturgh and i sees a jaunting car standing in the middle of the road and with the two wheels off and all tattered whats this says i didnt ye hear of it says they that were looking on its my lady rackrents car that was running away from her husband and the horse took fright at a carrion that lay across the road and so ran away with the jaunting car and my lady rackrent and her maid screaming and the horse ran with them against a car that was coming from the fair with the boy asleep on it and the ladys petticoat hanging out of the jaunting car caught and she was dragged i cant tell you how far upon the road and it all broken up with the stones just going to be pounded and one of the roadmakers with his sledgehammer in his hand stops the horse at the last but my lady rackrent was all kilt and smashed and they lifted her into a cabin hard by and the maid was found after where she had been thrown in the gripe of the ditch her cap and bonnet all full of bog water and they say my lady cant live any way thady pray now is it true what im told for sartain that sir condy has made over all to your son jason all says i all entirely says she again all entirely says i then says she thats a great shame but dont be telling jason what i say and what is it you say cries sir condy leaning over betwixt us which made judy start greatly i know the time when judy mquirk would never have stayed so long talking at the door and i in the house oh says judy for shame sir condy times are altered since then and its my lady rackrent you ought to be thinking of and why should i be thinking of her thats not thinking of me now said sir condy no matter for that says judy very properly its time you should be thinking of her if ever you mean to do it at all for dont you know shes lying for death my lady rackrent says sir condy in a surprise why its but two days since we parted as you very well know thady in her full health and spirits and she and her maid along with her going to mount juliets town on her jaunting car shell never ride no more on her jaunting car said judy for it has been the death of her sure enough and is she dead then says his honour as good as dead i hear says judy but theres thady here has just learnt the whole truth of the story as i had it and it is fitter he or any body else should be telling it you than i sir condy i must be going home to the childer but he stops her but rather from civility in him as i could see very plainly than any thing else for judy was as his honour remarked at her first coming in greatly changed and little likely as far as i could seethough she did not seem to be clear of it herselflittle likely to be my lady rackrent now should there be a second tossup to be made but i told him the whole story out of the face just as judy had told it to me and he sent off a messenger with his compliments to mount juliets town that evening to learn the truth of the report and judy bid the boy that was going call in at tim menerneys shop in oshaughlins town and buy her a new shawl do so said sir condy and tell tim to take no money from you for i must pay him for the shawl myself at this my shister throws me over a look and i says nothing but turned the tobacco in my mouth whilst judy began making a many words about it and saying how she could not be beholden for shawls to any gentleman i left her there to consult with my shister did she think there was any thing in it and my shister thought i was blind to be asking her the question and i thought my shister must see more into it than i did and recollecting all past times and every thing i changed my mind and came over to her way of thinking and we settled it that judy was very like to be my lady rackrent after all if a vacancy should have happened the next day before his honour was up somebody comes with a double knock at the door and i was greatly surprised to see it was my son jason jason is it you said i what brings you to the lodge says i is it my lady rackrent we know that already since yesterday may be so says he but i must see sir condy about it you cant see him yet says i sure he is not awake what then says he cant he be wakened and i standing at the door ill not be disturbing his honour for you jason says i manys the hour youve waited in your time and been proud to do it till his honour was at leisure to speak to you his honour says i raising my voice at which his honour wakens of his own accord and calls to me from the room to know who it was i was speaking to jason made no more ceremony but follows me into the room how are you sir condy says he im happy to see you looking so well i came up to know how you did today and to see did you want for any thing at the lodge nothing at all mr jason i thank you says he for his honour had his own share of pride and did not choose after all that had passed to be beholden i suppose to my son but pray take a chair and be seated mr jason jason sat him down upon the chest for chair there was none and after he had set there some time and a silence on all sides what news is there stirring in the country mr jason mquirk says sir condy very easy yet high like none thats news to you sir condy i hear says jason i am sorry to hear of my lady rackrents accident im much obliged to you and so is her ladyship im sure answered sir condy still stiff and there was another sort of a silence which seemed to lie the heaviest on my son jason sir condy says he at last seeing sir condy disposing himself to go to sleep again sir condy i dare say you recollect mentioning to me the little memorandum you gave to lady rackrent about the l ayear jointure very true said sir condy it is all in my recollection but if my lady rackrent dies theres an end of all jointure says jason of course says sir condy but its not a matter of certainty that my lady rackrent wont recover says jason very true sir says my master its a fair speculation then for you to consider what the chance of the jointure on those lands when out of custodiam will be to you just five hundred ayear i take it without any speculation at all said sir condy thats supposing the life dropt and the custodiam off you know begging your pardon sir condy who understands business that is a wrong calculation very likely so said sir condy but mr jason if you have any thing to say to me this morning about it id be obliged to you to say it for i had an indifferent nights rest last night and wouldnt be sorry to sleep a little this morning i have only three words to say and those more of consequence to you sir condy than me you are a little cool i observe but i hope you will not be offended at what i have brought here in my pocket and he pulls out two long rolls and showers down golden guineas upon the bed whats this said sir condy its long sincebut his pride stops him all these are your lawful property this minute sir condy if you please said jason not for nothing im sure said sir condy and laughs a littlenothing for nothing or im under a mistake with you jason oh sir condy well not be indulging ourselves in any unpleasant retrospects says jason its my present intention to behave as im sure you will like a gentleman in this affair heres two hundred guineas and a third i mean to add if you should think proper to make over to me all your right and title to those lands that you know of ill consider of it said my master and a great deal more that i was tired listening to was said by jason and all that and the sight of the ready cash upon the bed worked with his honour and the short and the long of it was sir condy gathered up the golden guineas and tied them up in a handkerchief and signed some paper jason brought with him as usual and there was an end of the business jason took himself away and my master turned himself round and fell asleep again i soon found what had put jason in such a hurry to conclude this business the little gossoon we had sent off the day before with my masters compliments to mount juliets town and to know how my lady did after her accident was stopped early this morning coming back with his answer through oshaughlins town at castle rackrent by my son jason and questioned of all he knew of my lady from the servant at mount juliets town and the gossoon told him my lady rackrent was not expected to live over night so jason thought it high time to be moving to the lodge to make his bargain with my master about the jointure afore it should be too late and afore the little gossoon should reach us with the news my master was greatly vexed that is i may say as much as ever i seen him when he found how he had been taken in but it was some comfort to have the ready cash for immediate consumption in the house any way and when judy came up that evening and brought the childer to see his honour he unties the handkerchief and god bless him whether it was little or much he had twas all the same with him he gives em all round guineas apiece hold up your head says my shister to judy as sir condy was busy filling out a glass of punch for her eldest boyhold up your head judy for who knows but we may live to see you yet at the head of the castle rackrent estate maybe so says she but not the way you are thinking of i did not rightly understand which way judy was looking when she makes this speech till awhile after why thady you were telling me yesterday that sir condy had sold all entirely to jason and where then does all them guineas in the handkerchief come from they are the purchasemoney of my ladys jointure says i judy looks a little bit puzzled at this a penny for your thoughts judy says my shister hark sure sir condy is drinking her health he was at the table in the room drinking with the exciseman and the gauger who came up to see his honour and we were standing over the fire in the kitchen i dont much care is he drinking my health or not says judy and it is not sir condy im thinking of with all your jokes whatever he is of me sure you wouldnt refuse to be my lady rackrent judy if you had the offer says i but if i could do better says she how better says i and my shister both at once how better says she why what signifies it to be my lady rackrent and no castle sure what good is the car and no horse to draw it and where will ye get the horse judy says i never mind that says she may be it is your own son jason might find that jason says i dont be trusting to him judy sir condy as i have good reason to know spoke well of you when jason spoke very indifferently of you judy no matter says judy its often men speak the contrary just to what they think of us and you the same way of them no doubt answers i nay dont be denying it judy for i think the better of ye for it and shouldnt be proud to call ye the daughter of a shisters son of mine if i was to hear ye talk ungrateful and any way disrespectful of his honour what disrespect says she to say id rather if it was my luck be the wife of another man youll have no luck mind my words judy says i and all i remembered about my poor masters goodness in tossing up for her afore he married at all came across me and i had a choaking in my throat that hindered me to say more better luck any how thady says she than to be like some folk following the fortunes of them that have none left oh king of glory says i hear the pride and ungratitude of her and he giving his last guineas but a minute ago to her childer and she with the fine shawl on her he made her a present of but yesterday oh troth judy youre wrong now says my shister looking at the shawl and was not he wrong yesterday then says she to be telling me i was greatly altered to affront me but judy says i what is it brings you here then at all in the mind you are in is it to make jason think the better of you ill tell you no more of my secrets thady says she nor would have told you this much had i taken you for such an unnatural fader as i find you are not to wish your own son prefarred to another oh troth you are wrong now thady says my shister well i was never so put to it in my life between these womens and my son and my master and all i felt and thought just now i could not upon my conscience tell which was the wrong from the right so i said not a word more but was only glad his honour had not the luck to hear all judy had been saying of him for i reckoned it would have gone nigh to break his heart not that i was of opinion he cared for her as much as she and my shister fancied but the ungratitude of the whole from judy might not plase him and he could never stand the notion of not being well spoken of or beloved like behind his back fortunately for all parties concerned he was so much elevated at this time there was no danger of his understanding any thing even if it had reached his ears there was a great horn at the lodge ever since my master and captain moneygawl was in together that used to belong originally to the celebrated sir patrick his ancestor and his honour was fond often of telling the story that he learned from me when a child how sir patrick drank the full of this horn without stopping and this was what no other man afore or since could without drawing breath now sir condy challenged the gauger who seemed to think little of the horn to swallow the contents and had it filled to the brim with punch and the gauger said it was what he could not do for nothing but hed hold sir condy a hundred guineas hed do it done says my master ill lay you a hundred golden guineas to a tester you dont done says the gauger and done and dones enough between two gentlemen the gauger was cast and my master won the bet and thought hed won a hundred guineas but by the wording it was adjudged to be only a tester that was his due by the exciseman it was all one to him he was as well pleased and i was glad to see him in such spirits again the gauger bad luck to him was the man that next proposed to my master to try himself could he take at a draught the contents of the great horn sir patricks horn said his honour hand it to me ill hold you your own bet over again ill swallow it done says the gauger ill lay ye anything at all you do no such thing a hundred guineas to sixpence i do says he bring me the handkerchief i was loth knowing he meant the handkerchief with the gold in it to bring it out in such company and his honour not very able to reckon it bring me the handkerchief then thady says he and stamps with his foot so with that i pulls it out of my great coat pocket where i had put it for safety oh how it grieved me to see the guineas counting upon the table and they the last my master had says sir condy to me your hand is steadier than mine tonight old thady and thats a wonder fill you the horn for me and so wishing his honour success i did but i filled it little thinking of what would befall him he swallows it down and drops like one shot we lifts him up and he was speechless and quite black in the face we put him to bed and in a short time he wakened raving with a fever on his brain he was shocking either to see or hear judy judy have you no touch of feeling wont you stay to help us nurse him says i to her and she putting on her shawl to go out of the house im frightened to see him says she and wouldnt nor couldnt stay in it and what use he cant last till the morning with that she ran off there was none but my shister and myself left near him of all the many friends he had the fever came and went and came and went and lasted five days and the sixth he was sensible for a few minutes and said to me knowing me very well im in burning pain all withinside of me thady i could not speak but my shister asked him would he have this thing or tother to do him good no says he nothing will do me good no more and he gave a terrible screech with the torture he was inthen again a minutes easebrought to this by drink says he where are all the friendswheres judygone hey ay sir condy has been a fool all his days said he and there was the last word he spoke and died he had but a very poor funeral after all if you want to know any more im not very well able to tell you but my lady rackrent did not die as was expected of her but was only disfigured in the face ever after by the fall and bruises she got and she and jason immediately after my poor masters death set about going to law about that jointure the memorandum not being on stamped paper some say it is worth nothing others again it may do others say jason wont have the lands at any rate many wishes it so for my part im tired wishing for any thing in this world after all ive seen in itbut ill say nothing it would be a folly to be getting myself illwill in my old age jason did not marry nor think of marrying judy as i prophesied and i am not sorry for it who is as for all i have here set down from memory and hearsay of the family theres nothing but truth in it from beginning to end that you may depend upon for wheres the use of telling lies about the things which every body knows as well as i do the editor could have readily made the catastrophe of sir condys history more dramatic and more pathetic if he thought it allowable to varnish the plain round tale of faithful thady he lays it before the english reader as a specimen of manners and characters which are perhaps unknown in england indeed the domestic habits of no nation in europe were less known to the english than those of their sister country till within these few years mr youngs picture of ireland in his tour through that country was the first faithful portrait of its inhabitants all the features in the foregoing sketch were taken from the life and they are characteristic of that mixture of quickness simplicity cunning carelessness dissipation disinterestedness shrewdness and blunder which in different forms and with various success has been brought upon the stage or delineated in novels it is a problem of difficult solution to determine whether an union will hasten or retard the amelioration of this country the few gentlemen of education who now reside in this country will resort to england they are few but they are in nothing inferior to men of the same rank in great britain the best that can happen will be the introduction of british manufacturers in their places did the warwickshire militia who were chiefly artisans teach the irish to drink beer or did they learn from the irish to drink whiskey glossary some friends who have seen thadys history since it has been printed have suggested to the editor that many of the terms and idiomatic phrases with which it abounds could not be intelligible to the english reader without further explanation the editor has therefore furnished the following glossary a monday morningthady begins his memoirs of the rackrent family by dating monday morning because no great undertaking can be auspiciously commenced in ireland on any morning but monday morning oh please god we live till monday morning well set the slater to mend the roof of the house on monday morning well fall to and cut the turf on monday morning well see and begin mowing on monday morning please your honour well begin and dig the potatoes c all the intermediate days between the making of such speeches and the ensuing monday are wasted and when monday morning comes it is ten to one that the business is deferred to the next monday morning the editor knew a gentleman who to counteract this prejudice made his workmen and labourers begin all new pieces of work upon a saturday b let alone the three kingdoms itselflet alone in this sentence means put out of consideration the phrase let alone which is now used as the imperative of a verb may in time become a conjunction and may exercise the ingenuity of some future etymologist the celebrated horne tooke has proved most satisfactorily that the conjunction but comes from the imperative of the anglosaxon verb beoutan to be out also that if comes from gif the imperative of the anglosaxon verb which signifies to give c c whillaluhullaloo gol or lamentation over the dead magnoque ululante tumultuvirgil ululatibus omne implevere nemusovid a full account of the irish gol or ullaloo and of the caoinan or irish funeral song with its first semichorus second semichorus full chorus of sighs and groans together with the irish words and music may be found in the fourth volume of the transactions of the royal irish academy for the advantage of lazy readers who would rather read a page than walk a yard and from compassion not to say sympathy with their infirmity the editor transcribes the following passages the irish have been always remarkable for their funeral lamentations and this peculiarity has been noticed by almost every traveller who visited them and it seems derived from their celtic ancestors the primaeval inhabitants of this isle it has been affirmed of the irish that to cry was more natural to them than to any other nation and at length the irish cry became proverbial cambrensis in the twelfth century says the irish then musically expressed their griefs that is they applied the musical art in which they excelled all others to the orderly celebration of funeral obsequies by dividing the mourners into two bodies each alternately singing their part and the whole at times joining in full chorus the body of the deceased dressed in grave clothes and ornamented with flowers was placed on a bier or some elevated spot the relations and keepers singing mourners ranged themselves in two divisions one at the head and the other at the feet of the corpse the bards and croteries had before prepared the funeral caoinan the chief bard of the head chorus began by singing the first stanza in a low doleful tone which was softly accompanied by the harp at the conclusion the foot semichorus began the lamentation or ullaloo from the final note of the preceding stanza in which they were answered by the head semichorus then both united in one general chorus the chorus of the first stanza being ended the chief bard of the foot semichorus began the second gol or lamentation in which he was answered by that of the head and then as before both united in the general full chorus thus alternately were the song and choruses performed during the night the genealogy rank possessions the virtues and vices of the dead were rehearsed and a number of interrogations were addressed to the deceased as why did he die if married whether his wife was faithful to him his sons dutiful or good hunters or warriors if a woman whether her daughters were fair or chaste if a young man whether he had been crossed in love or if the blueeyed maids of erin treated him with scorn we are told that formerly the feet the metrical feet of the caoinan were much attended to but on the decline of the irish bards these feet were gradually neglected and the caoinan fell into a sort of slipshod metre amongst women each province had different caoinans or at least different imitations of the original there was the munster cry the ulster cry c it became an extempore performance and every set of keepers varied the melody according to their own fancy it is curious to observe how customs and ceremonies degenerate the present irish cry or howl cannot boast of such melody nor is the funeral procession conducted with much dignity the crowd of people who assemble at these funerals sometimes amounts to a thousand often to four or five hundred they gather as the bearers of the hearse proceed on their way and when they pass through any village or when they come near any houses they begin to cryoh oh oh oh oh agh agh raising their notes from the first oh to the last agh in a kind of mournful howl this gives notice to the inhabitants of the village that a funeral is passing and immediately they flock out to follow it in the province of munster it is a common thing for the women to follow a funeral to join in the universal cry with all their might and main for some time and then to turn and askarrah who is it thats deadwho is it were crying for even the poorest people have their own buryingplaces that is spots of ground in the churchyards where they say that their ancestors have been buried ever since the wars of ireland and if these burialplaces are ten miles from the place where a man dies his friends and neighbours take care to carry his corpse thither always one priest often five or six priests attend these funerals each priest repeats a mass for which he is paid sometimes a shilling sometimes halfacrown sometimes halfaguinea or a guinea according to their circumstances or as they say according to the ability of the deceased after the burial of any very poor man who has left a widow or children the priest makes what is called a collection for the widow he goes round to every person present and each contributes sixpence or a shilling or what they please the reader will find in the note upon the word wake more particulars respecting the conclusion of the irish funerals certain old women who cry particularly loud and well are in great request and as a man said to the editor every one would wish and be proud to have such at his funeral or at that of his friends the lower irish are wonderfully eager to attend the funerals of their friends and relations and they make their relationships branch out to a great extent the proof that a poor man has been well beloved during his life is his having a crowded funeral to attend a neighbours funeral is a cheap proof of humanity but it does not as some imagine cost nothing the time spent in attending funerals may be safely valued at half a million to the irish nation the editor thinks that double that sum would not be too high an estimate the habits of profligacy and drunkenness which are acquired at wakes are here put out of the question when a labourer a carpenter or a smith is not at his work which frequently happens ask where he is gone and ten to one the answer isoh faith please your honour he couldnt do a stroke today for hes gone to the funeral even beggars when they grow old go about begging for their own funerals that is begging for money to buy a coffin candles pipes and tobacco for the use of the candles pipes and tobacco see wake those who value customs in proportion to their antiquity and nations in proportion to their adherence to ancient customs will doubtless admire the irish ullaloo and the irish nation for persevering in this usage from time immemorial the editor however has observed some alarming symptoms which seem to prognosticate the declining taste for the ullaloo in ireland in a comic theatrical entertainment represented not long since on the dublin stage a chorus of old women was introduced who set up the irish howl round the relics of a physician who is supposed to have fallen under the wooden sword of harlequin after the old women have continued their ullaloo for a decent time with all the necessary accompaniments of wringing their hands wiping or rubbing their eyes with the corners of their gowns or aprons c one of the mourners suddenly suspends her lamentable cries and turning to her neighbour asks arrah now honey who is it were crying for d the tenants were sent away without their whiskeyit is usual with some landlords to give their inferior tenants a glass of whiskey when they pay their rents thady calls it their whiskey not that the whiskey is actually the property of the tenants but that it becomes their right after it has been often given to them in this general mode of reasoning respecting rights the lower irish are not singular but they are peculiarly quick and tenacious in claiming these rights last year your honour gave me some straw for the roof of my house and i expect your honour will be after doing the same this year in this manner gifts are frequently turned into tributes the high and low are not always dissimilar in their habits it is said that the sublime ottoman porte is very apt to claim gifts as tributes thus it is dangerous to send the grand seignor a fine horse on his birthday one year lest on his next birthday he should expect a similar present and should proceed to demonstrate the reasonableness of his expectations e he demeaned himself greatlymeans he lowered or disgraced himself much f duty fowls duty turkeys and duty geesein many leases in ireland tenants were formerly bound to supply an inordinate quantity of poultry to their landlords the editor knew of thirty turkeys being reserved in one lease of a small farm g english tenantsan english tenant does not mean a tenant who is an englishman but a tenant who pays his rent the day that it is due it is a common prejudice in ireland amongst the poorer classes of people to believe that all tenants in england pay their rents on the very day when they become due an irishman when he goes to take a farm if he wants to prove to his landlord that he is a substantial man offers to become an english tenant if a tenant disobliges his landlord by voting against him or against his opinion at an election the tenant is immediately informed by the agent that he must become an english tenant this threat does not imply that he is to change his language or his country but that he must pay all the arrear of rent which he owes and that he must thenceforward pay his rent on that day when it becomes due h cantingdoes not mean talking or writing hypocritical nonsense but selling substantially by auction i duty workit was formerly common in ireland to insert clauses in leases binding tenants to furnish their landlords with labourers and horses for several days in the year much petty tyranny and oppression have resulted from this feudal custom whenever a poor man disobliged his landlord the agent sent to him for his duty work and thady does not exaggerate when he says that the tenants were often called from their own work to do that of their landlord thus the very means of earning their rent were taken from them whilst they were getting home their landlords harvest their own was often ruined and yet their rents were expected to be paid as punctually as if their time had been at their own disposal this appears the height of absurd injustice in esthonia amongst the poor sclavonian race of peasant slaves they pay tributes to their lords not under the name of duty work duty geese duty turkeys c but under the name of righteousnesses the following ballad is a curious specimen of esthonian poetry this is the cause that the country is ruined and the straw of the thatch is eaten away the gentry are come to live in the land chimneys between the village and the proprietor upon the white floor the sheep brings forth a lamb with a white forehead this is paid to the lord for a righteousness sheep the sow farrows pigs they go to the spit of the lord the hen lays eggs they go into the lords fryingpan the cow drops a male calf that goes into the lords herd as a

seventeenthadys language in this instance is a specimen of a mode of rhetoric common in ireland an astonishing assertion is made in the beginning of a sentence which ceases to be in the least surprising when you hear the qualifying explanation that follows thus a man who is in the last stage of staggering drunkenness will if he can articulate swear to youupon his conscience now and may he never stir from the spot alive if he is telling a lie upon his conscience he has not tasted a drop of any thing good or bad since morning atallatall but half a pint of whiskey please your honour k fairy mountsbarrows it is said that these high mounts were of great service to the natives of ireland when ireland was invaded by the danes watch was always kept on them and upon the approach of an enemy a fire was lighted to give notice to the next watch and thus the intelligence was quickly communicated through the country some years ago the common people believed that these barrows were inhabited by fairies or as they called them by the good people oh troth to the best of my belief and to the best of my judgment and opinion said an elderly man to the editor it was only the old people that had nothing to do and got together and were telling stories about them fairies but to the best of my judgment theres nothing in it only this i heard myself not very many years hack from a decent kind of a man a grazier that as he was coming just fair and easy quietly from the fair with some cattle and sheep that he had not sold just at the church of at an angle of the road like he was met by a goodlooking man who asked him where he was going and he answered oh far enough i must be going all night no that you mustnt nor wont says the man youll sleep with me the night and youll want for nothing nor your cattle nor sheep neither nor your beast horse so come along with me with that the grazier lit alighted from his horse and it was dark night but presently he finds himself he does not know in the wide world how in a fine house and plenty of every thing to eat and drink nothing at all wanting that he could wish for or think of and he does not mind recollect or know how at last he falls asleep and in the morning he finds himself lying not in ever a bed or a house at all but just in the angle of the road where first he met the strange man there he finds himself lying on his back on the grass and all his sheep feeding as quiet as ever all round about him and his horse the same way and the bridle of the beast over his wrist and i asked him what he thought of it and from first to last he could think of nothing but for certain sure it must have been the fairies that entertained him so well for there was no house to see any where nigh hand or any building or barn or place at all but only the church and the mote barrow theres another odd thing enough that they tell about this same church that if any persons corpse that had not a right to be buried in that churchyard went to be burying there in it no not all the men women or childer in all ireland could get the corpse any way into the churchyard but as they would be trying to go into the churchyard their feet would seem to be going backwards instead of forwards ay continually backwards the whole funeral would seem to go and they would never set foot with the corpse in the churchyard now they say that it is the fairies do all this but it is my opinion it is all idle talk and people are after being wiser now the country people in ireland certainly had great admiration mixed with reverence if not dread of fairies they believed that beneath these fairy mounts were spacious subterraneous palaces inhabited by the good people who must not on any account be disturbed when the wind raises a little eddy of dust upon the road the poor people believe that it is raised by the fairies that it is a sign that they are journeying from one of the fairies mounts to another and they say to the fairies or to the dust as it passes god speed ye gentlemen god speed ye this averts any evil that the good people might be inclined to do them there are innumerable stories told of the friendly and unfriendly feats of these busy fairies some of these tales are ludicrous and some romantic enough for poetry it is a pity that poets should lose such convenient though diminutive machinery bythebye parnell who showed himself so deeply skilled in faerie lore was an irishman and though he has presented his fairies to the world in the ancient english dress of britains isle and arthurs days it is probable that his first acquaintance with them began in his native country some remote origin for the most superstitious or romantic popular illusions or vulgar errors may often be discovered in ireland the old churches and churchyards have been usually fixed upon as the scenes of wonders now antiquaries tell us that near the ancient churches in that kingdom caves of various constructions have from time to time been discovered which were formerly used as granaries or magazines by the ancient inhabitants and as places to which they retreated in time of danger there is p of the ria transactions for a particular account of a number of these artificial caves at the west end of the church of killossy in the county of kildare under a rising ground in a dry sandy soil these subterraneous dwellings were found they have pediment roofs and they communicate with each other by small apertures in the brehon laws these are mentioned and there are fines inflicted by those laws upon persons who steal from the subterraneous granaries all these things show that there was a real foundation for the stories which were told of the appearance of lights and of the sounds of voices near these places the persons who had property concealed there very willingly countenanced every wonderful relation that tended to make these places objects of sacred awe or superstitious terror l weedashesby ancient usage in ireland all the weeds on a farm belonged to the farmers wife or to the wife of the squire who holds the ground in his own hands the great demand for alkaline salts in bleaching rendered these ashes no

metaphor and amplification p fining down the years rentwhen an irish gentleman like sir kit rackrent has lived beyond his income and finds himself distressed for ready money tenants obligingly offer to take his land at a rent far below the value and to pay him a small sum of money in hand which they call fining down the yearly rent the temptation of this ready cash often blinds the landlord to

college of maynooth but after he had gone through his course of humanities he determined to be a soldier instead of a priest s flamshort for flambeau t barrackroomformerly it was customary in

of you so i will is the saying of an englishman who expects justice ill have you before his honour is the threat of an irishman who hopes for partiality miserable is the life of a justice of the peace in ireland the day after a fair especially if he resides near a small town the multitude of the kilt kilt does not mean killed but hurt and wounded who come before his honour with black eyes or bloody heads is astonishing but more astonishing is the number of those who though they are scarcely able by daily labour to procure daily food will nevertheless without the least reluctance waste six or seven hours of the day lounging in the yard or court of a justice of the peace waiting to make some complaint aboutnothing it is impossible to convince them that time is money they do not set any value upon their own time and they think that others estimate theirs at less than nothing hence they make no scruple of telling a justice of the peace a story of an hour long about a tester sixpence and if he grows impatient they attribute it to some secret prejudice which he entertains against them their method is to get a story completely by heart and to tell it as they call it out of the face that is from the beginning to the end without interruption well my good friend i have seen you lounging about these three hours in the yard what is your business please your honour it is what i want to speak one word to your honour speak then but be quickwhat is the matter the matter please your honour is nothing atallatall only just about the grazing of a horse please your honour that this man here sold me at the fair of gurtishannon last shrove fair which lay down three times with myself please your honour and kilt me not to be telling your honour of how no later back than yesterday night he lay down in the house there within and all the childer standing round and it was gods mercy he did not fall atop of them or into the fire to burn himself so please your honour today i took him back to this man which owned him and after a great deal to do i got the mare again i swopped exchanged him for but he wont pay the grazing of the horse for the time i had him though he promised to pay the grazing in case the horse didnt answer and he never did a days work good or bad please your honour all the time he was with me and i had the doctor to him five times any how and so please your honour it is what i expect your honour will stand my friend for id sooner come to your honour for justice than to any other in all ireland and so i brought him here before your honour and expect your honour will make him pay me the grazing or tell me can i process him for it at the next assizes please your honour the defendant now turning a quid of tobacco with his tongue into some secret cavern in his mouth begins his defence with please your honour under favour and saving your honours presence theres not a word of truth in all this man has been saying from beginning to end upon my conscience and i wouldnt for the value of the horse itself grazing and all be after telling your honour a lie for please your honour i have a dependence upon your honour that youll do me justice and not be listening to him or the like of him please your honour its what he has brought me before your honour because he had a spite against me about some oats i sold your honour which he was jealous of and a shawl his wife got at my shisters shop there without and never paid for so i offered to set the shawl against the grazing and give him a receipt in full of all demands but he wouldnt out of spite please your honour so he brought me before your honour expecting your honour was mad with me for cutting down the tree in the horse park which was none of my doing please your honourill luck to them that went and belied me to your honour behind my back so if your honour is pleasing ill tell you the whole truth about the horse that he swopped against my mare out of the face last shrove fair i met this man jemmy duffy please your honour just at the corner of the road where the bridge is broken down that your honour is to have the presentment for this yearlong life to you for it and he was at that time coming from the fair of gurtishannon and i the same way how are you jemmy says i very well i thank ye kindly bryan says he shall we turn back to paddy salmons and take a naggin of whiskey to our better acquaintance i dont care if i did jemmy says i only it is what i cant take the whiskey because im under an oath against it for a month ever since please your honour the day your honour met me on the road and observed to me i could hardly stand i had taken so much though upon my conscience your honour wronged me greatly that same timeill luck to them that belied me behind my back to your honour well please your honour as i was telling you as he was taking the whiskey and we talking of one thing or tother he makes me an offer to swop his mare that he couldnt sell at the fair of gurtishannon because nobody would be troubled with the beast please your honour against my horse and to oblige him i took the maresorrow take her and him along with her she kicked me a new car that was worth three pounds ten to tatters the first time i ever put her into it and i expect your honour will make him pay me the price of the car any how before i pay the grazing which ive no right to pay atallatall only to oblige him but i leave it all to your honour and the whole grazing he ought to be charging for the beast is but two and eight pence halfpenny any how please your honour so ill abide by what your honour says good or bad ill leave it all to your honour ill leave it all to your honourliterally means ill leave all the trouble to your honour the editor knew a justice of the peace in ireland who had such a dread of having it all left to his honour that he frequently gave the complainants the sum about which they were disputing to make peace between them and to get rid of the trouble of hearing their stories out of the face but he was soon cured of this method of buying off disputes by the increasing multitude of those who out of pure regard to his honour came to get justice from him because they would sooner come before him than before any man in all ireland z a raking pot of teawe should observe this custom has long since been banished from the higher orders of irish gentry the mysteries of a raking pot of tea like those of the bona dea are supposed to be sacred to females but now and then it has happened that some of the male species who were either more audacious or more highly favoured than the rest of their sex have been admitted by stealth to these orgies the time when the festive ceremony begins varies according to circumstances but it is never earlier than twelve oclock at night the joys of a raking pot of tea depending on its being made in secret and at an unseasonable hour after a ball when the more discreet part of the company has departed to rest a few chosen female spirits who have footed it till they can foot it no longer and till the sleepy notes expire under the slurring hand of the musician retire to a bedchamber call the favourite maid who alone is admitted bid her put down the kettle lock the door and amidst as much giggling and scrambling as possible they get round a teatable on which all manner of things are huddled together then begin mutual railleries and mutual confidences amongst the young ladies and the faint scream and the loud laugh is heard and the romping for letters and pocketbooks begins and gentlemen are called by their surnames or by the general name of fellows pleasant fellows charming fellows odious fellows abominable fellows and then all prudish decorums are forgotten and then we might be convinced how much the satirical poet was mistaken when he said there is no woman where theres no reserve the merit of the original idea of a raking pot of tea evidently belongs to the washerwoman and the laundrymaid but why should not we have low life above stairs as well as high life below stairs a we gained the day by this piece of honestyin a dispute which occurred some years ago in ireland between mr e and mr m about the boundaries of a farm an old tenant of mr ms cut a sod from mr ms land and inserted it in a spot prepared for its reception in mr es land so nicely was it inserted that no eye could detect the junction of the grass the old man who was to give his evidence as to the property stood upon the inserted sod when the viewers came and swore that the ground he then stood upon belonged to his landlord mr m the editor had flattered himself that the ingenious contrivance which thady records and the similar subterfuge of this old irishman in the dispute concerning boundaries were instances of cuteness unparalleled in all but irish story an english friend however has just mortified the editors national vanity by an account of the following custom which prevails in part of shropshire it is discreditable for women to appear abroad after the birth of their children till they have been churched to avoid this reproach and at the same time to enjoy the pleasure of gadding whenever a woman goes abroad before she has been to church she takes a tile from the roof of her house and puts it upon her head wearing this panoply all the time she pays her visits her conscience is perfectly at ease for she can afterwards safely declare to the clergyman that she has never been from under her own roof till she came to be churched b carton and half cartonthady means cartron and half cartron according to the old record in the black book of dublin a cantred is said to contain villatas terras which are also called quarters of land quarterons cartrons every one of which quarters must contain so much ground as will pasture cows and ploughlands a knights fee was composed of hydes which amount to acres and that is generally deemed about a ploughland the editor was favoured by a learned friend with the above extract from a ms of lord totnesss in the lambeth library c wakea wake in england means a festival held upon the anniversary of the saint of the parish at these wakes rustic games rustic conviviality and rustic courtship are pursued with all the ardour and all the appetite which accompany such pleasures as occur but seldom in ireland a wake is a midnight meeting held professedly for the indulgence of holy sorrow but usually it is converted into orgies of unholy joy when an irish man or woman of the lower order dies the straw which composed the bed whether it has been contained in a bag to form a mattress or simply spread upon the earthen floor is immediately taken out of the house and burned before the cabin door the family at the same time setting up the death howl the ears and eyes of the neighbours being thus alarmed they flock to the house of the deceased and by their vociferous sympathy excite and at the same time soothe the sorrows of the family it is curious to observe how good and bad are mingled in human institutions in countries which were thinly inhabited this custom prevented private attempts against the lives of individuals and formed a kind of coroners inquest upon the body which had recently expired and burning the straw upon which the sick man lay became a simple preservative against infection at night the dead body is waked that is to say all the friends and neighbours of the deceased collect in a barn or stable where the corpse is laid upon some boards or an unhinged door supported upon stools the face exposed the rest of the body covered with a white sheet bound the body are stuck in brass candlesticks which have been borrowed perhaps at five miles distance as many candles as the poor person can beg or borrow observing always to have an odd number pipes and tobacco are first distributed and then according to the ability of the deceased cakes and ale and sometimes whiskey are dealt to the company deal on deal on my merry men all deal on your cakes and your wine for whatever is dealt at her funeral today shall be dealt tomorrow at mine after a fit of universal sorrow and the comfort of a universal dram the scandal of the neighbourhood as in higher circles occupies the company the young lads and lasses romp with one another and when the fathers and mothers are at last overcome with sleep and whiskey

where it means not killed but much hurt in ireland not only cowards but the brave die many times before their deaththere killing is no murder footnotes the cloak or mantle as described by thady is of high antiquity spenser in his view of the state of ireland proves that it is not as some have imagined peculiarly derived from the scythians but that most nations of the world anciently used the mantle for the jews used it as you may read of eliass mantle c the chaldees also used it as you may read in diodorus the egyptians likewise used it as you may read in herodotus and may be gathered by the description of berenice in the greek commentary upon callimachus the greeks also used it anciently as appeared by venuss mantle lined with stars though afterward they changed the form thereof into their cloaks called pallai as some of the irish also use and the ancient latins and romans used it as you may read in virgil who was a great antiquary that evander when aeneas came to him at his feast did entertain and feast him sitting on the ground and lying on mantles insomuch that he useth the very word mantile for a mantle humi mantilia sternunt so that it seemeth that the mantle was a general habit to most nations and not proper to the scythians only spenser knew the convenience of the said mantle as housing bedding and clothing iren because the commodity doth not countervail the discommodity for the inconveniences which thereby do arise are much more many for it is a fit house for an outlaw a meet bed for a rebel and an apt cloak for a thief first the outlaw being for his many crimes and villanies banished from the towns and houses of honest men and wandering in waste places far from danger of law maketh his mantle his house and under it covereth himself from the wrath of heaven from the offence of the earth and from the sight of men when it raineth it is his penthouse when it bloweth it is his tent when it freezeth it is his tabernacle in summer he can wear it loose in winter he can wrap it close at all times he can use it never heavy never cumbersome likewise for a rebel it is as serviceable for in this war that he maketh if at least it deserves the name of war when he still flieth from his foe and lurketh in the thick woods this should be black bogs and straight passages waiting for advantages it is his bed yea and almost his household stuff these fairymounts are called anthills in england they are held in high reverence by the common people in ireland a gentleman who in laying out his lawn had occasion to level one of these hillocks could not prevail upon any of his labourers to begin the ominous work he was obliged to take a loy from one of their reluctant hands and began the attack himself the labourers agreed that the vengeance of the fairies would fall upon the head of the presumptuous mortal who first disturbed them in their retreat see glossary k the banshee is a species of aristocratic fairy who in the shape of a little hideous old woman has been known to appear and heard to sing in a mournful supernatural voice under the windows of great houses to warn the family that some of them are soon to die in the last century every great family in ireland had a banshee who attended regularly but latterly their visits and songs have been discontinued childer this is the manner in which many of thadys rank and others in ireland formerly pronounced the word children middle menthere was a class of men termed middle men in ireland who took large farms on long leases from gentlemen of landed property and let the land again in small portions to the poor as undertenants at exorbitant rents the head landlord as he was called seldom saw his undertenants but if he could not get the middle man to pay him his rent punctually he went to his land and drove the land for his rent that is to say he sent his steward or bailiff or driver to the land to seize the cattle hay corn flax oats or potatoes belonging to the undertenants and proceeded to sell these for his rents it sometimes happened that these unfortunate tenants paid their rent twice over once to the middle man and once to the head landlord the characteristics of a middle man were servility to his superiors and tyranny towards his inferiors the poor detested this race of beings in speaking to them however they always used the most abject language and the most humble tone and postureplease your honour and please your honours honour they knew must be repeated as a charm at the beginning and end of every equivocating exculpatory or supplicatory sentence and they were much more alert in doffing their caps to these new men than to those of what they call good old families a witty carpenter once termed these middle men journeymen gentlemen this part of the history of the rackrent family can scarcely be thought credible but in justice to honest thady it is hoped the reader will recollect the history of the celebrated lady cathcarts conjugal imprisonmentthe editor was acquainted with colonel mguire lady cathcarts husband he has lately seen and questioned the maidservant who lived with colonel mguire during the time of lady cathcarts imprisonment her ladyship was locked up in her own house for many years during which period her husband was visited by the neighbouring gentry and it was his regular custom at dinner to send his compliments to lady cathcart informing her that the company had the honour to drink her ladyships health and begging to know whether there was any thing at table that she would like to eat the answer was always lady cathcarts compliments and she has every thing she wants an instance of honesty in a poor irish woman deserves to be recordedlady cathcart had some remarkably fine diamonds which she had concealed from her husband and which she was anxious to get out of the house lest he should discover them she had neither servant nor friend to whom she could entrust them but she had observed a poor beggar woman who used to come to the house she spoke to her from the window of the room in which she was confined the woman promised to do what she desired and lady cathcart threw a parcel containing the jewels to her the poor woman carried them to the person to whom they were directed and several years afterwards when lady cathcart recovered her liberty she received her diamonds safely at colonel mguires death her ladyship was released the editor within this year saw the gentleman who accompanied her to england after her husbands death when she first was told of his death she imagined that the news was not true and that it was told only with an intention of deceiving her at his death she had scarcely clothes sufficient to cover her she wore a red wig looked scared and her understanding seemed stupified she said that she scarcely knew one human creature from another her imprisonment lasted above twenty years these circumstances may appear strange to an english reader but there is no danger in the present times that any individual should exercise such tyranny as colonel mguires with impunity the power being now all in the hands of government and there being no possibility of obtaining from parliament an act of indemnity for any cruelties boo boo an exclamation equivalent to pshaw or nonsense pin read pen it formerly was vulgarly pronounced pin in ireland her mark it was the custom in ireland for those who could not write to make a cross to stand for their signature as was formerly the practice of our english monarchs the editor inserts the facsimile of an irish mark which may hereafter be valuable to a judicious antiquary her judy x mquirk mark in bonds or notes signed in this manner a witness is requisite as the name is frequently written by him or her vowsit has been maliciously and unjustly hinted that the lower classes of the people in ireland pay but little regard to oaths yet it is certain that some oaths or vows have great power over their minds sometimes they swear they will be revenged on some of their neighbours this is an oath that they are never known to break but what is infinitely more extraordinary and unaccountable they sometimes make and keep a vow against whiskey these vows are usually limited to a short time a woman who has a drunken husband is most fortunate if she can prevail upon him to go to the priest and make a vow against whiskey for a year or a month or a week or a day gossoon a little boyfrom the french word garcon in most irish families there used to be a barefooted gossoon who was slave to the

fiftyone english miles between sunrise and sunset at st patricks meeting london march the duke of sussex said he had the honour of bearing an irish title and with the permission of the company he should tell them an anecdote of what he had experienced on his travels when he was at rome he went to visit an irish seminary and when they heard who he was and that he had an irish title some of them asked him please you royal highness since you are an irish peer will you tell us if you ever trod upon irish ground when he told them he had not oh then said one of the order you shall soon do so they

a labourer of the old school sweep down a flight of stairs with his wig he afterwards put it on his head again with the utmost composure and said oh please your honour its never a bit the worse it must be acknowledged that these men are not in any danger of catching cold by taking off their wigs occasionally because they usually have fine crops of hair growing under their wigs the wigs are often yellow and the hair which appears from beneath them black the wigs are usually too small and are raised up by the hair beneath or by the ears of the wearers a wake in england is a meeting

those oppressive fits of silence which ensue after the weather and the fashions and the politics and the scandal and all the commonplace topics of the day have been utterly exhausted who is there that at such a time has not tried in vain to call up an idea and found that none would come when they did call or that all that came were impertinent and must be rejected some as too grave others too gay some too vulgar some too refined for the hearers some relating to persons others to circumstances that must not be mentioned not one will do and all this time the silence lasts and the difficulty of breaking it increases every instant in an incalculable proportion let it be some comfort to those whose polite sensibility has laboured under such distress to be assured that they need never henceforward fear to be reduced to similar dilemmas they may be insured for ever against such dangers at the slight premium and upon the easy condition of perusing the following little volume it will satisfy them that there is a subject which still affords inexhausted and inexhaustible sources of conversation suited to all tastes all ranks all individuals democratic aristocratic commercial or philosophic suited to every company which can be combined purposely or fortuitously in this great metropolis or in any of the most remote parts of england wales or scotland there is a subject which dilates the heart of every true briton which relaxes his muscles however rigid to a smilewhich opens his lips however closed to conversation there is a subject which frets anothers spleen to cure our own and which makes even the angelic part of the creation laugh themselves mortal for who can forbear to laugh at the bare idea of an irish bull nor let any one apprehend that this subject can ever become trite and vulgar custom cannot stale its infinite variety it is in the main obvious and palpable enough for every common understanding yet it leads to disquisitions of exquisite subtlety it branches into innumerable ramifications and involves consequences of surprising importance it may exercise the ingenuity of the subtlest wit the fancy of the oddest humourist the imagination of the finest poet and the judgment of the most profound metaphysician moreover this happy subject is enveloped in all that doubt and confusion which are so favourable to the reputation of disputants and which secures the glorious possibility of talking incessantly without being stopped short by a definition or a demonstration for much as we have all heard and talked of irish bulls it has never yet been decided what it is that constitutes a bull incongruity of ideas says one but this supposition touches too closely upon the definition of wit which according to the best authorities locke burke and stewart consists in an unexpected assemblage of ideas apparently discordant but in which some point of resemblance or aptitude is suddenly discovered then perhaps says another the essence of a bull lies in confusion of ideas this sounds plausible in theory but it will not apply in practice for confusion of ideas is common to both countries for instance was there not some slight confusion of ideas in the mind of that english student who when he was asked what progress he had made in the study of medicine replied i hope i shall soon be qualified to be a physician for i think i am now able to cure a child to amend our bill suppose we insert the word laughable and say that a laughable confusion of ideas constitutes a bull but have we not a laughable confusion of ideas in our english poet blackmores famous lines in prince arthur a painted vest prince vortigern had on which from a naked pict his grandsire won we are sensible that to many people the most vulgar irish bull would appear more laughable merely from its being irishtherefore we cannot make the propensity to laughter in one man the criterion of what is ridiculous in another though we have a precedent for this mode of judging in the laws of england which are allowed to be the perfection of human reason if a man swear that his neighbour has put him in bodily fear he may have the cause of his terror sent to gaol thus the feelings of the plaintiff become the measure of the defendants guilt as we cannot extend this convenient principle to all matters of taste and all subjects of risibility we are still compelled to acknowledge that no accurate definition of a bull has yet been given the essence of an irish bull must be of the most ethereal nature for notwithstanding the most indefatigable research it has hitherto escaped from analysis the crucible always breaks in the longexpected moment of projection we have nevertheless the courage to recommence the process in a new mode perhaps by ascertaining what it is not we may at last discover what it is we must distinguish the genuine from the spurious the original from all imitations the indigenous from the exotic in short it must be determined in what an irish bull essentially differs from a blunder or in what irish blunders specifically differ from english blunders and from those of all other nations to elucidate these points or to prove to the satisfaction of all competent judges that they are beyond the reach of the human understanding is the object of the following essay concerning the nature of bulls and blunders chapter i originality of irish bulls examined the difficulty of selecting from the vulgar herd of irish bulls one that shall be entitled to the prize from the united merits of preeminent absurdity and indisputable originality is greater than hasty judges may imagine many bulls reputed to be bred and born in ireland are of foreign extraction and many more supposed to be unrivalled in their kind may be matched in all their capital points for instance there is not a more celebrated bull than paddy blakes when paddy heard an english gentleman speaking of the fine echo at the lake of killarney which repeats the sound forty times he very promptly observed faith thats nothing at all to the echo in my fathers garden in the county of galway if you say to it how do you do paddy blake it will answer pretty well i thank you sir now this echo of paddy blakes which has long been the admiration of the world is not a prodigy unique in its kind it can be matched by one recorded in the immortal works of the great lord verulam i remember well says this father of philosophy that when i went to the echo at port charenton there was an old parisian that took it to be the work of spirits and of good spirits for said he call satan and the echo will not deliver back the devils name but will say va ten the parisian echo is surely superior to the hibernian paddy blakes simply understood and practised the common rules of goodbreeding but the port charenton echo is instinct with spirit and endowed with a nice moral sense amongst the famous bulls recorded by the illustrious joe miller there is one which has been continually quoted as an example of original irish genius an english gentleman was writing a letter in a coffeehouse and perceiving that an irishman stationed behind him was taking that liberty which hephaestion used with his friend alexander instead of putting his seal upon the lips of the curious impertinent the english gentleman thought proper to reprove the hibernian if not with delicacy at least with poetical justice he concluded writing his letter in these words i would say more but a damned tall irishman is reading over my shoulder every word i write you lie you scoundrel said the selfconvicted hibernian this blunder is unquestionably excellent but it is not originally irish it comes with other riches from the east as the reader may find by looking into a book by m galland entitled the remarkable sayings of the eastern nations a learned man was writing to a friend a troublesome fellow was beside him who was looking over his shoulder at what he was writing the learned man who perceived this continued writing in these words if an impertinent chap who stands beside me were not looking at what i write i would write many other things to you which should be known only to you and to me the troublesome fellow who was reading on now thought it incumbent upon him to speak and said i swear to you that i have not read or looked at what you are writing the learned man replied blockhead as you are why then do you say to me what you are now saying making allowance for the difference of manners in eastern and northern nations there is certainly such a similarity between this oriental anecdote and joe millers story that we may conclude the latter is stolen from the former now an irish bull must be a species of blunder peculiar to ireland those that we have hitherto examined though they may be called irish bulls by the ignorant vulgar have no right title or claim to such a distinction we should invariably exclude from that class all blunders which can be found in another country for instance a speech of the celebrated irish beauty lady c has been called a bull but as a parallel can be produced in the speech of an english nobleman it tells for nothing when her ladyship was presented at court his majesty george the second politely hoped that since her arrival in england she had been entertained with the gaieties of london oh yes please your majesty i have seen every sight in london worth seeing except a coronation this naivete is certainly not equal to that of the english earl marshal who when his king found fault with some arrangement at his coronation said please your majesty i hope it will be better next time a naivete of the same species entailed a heavy tax upon the inhabitants of beaune in france beaune is famous for burgundy and henry the fourth passing through his kingdom stopped there and was well entertained by his loyal subjects his majesty praised the burgundy which they set before himit was excellent it was admirable oh sire cried they do you think this excellent we have much finer burgundy than this have you so then you can afford to pay for it replied harry the fourth and he laid a double tax thenceforward upon the burgundy of beaune of the same class of blunders is the following speech which we actually heard not long ago from an irishman please your worship he sent me to the devil and i came straight to your honour we thought this an original irish blunder till we recollected its prototype in marmontels annette and lubin lubin concludes his harangue with the bailiff sent us to the devil and we come to put ourselves under your protection my lord the french at least in former times were celebrated for politeness yet we meet with a naive compliment of a frenchman which would have been accounted a bull if it had been found in ireland a gentleman was complimenting madame denis on the manner in which she had just acted zaire to act that part said she a person should be young and handsome ah madam replied the complimenter naivement you are a complete proof of the contrary we know not any original irish blunder superior to this unless it be that which lord orford pronounced to be the best bull that he ever heard i hate that woman said a gentleman looking at one who had been his nurse i hate that woman for she changed me at nurse lord orford particularly admires this bull because in the confusion of the blunderers ideas he is not clear even of his personal identity philosophers will not perhaps be so ready as his lordship has been to call this a blunder of the first magnitude those who have never been initiated into the mysteries of metaphysics may have the presumptuous ignorance to fancy that they understand what is meant by the common words i or me but the able metaphysician knows better than lord orfords changeling how to prove to our satisfaction that we know nothing of the matter personal identity says locke consists not in the identity of substance but in the identity of consciousness wherein socrates and the present mayor of queenborough agree they are the same person if the same socrates sleeping and waking do not partake of the same consciousness socrates waking and sleeping is not the same person and to punish socrates waking for what sleeping socrates thought and waking socrates was never conscious of would be no more of right than to punish one twin for what his brother twin did whereof he knew nothing because their outsides are so like that they could not be distinguished for such twins have been seen we may presume that our hibernians consciousness could not retrograde to the time when he was changed at nurse consequently there was no continuity of identity between the infant and the man who expressed his hatred of the nurse for perpetrating the fraud at all events the confusion of identity which excited lord orfords admiration in our hibernian is by no means unprecedented in france england or ancient greece and consequently it cannot be an instance of national idiosyncracy or an irish bull we find a similar blunder in spain in the time of cervantes pray tell me squire says the duchess in don quixote is not your master the person whose history is printed under the name of the sage hidalgo don quixote de la mancha who professes himself the admirer of one dulcinea del toboso the very same my lady answered sancho and i myself am that very squire of his who is mentioned or ought to be mentioned in that history unless they have changed me in the cradle in molieres amphitrion there is a dialogue between mercure and sosie evidently taken from the attic lucian sosie being completely puzzled out of his personal identity if not out of his senses says literally of my being myself i begin to doubt in good earnest yet when i feel myself and when i recollect myself it seems to me that i am i we see that the puzzle about identity proves at last to be of grecian origin it is really edifying to observe how those things which have long been objects of popular admiration shrink and fade when exposed to the light of strict examination an experienced critic proposed that a work should be written to inquire into the pretensions of modern writers to original invention to trace their thefts and to restore the property to the ancient owners such a work would require powers and erudition beyond what can be expected from any ordinary individual the labour must be shared amongst numbers and we are proud to assist in ascertaining the rightful property even of bulls and blunders though without pretending like some literary bloodhounds to follow up a plagiarism where common sagacity is at a fault chapter ii irish newspapers we presume that we have successfully disputed the claims imposed upon the public in behalf of certain spurious alien blunders pretending to be native original irish bulls and we shall now with pleasure proceed to examine those which have better titles to notice even nonsense ceases to be worthy of attention and public favour unless it be original dear lady emily says miss allscrip in the excellent comedy of the heiressdear lady emily dont you dote upon folly to ecstasy replies her ladyship i only despair of seeing it well kept up we flatter ourselves there is no great danger of that for we have the irish newspapers before us where no doubt we shall find a fresh harvest of indigenous absurdity ripe for the sickle the first advertisement that meets our eye is promising it is the late proclamation of an irish mayor in which we are informed that certain business is to be transacted in that city every monday easter sunday only excepted this seems rather an unnecessary exception but it is not an inadvertency caused by any hurry of business in his worship it is deliberately copied from a precedent set in england by a baronet formerly well known in parliament who in the preamble to a bill proposed that certain regulations should take place on every monday tuesday excepted we fear also that an english mayor has been known to blunder some years ago the mayor of a capital english city published a proclamation and advertisement previous to the races that no gentleman will be allowed to ride on the course but the horses that are to run a mayors blundering proclamation is not however worth half so much in the eye of ridicule as a lord lieutenants a saint in crape is twice a saint in lawn a bull on the throne is worth twice as much as a bull in the chair by the lord lieutenant and council of ireland a proclamation whereas the greatest economy is necessary in the consumption of all species of grain and especially in the consumption of potatoes c given at the council chamber in dublin this is the first time we have been informed by authority that potatoes are a species of grain but we must accede to this new botanical arrangement when published under such splendid auspices the assertion certainly is not made in distinct terms but all who understand the construction of language must imply the conclusion that we draw from these premises a general position is in the first member of the sentence laid down that the greatest economy is necessary in the consumption of all species of grain a particular exemplification of the principle is made in the next clause especially in the consumption of potatoes the inference is as plain as can be made the next article in our newspaper is an advertisement of lands to be let to an improving tenanta few miles from cork in a most sporting country bounded by an uncommon fine turf bog on the verge of which there are a number of fine lime kilns where that manure may be had on very moderate terms the distance for carriage not being many hundred yards the whole lands being now in great heart and completely laid down entirely surrounded and divided by impenetrable furze ditches made of quarried stones laid edgeways it will be a matter of difficulty to the untravelled english reader to comprehend how furze ditches can be made of quarried stones laid edgeways or any way and we fear that we should only puzzle his intellects still more if we should attempt to explain to him the mysteries of irish ditching in the technical terms of the country with the face of a ditch he may be acquainted but to the back and gripe and bottom of the gripe and top of the back of a ditch we fear he is still to be introduced we can never sufficiently admire these furze ditches made of quarried stones they can indeed be found only in ireland but we have heard in england of things almost as extraordinary dr grey in his erudite and entertaining notes on hudibras records the deposition of a lawyer who in an action of battery told the judge that the defendant beat his client with a certain wooden instrument called an iron pestle nay to go further still a wise annotator on the pentateuch named peter harrison observed of moses two tables of stone that they were made of shittimwood the stone furze ditches are scarcely bolder instances of the catachresis than the stone tables of shittimwood this bold figure of rhetoric in an irish advertisement of an estate may lead us to expect that hibernian advertisers may in time emulate the fame of christie the prince of auctioneers whose fine descriptive powers can make more of an estate on paper than ever was made of it in any other shape except in the form of an ejectment the fictions of law indeed surpass even the auctioneers imagination and a man may be said never to know the extent of his own possessions until he is served with a process of ejectment he then finds himself required to give up the possession of a multitude of barns orchards fishponds horseponds dwellinghouses pigeonhouses dovecotes outhouses and appurtenances which he never saw or heard of and which are nowhere to be found upon the surface of the habitable globe so that we cannot really express this english legal transaction without being guilty of an irish bull and saying that the person ejected is ousted from places which he never entered to proceed with our newspapersthe next advertisement is from a schoolmaster but we shall not descant upon its grammatical errors because they are not blunders peculiar to irish schoolmasters we have frequently observed that the advertisements of schoolmasters even in england are seldom free from solecisms too much care in writing it seems is almost as bad as too little in the preface of the dictionary of the french academy there are as it is computed by an able french critic no less than sixteen faults and in harris the celebrated grammarians dedication of his hermes there is one bull and almost as many faults as lines it appears as if the most precise and learned writers sometimes like the ladies in one of congreves plays run into the danger to avoid the apprehension after a careful scrutiny of the hibernian advertisements we are compelled to confess that we have not met with any blunders that more nearly resemble our notion of an irish bull than one which some years ago appeared in our english papers it was the title to an advertisement of a washing machine in these words every man his own washerwoman we have this day nov seen the following this day were published memoirs of the life of mrs elizabeth carter with a new edition of her poems some of which have never before appeared and an eyewitness assures us that lately he saw an advertisement in the following terms stuck up on the walls of an english coffeehouse this coffeehouse removed upstairs a roman emperor used to draw his stairs up after him every night into his bedchamber and we have heard of throwing a house out of the windows but drawing a whole house up into itself is new how can we account for such a blunder in an advertisement on the wall of an english coffeehouse except by supposing that it was penned by an irish waiter if that were the case it would an admirable example of an irish bull and therefore we had best take it for granted let not any conscientious person be startled at the mode of reasoning by which we have convicted an imaginary irish waiter of a real bull it is at least as good if not better logic than that which was successfully employed in the time of the popish plot to convict an irish physician of forgery the matter is thus recorded by lestrange the irish physician was charged with writing a treasonable libel but denied the thing and appealed to the unlikeness of the characters it was agreed that there was no resemblance at all in the hands but asserted that the doctor had two hands his physic hand and his plot hand and the one not a jot like the other now this was the doctors plot hand and it was insisted that because it was not like one of his hands it must be like the other by this convenient mode of reasoning an irishman may at any time be convicted of any crime or of any absurdity but what have we next in our newspapermurder robbery and reward this seems a strange connexion of things according to our vulgar notions of distributive justice but we are told that the wicked shall have their reward even in this world and we suppose it is upon this principle that over the stocks in a town in ireland there appears this inscription a reward for vagabonds upon proceeding further in our advertisement which begins with murder robbery and reward we find however that contrary to the just expectations raised by the title the reward is promised not to the robbers and murderers but to those who shall discover and prosecute them to conviction here we were led into error by that hasty mode of elision which sometimes obtains in the titles even of our english law processes as scifa fifa quitam c names which to preserve the glorious uncertainty of the law never refer to the sense but to the first words of the writs in our newspaper a formidable list of unanimous resolutions of various committees and corps succeeds to the advertisement of murder robbery and reward and we have at the close of each days business thanksgivings in various formulas for the very proper upright or spirited behaviour of our worthy gallant or respected chairman now that a man may behave properly or sit upright in a chair we can readily comprehend but what are we to understand by a spirited behaviour in a chair perhaps it alludes to the famous duel fought by a gouty irish gentleman in his arm chair as the gallant chairman actually in that position shot his adversary it behoves us to understand the meaning of spirited behaviour in the chair we may however venture to hint fas est et ab hoste doceri that in the publication of corps and committees this formula should be omittedresolved unanimously with only one dissentient voice here the obloquy meant to rest on the one dissentient voice unfortunately falls upon the publishers of the disgrace exposing them to the ridicule of resolving an irish bull if this be a bull however we are concerned to find it is matched by that of the government of munich who published a catalogue of forbidden books and afterwards under heavy penalties forbade the reading of the catalogue but this might be done in the hurry occasioned by the just dread of revolutionary principles what shall we say for the blunder of a french academician in a time of profound peace who gave it as his opinion that nothing should be read in the public sittings of the academy par dela ce qui est impose par les statuts il motivait son avis en disanten fait dinutilites il ne faut que le necessaire if this speech had been made by a member of the royal irish academy it would have had the honour to be noticed all over england as a bull the honour to be noticed we say in imitation of the exquisitely polite expression of a correspondent of the english royal society who talks of the earthquake that had the honour to be noticed by the royal society it will we fear be long before the irish emerge so far from barbarism as to write in this style the irish are however we are happy to observe making some little approaches to a refined and courtly style kings and in imitation of them great men and all who think themselves greata numerous classspeak and write as much as possible in the plural number instead of the singular instead of i they always say we instead of my our according to the italian idiom which flatters this humour so far as to make it a point of indispensable politeness it is doubtless in humble imitation of such illustrious examples that an irishman of the lowest class when he means to express that he is a member of a committee says i am a committee thus consolidating the power wisdom and virtue of a whole committee in his own person superior even to the indian who believes that he shall inherit the powers and virtues of his enemies after he has destroyed them this committeeman takes possession of the faculties of his living friends and associates when some of the united men as they called themselves were examined they frequently answered to the questions who or what are you i am a committee however extraordinary it may at first sound to hear one man assert that he is a whole committee it is not more wonderful than that the whole parliament of bordeaux should be found in a onehorse chair we forbear to descant further upon irish committeemen lest we should call to mind merely by the similarity of name the times when england had her committeemen who were not perfectly free from all tinge of absurdity it is remarkable that in times of popular ferment a variety of new terms are coined to serve purposes and passions of the moment in the days of the english committeemen this practice had risen to such a height that it was fair game for ridicule accordingly sir john birkenhead about that time found it necessary to publish the childrens dictionary an exact collection of all new words born since nov in speeches prayers and sermons as well those that signify something as nothing we observe that it has been likewise found necessary to publish in france un dictionnaire neologique a dictionary of the new terms adopted since the revolution it must be supposed that during the late disturbances in ireland many cant terms have been brought into use which are not yet to be reckoned amongst the acknowledged terms of the country however absurd these may be they are not for our purpose proper subjects of animadversion some countries have their birds of passage and some their follies of passage which it is scarcely worth while to shoot as they fly it has been often said that the language of a people is a just criterion of their progress in civilization but we must not take a specimen of their vocabulary during the immediate prevalence of any transient passion or prejudice it is to be hoped that all party barbarisms in language will now be disused and forgotten for some time has elapsed since we read the following article of country intelligence in a dublin paper general scoured the country yesterday but had not the good fortune to meet with a single rebel the author of this paragraph seems to have been a keen sportsman he regrets the not meeting with a single rebel as he would the not meeting with a single hare or partridge and he justly considers the human biped as fair game to be hunted down by all who are properly qualified and licensed by government to the english perhaps it may seem a strange subject of lamentation that a general could not meet with a single rebel in the county of wicklow when they have so lately been informed from the high authority of a noble lord that ireland was so disturbed that whenever he went out he called as regularly for his pistols as for his hat and gloves possibly however this was only a figure of speech like that of bishop wilkins who prophesied that the time would come when gentlemen when they were to go a journey would call for their wings as regularly as they call for their bootswe believe that the hyperboles of the privycounsellor and the bishop are of equal magnitude chapter iii the criminal law of bulls and blunders madame de sevigne observes that there are few people sufficiently candid or sufficiently enlightened to distinguish in their judgments of others between those faults and mistakes which proceed from manque desprit and those which arise merely from manque dusage we cannot appreciate the talents or character of foreigners without making allowance for their ignorance of our manners of the idiom of our language and the multifarious significations of some of our words a french gentleman who dined in london in company with the celebrated author of the rambler wishing to show him a mark of peculiar respect drank dr johnsons health in these words your health mr vagabond assuredly no welljudging englishman would undervalue the frenchmans abilities because he mistook the meaning of the words vagabond and rambler he would recollect that in old english and modern french authors vagabond means wanderer des eaux vagabondes is a phrase far from inelegant but independently of this consideration no wellbred gentleman would put a foreigner out of countenance by openly laughing at such a mistake he would imitate the politeness of the frenchman who when dr moore said i am afraid the expression i have just used is not french replied non monsieurmais il merite bien de letre it would indeed be a great stretch of politeness to extend this to our irish neighbours for no irishism can ever deserve to be anglicised though so many gallicisms have of late not only been naturalized in england but even adopted by the most fashionable speakers and writers the mistaking a feminine for a masculine noun or a masculine for a feminine must in all probability have happened to every englishman that ever opened his lips in paris yet without losing his reputation for common sense but when a poor irish haymaker who had but just learned a few phrases of the english language by rote mistook a feminine for a masculine noun and began his speech in a court of justice with these words my lord i am a poor widow instead of my lord i am a poor widower it was sufficient to throw a grave judge and jury into convulsions of laughter it was formerly in law no murder to kill a merus hibernicus and it is to this day no offence against good manners to laugh at any of this species it is of a thousand times more consequence to have the laugh than the argument on our side as all those know full well who have any experience in the management of the great or little vulgar by the common custom and courtesy of england we have the laugh on our side let us keep it by all means all means are justifiable to obtain a great end as all great men maintain in practice if not in theory we need not in imitating them have any scruples of conscience we need not apprehend that to ridicule our hibernian neighbours unmercifully is unfriendly or ungenerous nations it has been well observed are never generous in their conduct towards each other we must follow the common custom of nations where we have no law to guide our proceedings we must therefore carefully continue the laudable practice of ridiculing the blunders whether real or imaginary of irishmen in conversation englishmen are permitted sometimes to blunder but without ever being called blunderers it would indeed be an intolerable restraint upon social intercourse if every man were subject to be taxed for each inaccuracy of languageif he were compelled to talk upon all occasions as if he were amenable to a starchamber of criticism and surrounded by informers much must be allowed in england for the licence of conversation but by no means must this conversationlicence be extended to the irish if for instance at the convivial hour of dinner when men are not usually intent upon grammatical or mathematical niceties an irish gentleman desires him who rules the roast to cut the sirloin of beef horizontally downwards let the mistake immediately be set down in our notebooks and conned over and got by heart and let it be repeated to all eternity as a bull but if an english lady observe when the candles have long stood unsnuffed that those odious long wicks will soon grow up to the ceiling she can be accused only of an error of vision we conjure our readers to attend to these distinctions in their intercourse with their hibernian neighbours it must be done habitually and technically and we must not listen to what is called reason we must not enter into any argument pro or con but silence every irish opponent if we can with a laugh the abbe girard in his accurate work synonymes francois makes a plausible distinction between un ane et un ignorant he says on est ane par disposition on est ignorant par defaut dinstruction an ignorant person may certainly even in the very circumstances which betray his ignorance evince considerable ability for instance the native indian who for the first time saw a bottle of porter uncorked and who expressed great astonishment at the quantity of froth which he saw burst from the bottle and much curiosity to know whether it could all be put in again showed even in his ignorance a degree of capacity which in different situations might have saved his life or have made his fortune in the situation of the poor fisherman and the great giant of smoke who issued from the small vessel well known to all versed in the arabian tales such acuteness would have saved his life and a similar spirit of inquiry applied to chemistry might in modern times have made his fortune even where no positive abilities are displayed at the time by those who manifest ignorance we should not except the culprits be natives of ireland hastily give them up ignorance of the most common objects is not only incident to certain situations but absolutely unavoidable and the individuals placed in those situations are no more blameable than they would be for becoming blind in the snows of lapland or for having goitres amongst the cretins of le vallais would you blame the ignorant nuns who insensible of the danger of an eruption of mount vesuvius warmed themselves at the burning lava which flowed up to the windows of their cells or would you think the french canoness an idiot who at the age of fifty was on account of her health to go out of her convent and asked when she met a cow for the first time what strange animal that was or would you think that those poor children deserved to be stigmatized as fools who after being confined for a couple of years in an english workhouse actually at eight years old had forgotten the names of a pig and a calf their ignorance was surely more deplorable than ridiculous when the london young lady kept a collection of chickenbones on her plate at dinner as a bonnebouche for her brothers horse dr johnson would not suffer her to be called an idiot but very judiciously defended her by maintaining that her action merely demonstrated her ignorant of points of natural history on which a london miss had no immediate opportunity of obtaining information had the world always judged upon such subjects with similar candour the reproachful cant term of cockney would never have been disgracefully naturalized in the english language this word as we are informed by a learned philologist originated from the mistake of a learned citizens son who having been bred up entirely in the metropolis was so gloriously ignorant of country life and country animals that the first time he heard a cock crow he called it neighing if such a mistake had been made by an irishman it would surely have been called a bull it has at least as good pretensions to the title as many mistakes made by ignorant hibernians for instance the wellknown blunder relative to the sphinxan uninformed irishman hearing the sphinx alluded to in company whispered to a friend the sphinx who is that now a monsterman oh a munsterman i thought he was from connaught replied our irishman determined not to seem totally unacquainted with the family gross and ridiculous as this blunder appears we are compelled by candour to allow that the affectation of showing knowledge has betrayed to shame men far superior to our hibernian both in reputation and in the means of acquiring knowledge cardinal richelieu the maecenas or wouldbe maecenas of france once mistook the name of a noted grammarian maurus terentianus for a play of terences this is called by the french writer who records it une bevue bien grossiere however gross a mistake can never be made into a bull we find bevues french english italian german latin and greek of theologians historians antiquaries poets critics and translators without end the learned budaeus takes sir thomas mores utopia for a true history and proposes sending missionaries to work the conversion of so wise a people as the utopians an english antiquary mistakes a tomb in a gothic cathedral for the tomb of hector pope our great poet and prince of translators mistakes dec the th nov the th of cinthio for dec th nov th and warburton his learned critic improves upon the blunder by afterward writing the words december and november at full length better still because more comic is the blunder of a frenchman who puzzled by the title of one of cibbers plays loves last shift translates it la derniere chemise de lamour we laugh at these mistakes and forget them but who can forget the blunder of the cork almanackmaker who informs the world that the principal republics in europe are venice holland and america the blunders of men of all countries except ireland do not affix an indelible stigma upon individual or national character a free pardon is and ought to be granted by every englishman to the vernacular and literary errors of those who have the happiness to be born subjects of great britain what enviable privileges are annexed to the birth of an englishman and what a misfortune it is to be a native of ireland chapter iv little dominick we have laid down the general law of bulls and blunders but as there is no rule without an exception we may perhaps allow an exception in favour of little dominick little dominick was born at fortreilly in ireland and bred nowhere until his tenth year when he was sent to wales to learn manners and grammar at the school of mr owen ap davies ap jenkins ap jones this gentleman had reason to think himself the greatest of men for he had over his chimneypiece a wellsmoked genealogy duly attested tracing his ancestry in a direct line up to noah and moreover he was nearly related to the learned etymologist who in the time of queen elizabeth wrote a folio to prove that the language of adam and eve in paradise was pure welsh with such causes to be proud mr owen ap davies ap jenkins ap jones was excusable for sometimes seeming to forget that a schoolmaster is but a man he however sometimes entirely forgot that a boy is but a boy and this happened most frequently with respect to little dominick this unlucky wight was flogged every morning by his master not for his vices but for his vicious constructions and laughed at by his companions every evening for his idiomatic absurdities they would probably have been inclined to sympathize in his misfortunes but that he was the only irish boy at school and as he was at a distance from all his relations and without a friend to take his part he was a just object of obloquy and derision every sentence he spoke was a bull every two words he put together proved a false concord and every sound he articulated betrayed the brogue but as he possessed some of the characteristic boldness of those who have been dipped in the shannon he showed himself able and willing to fight his own battles with the host of foes by whom he was encompassed some of these it was said were of nearly twice his stature this may be exaggerated but it is certain that our hero sometimes ventured with sly irish humour to revenge himself upon his most powerful tyrant by mimicking the welsh accent in which mr owen ap jones said to him cot pless me you plockit and shall i never learn you enclish crammer it was whispered in the ear of this dionysius that our little hero was a mimick and he was treated with increased severity the midsummer holydays approached but he feared that they would shine no holydays for him he had written to his mother to tell her that school would break up the st and to beg an answer without fail by return of post but no answer came it was now nearly two months since he had heard from his dear mother or any of his friends in ireland his spirits began to sink under the pressure of these accumulated misfortunes he slept little ate less and played not at all indeed nobody would play with him upon equal terms because he was nobodys equal his schoolfellows continued to consider him as a being if not of a different species at least of a different caste from themselves mr owen ap joness triumph over the little irish plockit was nearly complete for the boys heart was almost broken when there came to the school a new scholaroh how unlike the others his name was edwards he was the son of a neighbouring welsh gentleman and he had himself the spirit of a gentleman when he saw how poor dominick was persecuted he took him under his protection fought his battles with the welsh boys and instead of laughing at him for speaking irish he endeavoured to teach him to speak english in his answers to the first question edwards ever asked him little dominick made two blunders which set all his other companions in a roar yet edwards would not allow them to be genuine bulls in answer to the question who is your father dominick said with a deep sigh i have no fatheri am an orphani have only a mother have you any brothers and sisters no i wish i had perhaps they would love me and not laugh at me said dominick with tears in his eyes but i have no brothers but myself one day mr jones came into the schoolroom with an open letter in his hand saying here you little irish plockit heres a letter from your mother the little irish blockhead started from his form and throwing his grammar on the floor leaped up higher than he or any boy in the school had ever been seen to leap before and clapping his hands he exclaimed a letter from my mother and will i hear the letter and will i see her once more and will i go home these holydays oh then i will be too happy theres no tanger of that said mr owen ap jones for your mother like a wise ooman writes me here that py the atvice of your cardian to oom she is coing to be married she will not pring you home to ireland till i send her word you are perfect in your enclish crammer at least i have my lesson perfect sir said dominick taking his grammar up from the floor will i say it now will i say it now no you plockit no and i will write your mother word you have proke priscians head four times this tay since her letter came you irish plockit continued the relentless grammarian will you never learn the tifference between shall and will will i hear the letter and will i see her once more what enclish is this plockit the welsh boys all grinned except edwards who hummed loud enough to be heard two lines of the good old english song and will i see him once again and will i hear him speak many of the boys were fortunately too ignorant to feel the force of the quotation but mr owen ap jones understood it turned upon his heel and walked off soon afterwards he summoned dominick to his awful desk and pointing with his ruler to the following page in harriss hermes bade him reat it and understant it if he could little dominick read but could not understand then read it loud you plockit dominick read aloud there is nothing appears so clearly an object of the mind or intellect only as the future does since we can find no place for its existence any where else not but the same if we consider is equally true of the past well co onwhat stops the plockit cant you reat enclish now yes sir but i was trying to understand it i was considering that this is like what they would call an irish bull if i had said it little dominick could not explain what he meant in english that mr owen ap jones would understand and to punish him for his impertinent observation the boy was doomed to learn all that harris and lowth have written to explain the nature of shall and will the reader if he be desirous of knowing the full extent of the penance enjoined may consult lowths grammar p ed and harriss hermes p and th edition undismayed at the length of his task little dominick only said i hope if i say it all without missing a word you will not give my mother a bad account of me and my grammar studies sir say it all first without missing a word and then i shall see what i shall say replied mr owen ap jones even the encouragement of this oracular answer excited the boys fond hopes so keenly that he lent his little soul to the task learned it perfectly said it at night without missing one word to his friend edwards and said it the next morning without missing one word to his master and now sir said the boy looking up will you write to my mother and shall i see her and shall i go home tell me first whether you understant all this that you have learnt so cliply said mr owen ap jones that was more than his bond our heros countenance fell and he acknowledged that he did not understand it perfectly then i cannot write a coot account of you and your crammer studies to your mother my conscience coes against it said the conscientious mr owen ap jones no entreaties could move him dominick never saw the letter that was written to his mother but he felt the consequence she wrote word this time punctually by return of the post that she was sorry that she could not send for him home these holydays as she heard so bad an account from mr jones c and as she thought it her duty not to interrupt the course of his education especially his grammar studies little dominick heaved many a sigh when he saw the packingsup of all his schoolfellows and dropped a few tears as he looked out of the window and saw them one after another get on their welsh ponies and gallop off towards their homes i have no home to go to said he yes you have cried edwards and our horses are at the door to carry us there to ireland methe horses said the poor boy quite bewildered and will they bring me to ireland no the horses cannot carry you to ireland said edwards laughing goodnaturedly but you have a home now in england i asked my father to let me take you home with me and he says yes like a dear good father and has sent the horses come lets away but will mr jones let me go yes he dare not refuse for my father has a living in his gift that jones wants and which he will not have if he do not change his tone to you little dominick could not speak one word his heart was so full no boy could be happier than he was during these holydays the genial current of his soul which had been frozen by unkindness flowed with all its natural freedom and force when dominick returned to school after these holydays were over mr owen ap jones who now found that the irish boy had an english protector with a living in his gift changed his tone he never more complained unjustly that dominick broke priscians head seldom called him irish plockit and once would have flogged a welsh boy for taking up this castoff expression of the masters but the irish blockhead begged the culprit off little dominick sprang forward rapidly in his studies he soon surpassed every boy in the school his friend edwards only excepted in process of time his guardian removed him to a higher seminary of education edwards had a tutor at home the friends separated afterwards they followed different professions in distant parts of the world and they neither saw nor heard any more of each other for many years from boys they grew into men and dominick now no longer little dominick went over to india as private secretary to one of our commanders in chief how he got into this situation or by what gradations he rose in the world we are not exactly informed we know only that he was the reputed author of a muchadmired pamphlet on indian affairs that the despatches of the general to whom he was secretary were remarkably well written and that dominick oreilly esq returned to england after several years absence not miraculously rich but with a fortune equal to his wishes his wishes were not extravagant his utmost ambition was to return to his native country with a fortune that should enable him to live independently of all the world especially of some of his relations who had not used him well his mother was no more upon his arrival in london one of the first things he did was to read the irish newspapersto his inexpressible joy he saw the estate of fortreilly advertised to be soldthe very estate which had formerly belonged to his own family away he posted directly to an attorneys who was empowered to dispose of the land when this attorney produced a map of the wellknown pleasureground and an elevation of that house in which he had spent the happiest hours of his infancy his heart was so touched that he was on the point of paying down more for an old ruin than a good new house would cost the attorney acted honestly by his client and seized this moment to exhibit a plan of the stabling and offices which as sometimes is the case in ireland were in a style far superior to the dwellinghouse our hero surveyed these with transport he rapidly planned various improvements in imagination and planted certain favourite spots in the pleasureground during this time the attorney was giving directions to a clerk about some other business suddenly the name of owen ap jones struck his earhe started let him wait in the front parlour his money is not forthcoming said the attorney and if he keep edwards in gaol till he rots edwards good heavensin gaol what edwards exclaimed our hero it was his friend edwards the attorney told him that mr edwards had been involved in great distress by taking upon himself his fathers debts which had been incurred in exploring a mine in wales that of all the creditors none had refused to compound except a welsh parson who had been presented to his living by old edwards and that this mr owen ap jones had thrown young mr edwards into gaol for the debt what is the rascals demand he shall be paid off this instant cried dominick throwing down the plan of fortreilly send for him up and let me pay him off upon the spot had not we best finish our business first about the oreilly estate sir said the attorney no sir damn the oreilly estate cried he huddling the maps together on the desk and taking up the bank notes which he had begun to reckon for the purchase money i beg your pardon sir if you knew the facts you would excuse me why does not this rascal come up to be paid the attorney thunderstruck by this hibernian impetuosity had not yet found time to take his pen out of his mouth as he sat transfixed in his armchair oreilly ran to the head of the stairs and called out in a stentorian voice here you mr owen ap jones come up and be paid off this instant or you shall never be paid at all up stairs hobbled the old schoolmaster as fast as the gout and welsh ale would let him cot pless me that voice he began wheres your bond sir said the attorney safe here cot be praised said the terrified owen ap jones pulling out of his bosom first a blue pockethandkerchief and then a tattered welsh grammar which oreilly kicked to the farther end of the room here is my bond said he in the crammer which he gathered from the ground then fumbling over the leaves he at length unfolded the precious deposit oreilly saw the bond seized it looked at the sum paid it into the attorneys hands tore the seal from the bond then without looking at old jones whom he dared not trust himself to speak to he clapped his hat upon his head and rushed out of the room arrived at the kings bench prison he hurried to the apartment where edwards was confined the bolts flew back for even the turnkeys seemed to catch our heros enthusiasm edwards my dear boy how do you do heres a bond debt justly due to you for my education oh never mind asking any unnecessary questions only just make haste out of this undeserved abode our old rascal is paid offowen ap jones you knowwell how the man stares why now will you have the assurance to pretend to forget who i am and must i spake continued he assuming the tone of his childhood and must i spake to you again in my ould irish brogue before you will ricollict your own little dominick when his friend edwards was out of prison and when our hero had leisure to look into business he returned to the attorney to see that mr owen ap jones had been legally satisfied sir said the attorney i have paid the plaintiff in this suit and he is satisfied but i must say added he with a contemptuous smile that you irish gentlemen are rather in too great a hurry in doing business business sir is a thing that must be done slowly to be done well i am ready now to do business as slowly as you please but when my friend was in prison i thought the quicker i did his business the better now tell me what mistake i have made and i will rectify it instantly instantly tis well sir with your promptitude that you have to deal with what prejudice thinks uncommonan honest attorney here are some bank notes of yours sir amounting to a good round sum you made a little blunder in this business you left me the penalty instead of the principal of the bondjust twice as much as you should have done just twice as much as was in the bond but not twice as much as i should have done nor half as much as i should have done in my opinion said oreilly but whatever i did was with my eyes open i was persuaded you were an honest man in which you see i was not mistaken and as a man of business i knew you would pay jones only his due the remainder of the money i meant and mean should lie in your hands for my friend edwardss use i feared he would not have taken it from my hands i therefore left it in yours to have taken my friend out of prison merely to let him go back again today for want of money to keep himself clear with the world would have been a blunder indeed but not an irish blunder our irish blunders are never blunders of the heart chapter v the bliss of ignorance no wellinformed englishman would laugh at the blunders of such a character as little dominick but there are people who justify the assertion that laughter always arises from a sense of real or imaginary superiority now if it be true that laughter has its source in vanity as the most ignorant are generally the most vain they must enjoy this pleasure in its highest perfection unconscious of their own deficiencies and consequently fearless of becoming in their turn the objects of ridicule they enjoy in full security the delight of humbling their superiors how much are they to be admired for the courage with which they apply on all occasions their test of truth wise men may be struck with admiration respect doubt or humility but the ignorant happily unconscious that they know nothing can be checked in their merriment by no consideration human or divine theirs is the sly sneer the dry joke and the horse laugh theirs the comprehensive range of ridicule which takes every creature in of every kind no fastidious delicacy spoils their sports of fancy though ten times told the tale to them never can be tedious though dull as the fat weed that grows on lethes bank the jest for them has all the poignancy of satire on the very offals the garbage of wit they can feed and batten happy they who can find in every jester the wit of sterne or swift who else can wade through hundreds of thicklyprinted pages to obtain for their reward such witticisms as the following two irishmen having travelled on foot from chester to barnet were confoundedly tired and fatigued by their journey and the more so when they were told that they had still about ten miles to go by my shoul and st patrick cries one of them it is but five miles apiece here notwithstanding the promise of a jest held forth by the words by my shoul and st patrick we are ultimately cheated of our hopes to the ignorant indeed the word of promise is kept to the mind as well as to the ear but others perceive that instead of a bull they have only a piece of sentimental arithmetic founded upon the elegant theorem that friendship doubles all our pleasures and divides all our pains we must not from false delicacy to our countrymen here omit a piece of advice to english retailers or inventors of irish blunders let them beware of such prefatory exclamations asby my shoul and st patrick by jasus arrah honey my dear joy c because all such phrases besides being absolutely out of date and fashion in ireland raise too high an expectation in the minds of a british audience operating as much to the disadvantage of the storyteller as the dangerous exordium ofill tell you an excellent story an exordium ever to be avoided by all prudent wits another caution should be given to wellmeaning ignorance never produce that as an irish bull for which any person of common literature can immediately supply a precedent from our best authors never be at the pains for instance of telling from joe miller a good story of an irish sailor who travelled with captain cook round the world and afterwards swore to his companions that it was as flat as a table this anecdote however excellent immediately finds a parallel in pope mad mathesis alone was unconfined too mad for mere material chains to bind now to pure space lifts her ecstatic stare now running round the circle finds it square pope was led into the blunder of representing mad mathesis running round the circle and finding it square by a confused notion that mathematicians had considered the circle as composed of straight lines his mathematical friends could have told him that though it was talked of as a polygon it was not supposed to be a square but polygon would not have rhymed to stare and poets when they launch into the ocean of words must have an eye to the helm at all events a poet who is not supposed to be a student of the exact sciences may be forgiven for a mathematical blunder this affair of squaring the circle seems to be peculiarly liable to error for even an accurate mathematician cannot speak of it without committing something very like a bull dr hutton in his treatise on mensuration p says as the famous quadrature of the late mr john machin professor of astronomy in gresham college is extremely expeditious and but little known i shall take this opportunity of explaining it it is to be presumed that the doctor here uses the word famous in that acceptation in which it is daily and hourly employed by our bondstreet loungers by city apprentices and men of the ton that was a famous good joke he is a famous whip we had a famous hop c now it cannot be supposed that any of these things are in themselves entitled to fame but they may indeed by the courtesy of england be at once famous and but little known it is unnecessary to enter into the defence either of dr hutton or of pope for they were not born in ireland therefore they cannot make bulls and assuredly their mistakes will not in the opinion of any person of common sense or candour derogate from their reputation never strike till you are sure to wound is a maxim well known to the polite and politic part of the world never laugh when the laugh can be turned against you should be the maxim of those who find their chief pleasure in making others ridiculous this principle if applied to our subject would lead however to a very extensive and troublesome system of mutual forbearance troublesome in proportion to the good or ill humour of the parties concerned extensive in proportion to their knowledge and acquirements a man of cultivated parts will foresee the possibility of the retort courteous where an ignorant man will enjoy the fearless bliss of ignorance for example an illiterate person may enjoy a hearty laugh at the common story of an old irish beggarman who pretending to be dumb was thrown off his guard by the question how many years have you been dumb and answered five years last st johns eve please your honour but our triumph over the irishman abates when we recollect in the history of england and in shakspeare the case of saunder simcox who pretended to be miraculously and instantaneously cured of blindness at st albans shrine since we have bestowed so much criticism on the blunder of a beggarman a word or two must be permitted on the blunder of a thief it is natural for ignorant people to laugh at the hibernian who said that he had stolen a pound of chocolate to make tea of but philosophers are disposed to abstain from the laugh of superiority when they recollect that the irishman could probably make as good tea from chocolate as the chemist could make butter sugar and cream from antimony sulphur and tartar the absurdities in the ancient chemical nomenclature could not be surpassed by any in the hibernian catalogue if the reader should think this a rash and unwarrantable assertion we refer him to an essay in which the flagrant abuses of speech in the old language of chemistry are admirably exposed and ridiculed could an irishman confer a more appropriate appellation upon a white powder than that of beautiful black it is really provoking to perceive that as our knowledge of science or literature extends we are in more danger of finding in our own and foreign languages parallels and precedents for irish blunders so that a very well informed man can scarcely with any grace or conscience smile where a booby squire might enjoy a long and loud horselaugh of contempt what crowds were collected to see the irish bottle conjuror get into a quart bottle but dr desaguliers had prepared the english to think such a condensation of animal particles not impossible he says vol i p of his lectures on natural philosophy that the nature of things should last and their natural course continue the same all the changes made in bodies must arise only from the various separations new conjunctions and motions of these original particles these must be imagined of an unconceivable smallness but by the union of them there are made bigger lumps c indeed things are now come to such a lamentable pass that without either literary or scientific acquirements mere local knowledge such as can be obtained from a fingerpost may sometimes prevent us from the full enjoyment of the boeotian absurdity of our neighbours what can at first view appear a grosser blunder than that of the irishman who begged a friend to look over his library to find for him the history of the world before the creation yet this anachronism of ideas is not unparalleled it is matched though on a more contracted scale by an inscription on a british fingerpost had you seen these roads before they were made youd lift up your eyes and bless marshal wade there is however a rabbi mentioned by bayle who far exceeds both the irishman and the fingerpost he asserts that providence questioned adam concerning the creation before he was born and that adam knew more of the matter than the angels who had laughed at him those who see things in a philosophical light must have observed more frequently than others that there is in this world a continual recurrence or rotation of ideas events and blunders with his utmost ingenuity or his utmost absurdity a man in modern days cannot contrive to produce a system for which there is no prototype in antiquity or to commit a blunder for which there is no precedent for example during the late rebellion in ireland at the military execution of some wretched rebel the cord broke and the criminal who had been only half hanged fell to the ground the major who was superintending the execution exclaimed you rascal if you do that again ill kill you as sure as you breathe now this is by no means an original idea in an old french book called la charlatanerie des savans is the following notedautres ont propose et resolu en meme tems des questions ridicules par exemple celleci devroiton faire souffrir une seconde fois le meme genre de mort a un criminel qui apres avoir eu la tete coupee viendroit a resusciterfinkelth praef ad observationes pract num the passionate major instead of being a mere irish blunderer was without knowing it a learned casuist for he was capable of deciding in one word a question which it seems had puzzled the understandings of the ablest lawyers of france or which had appalled their conscientious sensibility alas there is nothing new under the sun where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise chapter vi thoughts that breathe and words that burn we lamented in our last chapter that there is nothing new under the sun yet perhaps the thoughts and phraseology of the following story may not be familiar to the english plase your honour says a man whose head is bound up with a garter in token and commemoration of his having been at a fair the preceding nightplase your honour its what i am striving since six oclock and before this morning becaase id sooner trouble your honours honour than any man in all ireland on account of your character and having lived under your family me and mine twinty years aye say forty again to the back o that in the old gentlemans time as i well remember before i was born that same time i heard tell of your own honours riding a little horse in green with your gun before you a grousing over our townlands which was the mill and abbey of ballynagobogg though tis now set away from me owing to them that belied my father to christy salmon becaase hes an orangemanor his wifethough he was once let him deny it who can to my certain knowledge behind the haystack in tullygore sworn in a united man by captain alick who was hangedpace to the dead any howwell not to be talking too much of that now only for this christy salmon i should be still living under your honour very likely but what has all this to do with the present business if you have any complaint to make against christy salmon make itif not let me go to dinner oh it would be too bad to be keeping your honour from your dinner but ill make your honour sinsible immadiately it is not of christy salmon atallatall im talking may be your honour is not sinsible yet who i ami am paddy mdoole of the curragh and ive been a flaxdresser and dealer since i parted your honours land and was last night at the fair of clonaghkilty where i went just in a quiet way thinking of nothing at all as any man might and had my little yarn along with me my wifes and the girls years spinning and all just hoping to bring them back a few honest shillings as they desarvednone betterwell plase your honour my beast lost a shoe which brought me late to the fair but not so late but what it was as throng as ever you could have walked over the heads of the men women and childer a foot and a horseback all buying and selling so i to be sure thought no harm of doing the like so i makes the best bargain i could of the little hanks for my wife and the girl and the man i sold them to was just weighing them at the crane and i standing forenent himsuccess to myselfsaid i looking at the shillings i was putting into my waistcoat pocket for my poor family when up comes the inspector whom i did not know ill take my oath from adam nor couldnt know becaase he was the deputy inspector and had been but just made of which i was ignorant by this book and all the books that ever were shut and openedbut no matter for that he seizes my hanks out of the scales that i had just sold saying they were unlawful and forfeit becaase by his watch it was past four oclock which i denied to be possible plase your honour becaase not one nor two nor three but all the town and country were selling the same as myself in broad day only when the deputy came up they stopped which i could not by rason i did not know himsir says i very civil if i had known you it would have been another case but any how i hope no jantleman will be making it a crime to a poor man to sell his little matter of yarn for his wife and childer after four oclock when he did not know it was contrary to law atallatall i gave you notice that it was contrary to law at the fair of edgerstown said hei axe your pardon sir said i it was my brother for i was by with that he calls me liar and what not and takes a grip of me and i a grip of my flax and he had a shilala and i had none so he gave it me over the head i crying murder murder and clinging to the scales to save me and they set a swinging and i with them plase your honour till the bame comes down atop o the back o my head and kilt me as your honour sees i see that you are alive still i think its not his fault if i am plase your honour for he left me for dead and i am as good as dead still if it be plasing to your honour to examine my head youll be sinsible im telling nothing but the truth your honour never seen a man kilt as i was and amall which im ready when convanient to swear before your honour the reiterated assurances which this hero gives us of his being killed and the composure with which he offers to swear to his own assassination and decease appear rather surprising and ludicrous to those who are not aware that kilt is here used in a metaphorical sense and that it has not the full force of our word killed but we have been informed by a lady of unquestionable veracity that she very lately received a petition worded in this manner to the right hon lady e p humbly showeth that your poor petitioner is now lying dead in a ditch c this poor irish petitioners expression however preposterous it sounds might perhaps be justified if we were inclined to justify an irishman by the example not only of poets comic and tragic but of prose writers of various nations the evidence in favour both of the fact and the belief that people can speak and walk after they are dead is attested by stout warriors and grave historians let us listen to the solemn voice of a princess who comes sweeping in the sceptred pall of gorgeous tragedy to inform us that half herself has buried the other half weep eyes melt into tears these cheeks to lave one half myself lays tother in the grave for six such lines as these corneille received six thousand livres and the admiration of the french court and people during the augustan age of french literature but an italian is not content with killing by halves here is a man from italy who goes on fighting not like witherington upon his stumps but fairly after he is dead nor yet perceived the vital spirit fled but still fought on nor knew that he was dead common sense is somewhat shocked at this single instance of an individual fighting after he is dead but we shall doubtless be reconciled to the idea by the example of a gallant and modern commander who has declared his opinion that nothing is more feasible than for a garrison to fight or at least to surrender after they are dead nay after they are buriedwitness this public document liberty and equality may th garrison of ostend th floreal muscar commandant of ostend to the commandant in chief of his british majesty general the council of war was sitting when i received the honour of your letters we have unanimously resolved not to surrender the place until we shall have been buried in its ruins c one step further in hyperbole is reserved for him who being buried carries about his own sepulchre to live a life half dead a living death and buried but oh yet more miserable myself my sepulchre a moving grave no person if he heard this passage for the first time from the lips of an irishman could hesitate to call it a series of bulls yet these lines are part of the beautiful complaint of samson agonistes on his blindness such are the hyperboles sanctioned by the genius or what with some judges may have more influence the name of milton the bounds which separate sublimity from bombast and absurdity from wit are as fugitive as the boundaries of taste only those who are accustomed to examine and appraise literary goods are sensible of the prodigious change that can be made in their apparent value by a slight change in the manufacture the absurdity of a mans swearing he was killed or declaring that he is now dead in a ditch is revolting to common sense yet the living death of dapperwit in the rape of the lock is not absurd but witty and representing men as dying many times before their death is in shakspeare sublime cowards die many times before their death the brave can never taste of death but once the most direct contradictions in words do not in english writers destroy the eflect of irony wit pathos or sublimity in the classic ode on eton college the poet exclaims to each their sufferings all are men condemned alike to groan the feeling for anothers pain th unfeeling for their own who but a halfwitted dunce would ask how those that are unfeeling can have sufferings when milton in melodious verse inquires who shall tempt with wandering feet the dark unbottomd infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way what zoilus shall dare interrupt this flow of poetry to object to the palpable obscure or to ask how feet can wander upon that which has no bottom it is easy as tully has long ago observed to fix the brand of ridicule upon the verbum ardens of orators and poetsthe thoughts that breathe and words that burn chapter vii practical bulls as we have not hitherto been successful in finding original irish bulls in language we must now look for them in conduct a person may be guilty of a solecism without uttering a single syllablethat man has been guilty of a solecism with his hand an ancient critic said of an actor who had pointed his hand upwards when invoking the infernal gods you may act a lie as well as speak one says wollaston upon the same principle the irish may be said to act as well as to utter bulls we shall give some instances of their practical bulls which we hope to find unmatched by the blunders of all other nations most people whether they be savage or civilized can contrive to revenge themselves upon their enemies without blundering but the irish are exceptions they cannot even do this without a bull during the late irish rebellion there was a banker to whom they had a peculiar dislike and on whom they had vowed vengeance accordingly they got possession of as many of his banknotes as they could and made a bonfire of them this might have been called a feu de joie perhaps but certainly not un feu dartifice for nothing could show less art than burning a bankers notes in order to destroy his credit how much better do the english understand the arts of vengeance captain drinkwater informs us that during the siege of gibraltar the english being half famished were most violently enraged against the jews who withheld their stores of provision and made money of the public distressa crime never committed except by jews at length the fleet relieved the besieged and as soon as the provisions were given out the english soldiers and sailors to revenge themselves upon the jews burst open their stores and actually roasted a pig at a fire made of cinnamon there are other persons as well as the irish who do not always understand their own interests where their passions are concerned that great warrior hyder ali once lost a battle by a practical bull being encamped within sight of the british he resolved to give them a high idea of his forces and of his artillery for this purpose before the engagement he ordered his army to march early and conveying some large pieces of cannon to the top of a hill he caused them to be pointed at the english camp which they reached admirably well and occasioned a kind of disorder and haste in striking and removing tents c hyder delighted at having thus insulted the english caused all his artillery even the very smallest pieces to be drawn up the hill for the purpose of making a vain parade though the greater part of the balls could never reach the english he imagined he should give the enemy a high idea of his forces and intimidate them by showing all his artillery and the vivacity with which it was worked and in order that his intention might be answered he encouraged the soldiers himself by giving money to the cannoneers of those pieces that appeared to be the best served the english presently after this farce was over obliged hyder to come down from labourinvain hill and to give them battle in earnest as the historian observes the ridiculous cannonade at the top of the hill had exhausted his ammunition his great guns were useless to him and he lost the day by his premature rejoicings before the battle a still more ancient precedent for this preposterous practical bull of rejoicing for an anticipated victory was given by xerxes we believe who brought with him an immense block of marble on which he intended to inscribe the date and manner of his victory over the greeks when xerxes was defeated the greeks dedicated this stone to nemesis the goddess of vengeance but xerxes was in the habit of making practical bulls such as whipping the sea and begging pardon for it afterwards throwing fetters into the hellespont as a token of subjugation and afterwards expiating his offence by an offering of a golden cup and persian scimetar to such blunders can the passions betray the most renowned heroes although they had not the misfortune to have been born in ireland the impatience which induced hyder ali to anticipate victory is not confined to military men and warlike operations if we descend to common life and vulgar business we shall find the same disposition even in the precincts of changealley those who bargained for south sea stock that was not actually forthcoming were called bears in allusion to the practice of the hunters of bears in canada who were accustomed to bargain for the skin of the bear before it was caught but whence the correlative term bull is derived we are at a loss to determine and we must also leave it to the mercantile speculators of england to explain why gentlemen call themselves bulls of wheat and bulls of coals all we can say is that these are not irish bulls there is one distinguished peculiarity of the irish bullits horns are tipped with brass it is generally supposed that persons who have been dipped in the shannon are ever afterwards endowed with a supernatural portion of what is called by enemies impudence or assurance by friends selfpossession or civil courage these invulnerable mortals are never oppressed with mauvaise honte that malady which keeps the faculties of the soul under imaginary imprisonment a welldipped irishman on the contrary can move speak think like demosthenes with as much ease when the eyes of numbers are upon him as if the spectators were so many cabbagestalks this virtue of civil courage is of inestimable value in the opinion of the best judges the great lord verulamno one bytheby could be a better judge of its value than he who wanted it so muchthe great lord verulam declares that if he were asked what is the first second and third thing necessary to success in public business he should answer boldness boldness boldness success to the nation which possesses it in perfection bacon was too acute and candid a philosopher not to acknowledge that like all the other goods of life this same boldness has its countervailing disadvantages certainly says he to men of great judgment bold persons are a sport to behold nay and to the vulgar boldness hath somewhat of the ridiculous for if absurdity be the subject of laughter doubt you not but great boldness is seldom without some absurdity especially it is a sport to see when a bold fellow is out of countenance for that puts his face into a most shrunken and wooden posture as needs it must the man however who possesses boldness in perfection can never be put out of countenance and consequently can never exhibit for the sport of his enemies a face in this wooden posture it is the deficiency and not the excess of this quality that is to be feared civil boldness without military courage would indeed be somewhat ridiculous but we cannot accuse the irish of any want of military courage on the contrary it is supposed in england that an irishman is always ready to give any gentleman satisfaction even when none is desired at the close of the american war as a noble lord of high naval character was returning home to his family after various escapes from danger he was detained a day at holyhead by contrary winds reading in a summerhouse he heard the wellknown sound of bullets whistling near him he looked about and found that two balls had just passed through the door close beside him he looked out of the window and saw two gentlemen who were just charging their pistols again and as he guessed that they had been shooting at a mark upon the door he rushed out and very civilly remonstrated with them on the imprudence of firing at the door of a house without having previously examined whether any one was withinside one of them immediately answered in a tone which proclaimed at once his disposition and his country sir i did not know you were within there and i dont know who you are now but if ive given offence i am willing said he holding out the readycharged pistols to give you the satisfaction of a gentlemantake your choice with his usual presence of mind the noble lord seized hold of both the pistols and said to his astonished countryman do me the justice sir to go into that summerhouse shut the door and let me have two shots at you then we shall be upon equal terms and i shall be quite at your service to give or receive the satisfaction of a gentleman there was an air of drollery and of superiority in his manner which at once struck and pleased the hibernian upon my conscience sir i believe you are a very honest fellow said he looking him earnestly in the face and i have a great mind to shake hands with you will you only just tell me who you are the nobleman told his namea name dear to every briton and every irishman i beg your pardon and thats what no man ever accused me of doing before cried the gallant hibernian and had i known who you were i would as soon have shot my own soul as have fired at the door but how could i tell who was withinside that is the very thing of which i complain said his lordship his candid opponent admitted the justice of the complaint as soon as he understood it and he promised never more to be guilty of such a practical bull chapter viii the dublin shoeblack upon looking over our last chapter on practical bulls we were much concerned to find that we have so few irish and so many foreign blunders it is with still more regret we perceive that notwithstanding our utmost diligence we have not yet been able to point out the distinguishing characteristic of an irish bull but to compensate for this disappointment we have devised a syllogism which some people may prefer to an a priori argument to prove irrefragably that the irish are blunderers after the instances we have produced chapter th of the verbum ardens of english and foreign poets and after the resemblance that we have pointed out betwixt certain figures of rhetoric and the irish bull we have little reason to fear that the candid and enlightened reader should object to our major majorthose who use figurative language are disposed to make bulls minorthe irish use figurative language conclusiontherefore the irish are disposed to make bulls we proceed to establish the truth of our minor and the first evidence we shall call is a dublin shoeblack he is not in circumstances peculiarly favourable for the display of figurative language he is in a court of justice upon his trial for life or death a quarrel happened between two shoeblacks who were playing at what in england is called pitchfarthing or heads and tails and in ireland head or harp one of the combatants threw a small paving stone at his opponent who drew out the knife with which he used to scrape shoes and plunged it up to the hilt in his companions breast it is necessary for our story to say that near the hilt of this knife was stamped the name of lamprey an eminent cutler in dublin the shoeblack was brought to trial with a number of significant gestures which on his audience had all the powers that demosthenes ascribes to action he in a language not purely attic gave the following account of the affair to his judge why my lard as i was going past the royal exchange i meets billy billy says i will you sky a copper done says he done says i and done and dones enough between two jantlemen with that i ranged them fair and even with my hookemsniveyup they go music says heskulls says i and down they come three brown mazards by the holy you fleshd em says he you lie says i with that he ups with a lump of a two year old and lets drive at me i outs with my breadearner and gives it him up to lamprey in the breadbasket to make this intelligible to the english some comments are necessary let us follow the text step by step and it will afford our readers as lord kames says of blairs dissertation on ossian a delicious morsel of criticism as i was going past the royal exchange i meets billy in this apparently simple exordium the scene and the meeting with billy are brought before the eye by the judicious use of the present tense billy says i will you sky a copper a copper genus pro specie the generic name of copper for the base individual halfpenny sky a copper to sky is a new verb which none but a master hand could have coined a more splendid metonymy could not be applied upon a more trivial occasion the lofty idea of raising a metal to the skies is substituted for the mean thought of tossing up a halfpenny our orator compresses his hyperbole into a single word thus the mind is prevented from dwelling long enough upon the figure to perceive its enormity this is the perfection of the art let the genius of french exaggeration and of eastern hyperbole hide their diminished headsvirgil is scarcely more sublime ingrediturque solo et caput inter nubila condit her feet on earth her head amidst the clouds up they go continues our orator music says heskulls says i metaphor continually on one side of an irish halfpenny there is a harp this is expressed by the general term music which is finely contrasted with the word skull down they come three brown mazards mazards how the diction of our orator is enriched from the vocabulary of shakspeare the word head instead of being changed for a more general term is here brought distinctly to the eye by the term mazard or face which is more appropriate to his majestys profile than the word skull or head by the holy you fleshd em says he by the holy is an oath in which more is meant than meets the ear it is an ellipsisan abridgment of an oath the full formula runs thusby the holy poker of hell this instrument is of irish invention or imagination it seems a useful piece of furniture in the place for which it is intended to stir the devouring flames and thus to increase the torments of the damned great judgment is necessary to direct an orator how to suit his terms to his auditors so as not to shock their feelings either by what is too much above or too much below common life in the use of oaths where the passions are warm this must be particularly attended to else they lose their effect and seem more the result of the head than the heart but to proceed by the holy you fleshd em to flesh is another verb of irish coinage it means in shoeblack dialect to touch a halfpenny as it goes up into the air with the fleshy part of the thumb so as to turn it which way you please and thus to cheat your opponent what an intricate explanation saved by one word you lie says i here no periphrasis would do the business with that he ups with a lump of a two year old and lets drive at me he ups witha verb is here formed of two prepositionsa novelty in grammar conjunctions we all know are corrupted anglosaxon verbs but prepositions according to horne tooke derive only from anglosaxon nouns all this time it is possible that the mere english reader may not be able to guess what it is that our orator ups with or takes up he should be apprised that a lump of a two year old is a middlesized stone this is a metaphor borrowed partly from the graziers vocabulary and partly from the arithmeticians vademecum a stone to come under the denomination of a lump of a two year old must be to a less stone as a two year old calf is to a yearling or it must be to a larger stone than itself as a two year old calf is to an ox here the scholar sees that there must be two statements one in the rule of three direct and one in the rule of three inverse to obtain precisely the thing required yet the untutored irishman without suspecting the necessity of this operose process arrives at the solution of the problem by some short cut of his own as he clearly evinces by the propriety of his metaphor to be sure there seems some incongruity in his throwing this lump of a two year old calf at his adversary no arm but that of milo could be strong enough for such a feat upon recollection however bold as this figure may seem there are precedents for its use we read in a certain author says beattie of a giant who in his wrath tore off the top of the promontory and flung it at the enemy and so huge was the mass that you might says he have seen goats browsing on it as it flew through the air compared with this our orators figure is cold and tame i outs with my breadearner continues he we forbear to comment on outs with because the intelligent critic immediately perceives that it has the same sort of merit ascribed to ups with what our hero dignifies with the name of his breadearner is the knife with which by scraping shoes he earned his bread popes ingenious critic mr warton bestows judicious praise upon the art with which this poet in the rape of the lock has used many periphrases and uncommon expressions to avoid mentioning the name of scissars which would sound too vulgar for epic dignityfatal engine forfex meetingpoints c though the metonymy of breadearner for a shoeblacks knife may not equal these in elegance it perhaps surpasses them in ingenuity i gives it him up to lamprey in the breadbasket homer is happy in his description of wounds but this surpasses him in the characteristic choice of circumstance up to lamprey gives us at once a complete idea of the length breadth and thickness of the wound without the assistance of the coroner it reminds us of a passage in virgil cervice orantis capulo tenus abdidit ensem up to the hilt his shining falchion sheathed let us now compare the irish shoeblacks metaphorical language with the sober slang of an english blackguard who fortunately for the fairness of the comparison was placed somewhat in similar circumstances lord mansfield examining a man who was a witness in the court of kings bench asked him what he knew of the defendant oh my lord i knew him i was up to him up to him says his lordship what do you mean by being up to him mean my lord why i was down upon him up to him and down upon him says his lordship turning to counsellor dunning what does the fellow mean why i mean my lord as deep as he thought himself i stagged him i cannot conceive friend says his lordship what you mean by this sort of language i do not understand it not understand it rejoined the fellow with surprise lord what a flat you must be though he undervalued lord mansfield this man does not seem to have been a very bright genius in his cant words up to him down upon him stagged him there are no metaphors and we confess ourselves to be as great flats as his lordship for we do not understand this sort of language true no meaning puzzles more than wit as we may see in another english example proverbs have been called the wisdom of nations therefore it is fair to have recourse to them in estimating national abilities now there is an old english proverb tenterden steeple is the cause of goodwin sands this proverb says mr ray is used when an absurd and ridiculous reason is given of any thing in question an account of the original whereof i find in one of bishop latimers sermons in these wordsmr moore was once sent with commission into kent to try out if it might be what was the cause of goodwin sands and the shelf which stopped up sandwich haven thither cometh mr moore and calleth all the country before him such as were thought to be men of experience and men that could of all likelihood best satisfy him of the matter concerning the stopping of sandwich haven among the rest came in before him an old man with a white head and one that was thought to be little less than a hundred years old when mr moore saw this aged man he thought it expedient to hear him say his mind in this matter for being so old a man it was likely that he knew the most in that presence or company so mr moore called this old aged man unto him and said father said he tell me if you can what is the cause of the great arising of the sands and shelves here about this haven which stop it up so that no ships can arrive here you are the oldest man i can espy in all the company so that if any man can tell any cause of it you of all likelihood can say most to it or at leastwise more than any man here assembled yea forsooth good mr moore quoth this old man for i am well nigh a hundred years old and no man here in this company any thing near my age well thenquoth mr moore how say you to this matter what think you to be the cause of these shelves and sands which stop up sandwich haven forsooth sir quoth he i am an old man i think that tenterden steeple is the cause of goodwin sands for i am an old man sir quoth he i may remember the building of tenterden steeple and i may remember when there was no steeple at all there and before that tenterden or totterden steeple was in building there was no manner of talking of any flats or sands that stopped up the haven and therefore i think that tenterden steeple is the cause of the decay and destroying of sandwich haven thus far the bishop the prolix pertinacity with which this old aged man adheres to the opinion that he had formed without any intelligible reason is characteristic of an english peasant but however absurd his mode of judging may be and however confused and incongruous his ideas his species of absurdity surely bears no resemblance to an hibernian blunder we cannot even suspect it to be possible that a man of this slow circumspect character could be in any danger of making an irish bull and we congratulate the english peasantry and populace as a body upon their possessing that temper which wisely rests content with sober sense nor makes to dangerous wit a vain pretence even the slang of english pickpockets and coiners is as we may see in colquhouns view of the metropolis free from all seducing mixture of wit and humour what englishman would ever have thought of calling persons in the pillory the babes in the wood this is a common cant phrase amongst dublin reprobates undoubtedly such phrases tend to lessen the power of shame and the effect of punishment and a witty rogue will lead numbers to the gallows english morality is not in so much danger as irish manners must be from these humourous talents in their knights of industry if nevertheless there be frequent executions for capital crimes in england we must account for this in the words of the old lord chief justice fortescuemore men says his lordship are hanged in englonde in one year than in fraunce in seven because the english have better hartes the scotchmenne likewise never dare rob but only commit larcenies at all events the phlegmatic temper of englonde secures her from making bulls the propensity to this species of blunder exists in minds of a totally different cast in those who are quick and enthusiastic who are confounded by the rapidity and force with which undisciplined multitudes of ideas crowd for utterance persons of such intellectual characters are apt to make elisions in speaking which they trust the capacities of their audience will supply passing rapidly over a long chain of thought they sometimes forget the intermediate links and no one but those of equally rapid habits can follow them successfully we hope that the evidence of the dublin shoeblack has in some degree tended to prove our minor that the irish are disposed to use figurative language we shall not however rest our cause on a single evidence however respectable but before we summon our other witnesses we beg to relieve the readers attention which must have been fatigued by such a chapter of criticism they shall now have the tale of a mendicant a specimen of city rhetoric is given in the shoeblack the country mendicants eloquence is of a totally different species chapter ix the hibernian mendicant perhaps the reader may wish to see as well as hear the petitioner at first view you might have taken him for a spaniard he was tall and if he had been a gentleman you would have said that there was an air of dignity in his figure he seemed very old yet he appeared more worn by sorrow than by time leaning upon a thick oaken stick as he took off his hat to ask for alms his white hair was blown by the wind health and long life to you said he give an old man something to help to bury him he is past his labour and cannot trouble this world long any way he held his hat towards us with nothing importunate in his manner but rather with a look of confidence in us mixed with habitual resignation his thanks were heaven bless youlong life and success to you to you and yours and may you never want a friend as i do the last words were spoken low he laid his hand upon his heart as he bowed to us and walked slowly away we called him back and upon our questioning him farther he gave the following account of himself i was bred and bornbut no matter where such a one as i was bred and born no more than where i may die and be buried i that have neither son nor daughter nor kin nor friend on the wide earth to mourn over my grave when i am laid in it as i soon must well when it pleases god to take me i shall never be missed out of this world so much as by a dog and why should ihaving never in my time done good to anybut evilwhich i have lived to repent me of manys the long day and night and ever shall whilst i have sense and reason left in my youthful days god was too good to me i had friends and a little home of my own to go toa pretty spot of land for a farm as you could see with a snug cabin and every thing complete and all to be mine for i was the only one my father and mother had and accordingly was made much of too much for i grew headstrong upon it and high and thought nothing of any man and little of any woman but one that one i surely did think of and well worth thinking of she was beauty they say is all fancy but she was a girl every man might fancy never was one more sought after she was then just in her prime and full of life and spirits but nothing light in her behaviourquite modestyet obliging she was too good for me to be thinking of no doubt but faint heart never won fair lady so i made bold to speak to rose for that was her name and after a world of pains i began to gain upon her good liking but couldnt get her to say more than that she never seen the man she should fancy so well this was a great deal from her for she was coy and proudlike as she had a good right to be and besides being young loved her little innocent pleasure and could not easy be brought to give up her sway no fault of hers but all very natural well i always considered she never would have held out so long nor have been so stiff with me had it not been for an old aunt honour of hersgod rest her soul one should not be talking ill of the dead but she was more out of my way than enough yet the cratur had no malice in her against me only meaning her childs good as she called it but mistook it and thought to make rose happy by some greater match than me counting her fondness for me which she could not but see something of childishness that she would soon be broke of now there was a party of english soldiers quartered in our town and there was a sergeant amongst them that had money and a pretty place as they said in his own country he courted rose and the aunt favoured him he and i could never relish one another at all he was a handsome portly man but very proud and looked upon me as dirt under his feet because i was an irishman and at every word would say thats an irish bull or do you hear paddys brogue at which his fellowsoldiers being all english would look greatly delighted now all this i could have taken in good part from any but him for i was not an illhumoured fellow but there was a spite in him i plainly saw against me and i could not nor would not take a word from him against me or my country especially when rose was by who did not like me the worse for having a proper spirit she little thought what would come of it whilst all this was going on her aunt honour found to object against me that i was wild and given to drink both which charges were false and malicious and i knew could come from none other than the sergeant which enraged me the more against him for speaking so mean behind my back now i knew that though the sergeant did not drink spirits he drank plenty of beer rose took it however to heart and talked very serious upon it observing she could never think to marry a man given to drink and that the sergeant was remarkably sober and staid therefore most like as her aunt honour said to make a good husband the words went straight to my heart along with roses look i said not a word but went out resolving before i slept to take an oath against spirits of all sorts for roses sweet sake that evening i fell in with some boys of the neighbours who would have had me along with them but i denied myself and them and all i would taste was one parting glass and then made my vow in the presence of the priest forswearing spirits for two years then i went straight to her house to tell her what i had done not being sensible that i was that same time a little elevated with the parting glass i had taken the first thing i noticed on going into the room was the man i least wished to see there and least looked for at this minute he was in high talk with the aunt and rose sitting on the other side of him no way strange towards him as i fancied but that was only fancy and effect of the liquor i had drunk which made me see things wrong i went up and put my head between them asking rose did she know what i had been about yes too well said she drawing back from my breath and the aunt looked at her and she at the aunt and the sergeant stopped his nose saying he had not been long enough in ireland to love the smell of whiskey i observed that was an uncivil remark in the present company and added that i had not taken a drop that night but one glass at which he sneered and said that was a bull and a blunder but no wonder as i was an irishman i replied in defence of myself and country we went on from one smart word to another and some of his soldiermen being of the company he had the laugh against me still i was vexed to see rose bear so well what i could not bear myself and the talk grew higher and higher and from talking of blunders and such trifles we got i cannot myself tell you how on to great party matters and politics and religion and i was a catholic and he a protestant and there he had the thing still against me the company seeing matters not agreeable dropped off till none were left but the sergeant and the aunt and rose and myself the aunt gave me a hint to part but i would not take it for i could not bear to go away worsted and borne down as it were by the english faction and rose by to judge the aunt was called out by one who wanted her to go to a funeral next day the englishman then let fall something about our irish howl and savages which rose herself said was uncivil she being an irish woman which he thinking only of making game on me had forgot i knocked him down telling him that it was he that was the savage to affront a lady as he got up he said that hed have the law of me if any law was to be had in ireland the law said i and you a soldier do you mean to call me coward said he this is what an english soldier must not bear with that he snatches at his arms that were beside him asking me again did i mean to call an englishman coward tell me first said i did you mean to call us irish savages thats no answer to my question says he or only an irish answer it is not the worse for that may be says i very coolly despising the man now and just took up a knife that was on the table to cut off a button that was hanging at my knee as i was opening of the knife he asks me was i going to stab at him with my irish knife and directly fixes a bayonet at me on which i seizes a musket and bayonet one of his men had left telling him i knew the use of it as well as he or any englishman and better for that i should never have gone as he did to charge it against an unarmed man you had your knife said he drawing back if i had it was not thinking of you said i throwing the knife away see im armed like yourself now fight me like a man and a soldier if you dare says i fight me if you dare says he rose calls to me to stop but we were both out of ourselves at the minute we thrust at each otherhe missed mei hit him rose ran in between us to get the musket from my hand it was loaded and went off in the struggle and the ball lodged in her body she fell and what happened next i cannot tell for the sight left my eyes and all sense forsook me when i came to myself the house was full of people going to and fro some whispering some crying and till the words reached my ears is she quite dead i could not understand where i was or what had happened i wished to forget again but could not the whole truth came upon me and yet i could not shed a tear but just pushed my way through the crowd into the inner room and up to the side of the bed there she lay stretched almost a corpsequite still her sweet eyes closed and no colour in her cheeks that had been so rosy i took hold of one of her hands that hung down and she then opens her eyes and knew me directly and smiles upon me and says it was no fault of yours take notice all of you it was no fault of his if i die but that i wont do for his sake if i can help itthat was the word she spoke i thinking from her speaking so strong that she was not badly hurt knelt down to whisper her that if my breath did smell of spirits it was the parting glass i had tasted before making the vow i had done against drink for her sake and that there was nothing i would not do for her if it would please god to spare her to me she just pressed my hand to show me she was sensible the priest came in and they forced our hands asunder and carried me away out of the room presently there was a great cry and i knew all was over here the old mans voice failed and he turned his face from us when he had somewhat recovered himself to change the course of his thoughts we asked whether he were prosecuted for his assault on the english sergeant and what became of him oh to do him justice as one should do to every one said the old man he behaved very handsome to me when i was brought to trial and told the whole truth only blamed himself more than i would have done and said it was all his fault for laughing at me and my nation more than a man could bear situated as i was they acquitted me through his means we shook hands and he hoped all would go right with me he said but nothing ever went right with me after i took little note ever after of worldly matters all belonging to me went to rack and ruin the hand of god was upon me i could not help myself nor settle mind or body to any thing i heard them say sometimes i was a little touched in my head however that might be i cannot say but at the last i found it was as good for me to give all that was left to my friends who were better able to manage and more eager for it than i and fancying a roving life would agree with me best i quitted the place taking nothing with me but resolved to walk the world and just trust to the charity of good christians or die as it should please god how i have lived so long he only knows and his will be done chapter x irish wit and eloquence wild wit invention ever new appear in high perfection amongst even the youngest inhabitants of an irish cottage the word wit amongst the lower classes of ireland means not only quickness of repartee but cleverness in action it implies invention and address with no slight mixture of cunning all which is expressed in their dialect by the single word cuteness acuteness examples will give a better notion of this than can be conveyed by any definition an irish boy a cute lad saw a train of his companions leading their cars loaded with kishes of turf coming towards his fathers cabin his father had no turf and the question was how some should be obtained to beg he was ashamed to dig he was unwillingbut his head went to work directly he took up a turf which had fallen from one of the cars the preceding day and stuck it on the top of a pole near the cabin when the cars were passing he appeared throwing turf at the mark boys cried he which of ye will hit each leader of the car as he passed could not forbear to fling a turf at the mark the turf fell at the foot of the pole and when all the cars had passed there was a heap left sufficient to reward the ingenuity of our little spartan the same cuteness which appears in youth continues and improves in old age when general v was quartered in a small town in ireland he and his lady were regularly besieged whenever they got into their carriage by an old beggarwoman who kept her post at the door assailing them daily with fresh importunities and fresh tales of distress at last the ladys charity and the generals patience were nearly exhausted but their petitioners wit was still in its pristine vigour one morning at the accustomed hour when the lady was getting into her carriage the old woman beganagh my lady success to your ladyship and success to your honours honour this morning of all days in the year for sure didnt i dream last night that her ladyship gave me a pound of tea and that your honour gave me a pound of tobacco but my good woman said the general do not you know that dreams always go by the rule of contrary do they so plase your honour rejoined the old woman then it must be your honour that will give me the tea and her ladyship that will give me the tobacco the general being of sternes opinion that a bonmot is always worth more than a pinch of snuff gave the ingenious dreamer the value of her dream innumerable instances might be quoted of the hibernian genius not merely for repartee but for what the italians call pasquinade we shall cite only one which is already so well known in ireland that we cannot be found guilty of publishing a libel over the ostentatious front of a noblemans house in dublin the owner had this motto cut in stone otium cum dignitateleisure with dignity in process of time his lordship changed his residence or since we must descend to plebeian language was committed to newgate and immediately there appeared over the front of his apartment his chosen motto as large as the life in white chalk otium cum dignitate mixed with keen satire the irish often show a sort of cool good sense and dry humour which gives not only effect but value to their impromptus of this class is the observation made by the irish hackney coachman upon seeing a man of the ton driving fourinhand down bondstreet that fellow said our observer looks like a coachman but drives like a gentleman as an instance of humour mixed with sophistry we beg the reader to recollect the popular story of the irishman who was run over by a troop of horse and miraculously escaped unhurt down upon your knees and thank god you reprobate said one of the spectators thank god for what is it for letting a troop of horse run over me in this speech there is the same sort of humour and sophistry that appears in the irishmans celebrated question what has posterity done for me that i should do so much for posterity the irish nation from the highest to the lowest in daily conversation about the ordinary affairs of life employ a superfluity of wit and metaphor which would be astonishing and unintelligible to a majority of the respectable body of english yeomen even the cutters of turf and drawers of whiskey are orators even the cottiers and gossoons speak in trope and figure ask an irish gossoon to go early in the morning on an errand and he answers ill be off at the flight of night if an irish cottager would express to his landlord that he wishes for a long lease of his land he says i would be proud to live on your honours land as long as grass grows or water runs one of our english poets has nearly the same idea as long as streams in silver mazes run or spring with annual green renews the grove without the advantages of a classical education the lower irish sometimes make similes that bear a near resemblance to those of the admired poets of antiquity a loyalist during the late rebellion was describing to us the number of the rebels who had gathered on one spot and were dispersed by the kings army rallied and were again put to flight they were said he like swarms of flies on a summers day that you brush away with your hand and still they will be returning there is a simile of homers which literally translated runs thus as the numerous troops of flies about a shepherds cottage in the spring when the milk moistens the pails such numbers of greeks stood in the field against the trojans lord kames observes that it is false taste to condemn such comparisons for the lowness of the images introduced in fact great objects cannot be degraded by comparison with small ones in these similes because the only point of resemblance is number the mind instantly perceives this and therefore requires no other species of similitude when we attempt to judge of the genius of the lower classes of the people we must take care that we are not under the influence of any prejudice of an aristocratic or literary nature but this is no easy effort of liberty agk dublin sweet jasus be wid you exclaimed a poor irishman as he stood on the deck of a vessel which was carrying him out of the bay of dublin the pathos of this poor fellow will not probably affect delicate sensibility because he says wid instead of with and jasus instead of jesus adam smith is certainly right in his theory that the sufferings of those in exalted stations have generally most power to command our sympathy the very same sentiment of sorrow at leaving his country which was expressed so awkwardly by the poor irishman appears to every reader of taste exquisitely pathetic from the lips of mary queen of scots farewell france farewell beloved country which i shall never more behold in anger as well as in sorrow the irishman is eloquent a gentleman who was lately riding through the county of in ireland to canvass called to ask a vote from a poor man who was planting willows in a little garden by the road side you have a vote my good sir i am told said the candidate in an insinuating tone the poor man stuck the willow which he had in his hand into the ground and with a deliberate pace came towards the candidate to parley with him please your honour said he gravely i have a vote and i have not a vote how can that be i will tell you sir said he leaning or rather lying down slowly upon the back of the ditch facing the road so that the gentleman who was on horseback could see only his head and arms sir said he out of this little garden with my five acres of land and my own labour i once had a freehold but i have been robbed of my freehold and who do you think has robbed me why that man pointing to his landlords steward who stood beside the candidate with my own hands i sowed my own ground with oats and a fine crop i expectedbut i never reaped that crop not a bushel no nor half a bushel did i ever see for into my little place comes this man with i dont know how many more with their shovels and their barrows and their horses and their cars and to work they fell and they ran a road straight through the best part of my land turning all to heaps of rubbish and a bad road it was and a bad time of year to make it but where was i when he did this not where i am now said the orator raising himself up and standing firm not as you see me now but lying on my back in my bed in a fever when i got up i was not able to make my rent out of my land besides myself i had my five children to support i sold my clothes and have never been able to buy any since but such as a recruit could sell who was in haste to get into regimentalssuch clothes as these said he looking down at his black rags soon i had nothing to eat but thats not all i am a weaver sir for my rent they seized my two looms then i had nothing to do but of all this i do not complain there was an election some time ago in this county and a man rode up to me in this garden as you do now and asked me for my vote but i refused him for i was steady to my landlord the gentleman observed i was a poor man and asked if i wanted for nothing but all did not signify so he rode on gently and at the corner of the road within view of my garden i saw him drop a purse and i knew by his looking at me it was on purpose for me to pick it up after a while he came back thinking to be sure i had taken up the purse and had changed my mind but he found his purse where he left it my landlord knew all this and he promised to see justice done me but he forgot then as for the candidates lady before the election nothing was too fairspeaking for me but afterward in my distress when i applied to her to get me a loom which she could have had from the linen board by only asking for it her answer to me was i dont know that i shall ever want a vote again in the county now sir continued he when justice is done to me and no sooner i shall be glad to assist my landlord or his friend i know who you are sir very well you bear a good character success to you but i have no vote to give to you or any man if i were to attempt to make you any amends for what you have suffered replied the candidate i should do you an injury it would be said that i had bribed you but i will repeat your story where it will meet with attention i cannot however tell it so well as you have told it no sir was his answer for you cannot feel it as i do this is almost in terms the conclusion of popes epistle from eloisa to abelard he best can paint them who shall feel them most in objurgation and pathetic remonstrancing eloquence the females of the lower class in ireland are not inferior to the men a thin tall woman wrapped in a long cloak the hood of which was drawn over her head and shaded her pale face came to a gentleman to complain of the cruelty of her landlord he is the most hardhearted man alive so he is sir said she he has just seized all i have which god knows is little enough and has driven my cow to pound the only cow i have and only dependence i have for a drop of milk to drink and the cow itself too standing there starving in the pound for not a wisp of hay would he give to cow or christian to save their lives if it was ever so and the rent for which he is driving me please your honour has not been due but one week a hard master he is but these middle men are all so one and all oh if it had been but my lot to be a tenant to a gentleman born like your honour who is the poor mans friend and the orphans and the widowsthe friend of them that have none other long life to you and long may you live to reign over us would you but speak three words to my landlord to let my cow out of pound and give me a fortnights time that i might see and fatten her to sell against the fair i could pay him then all honestly and not be racked entirely and he would be ashamed to refuse your honour and afraid to disoblige the like of you or get your illwill may the blessing of heaven be upon you if youll just send and speak to him three words for the poor woman and widow that has none other to speak for her in the wide world moved by this lamentable story the effect of which the womans whole miserable appearance corroborated and heightened the gentleman sent immediately for her hardhearted landlord the landlord appeared not a gentleman not a rich man as the term landlord might denote but a stout square stubbed thicklimbed greyeyed man who seemed to have come smoking hot from hard labour the gentleman repeated the charge made against him by the poor widow and mildly remonstrated on his cruelty the man heard all that was said with a calm but unmoved countenance and now have you done said he turning to the woman who had recommenced her lamentations look at her standing there sir its easy for her to put on her long cloak and to tell her long story and to make her poor mouth to your honour but if you are willing to hear ill tell you what she is and what i am she is one that has none but herself in this world to provide for she is one that is able to afford herself a glass of whiskey when she pleases and she pleases it often she is one that never denies herself the bit of staggering bob when in season she is one that has a snug house well thatched to live in all the year round and nothing to do or nothing that she does and this is the way of her life and this is what she is and what am i i am the father of eight children and i have a wife and myself to provide for i am a man that is at hard labour of one kind or another from sunrise to sunset the straw that thatched the house she lives in i brought two miles on my back the walls of the house she lives in i built with my own hands i did the same by five other houses and they are all sound and dry and good to live in summer or winter i set them for rent to put bread into my childrens mouth and after all i cannot get it and to support my eight children and my wife and myself what have i in this world cried he striding suddenly with colossal firmness upon his sturdy legs and raising to heaven arms which looked like foreshortenings of the limbs of hercules what have i in this wide world but these four bones no provocation could have worked up a phlegmatic english countryman to this pitch of eloquence he never suffers his anger to evaporate in idle figures of speech it is always concentrated in a few words which he repeats in reply to every argument persuasive or invective that can be employed to irritate or to assuage his wrath we recollect having once been present at a scene between an english gentleman and a churchwarden whose feelings were grievously hurt by the disturbance that had been given to certain bones in levelling a wall which separated the churchyard from the pleasure ground of the lord of the manor the bones belonged as the churchwarden believed or averred to his great great grandmother though how they were identified it might be difficult to explain to an indifferent judge yet we are to suppose that the confirmation of the suspicion was strong and satisfactory to the party concerned the pious great great grandsons feelings were all in arms but indignation did not inspire him with a single poetic idea or expression in his eloquence indeed there was the principal requisite action in reply to all that could be said he repeatedly struck his long oak stick perpendicularly upon the floor and reiterated these words its death sir death by the law its sacrilege sir sacrilege by act of parliament its death sir death by the law and the law ill have of him for its lawful to have the law this was the whole range of his ideas even when the passions had tumbled them all out of their dormitories innumerable fresh instances of irish eloquence and wit crowd upon our recollection but we forbear the examples we have cited are taken from real life and given without alteration or embellishment chapter xi the brogue having proved by a perfect syllogism that the irish must blunder we might rest satisfied with our labours but there are minds of so perverse a sort that they will not yield their understandings to the torturing power of syllogism it may be waste of time to address ourselves to persons of such a cast we shall therefore change our ground and adapt our arguments to the level of vulgar capacities much of the comic effect of irish bulls or of such speeches as are mistaken for bulls has depended upon the tone or brogue as it is called with which they are uttered the first irish blunders that we hear are made or repeated in this peculiar tone and afterward from the power of association whenever we hear the tone we expect the blunder now there is little danger that the irish should be cured of their brogue and consequently there is no great reason to apprehend that we should cease to think or call them blunderers of the powerful effect of any peculiarity of pronunciation to prepossess the mind against the speaker nay even to excite dislike amounting to antipathy we have an instance attested by an eyewitness or rather an earwitness in the year says the rev james adams i attended a public disputation in a foreign university when at least frenchmen literally hissed a grave and learned english doctor not by way of insult but irresistibly provoked by the quaintness of the repetition of sh the thesis was the concurrence of god in actionibus viciosis the whole hall resounded with the hissing cry of sh and its continual occurrence in actio actione viciosa c it is curious that shibboleth should so long continue a criterion among nations what must have been the degree of irritation that could so far get the better of the politeness of frenchmen as to make them hiss in the days of lancien regime the dread of being the object of that species of antipathy or ridicule which is excited by unfashionable peculiarity of accent has induced many of the misguided natives of ireland to affect what they imagine to be the english pronunciation they are seldom successful in this attempt for they generally overdo the business we are told by theophrastus that a barbarian who had taken some pains to attain the true attic dialect was discovered to be a foreigner by his speaking the attic dialect with a greater degree of precision and purity than was usual amongst the athenians themselves to avoid the imputation of committing barbarisms people sometimes run into solecisms which are yet more ridiculous affectation is always more ridiculous than ignorance there are irish ladies who ashamed of their country betray themselves by mincing out their abjuration by calling tables teebles and chairs cheers to such renegadoes we prefer the honest quixotism of a modern champion for the scottish accent who boldly asserted that the broad dialect rises above reproach scorn and laughter enters the lists as he says of himself in tartan dress and armour and throws down the gauntlet to the most prejudiced antagonist how weak is prejudice pursues this patriotic enthusiast the sight of the highland kelt the flowing plaid the buskined leg provokes my antagonist to laugh is this dress ridiculous in the eyes of reason and common sense no nor is the dialect of speech both are characteristic and national distinctions the arguments of general vindication continues he rise powerful before my sight like the highland bands in full array a louder strain of apologetic speech swells my words what if it should rise high as the unconquered summits of scotias hills and call back with voice sweet as caledonian song the days of ancient scotish heroes or attempt the powerful speech of the latian orator or his of greece the subject methinks would well accord with the attempt cupidum scotia optima vires deficiunt i leave this to the king of songs dunbar and dunkeld douglas in virgilian strains and later poets ramsay ferguson and burns awake from your graves you have already immortalized the scotish dialect in raptured melody lend me your golden target and wellpointed spear that i might victoriously pursue to the extremity of south britain reproachful ignorance and scorn still lurking there let impartial candour seize their usurped throne great then is the birth of this national dialect c so far so good we have some sympathy with the rhapsodist whose enthusiasm kindles at the names of allan ramsay and of burns nay we are willing to hear with a grain of allowance that the manly eloquence of the scotish bar affords a singular pleasure to the candid english hearer and gives merit and dignity to the noble speakers who retain so much of their own dialect and tempered propriety of english sounds that they may be emphatically termed british orators but we confess that we lose our patient decorum and are almost provoked to laughter when our philological quixote seriously sets about to prove that adam and eve spoke broad scotch in paradise how angry has this grave patriot reason to be with his ingenious countryman beattie the celebrated champion of truth who acknowledges that he never could when a boy or man look at a certain translation of ajaxs speech into one of the vulgar scotch dialects without laughing we shall now with boldness similar to that of the scotch champion try the risible muscles of our english reader we are not indeed inclined to go quite such lengths as he has gone he insists that the scotch dialect ought to be adopted all over england we are only going candidly to confess that we think the irish in general speak better english than is commonly spoken by the natives of england to limit this proposition so as to make it appear less absurd we should observe that we allude to the lower classes of the people in both countries in some counties in ireland a few of the poorest labourers and cottagers do not understand english they speak only irish as in wales there are vast numbers who speak only welsh but amongst those who speak english we find fewer vulgarisms than amongst the same rank of persons in england the english which they speak is chiefly such as has been traditional in their families from the time of the early settlers in the island during the reign of elizabeth and the reign of shakspeare numbers of english migrated to ireland and whoever attends to the phraseology of the lower irish may at this day hear many of the phrases and expressions used by shakspeare their vocabulary has been preserved nearly in its pristine purity since that time because they have not had intercourse with those counties in england which have made for themselves a jargon unlike to any language under heaven the irish brogue is a great and shameful defect but it does not render the english language absolutely unintelligible there are but a few variations of the brogue such as the long and the short the thady brogue and paddy brogue which differ much in tone and but little in phraseology but in england almost all of our fiftytwo counties have peculiar vulgarisms dialects and brogues unintelligible to their neighbours herodotus tells us that some of the nations of greece though they used the same language spoke it so differently that they could not understand each others conversation this is literally the case at present between the provincial inhabitants of remote parts of england indeed the language peculiar to the metropolis or the cockney dialect is proverbially ridiculous the londoners who look down with contempt upon all that have not been bred and born within the sound of bow talk with unconscious absurdity of weal and winegar and vine and vindors and idears and ask you ow you do and ave ye bin taking the hair in yde park and as your orse ad any hoats c aspirating always where they should not and never aspirating where they should the zummerzetzheer dialect full of broad oos and eternal zeds supplies neverfailing laughter when brought upon the stage even a cockney audience relishes the broad pronunciation of john moody in the journey to london or of sim in wild oats the cant of suffolk the vulgarisms of shropshire the uncouth phraseology of the three ridings of yorkshire amaze and bewilder foreigners who perhaps imagine that they do not understand english when they are in company with those who cannot speak it the patois of languedoc and champagne such as mein fis sest ai bai via mon fils cest un beau veau exercises it is true the ingenuity of travellers and renders many scenes of moliere and marivaux difficult if not unintelligible to those who have never resided in the french provinces but no french patois is more unintelligible than the following specimen of tummas and mearys lancashire dialogue thomas whau but i startit up to goa to th tits on slurrd deawn to th

unintelligible chapter xii bath coach conversation in one of the coaches which travel between bath and london an irish a scotch and an english gentleman happened to be passengers they were well informed and wellbred had seen the world had lived in good company and were consequently superior to local and national prejudice as their conversation was illustrative of our subject we shall make no apology for relating it we pass the usual preliminary compliments and the observations upon the weather and the roads the irish gentleman first started a more interesting subjectthe union its probable advantages and disadvantages were fully discussed and at last the irishman said whatever our political opinions may be there is one wish in which we shall all agree that the union may make us better acquainted with one another it is surprising said the englishman how ignorant we english in general are of ireland to be sure we do not now as in the times of bacon and spenser believe that wild irishmen have wings nor do we all of us give credit to mr twisss assertion that if you look at an irish lady she answers port if you please scotchmanthat traveller seems to be almost as liberal as he who defined oatsfood for horses in england and for men in scotland such illiberal notions die away of themselves irishmanor they are contradicted by more liberal travellers i am sure my country has great obligations to the gallant english and scotch military not only for so readily assisting to defend and quiet us but for spreading in england a juster notion of ireland within these few months i suppose more real knowledge of the state and manners of that kingdom has been diffused in england by their means than had been obtained during a whole century scotchmanindeed i do not recollect having read any author of note who has given me a notion of ireland since spenser and davies except arthur young englishmanwhat little knowledge i have of ireland has been drawn more from observation than from books i remember when i first went over there i did not expect to see twenty trees in the whole island i imagined that i should have nothing to drink but whiskey that i should have nothing to eat but potatoes that i should sleep in mudwalled cabins that i should when awake hear nothing but the irish howl the irish brogue irish answers and irish bulls and that if i smiled at any of these things a hundred pistols would fly from their holsters to give or demand satisfaction but experience taught me better things i found that the stories i had heard were tales of other times their hospitality indeed continues to this day irishmanit does i believe but of later days as we have been honoured with the visits of a greater number of foreigners our hospitality has become less extravagant englishmannot less agreeable irish hospitality i speak from experience does not now consist merely in pushing about the bottle the irish are convivial but their conviviality is seasoned with wit and humour they have plenty of good conversation as well as good cheer for their guests and they not only have wit themselves but they love it in others they can take as well as give a joke i never lived with a more goodhumoured generous openhearted people than the irish irishmani wish englishmen in general were half as partial to poor ireland as you are sir englishmanor rather you wish that they knew the country as well and then they would do it as much justice irishmanyou do it something more than justice i fear there are little peculiarities in my countrymen which will long be justly the subject of ridicule in england scotchmannot among wellbred and wellinformed people those who have seen or read of great varieties of customs and manners are never apt to laugh at all that may differ from their own as the sensible author of the government of the tongue says halfwitted people are always the bitterest revilers irishmanyou are very indulgent gentlemen but in spite of all your politeness you must allow or at least i must confess that there are little defects in the irish government of the tongue at which even wholewitted people must laugh scotchmanthe welleducated people in all countries i believe escape the particular accent and avoid the idiom that are characteristic of the vulgar irishmanbut even when we escape irish brogue we cannot escape irish bulls englishmanyou need not say irish bulls with such emphasis for bulls are not peculiar to ireland i have been informed by a person of unquestionable authority that there is a town in germany hirschau in the upper palatinate where the inhabitants are famous for making bulls irishmani am truly glad to hear we have companions in disgrace numbers certainly lessen the effect of ridicule as well as of shame but after all the irish idiom is peculiarly unfortunate for it leads perpetually to blunder scotchmani have heard the same remarked of the hebrew i am told that the hebrew and irish idiom are much alike irishman laughingthat is a great comfort to us certainly particularly to those amongst us who are fond of tracing our origin up to the remotest antiquity but still there are many who would willingly give up the honour of this high alliance to avoid its inconveniences for my own part if i could ensure myself and my countrymen from all future danger of making bulls and blunders i would this instant give up all hebrew roots and even the ogham character itself i would renounce to make assurance doubly sure englishmanto make assurance doubly sure now there is an example in our great shakspeare of what i have often observed that we english allow our poets and ourselves a licence of speech that we deny to our hibernian neighbours if an irishman instead of shakspeare had talked of making assurance doubly sure we should have asked how that could be the vulgar in england are too apt to catch at every slip of the tongue made by irishmen i remember once being present when an irish nobleman of talents and literature was actually hissed from the hustings at a middlesex election because in his speech he happened to say we have laid the root to the axe of the tree of liberty instead of we have laid the axe to the root of the tree scotchmana lapsus linguae that might have been made by the greatest orators ancient or modern by cicero or chatham by burke or by the fluent murray englishmanupon another occasion i have heard that an irish orator was silenced with inextinguishable laughter merely for saying i am sorry to hear my honourable friend stand mute scotchmanif i am not mistaken that very same irish orator made an allusion at which no one could laugh the protection said he which britain affords to ireland in the day of adversity is like that which the oak affords to the ignorant countryman who flies to it for shelter in the storm it draws down upon his head the lightning of heaven may be i do not repeat the words exactly but i could not forget the idea englishmani would with all my heart bear the ridicule of a hundred blunders for the honour of having made such a simile after all his saying i am sorry to hear my honourable friend stand mute if it be a bull is justified by homer one of the charms in the cestus of venus is silence that speaks and eloquence of eyes scotchmansilence that speaks sir is i am afraid an english not a grecian charm it is not in the greek it is one of those beautiful liberties which mr pope has taken with his original but silence that speaks can be found in france as well as in england voltaire in his chefdoeuvre his oedipus makes jocasta say tout parle centre nous jusqua notre silence englishmanand in our own milton samson agonistes makes as good indeed a better bull for he not only makes the mute speak but speak loud the deeds themselves though mute spoke loud the doer and in paradise lost we have to speak in fashionable language two famous bulls talking of satan milton says god and his son except created thing nought valued he nor shunnd and speaking of adam and eve and their sons and daughters he confounds them all together in a manner for which any irishman would have been laughed to scorn adam the goodliest man of men since born his sons the fairest of her daughters eve yet addison who notices these blunders calls them only little blemishes scotchmanhe does so and he quotes horace who tells us we should impute such venial errors to a pardonable inadvertency and as i recollect addison makes another very just remark that the ancients who were actuated by a spirit of candour not of cavilling invented a variety of figures of speech on purpose to palliate little errors of this nature really gentlemen interrupted the hibernian who had sat all this time in silence that spoke his grateful sense of the politeness of his companions you will put the finishing stroke to my obligations to you if you will prove that the ancient figures of speech were invented to palliate irish blunders englishmanno matter for what purpose they were invented if we can make so good a use of them we shall be satisfied especially if you are pleased i will however leave the burden of the proof upon my friend here who has detected me already in quoting from popes iliad instead of homers i am sure he will manage the ancient figures of rhetoric better than i should however if i can fight behind his shield i shall not shun the combat scotchmani stand corrected for quoting greek now i will not go to longinus for my tropes and figures i have just met with a little book on the subject which i put into my pocket today intending to finish it on my journey but i have been better employed he drew from his pocket a book called deinology or the union of reason and elegance look said he look at this long list of tropes and figures amongst them we could find apologies for every species of irish bulls but in mercy i will select from the twenty chief and most moving figures of speech only the oxymoron as it is a favourite with irish orators in the oxymoron contradictions meet to reconcile these irish ingenuity delights i will further spare four out of the seven figures of less note emphasis enallage and the hysteron proteron you must have because emphasis graces irish diction enallage unbinds it from strict grammatical fetters and hysteron proteron allows it sometimes to put the cart before the horse of the eleven grammatical figures ireland delights chiefly in the antimeria or changing one part of speech for another and in the ellipsis or defect of the remaining long list of figures the irish are particularly disposed to the epizeuxis as indeed indeedat all at all and antanaclasis or double meaning the tautotes or repetition of the same thing is i think full as common amongst the english the hyperbole and catachresis are so nearly related to a bull that i shall dwell upon them with pleasure you must listen to the definition of a catachresisa catachresis is the boldest of any trope necessity makes it borrow and employ an expression or term contrary to the thing it means to express upon my word this is something like a description of an irish bull interrupted the hibernian scotchmanfor instance it has been said equitare in arundine longa to ride on horseback on a stick reason condemns the contradiction but necessity has allowed it and use has made it intelligible the same trope is employed in the following metaphorical expressionthe seeds of the gospel have been watered by the blood of the martyrs englishmanthat does seem an absurdity i grant but you know great orators trample on impossibilities scotchmanand great poets get the letter of them you recollect shakspeare says now bid me run and i will strive with things impossible yea get the better of them englishmanand corneille in the cid i believe makes his hero a compliment upon his having performed impossibilitiesvos mains seules ont le droit de vaincre un invincible scotchmanay that would be a bull in an irishman but it is only an hyperbole in a frenchman irishmanindeed this line of corneilles outhyperboles the hyperbole considered in any but a prophetic light as a prophecy it exactly foretels the taking of bonapartes invincible standard by the glorious fortysecond regiment of the british your hands alone have a right to vanquish the invincible bytheby the phrase ont le droit cannot i believe be literally translated into english but the scotch and irish have a right translates it exactly but do not let me interrupt my countrys defence gentlemen i am heartily glad to find irish blunderers may shelter themselves in such good company in the ancient sanctuary of the hyperbole but i am afraid you must deny admittance to the poor mason who said this house will stand as long as the world and longer scotchmanwhy should we shut the gates of mercy upon him when we pardon his betters for more flagrant sins for instance mr pope who in his essay on criticism makes a blunder or rather uses an hyperbole stronger than that of your poor irish mason when first young maro in his noble mind a work toutlast immortal rome designd and to give you a more modern case i lately heard an english shopkeeper say to a lady in recommendation of his goods maam it will wear for ever and make you a petticoat afterwards irishmanupon my word i did not think you could have found a match for the mason but what will you say to my countryman who on meeting an acquaintance accosted him with this ambiguous complimentwhen first i saw you i thought it was you but now i see it is your brother scotchmanif i were not afraid you would take me for a pedant i should quote a sentence from cicero that is not far behind this blunder irishmani can take you for nothing but a friend pray let us have the latin scotchmanit is one of ciceros compliments to caesarqui cum ipse imperator in toto imperio populi romani unus esset esse me alterum passus est perhaps continued the scotchman my way of pronouncing latin sounds strangely to you gentlemen irishmanand perhaps ours would be unintelligible to cicero himself if he were to overhear us i fancy we are all so far from right that we need not dispute about degrees of wrong the coach stopped at this instant and the conversation was interrupted chapter xiii bath coach conversation after our travellers had dined the conversation was renewed by the english gentlemans repeating goldsmiths celebrated lines on burke who too deep for his hearers still went on refining and thought of convincing whilst they thought of dining in short twas his fate unemployed or in place sir to eat mutton cold and cut blocks with a razor what humour and wit there are in that poem of goldsmiths and where is there any thing equal to his traveller irishmanyet this is the man who used to be the butt of the company for his bulls englishmanno not for his bulls but for blurting out opinions in conversation that could not stand the test of dr johnsons critical powers but what would become of the freedom of wit and humour if every word that came out of our mouths were subject to the tax of a professed critics censure or if every sentence were to undergo a logical examination it would be well for englishmen if they were a little more inclined like your openhearted countrymen to blurt out their opinions freely scotchmani cannot forgive dr johnson for calling goldsmith an inspired idiot i confess i see no idiotism but much inspiration in his works irishmanbut we must remember that if johnson did laugh at goldsmith he would let no one else laugh at him and he was his most sincere and active friend the world would perhaps never have seen the vicar of wakefield if johnson had not recommended it to a bookseller and goldsmith might have died in jail if the doctor had not got him a hundred pounds for it when poor goldsmith did not know it was worth a shilling when we recollect this we must forgive the doctor for calling him in jest an inspired idiot scotchmanespecially as goldsmith has wit enough to bear him up against a thousand such jests englishmanit is curious to observe how nearly wit and absurdity are allied we may forgive the genius of ireland if he sometimes leap his light courser oer the bounds of taste even english genius is not always to be restrained within the strict limits of common sense for instance young is witty when he says how would a miser startle to be told of such a wonder as insolvent gold but johnson is i am afraid absurd when he says turn from the glittering bribe your scornful eye nor sell for gold what gold can never buy one case to be sure must be excepted said the irishman a patriot may sell his reputation and the purchaser get nothing by it but gentlemen i have just recollected an example of an irish bull in which are all the happy requisites incongruity confusion and laughable confusion both in thought and expression when sir richard steele was asked how it happened that his countrymen made so many bulls he replied it is the effect of climate sir if an englishman were born in ireland he would make as many scotchmanthis is an excellent bull i allow but i think i can match it englishmanand if he can you will allow yourself to be fairly vanquished irishmanmost willingly scotchmanthen i shall owe my victory to our friend dr johnson the leviathan of english literature in his celebrated preface to shakspeare he says that he has not only shown human nature as it acts in real exigencies but as it would be found in situations to which it cannot be exposed these are his own words i think i remember them accurately the english gentleman smiled and our hibernian acknowledged that the scotchman had fairly gained the victory my friends added he as i cannot pretend to be convinced against my will i certainly am not of the same opinion still but staythere are such things as practical bulls did you never hear of the irishman who ordered a painter to draw his picture and to represent him standing behind a tree englishmanno but i have heard the very same story told of an englishman the dealers in good jokes give them first to one nation and then to another first to one celebrated character and then to another as it suits the demand and fashion of the day just as our printsellers with a few touches change the portrait of general washington into the head of the king of france and a capital print of sir joshua reynolds into a striking likeness of the monster but i can give you an instance of a practical bull that is not only indisputably english but was made by one of the greatest men that england ever produced sir isaac newton who after he had made a large hole in his studydoor for his cat to creep through made a small hole beside it for the kitten you will acknowledge sir that this is a good practical bull pardon me said the hibernian we have still some miles further to go and if you will give me leave i will relate an hibernian tale which exemplifies some of the opinions held in this conversation the scotch and english gentlemen begged to hear the story and he began in the following manner chapter xiv the irish incognito sir john bull was a native of ireland bred and born in the city of cork his real name was phelim omooney and he was by profession a stocah or walking gentleman that is a person who is too proud to earn his bread and too poor to have bread without earning it he had always been told that none of his ancestors had ever been in trade or business of any kind and he resolved when a boy never to demean himself and family as his elder brother had done by becoming a rich merchant when he grew up to be a young man he kept this spirited resolution as long as he had a relation or friend in the world who would let him hang upon them but when he was shaken off by all what could he do but go into business he chose the most genteel however he became a wine merchant im only a wine merchant said he to himself and that is next door to being nothing at all his brother furnished his cellars and mr phelim omooney upon the strength of the wine that he had in his cellars and of the money he expected to make of it immediately married a wife set up a gig and gave excellent dinners to men who were ten times richer than he even ever expected to be in return for these excellent dinners his new friends bought all their wine from mr omooney and never paid for it he lived upon credit himself and gave all his friends credit till he became a bankrupt then nobody came to dine with him and every body found out that he had been very imprudent and he was obliged to sell his gig but not before it had broken his wifes neck so that when accounts came to be finally settled he was not much worse than when he began the world the loss falling upon his creditors and he being as he observed free to begin life again with the advantage of being once more a bachelor he was such a goodnatured freehearted fellow that every body liked him even his creditors his wifes relations made up the sum of five hundred pounds for him and his brother offered to take him into his firm as partner but omooney preferred he said going to try or rather to make his fortune in england as he did not doubt but he should by marriage being as he did not scruple to acknowledge a personable cleverlooking man and a great favourite with the sex my last wife i married for love my next i expect will do the same by me and of course the money must come on her side this time said our hero half jesting half in earnest his elder and wiser brother the merchant whom he still held in more than sufficient contempt ventured to hint some slight objections to this scheme of phelims seeking fortune in england he observed that so many had gone upon this plan already that there was rather a prejudice in england against irish adventurers this could not affect him any ways phelim replied because he did not mean to appear in england as an irishman at all how then as an englishman since that is most agreeable how can that be who should hinder it his brother hesitatingly said yourself myselfwhat part of myself is it my tongueyoull acknowledge brother that i do not speak with the brogue it was true that phelim did not speak with any irish brogue his mother was an english woman and he had lived much with english officers in cork and he had studied and imitated their manner of speaking so successfully that no one merely by his accent could have guessed that he was an irishman hey brother i say continued phelim in a triumphant english tone i never was taken for an irishman in my life colonel broadman told me the other day i spoke english better than the english themselves that he should take me for an englishman in any part of the known world the moment i opened my lips you must allow that not the smallest particle of brogue is discernible on my tongue his brother allowed that not the smallest particle of brogue was to be discerned upon phelims tongue but feared that some irish idiom might be perceived in his conversation and then the name of omooney oh as to that i need not trouble an act of parliament or even a kings letter just to change my name for a season at the worst i can travel and appear incognito always no only just till im upon good terms with the lady mrs phelim omooney that is to be god willing never fear nor shake your head brother you men of business are out of this line and not proper judges i beg your pardon for saying so but as you are my own brother and nobody by youll excuse me his brother did excuse him but continued silent for some minutes he was pondering upon the means of persuading phelim to give up this scheme i would lay you any wager my dear phelim said he that you could not continue four days in england incognito done cried phelim done for a hundred pounds done for a thousand pounds and welcome but if you lose how will you pay faith thats the last thing i thought of being sure of winning then you will not object to any mode of payment i shall propose none only remembering always that i was a bankrupt last week and shall be little better till im married but then ill pay you honestly if i lose no if you lose i must be paid before that time my good sir said his brother laughing my bet is thisi will lay you one hundred guineas that you do not remain four days in england incognito be upon honour with me and promise that if you lose you will instead of laying down a hundred guineas come back immediately and settle quietly again to business the word business was always odious to our heros proud ears but he thought himself so secure of winning his wager that he willingly bound himself in a penalty which he believed would never become due and his generous brother at parting made the bet still more favourable by allowing that phelim should not be deemed the loser unless he was in the course of the first four days after he touched english ground detected eight times in being an irishman eight times cried phelim good bye to a hundred guineas brother you may say you may say echoed his brother and so they parted mr phelim omooney the next morning sailed from cork harbour with a prosperous gale and with a confidence in his own success which supplied the place of auspicious omens he embarked at cork to go by long sea to london and was driven into deal where julius caesar once landed before him and with the same resolution to see and conquer it was early in the morning having been very seasick he was impatient as soon as he got into the inn for his breakfast he was shown into a room where three ladies were waiting to go by the stage his air of easy confidence was the best possible introduction would any of the company choose eggs said the waiter i never touch an egg for my share said omooney carelessly he knew that it was supposed to be an irish custom to eat eggs at breakfast and when the malicious waiter afterwards set a plate full of eggs in salt upon the table our hero magnanimously abstained from them he even laughed heartily at a story told by one of the ladies of an hibernian at buxton who declared that no english hen ever laid a fresh egg omooney got through breakfast much to his own satisfaction and to that of the ladies whom he had taken a proper occasion to call the three graces and whom he had informed that he was an old baronet of an english family and that his name was sir john bull the youngest of the graces civilly observed that whatever else he might be she should never have taken him for an old baronet the lady who made this speech was pretty but omooney had penetration enough to discover in the course of the conversation that she and her companions were far from being divinities his three graces were a greengrocers wife a tallowchandlers widow and a milliner when he found that these ladies were likely to be his companions if he were to travel in the coach he changed his plan and ordered a postchaise and four omooney was not in danger of making any vulgar irish blunders in paying his bill at an inn no landlord or waiter could have suspected him especially as he always left them to settle the matter first and then looked over the bill and money with a careless gentility saying very right or very well sir wisely calculating that it was better to lose a few shillings on the road than to lose a hundred pounds by the risk of hibernian miscalculation whilst the chaise was getting ready he went to the customhouse to look after his baggage he found a redhot countryman of his own there roaring about four and fourpence and fighting the battle of his trunks in which he was ready to make affidavit there was not nor never had been any thing contraband and when the customhouse officer replied by pulling out of one of them a piece of irish poplin the hibernian fell immediately upon the union which he swore was disunion as the customhouse officers managed it sir john bull appeared to much advantage all this time maintaining a dignified silence from his quiet appearance and deportment the customhouse officers took it for granted that he was an englishman he was in no hurry he begged that gentlemans business might be settled first he would wait the officers leisure and as he spoke he played so dexterously with halfaguinea between his fingers as to make it visible only where he wished the customhouse officer was his humble servant immediately but the hibernian would have been his enemy if he had not conciliated him by observing that even englishmen must allow there was something very like a bull in professing to make a complete identification of the two kingdoms whilst at the same time certain regulations continued in full force to divide the countries by art even more than the british channel does by nature sir john talked so plausibly and above all so candidly and coolly on irish and english politics that the customhouse officer conversed with him for a quarter of an hour without guessing of what country he was till in an unlucky moment phelims heart got the better of his head joining in the praises bestowed by all parties on the conduct of a distinguished patriot of his country he in the height of his enthusiasm inadvertently called him the speaker the speaker said the officer yes the speakerour speaker cried phelim with exultation he was not aware how he had betrayed himself till the officer smiled and said sir i really never should have found out that you were an irishman but from the manner in which you named your countryman who is as highly thought of by all parties in this country as in yours your enthusiasm does honour to your heart and to my head im sure said our hero laughing with the best grace imaginable well i am glad you have found me out in this manner though i lose the eighth part of a bet of a hundred guineas by it he explained the wager and begged the customhouse officer to keep his secret which he promised to do faithfully and assured him that he should be happy to do any thing in his power to serve him whilst he was uttering these last words there came in a snug but softlooking englishman who opining from the words happy to do any thing in my power to serve you that omooney was a friend of the customhouse officers and encouraged by something affable and goodnatured in our heros countenance crept up to him and whispered a requestcould you tell a body sir how to get out of the customhouse a very valuable box of sevre china that has been laying in the customhouse three weeks and which i was commissioned to get out if i could and bring up to town for a lady as a lady was in the case omooneys gallantry instantly made his goodnature effective the box of sevre china was produced and opened only as a matter of form and only as a matter of curiosity its contents were examineda beautiful set of sevre china and a pendule said to have belonged to m egalite these things must be intended said phelim for some lady of superior taste or fortune as phelim was a proficient in the socratic art of putting judicious interrogatories he was soon happily master of the principal points it concerned him to know he learnt that the lady was richa spinsterof full ageat her own disposalliving with a single female companion at blackheathfurnishing a house there in a superior stylehad two carriagesher christian name maryher surname sharperson omooney by the blessing of god it shall soon he thought phelim he politely offered the englishman a place in his chaise for himself and sevre china as it was for a lady and would run great hazard in the stage which besides was full mr queasy for that was our soft englishmans name was astonished by our heros condescension and affability especially as he heard him called sir john he bowed sundry times as low as the fear of losing his wig would permit and accepted the polite offer with many thanks for himself and the lady concerned sir john bulls chaise and four was soon ready and queasy seated in the corner of it and the sevre china safely stowed between his knees captain murray a scotch officer was standing at the inndoor with his eyes intently fixed on the letters that were worked in nails on the top of sir johns trunk the letters were p om our hero whose eyes were at least as quick as the scotchmans was alarmed lest this should lead to a second detection he called instantly with his usual presence of mind to the ostler and desired him to uncord that trunk as it was not to go with him raising his voice loud enough for all the yard to hear he addedit is not mine at all it belongs to my friend mr omooney let it be sent after me at leisure by the waggon as directed to the care of sir john bull our hero was now giving his invention a prodigious quantity of superfluous trouble and upon this occasion as upon most others he was more in danger from excess than deficiency of ingenuity he was like the man in the fairy tale who was obliged to tie his legs lest he should outrun the object of which he was in pursuit the scotch officer though his eyes were fixed on the letters pos had none of the suspicions which phelim was counteracting he was only considering how he could ask for the third place in sir johns chaise during the next stage as he was in great haste to get to town upon particular business and there were no other horses at the inn when he heard that the heavy baggage was to go by the waggon he took courage and made his request it was instantly granted by the goodnatured hibernian who showed as much hospitality about his chaise as if it had been his house away they drove as fast as they could fresh dangers awaited him at the next inn he left his hat upon the table in the hall whilst he went into the parlour and when he returned he heard some person inquiring what irish gentleman was there our hero was terribly alarmed for he saw that his hat was in the inquirers hand and he recollected that the name of phelim omooney was written in it this the inquisitive gentleman did not see for it was written in no very legible characters on the leather withinside of the front but f guest hatter damestreet dublin was a printed advertisement that could not be mistaken and that was pasted within the crown omooneys presence of mind did not forsake him upon this emergency my good sir said he turning to queasy who without hearing one word of what was passing was coming out of the parlour with his own hat and gloves in his hand my good sir continued he loading him with parcels will you have the goodness to see these put into my carriage ill take care of your hat and gloves added omooney in a low voice queasy surrendered his hat and gloves instantly unknowing wherefore then squeezed forward with his load through the crowd cryingwaiter hostler pray somebody put these into sir john bulls chaise sir john bull equipped with queasys hat marched deliberately through the defile bowing with the air of at least an english county member to this side and to that as way was made for him to his carriage no one suspected that the hat did not belong to him no one indeed thought of the hat for all eyes were fixed upon the man seated in the carriage he threw money to the waiter hostler and boots and drew up the glass bidding the postilions drive on by this cool selfpossession our hero effected his retreat with successful generalship leaving his new dublin beaver behind him without regret as bona waviata queasy before whose eyes things passed continually without his seeing them thanked sir john for the care he had taken of his hat drew on his gloves and calculated aloud how long they should be going to the next stage at the first town they passed through omooney bought a new hat and queasy deplored the unaccountable mistake by which sir johns hat had been forgotten no further mistakes happened upon the journey the travellers rattled on and neither stinted nor stayed till they arrived at blackheath at miss sharpersons sir john sat queasy down without having given him the least hint of his designs upon the lady but as he helped him out with the sevre china he looked through the large opening double doors of the hall and slightly saidupon my word this seems to be a handsome house it would be worth looking at if the family were not at home i am morally sure sir john said the soft queasy that miss sharperson would be happy to let you see the house tonight and this minute if she knew you were at the door and who you were and all your civility about me and the chinado pray walk in not for the world a gentleman could not do such a thing without an invitation from the lady of the house herself oh if thats all ill step up myself to the young lady im certain shell be proud mr queasy by no means i would not have the lady disturbed for the world at this unseasonable hourit is too latequite too late not at all begging pardon sir john said queasy taking out his watch only just teatime by menot at all unseasonable for any body besides the message is of my own headall you know if not well taken up the great staircase he made bold to go on his mission as he thought in defiance of sir johns better judgment he returned in a few minutes with a face of selfcomplacent exultation and miss sharpersons compliments and begs sir john bull will walk up and rest himself with a dish of tea and has her thanks to him for the china now queasy who had the highest possible opinion of sir john bull and of miss sharperson whom he thought the two people of the greatest consequence and affability had formed the notion that they were made for each other and that it must be a match if they could but meet the meeting he had now happily contrived and effected and he had done his part for his friend sir john with miss sharperson by as many exaggerations as he could utter in five minutes concerning his perdigious politeness and courage his fine person and carriage his ancient family and vast connexions and importance wherever he appeared on the road at inns and over all england he had previously during the journey done his part for his friend miss sharperson with sir john by stating that she had a large fortune left her by her mother and was to have twice as much from her grandmother that she had thousands upon thousands in the funds and an estate of two thousand a year called rascally in scotland besides plate and jewels without end thus prepared how could this lady and gentleman meet without falling desperately in love with each other though a servant in handsome livery appeared ready to show sir john up the great staircase mr queasy acted as a gentleman usher or rather as showman he nodded to sir john as they passed across a long gallery and through an antechamber threw open the doors of various apartments as he went along cryingpeep in peep in peep in here peep in thereis not this spacious is not this elegant is not that grand did i say too much continued he rubbing his hands with delight did you ever see so magnificent and such highlypolished steel grates out of lonon sir john conscious that the servants eyes were upon him smiled at this question looked superior down and though with reluctant complaisance he leaned his body to this side or to that as queasy pulled or swayed yet he appeared totally regardless of the mans vulgar reflections he had seen every thing as he passed and was surprised at all he saw but evinced not the slightest symptom of astonishment he was now ushered into a spacious welllighted apartment he entered with the easy unembarrassed air of a man who was perfectly accustomed to such a home his quick coupdoeil took in the whole at a single glance two magnificent candelabras stood on egyptian tables at the farther end of the room and the lights were reflected on all sides from mirrors of no common size nothing seemed worthy to attract our heros attention but the lady of the house whom he approached with an air of distinguished respect she was reclining on a turkish sofa her companion seated beside her tuning a harp miss sharperson half rose to receive sir john he paid his compliments with an easy yet respectful air he was thanked for his civilities to the person who had been commissioned to bring the box of sevre china from deal vastly sorry it should have been so troublesome miss sharperson said in a voice fashionably unintelligible and with a most becoming yet intimidating nonchalance of manner intimidating it might have been to any man but our hero he who had the happy talent of catching wherever he went the reigning manner of the place replied to the lady in equal strains and she in her turn seemed to look upon him more as her equal tea and coffee were served nothings were talked of quite easily by sir john he practised the art not to admire so as to give a justly high opinion of his taste consequence and knowledge of the world miss sharperson though her nonchalance was much diminished continued to maintain a certain dignified reserve whilst her companion miss felicia flat condescended to ask sir john who had doubtless seen every fine house in england and on the continent his opinion with respect to the furniture and finishing of the room the placing of the egyptian tables and the candelabras no mortal could have guessed by sir john bulls air when he heard this question that he had never seen a candelabra before in his life he was so much and yet seemingly so little upon his guard he dealt so dexterously in generals and evaded particulars so delicately that he went through this dangerous conversation triumphantly careful not to protract his visit beyond the bounds of propriety he soon rose to take leave and he mingled intrusion regret late hour happiness and honour so charmingly in his parting compliment as to leave the most favourable impression on the minds of both the ladies and to procure for himself an invitation to see the house next morning the first day was now ended and our hero had been detected but once he went to rest this night well satisfied with himself but much more occupied with the hopes of marrying the heiress of rascally than of winning a paltry bet the next day he waited upon the ladies in high spirits neither of them was visible but mr queasy had orders to show him the house which he did with much exultation dwelling particularly in his praises on the beautiful high polish of the steel grates queasy boasted that it was he who had recommended the ironmonger who furnished the house in that line and that his bill as he was proud to state amounted to many many hundreds sir john who did not attend to one word queasy said went to examine the map of the rascally estate which was unrolled and he had leisure to count the number of lords and ladies visiting tickets which lay upon the chimneypiece he saw names of the people of first quality and respectability it was plain that miss sharperson must be a lady of high family as well as large fortune else she would not be visited by persons of such distinction our heros passion for her increased every moment her companion miss flat now appeared and entered very freely into conversation with sir john and as he perceived that she was commissioned to sit in judgment upon him he evaded all her leading questions with the skill of an irish witness but without giving any hibernian answers she was fairly at a fault miss sharperson at length appeared elegantly dressed her person was genteel and her face rather pretty sir john at this instant thought her beautiful or seemed to think so the ladies interchanged looks and afterwards sir john found a softness in his fair ones manner a languishing tenderness in her eyes in the tone of her voice and at the same time a modest perplexity and reserve about her which altogether persuaded him that he was quite right and his brother quite wrong en fait damour miss flat appeared now to have the most selfpossession of the three and miss sharperson looked at her from time to time as if she asked leave to be in love sir johns visit lasted a full half hour before he was sensible of having been five minutes engaged in this delightful conversation miss sharpersons coach now came to the door he handed her into it and she gave him a parting look which satisfied him all was yet safe in her heart miss flat as he handed her into the carriage said perhaps they should meet sir john at tunbridge where they were going in a few days she added some words as she seated herself which he scarcely noticed at the time but they recurred afterwards disagreeably to his memory the words were im so glad weve a roomy coach for of all things it annoys me to be squeedged in a carriage this word squeedged as he had not been used to it in ireland sounded to him extremely vulgar and gave him suspicions of the most painful nature he had the precaution before he left blackheath to go into several shops and to inquire something more concerning his fair ladies all he heard was much to their advantage that is much to the advantage of miss sharpersons fortune all agreed that she was a rich scotch heiress a rich scotch heiress sir john wisely considered might have an humble companion who spoke bad english he concluded that squeedged was scotch blamed himself for his suspicions and was more in love with his mistress and with himself than ever as he returned to town he framed the outline of a triumphant letter to his brother on his approaching marriage the bet was a matter at present totally beneath his consideration however we must do him the justice to say that like a man of honour he resolved that as soon as he had won the ladys heart he would candidly tell her his circumstances and then leave her the choice either to marry him or break her heart as she pleased just as he had formed this generous resolution at a sudden turn of the road he overtook miss sharpersons coach he bowed and looked in as he passed when to his astonishment he saw squeedged up in the corner by miss felicia mr queasy he thought that this was a blunder in etiquette that would never have been made in ireland perhaps his mistress was of the same opinion for she hastily pulled down the blind as sir john passed a cold qualm came over the lovers heart he lost no time in idle doubts and suspicions but galloped on to town as fast as he could and went immediately to call upon the scotch officer with whom he had travelled and whom he knew to be keen and prudent he recollected the map of the rascally estate which he saw in miss sharpersons breakfastroom and he remembered that the lands were said to lie in that part of scotland from which captain murray came from him he resolved to inquire into the state of the premises before he should offer himself as tenant for life captain murray assured him that there was no such place as rascally in that part of scotland that he had never heard of any such person as miss sharperson though he was acquainted with every family and every estate in the neighbourhood where she fabled hers to be omooney drew from memory the map of the rascally estate captain murray examined the boundaries and assured him that his cousin the generals lands joined his own at the very spot which he described and that unless two straight lines could enclose a space the rascally estate could not be found sir john naturally of a warm temper proceeded however with prudence the scotch officer admired his sagacity in detecting this adventurer sir john waited at his hotel for queasy who had promised to call to let him know when the ladies f would go to tunbridge queasy came nothing could equal his astonishment and dismay when he was told the news no such place as the rascally estate then im an undone man an undone man cried poor queasy bursting into tears but im certain its impossible and youll find sir john youve been misinformed i would stake my life upon it miss sharpersons a rich heiress and has a rich grandmother why shes five hundred pounds in my debt and i know of her being thousands and thousands in the books of as good men as myself to whom ive recommended her which i wouldnt have done for my life if i had not known her to be solid youll find shell prove a rich heiress sir john sir john hoped so but the proofs were not yet satisfactory queasy determined to inquire about her payments to certain creditors at blackheath and promised to give a decisive answer in the morning omooney saw that this man was too great a fool to be a knave his perturbation was evidently the perturbation of a dupe not of an accomplice queasy was made to be an anvil not a hammer in the midst of his own disappointment our goodnatured hibernian really pitied this poor currier the next morning sir john went early to blackheath all was confusion at miss sharpersons house the steps covered with grates and furniture of all sorts porters carrying out lookingglasses egyptian tables and candelabras the noise of workmen was heard in every apartment and louder than all the rest omooney heard the curses that were denounced against his rich heiresscurses such as are bestowed on a swindler in the moment of detection by the tradesmen whom she has ruined our hero who was of a most happy temper congratulated himself upon having by his own wit and prudence escaped making the practical bull of marrying a female swindler now that phelims immediate hopes of marrying a rich heiress were over his bet with his brother appeared to him of more consequence and he rejoiced in the reflection that this was the third day he had spent in england and that he had but once been detectedthe ides of march were come but not passed my lads said he to the workmen who were busy in carrying out the furniture from miss sharpersons house all hands are at work i see in saving what they can from the wreck of the sharperson she was as wellfitted out a vessel and in as gallant trim as any ship upon the face of the earth ship upon the face of the yearth repeated an english porter with a sneer ship upon the face of the water you should say master but i take it you bes an irishman omooney had reason to be particularly vexed at being detected by this man who spoke a miserable jargon and who seemed not to have a very extensive range of ideas he was one of those halfwitted geniuses who catch at the shadow of an irish bull in fact phelim had merely made a lapsus lingual and had used an expression justifiable by the authority of the elegant and witty lord chesterfield who saidno who wrotethat the english navy is the finest navy upon the face of the earth but it was in vain for our hero to argue the point he was detectedno matter how or by whom but this was only his second detection and three of his four days of probation were past he dined this day at captain murrays in the room in which they dined there was a picture of the captain painted by romney sir john who happened to be seated opposite to it observed that it was a very fine picture the more he looked at it the more he liked it his admiration was at last unluckily expressed he said thats an incomparable an inimitable picture it is absolutely more like than the original a keen scotch lady in company smiled and repeated more like than the original sir john if i had not been told by my relative here that you were an englishman i should have set you doon from that speech for an irishman this unexpected detection brought the colour for a moment into sir johns face but immediately recovering his presence of mind he said that was i acknowledge an excellent irish bull but in the course of my travels i have heard as good english bulls as irish to this captain murray politely acceded and he produced some laughable instances in support of the assertion which gave the conversation a new turn omooney felt extremely obliged to the captain for this especially as he saw by his countenance that he also had suspicions of the truth the first moment he found himself alone with murray our hero said to him murray you are too good a fellow to impose upon even in jest your keen countrywoman guessed the truthi am an irishman but not a swindler you shall hear why i conceal my country and name only keep my secret till tomorrow night or i shall lose a hundred guineas by my frankness omooney then explained to him the nature of his bet this is only my third detection and half of it voluntary i might say if i chose to higgle which i scorn to do captain murray was so much pleased by this openness that as he shook hands with omooney he said give me leave to tell you sir that even if you should lose your bet by this frank behaviour you will have gained a better thinga friend in the evening our hero went with his friend and a party of gentlemen to maidenhead near which place a battle was to be fought next day between two famous pugilists bourke and belcher at the appointed time the combatants appeared upon the stage the whole boxing corps and the gentlemen amateurs crowded to behold the spectacle phelim omooneys heart beat for the irish champion bourke but he kept a guard upon his tongue and had even the forbearance not to bet upon his countrymans head how many rounds were fought and how many minutes the fight lasted how many blows were put in on each side or which was the game man of the two we forbear to decide or relate as all this has been settled in the newspapers of the day where also it was remarked that bourke who lost the battle was put into a postchaise and left standing half an hour while another fight took place this was very scandalous on the part of his friends says the humane newspaper historian as the poor man might possibly be dying our hero omooneys heart again got the better of his head forgetful of his bet forgetful of every thing but humanity he made his way up to the chaise where bourke was left how are you my gay fellow said he can you see at all with the eye thats knocked out the brutal populace who overheard this question set up a roar of laughter a bull a bull an irish bull did you hear the question this irish gentleman asked his countryman omooney was detected a fourth time and this time he was not ashamed there was one man in the crowd who did not join in the laugh a poor irishman of the name of terence mdermod he had in former times gone out a grousing near cork with our hero and the moment he heard his voice he sprang forward and with uncouth but honest demonstrations of joy exclaimed ah my dear master my dear young master phelim omooney esq and i have found your honour alive again by the blessing of god above ill never part you now till i die and ill go to the worlds end to sarve yees omooney wished him at the worlds end this instant yet could not prevail upon himself to check this affectionate follower of the omooneys he however put half a crown into his hand and hinted that if he wished really to serve him it must be at some other time the poor fellow threw down the money saying he would never leave him bid me do any thing barring that no you shall never part me do what you plase with me still ill be close to your heart like your own shadow knock me down if you will and wilcome ten times a day and ill be up again like a ninepin only let me sarve your honour ill ask no wages nor take none there was no withstanding all this and whether our heros goodnature deceived him we shall not determine but he thought it most prudent as he could not get rid of terence to take him into his service to let him into his secret to make him swear that he would never utter the name of phelim omooney during the remainder of this day terence heard the secret of the bet with joy entered into the jest with all the readiness of an irishman and with equal joy and readiness swore by the hind leg of the holy lamb that he would never mention even to his own dog the name of phelim omooney esq good or bad till past twelve oclock and further that he would till the clock should strike that hour call his master sir john bull and nothing else to all men women and children upon the floor of gods creation satisfied with the fulness of this oath omooney resolved to return to town with his man terence mdermod he however contrived before he got there to make a practical bull by which he was detected a fifth time he got into the coach which was driving from london instead of that which was driving to london and he would have been carried rapidly to oxford had not his man terence after they had proceeded a mile and a half on the wrong road put his head down from the top of the coach crying as he looked in at the window master sir john bull are you there do you know were in the wrong box going to oxford your masters an irishman dare to say as well as yourself said the coachman as he let sir john out he walked back to maidenhead and took a chaise to town it was six oclock when he got to london and he went into a coffeehouse to dine he sat down beside a gentleman who was reading the newspaper any news today sir the gentleman told him the news of the day and then began to read aloud some paragraphs in a strong hibernian accent our hero was sorry that he had met with another countryman but he resolved to set a guard upon his lips and he knew that his own accent could not betray him the stranger read on till he came to a trial about a legacy which an old woman had left to her cats omooney exclaimed i hate cats almost as much as old women and if i had been the english minister i would have laid the dogtax upon cats if you had been the irish minister you mean said the stranger smiling for i perceive now you are a countryman of my own how can you think so sir said omooney you have no reason to suppose so from my accent i believe none in lifequite the contrary for you speak remarkably pure englishnot the least note or half note of the brogue but theres another sort of freemason sign by which we hibernians know one another and are known all over the globe whether to call it a confusion of expressions or of ideas i cant tell now an englishman if he had been saying what you did sir just now would have taken time to separate the dog and the tax and he would have put the tax upon cats and let the dogs go about their business our hero with his usual goodhumour acknowledged himself to be fairly detected well sir said the stranger if i had not found you out before by the blunder i should be sure now you were my countryman by your goodhumour an irishman can take whats said to him provided no affronts meant with more goodhumour than any man on earth ay that he can cried omooney he lends himself like the whale to be tickled even by the fellow with the harpoon till he finds what he is about and then he pays away and pitches the fellow boat and all to the devil ah countryman you would give me credit indeed for my good humour if you knew what danger you have put me in by detecting me for an irishman i have been found out six times and if i blunder twice more before twelve oclock this night i shall lose a hundred guineas by it but i will make sure of my bet for i will go home straight this minute lock myself up in my room and not say a word to any mortal till the watchman cries past twelve oclockthen the fast and long lent of my tongue will be fairly over and if youll meet me my dear friend at the kings arms we will have a good supper and keep easter for ever phelim pursuant to his resolution returned to his hotel and shut himself up in his room where he remained in perfect silence and consequent safety till about nine oclock suddenly he heard a great huzzaing in the street he looked out of the window and saw that all the houses in the street were illuminated his landlady came bustling into his apartment followed by waiters with candles his spirits instantly rose though he did not clearly know the cause of the rejoicings i give you joy maam what are you all illuminating for said he to his landlady thank you sir with all my heart i am not sure it is either for a great victory or the peace bobwaiterstep out and inquire for the gentleman the gentleman preferred stepping out to inquire for himself the illuminations were in honour of the peace he totally forgot his bet his silence and his prudence in his sympathy with the general joy he walked rapidly from street to street admiring the various elegant devices a crowd was standing before the windows of a house that was illuminated with extraordinary splendour he inquired whose it was and was informed that it belonged to a contractor who had made an immense fortune by the war then im sure these illuminations of his for the peace are none of the most sincere said omooney the mob were of his opinion and phelim who was now alas worked up to the proper pitch for blundering added by way of pleasing his audience still moreif this contractor had illuminated in character it should have been with dark lanterns should it by jasus that would be an irish illumination cried some one arrah honey youre an irishman whoever you are and have spoke your mind in character sir john bull was vexed that the piece of wit which he had aimed at the contractor had recoiled upon himself it is always as my countryman observed by having too much wit that i blunder the deuce take me if i sport a single bon mot more this night this is only my seventh detection i have an eighth blunder still to the good and if i can but keep my wit to myself till i am out of purgatory then i shall be in heaven and may sing io triumphe in spite of my brother fortunately phelim had not made it any part of his bet that he should not speak to himself an irish idiom or that he should not think a bull resolved to be as obstinately silent as a monk of la trappe he once more shut himself up in his cell and fell fast asleepdreamed that fat bulls of basan encompassed him round aboutthat he ran down a steep bill to escape themthat his foot slippedhe rolled to the bottomfelt the bulls horns in his sideheard the bull bellowing in hisearswakenedand found terence mdermod bellowing at his room door sir john bull sir john bull murder murder my dear master sir john bull murder robbery and reward let me in for the love of the holy virgin they are all after you who are you drunk terence said sir john opening the door no but they are madall mad who the constable they are all mad entirely and the lord mayor all along with your honours making me swear i would not tell your name sure they are all coming armed in a body to put you in jail for a forgery unless i run back and tell them the truthwill i first tell me the truth blunderer ill make my affidavit i never blundered plase your honour but just went to the merchants as you ordered with the draft signed with the name i swore not to utter till past twelve i presents the draft and waits to be paid are you mr omooneys servant says one of the clerks after a while no sir not at all sir said i im sir john bulls at your sarvice he puzzles and puzzles and asks me did i bring the draft and was that your writing at the bottom of it i still said it was my masters writing sir john bulls and no other they whispered from one up to tother and then said it was a forgery as i overheard and i must go before the mayor with that while the master who was called down to be examined as to his opinion was putting on his glasses to spell it out i gives them one and all the slip and whips out of the street door and home to give your honour notice and have been breaking my heart at the door this half hour to make you hearand now you have it all i am in a worse dilemma now than when between the horns of the bull thought sir john i must now either tell my real name avow myself an irishman and so lose my bet or else go to jail he preferred going to jail he resolved to pretend to be dumb and he charged terence not to betray him the officers of justice came to take him up sir john resigned himself to them making signs that he could not speak he was carried before a magistrate the merchant had never seen mr phelim omooney but could swear to his handwriting and signature having many of his letters and drafts the draft in question was produced sir john bull would neither acknowledge nor deny the signature but in dumb show made signs of innocence no art or persuasion could make him speak he kept his fingers on his lips one of the bailiffs offered to open sir johns mouth sir john clenched his hand in token that if they used violence he knew his remedy to the magistrate he was all bows and respect but the law in spite of civility must take its course terence mcdermod beat his breast and called upon all the saints in the irish calendar when he saw the committal actually made out and his dear master given over to the constables nothing but his own oath and his masters commanding eye which was fixed upon him at this instant could have made him forbear to utter what he had never in his life been before so strongly tempted to tellthe truth determined to win his wager our hero suffered himself to be carried to a lockup house and persisted in keeping silence till the clock struck twelve then the charm was broken and he spoke he began talking to himself and singing as loud as he possibly could the next morning terence who was no longer bound by his oath to conceal phelims name hastened to his masters correspondent in town told the whole story and omooney was liberated having won his bet by his wit and steadiness he had now the prudence to give up these adventuring schemes to which he had so nearly become a dupe he returned immediately to ireland to his brother and determined to settle quietly to business his good brother paid him the hundred guineas most joyfully declaring that he had never spent a hundred guineas better in his life than in recovering a brother phelim had now conquered his foolish dislike to trade his brother took him into partnership and phelim omooney never relapsed into sir john bull conclusion unable any longer to support the tone of irony we joyfully speak in our own characters and explicitly declare our opinion that the irish are an ingenious generous people that the bulls and blunders of which they are accused are often imputable to their neighbours or that they are justifiable by ancient precedents or that they are produced by their habits of using figurative and witty language by what their goodhumour is produced we know not but that it exists we are certain in ireland the countenance and heart expand at the approach of wit and humour the poorest labourer forgets his poverty and toil in the pleasure of enjoying a joke amongst all classes of the people provided no malice is obviously meant none is apprehended that such is the character of the majority of the nation there cannot to us be a more convincing and satisfactory proof than the manner in which a late publication was received in ireland the irish were the first to laugh at the caricature of their ancient foibles and it was generally taken merely as goodhumoured raillery not as insulting satire if gratitude for this generosity has now betrayed us unawares into the language of panegyric we may hope for pardon from the liberal of both nations those who are thoroughly acquainted with ireland will most readily acknowledge the justice of our praises those who are ignorant of the country will not perhaps be displeased to have their knowledge of the people of ireland extended many foreign pictures of irishmen are as grotesque and absurd as the chinese pictures of lions having never seen that animal the chinese can paint him only from the descriptions of voyagers which are sometimes ignorantly sometimes wantonly exaggerated in voltaires age of lewis the fourteenth we find the following passagesome nations seem made to be subject to others the english have always had over the irish the superiority of genius wealth and arms the superiority which the whites have over the negroes a note in a subsequent edition informs us that the injurious expressionthe superiority which the whites have over the negroes was erased by voltaire and his editor subjoins his own opinion the nearly savage state in which ireland was when she was conquered her superstition the oppression exercised by the english the religious fanaticism which divides the irish into two hostile nations such were the causes which have held down this people in depression and weakness religious hatreds are appeased and this country has recovered her liberty the irish no longer yield to the english either in industry or in information the last sentence of this note might if it had reached the eyes or ears of the incensed irish historian mr ohalloran have assuaged his wrath against voltaire for the unguarded expression in the text unless the amor patriae of the historian like the amour propre of some individuals instead of being gratified by congratulations on their improvement should be intent upon demonstrating that there never was anything to improve as we were neither born nor bred in ireland we cannot be supposed to possess this amor patriae in its full force we profess to be attached to the country only for its merits we acknowledge that it is a matter of indifference to us whether the irish derive their origin from the spaniards or the milesians or the welsh we are not so violently anxious as we ought to be to determine whether or not the language spoken by the phoenician slave in terences play was irish nay we should not break our hearts if it could never be satisfactorily proved that albion is only another name for ireland we moreover candidly confess that we are more interested in the fate of the present race of its inhabitants than in the historian of st patrick st facharis st cormuc the renowned brien boru tireldach king of connaught mmurrough king of leinster diarmod righdamnha labraloingseach tighermas ollamhfoldha the mgiollaphadraigs or even the great william of ogham and by this declaration we have no fear of giving offence to any but rusty antiquaries we think it somewhat more to the honour of ireland to enumerate the names of some of the men of genius whom she has produced milton and shakspeare stand unrivalled but ireland can boast of usher boyle denham congreve molyneux farquhar sir richard steele bickerstaff sir hans sloane

sheridan kirwan brinsley sheridan and burke we enter into no invidious comparisons it is our sincere wish to conciliate both countries and if in this slight essay we should succeed in diffusing a more just and enlarged idea of the irish than has been generally entertained we hope the english will deem it not an unacceptable service whatever might have been the policy of the english nation towards ireland whilst she was a separate kingdom since the union it can no longer be her wish to depreciate the talents or ridicule the language of hibernians one of the czars of russia used to take the cap and bells from his fool and place it on the head of any of his subjects whom he wished to disgrace the idea of extending such a punishment to a whole nation was ingenious and magnanimous but england cannot now put it into execution towards ireland would it not be a practical bull to place the bells upon her own imperial head appendix the following collection of foreign bulls was given us by a man

science of selfjustification for which an eloquence that aims to vex with native tropes of anger arms the sexparnell endowed as the fair sex indisputably are with a natural genius for the invaluable art of selfjustification it may not be displeasing to them to see its rising perfection evinced by an attempt to reduce it to a science possessed as are all the fair daughters of eve of an hereditary propensity transmitted to them undiminished through succeeding generations to be soon moved with slightest touch of blame very little precept and practice will confirm them in the habit and instruct them in all the maxims of selfjustification candid pupil you will readily accede to my first and fundamental axiomthat a lady can do no wrong but simple as this maxim may appear and suited to the level of the meanest capacity the talent of applying it on all the important but more especially on all the most trivial occurrences of domestic life so as to secure private peace and public dominion has hitherto been monopolized by the female adepts in the art of selfjustification excuse me for insinuating by this expression that there may yet be amongst you some novices to these if any such i principally address myself and now lest fired by ambition you lose all by aiming at too much let me explain and limit my first principle that you can do no wrong you must be aware that real perfection is beyond the reach of mortals nor would i have you aim at it indeed it is not in any degree necessary to our purpose you have heard of the established belief in the infallibility of the sovereign pontiff which prevailed not many centuries agoif man was allowed to be infallible i see no reason why the same privilege should not be extended to womanbut times have changed and since the happy age of credulity is past leave the opinions of men to their natural perversitytheir actions are the best test of their faith instead then of a belief in your infallibility endeavour to enforce implicit submission to your authority this will give you infinitely less trouble and will answer your purpose as well right and wrong if we go to the foundation of things are as casuists tell us really words of very dubious signification perpetually varying with custom and fashion and to be adjusted ultimately by no other standards but opinion and force obtain power then by all means power is the law of man make it yours but to return from a frivolous disquisition about right let me teach you the art of defending the wrong after having thus pointed out to you the glorious end of your labours i must now instruct you in the equally glorious means for the advantage of my subject i address myself chiefly to married ladies but those who have not as yet the good fortune to have that common enemy a husband to combat may in the mean time practise my precepts upon their fathers brothers and female friends with caution however lest by discovering their arms too soon they preclude themselves from the power of using them to the fullest advantage hereafter i therefore recommend it to them to prefer with a philosophical moderation the future to the present timid brides you have probably hitherto been addressed as angels prepare for the time when you shall again become mortal take the alarm at the first approach of blame at the first hint of a discovery that you are any thing less than infalliblecontradict debate justify recriminate rage weep swoon do any thing but yield to conviction i take it for granted that you have already acquired sufficient command of voice you need not study its compass going beyond its pitch has a peculiarly happy effect upon some occasions but are you voluble enough to drown all sense in a torrent of words can you be loud enough to overpower the voice of all who shall attempt to interrupt or contradict you are you mistress of the petulant the peevish and the sullen tone have you practised the sharpness which provokes retort and the continual monotony which by setting your adversary to sleep effectually precludes reply an event which is always to be considered as decisive of the victory or at least as reducing it to a drawn battleyou and somnus divide the prize thus prepared for an engagement you will next if you have not already done it study the weak part of the character of your enemyyour husband i mean if he be a man of high spirit jealous of command and impatient of control one who decides for himself and who is little troubled with the insanity of minding what the world says of him you must proceed with extreme circumspection you must not dare to provoke the combined forces of the enemy to a regular engagement but harass him with perpetual petty skirmishes in these though you gain little at a time you will gradually weary the patience and break the spirit of your opponent if he be a man of spirit he must also be generous and what man of generosity will contend for trifles with a woman who submits to him in all affairs of consequence who is in his power who is weak and who loves him can superior with inferior power contend no the spirit of a lion is not to be roused by the teasing of an insect but such a man as i have described besides being as generous as he is brave will probably be of an active temper then you have an inestimable advantage for he will set a high value upon a thing for which you have nonetime he will acknowledge the force of your arguments merely from a dread of their length he will yield to you in trifles particularly in trifles which do not militate against his authority not out of regard for you but for his time for what man can prevail upon himself to debate three hours about what could be as well decided in three minutes lest amongst infinite variety the difficulty of immediate selection should at first perplex you let me point out that matters of taste will afford you of all others the most ample and incessant subjects of debate here you have no criterion to appeal to upon the same principle next to matters of taste points of opinion will afford the most constant exercise to your talents here you will have an opportunity of citing the opinions of all the living and dead you have ever known besides the dear privilege of repeating continuallynay you must allow that or you cant deny this for its the universal opinionevery body says so every body thinks so i wonder to hear you express such an opinion nobody but yourself is of that way of thinking with innumerable other phrases with which a slight attention to polite conversation will furnish you this mode of opposing authority to argument and assertion to proof is of such universal utility that i pray you to practise it if the point in dispute be some opinion relative to your character or disposition allow in general that you are sure you have a great many faults but to every specific charge reply well i am sure i dont know but i did not think that was one of my faults nobody ever accused me of that before nay i was always remarkable for the contrary at least before i was acquainted with you sir in my own family i was always remarkable for the contrary ask any of my own friends ask any of them they must know me best but if instead of attacking the material parts of your character your husband should merely presume to advert to your manners to some slight personal habit which might be made more agreeable to him prove in the first place that it is his fault that it is not agreeable to him ask which is most to blame she who ceases to please or he who ceases to be pleasedhis eyes are changed or opened but it may perhaps have been a matter almost of indifference to him till you undertook its defence then make it of consequence by rising in eagerness in proportion to the insignificance of your object if he can draw consequences this will be an excellent lesson if you are so tender of blame in the veriest trifles how impeachable must you be in matters of importance as to personal habits begin by denying that you have any or in the paradoxical language of rousseau declare that the only habit you have is the habit of having none as all personal habits if they have been of any long standing must have become involuntary the unconscious culprit may assert her innocence without hazarding her veracity however if you happen to be detected in the very fact and a person cries now now you are doing it submit but declare at the same momentthat it is the very first time in your whole life that you were ever known to be guilty of it and therefore it can be no habit and of course nowise reprehensible extend the rage for vindication to all the objects which the most remotely concern you take even inanimate objects under your protection your dress your furniture your property every thing which is or has been yours defend and this upon the principles of the soundest philosophy each of these things all compose a part of your personal merit vide hume all that connected the most distantly with your idea gives pleasure or pain to others becomes an object of blame or praise and consequently claims your support or vindication in the course of the management of your house children family and affairs probably some few errors of omission or commission may strike your husbands pervading eye but these errors admitting them to be errors you will never if you please allow to be charged to any deficiency in memory judgment or activity on your part there are surely people enough around you to divide and share the blame send it from one to another till at last by universal rejection it is proved to belong to nobody you will say however that facts remain unalterable and that in some unlucky instance in the changes and chances of human affairs you may be proved to have been to blame some stubborn evidence may appear against you still you may prove an alibi or balance the evidence there is nothing equal to balancing evidence doubt is you know the most philosophic state of the human mind and it will be kind of you to keep your husband perpetually in this sceptical state indeed the short method of denying absolutely all blameable facts i should recommend to pupils as the best and if in the beginning of their career they may startle at this mode let them depend upon it that in their future practice it must become perfectly familiar the nice distinction of simulation and dissimulation depends but on the trick of a syllable palliation and extenuation are universally allowable in selfdefence prevarication inevitably follows and falsehood is but in the next degree yet i would not destroy this nicety of conscience too soon it may be of use in your first setting out because you must establish credit in proportion to your credit will be the value of your future asseverations in the mean time however argument and debate are allowed to the most rigid moralist you can never perjure yourself by swearing to a false opinion i come now to the art of reasoning dont be alarmed at the name of reasoning fair pupils i will explain to you my meaning if instead of the fierytempered being i formerly described you should fortunately be connected with a man who having formed a justly high opinion of your sex should propose to treat you as his equal and who in any little dispute which might arise between you should desire no other arbiter than reason triumph in his mistaken candour regularly appeal to the decision of reason at the beginning of every contest and deny its jurisdiction at the conclusion i take it for granted that you will be on the wrong side of every question and indeed in general i advise you to choose the wrong side of an argument to defend whilst you are young in the science it will afford the best exercise and as you improve the best display of your talents if then reasonable pupils you would succeed in argument attend to the following instructions begin by preventing if possible the specific statement of any position or if reduced to it use the most general terms and take advantage of the ambiguity which all languages and which most philosophers allow above all things shun definitions they will prove fatal to you for two persons of sense and candour who define their terms cannot argue long without either convincing or being convinced or parting in equal goodhumour to prevent which go over and over the same ground wander as wide as possible from the point but always with a view to return at last precisely to the same spot from which you set out i should remark to you that the choice of your weapons is a circumstance much to be attended to choose always those which your adversary cannot use if your husband is a man of wit you will of course undervalue a talent which is never connected with judgment for your part you do not presume to contend with him in wit but if he be a soberminded man who will go link by link along the chain of an argument follow him at first till he grows so intent that he does not perceive whether you follow him or not then slide back to your own station and when with perverse patience he has at last reached the last link of the chain with one electric shock of wit make him quit his hold and strike him to the ground in an instant depend upon the sympathy of the spectators for to one who can understand reason you will find ten who admire wit but if you should not be blessed with a ready wit if demonstration should in the mean time stare you in the face do not be in the least alarmedanticipate the blow whilst you have it yet in your power rise with becoming magnanimity and cry i give it up i give it up la let us say no more about it i do so hate disputing about trifles i give it up before an explanation on the word trifle can take place quit the room with flying colours if you are a woman of sentiment and eloquence you have advantages of which i scarcely need apprize you from the understanding of a man you have always an appeal to his heart or if not to his affection to his weakness if you have the good fortune to be married to a weak man always choose the moment to argue with him when you have a full audience trust to the sublime power of numbers it will be of use even to excite your own enthusiasm in debate then as the scene advances talk of his cruelty and your sensibility and sink with becoming woe into the pathos of injured innocence besides the heart and the weakness of your opponent you have still another chance in ruffling his temper which in the course of a long conversation you will have a fair opportunity of trying and iffor philosophers will sometimes grow warm in the defence of truthif he should grow absolutely angry you will in the same proportion grow calm and wonder at his rage though you well know it has been created by your own provocation the bystanders seeing anger without any adequate cause will all be of your side nothing provokes an irascible man interested in debate and possessed of an opinion of his own eloquence so much as to see the attention of his hearers go from him you will then when he flatters himself that he has just fixed your eye with his very best argument suddenly grow absentyour house affairs must call you henceor you have directions to give to your childrenor the room is too hot or too coldthe window must be openedor door shutor the candle wants snuffing nay without these interruptions the simple motion of your eye may provoke a speaker a butterfly or the figure in a carpet may engage your attention in preference to him or if these objects be absent the simply averting your eye looking through the window in quest of outward objects will show that your mind has not been abstracted and will display to him at least your wish of not attending he may however possibly have lost the habit of watching your eye for approbation then you may assault his ear if all other resources fail beat with your foot that dead march of the spirits that incessant tattoo which so well deserves its name marvellous must be the patience of the muchenduring man whom some or other of these devices do not provoke slight causes often produce great effects the simple scratching of a pickaxe properly applied to certain veins in a mine will cause the most dreadful explosions hitherto we have only professed to teach the defensive let me now recommend to you the offensive part of the art of justification as a supplement to reasoning comes recrimination the pleasure of proving that you are right is surely incomplete till you have proved that your adversary is wrong this might have been a secondary let it now become a primary object with you rest your own defence on it for further security you are no longer to consider yourself as obliged either to deny palliate argue or declaim but simply to justify yourself by criminating another all merit you know is judged of by comparison in the art of recrimination your memory will be of the highest service to you for you are to open and keep an accountcurrent of all the faults mistakes neglects unkindnesses of those you live with these you are to state against your own i need not tell you that the balance will always be in your favour in stating matters or opinion produce the words of the very same person which passed days months years before in contradiction to what he is then saying by displacing disjointing words and sentences by misunderstanding the whole or quoting only a part of what has been said you may convict any man of inconsistency particularly if he be a man of genius and feeling for he speaks generally from the impulse of the moment and of all others can the least bear to be charged with paradoxes so far for a husband recriminating is also of sovereign use in the quarrels of friends no friend is so perfectly equable so ardent in affection so nice in punctilio as never to offend then note his faults and con them all by rote say you can forgive but you can never forget and surely it is much more generous to forgive and remember than to forgive and forget on every new alarm call the unburied ghosts from former fields of battle range them in tremendous array call them one by one to witness against the conscience of your enemy and ere the battle is begun take from him all courage to engage there is one case i must observe to you in which recrimination has peculiar poignancy if you have had it in your power to confer obligations on any one never cease reminding them of it and let them feel that you have acquired an indefeasible right to reproach them without a possibility of their retorting it is a maxim with some sentimental people to treat their servants as if they were their friends in distressi have observed that people of this cast make themselves amends by treating their friends in distress as if they were their servants apply this maximyou may do it a thousand ways especially in company in general conversation where every one is supposed to be on a footing if any of your humble companions should presume to hazard an opinion contrary to yours and should modestly begin with i think look as the man did when he said to his servant you think sirwhat business have you to think never fear to lose a friend by the habits which i recommend reconciliations as you have often heard it saidreconciliations are the cement of friendship therefore friends should quarrel to strengthen their attachment and offend each other for the pleasure of being reconciled i beg pardon for digressing i was i believe talking of your husband not of your friendi have gone far out of the way if in your debates with your husband you should want eloquence to vex him the dull prolixity of narration joined to the complaining monotony of voice which i formerly recommended will supply its place and have the desired effect somnus will prove propitious then ever and anon as the soporific charm begins to work rouse him with interrogatories such as did not you say so dont you remember only answer me that bytheby interrogatories artfully put may lead an unsuspicious reasoner you know always to your own conclusion in addition to the patience philosophy and other good things which socrates learned from his wife perhaps she taught him this mode of reasoning but after all the precepts of art and even the natural susceptibility of your tempers will avail you little in the sublime of our science if you cannot command that ready enthusiasm which will make you enter into the part you are acting that happy imagination which shall make you believe all you fear and all you invent who is there amongst you who cannot or who will not justify when they are accused vulgar talent the sublime of our science is to justify before we are accused there is no reptile so vile but what will turn when it is trodden on but of a nicer sense and nobler species are those whom nature has endowed with antennas which perceive and withdraw at the distant approach of danger allow me another allusion similes cannot be crowded too close for a female taste and analogy i have heard my fair pupils is your favourite mode of reasoning the sensitive plant is too vulgar an allusion but if the truth of modern naturalists may be depended upon there is a plant which instead of receding timidly from the intrusive touch angrily protrudes its venomous juices upon all who presume to meddle with itdo not you think this plant would be your fittest emblem let me however recommend it to you nice souls who of the mimosa kind fear the dark cloud and feel the coming storm to take the utmost precaution lest the same susceptibility which you cherish as the dear means to torment others should insensibly become a torment to yourselves distinguish then between sensibility and susceptibility between the anxious solicitude not to give offence and the captious eagerness of vanity to prove that it ought not to have been taken distinguish between the desire of praise and the horror of blame can any two things be more different than the wish to improve and the wish to demonstrate that you have never been to blame observe i only wish you to distinguish these things in your own minds i would by no means advise you to discontinue the laudable practice of confounding them perpetually in speaking to others when you have nearly exhausted human patience in explaining justifying vindicating when in spite of all the pains you have taken you have more than half betrayed your own vanity you have a neverfailing resource in paying tribute to that of your opponent as thus i am sure you must be sensible that i should never take so much pains to justify myself if i were indifferent to your opinioni know that i ought not to disturb myself with such trifles but nothing is a trifle to me which concerns you i confess i am too anxious to please i know its a fault but i cannot cure myself of it nowtoo quick sensibility i am conscious is the defect of my disposition it would be happier for me if i could be more indifferent i know who could be so brutal as to blame so amiable so candid a creature who would not submit to be tormented with kindness when once your captive condescends to be flattered by such arguments as these your power is fixed your future triumphs can be bounded only by your own moderation they are at once secured and justified forbear not then happy pupils but arrived at the summit of power give a full scope to your genius nor trust to genius alone to exercise in all its extent your privileged dominion you must acquire or rather you must pretend to have acquired infallible skill in the noble art of physiognomy immediately the thoughts as well as the words of your subjects are exposed to your inquisition words may flatter you but the countenance never can deceive you the eyes are the windows of the soul and through them you are to watch what passes in the inmost recesses of the heart there if you discern the slightest ideas of doubt blame or displeasure if you discover the slightest symptoms of revolt take the alarm instantly conquerors must maintain their conquests and how easily can they do this who hold a secret correspondence with the minds of the vanquished be your own spies then from the looks gestures slightest motions of your enemies you are to form an alphabet a language intelligible only to yourselves yet by which you shall condemn them always remembering that in sound policy suspicion justifies punishment in vain when you accuse your friends of the high treason of blaming you in vain let them plead their innocence even of the intention they did not say a word which could be tortured into such a meaning no but they looked daggers though they used none and of this you are to be the sole judge though there were fifty witnesses to the contrary how should indifferent spectators pretend to know the countenance of your friend as well as you doyou that have a nearer a dearer interest in attending to it so accurate have been your observations that no thought of their souls escapes you nay you often can tell even what they are going to think of the science of divination certainly claims your attention beyond the past and the present it shall extend your dominion over the future from slight words halffinished sentences from silence itself you shall draw your omens and auguries i know what you were going to say or i know such a thing was a sign you were inclined to be displeased with me in the ardour of innocence the culprit to clear himself from such imputations incurs the imputation of a greater offence suppose to prove that you were mistaken to prove that he could not have meant to blame you he should declare that at the moment you mention you were quite foreign to his thoughts he was not thinking at all about you then in truth you have a right to be angry to one of your class of justificators this is the highest offence possessed as you are of the firm opinion that all persons at all times on all occasions are intent upon you alone is it not less mortifying to discover that you were thought ill of than that you were not thought of at all indifference you know sentimental pupils is more fatal to love than even hatred thus my dear pupils i have endeavoured to provide precepts adapted to the display of your several talents but if there should be any amongst you who have no talents who can neither argue nor persuade who have neither sentiment nor enthusiasm i must indeedcongratulate themthey are peculiarly qualified for the science of selfjustification indulgent nature often even in the weakness provides for the protection of her creatures just providence as the guard of stupidity has enveloped it with the impenetrable armour of obstinacy fair idiots let women of sense wit feeling triumph in their various arts yours are superior their empire absolute as it sometimes may be is perpetually subject to sudden revolutions with them a man has some chance of equal sway with a fool he has none have they hearts and understandings then the one may be touched or the other in some unlucky moment convinced even in their very power lies their greatest dangernot so with you in vain let the most candid of his sex attempt to reason with you let him begin with now my dear only listen to reasonyou stop him at once with no my dear you know i do not pretend to reason i only say thats my opinion let him go on to prove that yours is a mistaken opinionyou are ready to acknowledge it long before he desires it you acknowledge it may be a wrong opinion but still it is your opinion you do not maintain it in the least either because you believe it to be wrong or right but merely because it is yours exposed as you might have been to the perpetual humiliation of being convinced nature seems kindly to have denied you all perception of truth or at least all sentiment of pleasure from the perception with an admirable humility you are as well contented to be in the wrong as in the right you answer all that can be said to you with a provoking humility of aspect yes i do not doubt but what you say may be very true but i cannot tell i do not think myself capable of judging on these subjects i am sure you must know much better than i do i do not pretend to say but that your opinion is very just but i own i am of a contrary way of thinking i always thought so and i always shall should a man with persevering temper tell you that he is ready to adopt your sentiments if you will only explain them should he beg only to have a reason for your opinionno you can give no reason let him urge you to say something in its defenceno like queen anne you will only repeat the same thing over again or be silent silence is the ornament of your sex and in silence if there be not wisdom there is safety you will then if you please according to your custom sit listening to all entreaties to explain and speakwith a fixed immutability of posture and a predetermined deafness of eye which shall put your opponent utterly out of patience yet still by persevering with the same complacent importance of countenance you shall half persuade people you could speak if you would you shall keep them in doubt by that true want of meaning which puzzles more than wit even because they cannot conceive the excess of your stupidity they shall actually begin to believe that they themselves are stupid ignorance and doubt are the great parents of the sublime your adversary finding you impenetrable to argument perhaps would try witbut on the impassive ice the lightnings play his eloquence or his kindness will avail less when in yielding to you after a long harangue he expects to please you you will answer undoubtedly with the utmost propriety that you should be very sorry he yielded his judgment to you that he is very good that you are much obliged to him but that as to the point in dispute it is a matter of perfect indifference to you for your part you have no choice at all about it you beg that he will do just what he pleases you know that it is the duty of a wife to submit but you hope however you may have an opinion of your own remember all such speeches as these will lose above half their effect if you cannot accompany them with the vacant stare the insipid smile the passive aspect of the humbly perverse whilst i write new precepts rush upon my recollection but the subject is inexhaustible i quit it with regret though fully sensible of my presumption in having attempted to instruct those who whilst they read will smile in the consciousness of superior powers adieu then my fair readers long may you prosper in the practice of an art

to the grave miss edgeworths former works consist of tales for childrenof stories for young men and womenand of tales suited to that great mass which does not move in the circles of fashion the present volumes are intended to point out some of those errors to which the higher classes of society are disposed all the parts of this series of moral fictions bear upon the faults and excellencies of different ages and classes and they have all arisen from that view of society which we have laid before the public in more didactic works on education in the parents assistant in moral and in popular tales it was my daughters aim to exemplify the principles contained in practical education in these volumes and in others which are to follow she endeavours to disseminate in a familiar form some of the ideas that are unfolded in essays on professional education the first of these stories is called ennuithe causes curses and cure of this disease are exemplified i hope in such a manner as

sennuient je mennuyois je mennuierai c thiebauld mem de frederic le grand chapter i bred up in luxurious indolence i was surrounded by friends who seemed to have no business in this world but to save me the trouble of thinking or acting for myself and i was confirmed in the pride of helplessness by being continually reminded that i was the only son and heir of the earl of glenthorn my mother died a few weeks after i was born and i lost my father when i was very young i was left to the care of a guardian who in hopes of winning my affection never controlled my wishes or even my whims i changed schools and masters as often as i pleased and consequently learned nothing at last i found a private tutor who suited me exactly for he was completely of my own opinion that every thing which the young earl of glenthorn did not know by the instinct of genius was not worth his learning money could purchase a reputation for talents and with money i was immoderately supplied for my guardian expected to bribe me with a part of my own fortune to forbear inquiring what had become of a certain deficiency in the remainder this tacit compact i perfectly understood we were consequently on the most amicable terms imaginable and the most confidential for i thought it better to deal with my guardian than with jews thus at an age when other young men are subject to some restraint either from the necessity of their circumstances or the discretion of their friends i became completely master of myself and of my fortune my companions envied me but even their envy was not sufficient to make me happy whilst yet a boy i began to feel the dreadful symptoms of that mental malady which baffles the skill of medicine and for which wealth can purchase only temporary alleviation for this complaint there is no precise english name but alas the foreign term is now naturalized in england among the higher classes whether in the wealthy or the fashionable world who is unacquainted with ennui at first i was unconscious of being subject to this disease i felt that something was the matter with me but i did not know what yet the symptoms were sufficiently marked i was afflicted with frequent fits of fidgeting yawning and stretching with a constant restlessness of mind and body an aversion to the place i was in or the thing i was doing or rather to that which was passing before my eyes for i was never doing any thing i had an utter abhorrence and an incapacity of voluntary exertion unless roused by external stimulus i sank into that kind of apathy and vacancy of ideas vulgarly known by the name of a brown study if confined in a room for more than half an hour by bad weather or other contrarieties i would pace backwards and forwards like the restless cavia in his den with a fretful unmeaning pertinacity i felt an insatiable longing for something new and a childish love of locomotion my physician and my guardian not knowing what else to do with me sent me abroad i set out upon my travels in my eighteenth year attended by my favourite tutor as my companion we perfectly agreed in our ideas of travelling we hurried from place to place as fast as horses and wheels and curses and guineas could carry us milord anglois rattled over half the globe without getting one inch farther from his ennui three years were to be consumed before i should be of age what sums did i spend during this interval in expeditionmoney to time but the more i tried to hasten him the slower the rogue went i lost my money and my temper at last the day for which i had so long panted arrivedi was twentyone and i took possession of my estate the bells rang the bonfires blazed the tables were spread the wine flowed huzzas resounded friends and tenants crowded about me and nothing but the voice of joy and congratulation was to be heard the bustle of my situation kept me awake for some weeks the pleasure of property was new and as long as the novelty lasted delightful i cannot say that i was satisfied but my mind was distended by the sense of the magnitude of my possessions i had large estates in england and in one of the remote maritime counties of ireland i was lord over an immense territory annexed to the ancient castle of glenthorna noble pile of antiquity worth ten degenerate castles of modern days it was placed in a bold romantic situation at least as far as i could judge of it by a picture said to be a striking likeness which hung in my hall at sherwood park in england i was born in ireland and nursed as i was told in an irish cabin for my father had an idea that this would make me hardy he left me with my irish nurse till i was two years old and from that time forward neither he nor i ever revisited ireland he had a dislike to that country and i grew up in his prejudices i declared that i would always reside in england sherwood park my english countryseat had but one fault it was completely finished the house was magnificent and in the modern taste the furniture fashionably elegant and in all the gloss of novelty not a single luxury omitted not a fault could be found by the most fastidious critic my park my grounds displayed all the beauties of nature and of art judiciously combined majestic woods waving their dark foliage overhungbut i will spare my readers the description for i remember falling asleep myself whilst a poet was reading to me an ode on the beauties of sherwood park these beauties too soon became familiar to my eye and even the idea of being the proprietor of this enchanting place soon palled upon my vanity every casual visitor all the strangers even the common people who were allowed once a week to walk in my pleasuregrounds enjoyed them a thousand times more than i could i remember that about six weeks after i came to sherwood park i one evening escaped from the crowds of friends who filled my house to indulge myself in a solitary melancholy walk i saw at some distance a party of people who were coming to admire the place and to avoid meeting them i took shelter under a fine tree the branches of which hanging to the ground concealed me from the view of passengers thus seated i was checked in the middle of a desperate yawn by hearing one among the party of strangers exclaiming how happy the owner of this place must be yes had i known how to enjoy the goods of life i might have been happy but want of occupation and antipathy to exertion rendered me one of the most miserable men upon earth still i imagined that the cause of my discontent proceeded from some external circumstance soon after my coming of age business of various sorts required my attention papers were to be signed and lands were to be let these things appeared to me terrible difficulties not even that minister of state who so feelingly describes his horror at the first appearance of the secretary with the great portfolio ever experienced sensations so oppressive as mine were when my steward began to talk to me of my own affairs in the peevishness of my indolence i declared that i thought the pains overbalanced the pleasures of property captain crawley a frienda sort of a frienda humble companion of mine a gross unblushing thoroughgoing flatterer happened to be present when i made this declaration he kindly undertook to stand between me and the shadow of trouble i accepted this offer ay crawley said i do see and settle with these people i had not the slightest confidence in the person into whose hands to save myself from the labour of thinking i thus threw all my affairs but i satisfied my understanding by resolving that when i should have leisure i would look out for an agent upon whom i could depend i had now been nearly two months at sherwood park too long a time i thought to remain in any place and i was impatient to get away my steward who disliked the idea of my spending my summers at home found it easy to persuade me that the water on my estate had a brackish unwholesome taste the man who told me this stood before me in perfect health though he had drunk this insalubrious water all his life but it was too laborious a task for my intellects to compare the evidence of my different senses and i found it most easy to believe what i heard though it was in direct opposition to what i saw away i hurried to a wateringplace after the example of many of my noble contemporaries who leave their delightful countryseats to pay by the inch for being squeezed up in lodginghouses with all imaginable inconvenience during the hottest months in summer i whiled away my time at brighton cursing the heat of the weather till the winter came and then cursing the cold and longing for the london winter the london winter commenced and the young earl of glenthorn and his entertainments and his equipages and extravagance were the conversation of all the world and the joy of the newspapers the immense cost of the fruit at my desserts was recorded the annual expense of the vast nosegays of hothouse flowers worn daily by the footmen who clung behind my coach was calculated the hundreds of wax lights which burned nightly in my house were numbered by the idle admirers of folly and it was known by every body that lord glenthorn suffered nothing but wax to be burned in his stables that his servants drank nothing but claret and champagne that his liveries surpassing the imagination of ambassadors vied with regal magnificence whilst their golden trappings could have stood even the test of chinese curiosity my coachmakers bill for this year if laid before the public would amuse and astonish soberminded people as much as some charges which have lately appeared in our courts of justice for extraordinary coaches and very extraordinary landaus i will not enter into the detail of my extravagance in minor articles of expense these i thought could never be felt by such a fortune as that of the earl of glenthorn but for the information of those who have the same course to run or to avoid i should observe that my diurnal visits to jewellers shops amounted in time to sums worth mentioning of the multitude of baubles that i bought the rings the seals the chains i will give no account it would pass the belief of man and the imagination of woman those who have the least value for their time have usually the greatest number of watches and are the most anxious about the exactness of their going i and my repeaters were my own plagues and the profit of all the fashionable watchmakers whose shops i regularly visited for a lounge my history at this period would be a complete loungers journal but i will spare my readers this diary i wish however as i have had ample experience to impress it on the minds of all whom it may concern that a lounger of fortune must be extravagant i went into shops merely to pass an idle hour but i could not help buying something and i was ever at the mercy of tradesmen who took advantage of my indolence and who thought my fortune inexhaustible i really had not any taste for expense but i let all who dealt with me especially my servants do as they pleased rather than be at the trouble of making them do as they ought they assured me that lord glenthorn must have such and such things and must do so and so and i quietly submitted to this imaginary necessity all this time i was the envy of my acquaintance but i was more deserving of their compassion without anxiety or exertion i possessed every thing they wanted but then i had no motivei had nothing to desire i had an immense fortune and i was the earl of glenthorn my title and wealth were sufficient distinctions how could i be anxious about my boots or the cape of my coat or any of those trifles which so happily interest and occupy the lives of fashionable young men who have not the misfortune to possess large estates most of my companions had some real or imaginary grievance some old uncle or father some cursed profession to complain of but i had none they had hopes and fears but i had none i was on the pinnacle of glory which they were endeavouring to reach and i had nothing to do but to sit still and enjoy the barrenness of the prospect in this recital i have communicated i hope to my readers some portion of that ennui which i endured otherwise they cannot form an adequate idea of my temptation to become a gambler i really had no vice nor any of those propensities which lead to vice but ennui produced most of the effects that are usually attributed to strong passions or a vicious disposition chapter ii o ressource assuree viens ranimer leur langueur desoeuvree leur ame vide est du moins amusee par lavarice en plaisir deguisee gaming relieved me from that insuperable listlessness by which i was oppressed i became interestedi became agitated in short i found a new kind of stimulus and i indulged in it most intemperately i grew immoderately fond of that which supplied me with sensations my days and nights were passed at the gamingtable i remember once spending three days and three nights in the hazardroom of a wellknown house in st jamessstreet the shutters were closed the curtains down and we had candles the whole time even in the adjoining rooms we had candles that when our doors were opened to bring in refreshments no obtrusive gleam of daylight might remind us how the hours had passed how human nature supported the fatigue i know not we scarcely allowed ourselves a moments pause to take the sustenance our bodies required at last one of the markers who had been in the room with us the whole time declared that he could hold out no longer and that sleep he must with difficulty he obtained an hours truce the moment he got out of the room he fell asleep absolutely at the very threshold of our door by the rules of the house he was entitled to a bonus on every transfer of property at the hazardtable and he had made in the course of these three days upwards of three hundred pounds sleep and avarice had struggled to the utmost but with his vulgar habits sleep prevailed we were wide awake i shall never forget the figure of one of my noble associates who sat holding his watch his eager eyes fixed upon the minutehand whilst he exclaimed continually this hour will never be over then he listened to discover whether his watch had stopped then cursed the lazy fellow for falling asleep protesting that for his part he never would again consent to such waste of time the very instant the hour was ended he ordered that dog to be awakened and to work we went at this sitting l were lost and won i was very fortunate for i lost a mere trifleten thousand pounds but i could not expect to be always so luckynow we come to the old story of being ruined by play my english john othescales warned me that he could advance no more money my irish agent upon whom my drafts had indeed been unmerciful could not oblige me any longer and he threw up his agency after having made his fortune at my expense i railed but railing would not pay my debts of honour i inveighed against my grandfather for having tied me up so tight i could neither mortgage nor sell my irish estate would have been sold instantly had it not been settled upon a mr delamere the pleasure of abusing him whom i had never seen and of whom i knew nothing but that he was to be my heir relieved me wonderfully he died and left only a daughter a mere child my chance of possessing the estate in feesimple increased i sold this increased value to the jews and gamed on miss delamere some time afterwards had the smallpox upon the event of her illness i laid bets to an amazing amount she recovered no more money could be raised and my debts were to be paid in this dilemma i recollected that i once had a guardian and that i had never settled accounts with him crawley who continued to be my factotum and flatterer in ordinary and extraordinary informed me upon looking over these accounts that there was a mine of money due to me if i could but obtain it by law or equity to law i went and the anxiety of a lawsuit might have in some degree supplied the place of gambling but that all my business was managed for me by crawley and i charged him never to mention the subject to me till a verdict should be obtained a verdict was obtained against me it was proved in open court by my own witnesses that i was a fool but as no judge jury or chancellor could believe that i was so great a fool as my carelessness indicated my guardian stood acquitted in equity of being so great a rogue as he really was what was now to be done i saw my doom as a highwayman knows that he must come to the gallows at last and acts accordingly so a fashionably extravagant youth knows that sooner or later he must come to matrimony no one could have more horror of this catastrophe than i felt but it was in vain to oppose my destiny my opinion of women had been formed from the commonplace jests of my companions and from my own acquaintance with the worst part of the sex i had never felt the passion of love and of course believed it to be something that might have existed in former ages but that it was in our days quite obsolete at least among the knowing part of the world in my imagination young women were divided into two classes those who were to be purchased and those who were to purchase between these two classes though the division was to be marked externally by a certain degree of ceremony yet i was internally persuaded that there was no essential difference in my feelings towards them there was some distinction of the first class i was tired and of the second i was afraid afraid yesafraid of being taken in with these fears and these sentiments i was now to choose a wife i chose her by the numeration table units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands i was content in the language of the newspapers to lead to the hymeneal altar any fashionable fair one whose fortune came under the sixth place of figures no sooner were my dispositions known than the friends of a young heiress who wanted to purchase a coronet settled a match between us my bride had one hundred weddingdresses elegant as a select committee of dressmakers and milliners french and english could devise the least expensive of these robes as well as i remember cost fifty guineas the most admired came to about five hundred pounds and was thought by the best judges in these matters to be wonderfully cheap as it was of lace such as had never before been trailed in english dust even by the lady of a nabob these things were shown in london as a spectacle for some days by the dressmaker who declared that she had lost many a nights rest in contriving how to make such a variety of dresses sufficiently magnificent and distinguished the jewellers also requested and obtained permission to exhibit the different sets of jewels these were so numerous that lady glenthorn scarcely knew them all one day soon after her marriage somebody at court observing that her diamonds were prodigiously fine asked where she bought them really said she i cannot tell i have so many sets i declare i dont know whether its my paris or my hamburgh or my london set poor young creature i believe her chief idea of happiness in marriage was the possession of the jewels and paraphernalia of a countessi am sure it was the only hope she could have that was likely to be realized in marrying me i thought it manly and fashionable to be indifferent if not contemptuous to my wife i considered her only as an incumbrance that i was obliged to take along with my fortune besides the disagreeable ideas generally connected with the word wife i had some peculiar reasons for my aversion to my lady glenthorn before her friends would suffer me to take possession of her fortune they required from me a solemn oath against gambling so i was compelled to abjure the hazardtable and the turf the only two objects in life that could keep me awake this extorted vow i set down entirely to my brides account and i therefore became even more averse to her than men usually are who marry for money yet this dislike subsided lady glenthorn was only childishi of an easy temper i thought her ridiculous but it was too much trouble to tell her so continually i let the occasions pass and even forgot her ladyship when she was not absolutely in my way she was too frivolous to be hated and the passion of hatred was not to be easily sustained in my mind the habit of ennui was stronger than all my passions put together chapter iii or realize what we think fabulous i th bill of fare of eliogabalus after my marriage my old malady rose to an insupportable height the pleasures of the table were all that seemed left to me in life most of the young men of any ton either were or pretended to be connoisseurs in the science of good eating their talk was of sauces and of cooks what dishes each cook was famous for whether his forte lay in white sauces or brown in soups lentilles fricandeaus bechemele matelotes daubes c then the history and genealogy of the cooks came after the discussion of the merit of the works whom my lord cs cook lived with formerlywhat my lord d gave his cookwhere they met with these great geniuses c i cannot boast that our conversation at these select dinners from which the ladies were excluded was very entertaining but true good eaters detest wit at dinnertime and sentiment at all times i think i observed that amongst these cognoscenti there was scarcely one to whom the delicacy of taste did not daily prove a source of more pain than pleasure there was always a cruel something that spoiled the rest or if the dinner were excellent beyond the power of the most fastidious palate to condemn yet there was the hazard of being placed far from the favourite dish or the still greater danger of being deputed to carve at the head or foot of the table how i have seen a heavy nobleman of this set dexterously manoeuvre to avoid the dangerous honour of carving a haunch of venison but good heavens said i when a confidential whisper first pointed out this to my notice why does he not like to carvehe would have it in his power to help himself to his mind which nobody else can do so wellno if he carve he must give the nice bits to others every body here understands them as well as heeach knows what is upon his neighbours plate and what ought to be there and what must be in the dish i found that it was an affair of calculationa game at which nobody can cheat without being discovered and disgraced i emulated and soon equalled my experienced friends i became a perfect epicure and gloried in the character for it could be supported without any intellectual exertion and it was fashionable i cannot say that i could ever eat as much as some of my companions one of them i once heard exclaim after a monstrous dinner i wish my digestion were equal to my appetite i would not be thought to exaggerate therefore i shall not recount the wonders i have seen performed by these capacious heroes of the table after what i have beheld to say nothing of what i have achieved i can believe any thing that is related of the capacity of the human stomach i can credit even the account of the dinner which madame de baviere affirms she saw eaten by lewis the fourteenth viz quatre assiettes de differentes soupes un faisan tout entier un perdrix une grande assiette pleine de salade du mouton coupe dans son jus avec de lail deux bons morceaux de jambon une assiette pleine de patisserie du fruit et des confitures nor can i doubt the accuracy of the historian who assures us that a roman emperor one of the most moderate of those imperial gluttons took for his breakfast figs peaches melons beccaficoes and oysters epicurism was scarcely more prevalent during the decline of the roman empire than it is at this day amongst some of the wealthy and noble youths of britain not one of my select dinnerparty but would have been worthy of a place at the turbot consultation immortalized by the roman satirist a friend of mine a bishop one day went into his kitchen to look at a large turbot which the cook was dressing the cook had found it so large that he had cut off the fins what a shame cried the bishop and immediately calling for the cooks apron he spread it before his cassock and actually sewed the fins again to the turbot with his own episcopal hands if i might judge from my own experience i should attribute fashionable epicurism in a great measure to ennui many affect it because they have nothing else to do and sensual indulgences are all that exist for those who have not sufficient energy to enjoy intellectual pleasures i dare say that if heliogabalus could be brought in evidence in his own case and could be made to understand the meaning of the word ennui he would agree with me in opinion that it was the cause of half his vices his offered reward for the discovery of a new pleasure is stronger evidence than any confession he could make i thank god that i was not born an emperor or i might have become a monster though not in the least inclined to cruelty i might have acquired the taste for it merely for desire of the emotion which real tragedies excite fortunately i was only an earl and an epicure my indulgence in the excesses of the table injured my health violent bodily exercise was necessary to counteract the effects of intemperance it was my maxim that a man could never eat or drink too much if he would but take exercise enough i killed fourteen horses and survived but i grew tired of killing horses and i continued to eat immoderately i was seized with a nervous complaint attended with extreme melancholy frequently the thoughts of putting an end to my existence occurred and i had many times determined upon the means but very small and apparently inadequate and ridiculous motives prevented the execution of my design once i was kept alive by a piggery which i wanted to see finished another time i delayed destroying myself till a statue which i had just purchased at a vast expense should be put up in my egyptian salon by the awkwardness of the unpacker the statues thumb was broken this broken thumb saved my life it converted ennui into anger like montaigne and his sausage i had now something to complain of and i was happy but at last my anger subsided the thumb would serve me no longer as a subject of conversation and i relapsed into silence and black melancholy i was aweary of the sun my old thoughts recurred at this time i was just entering my twentyfifth year rejoicings were preparing for my birthday my lady glenthorn had prevailed upon me to spend the summer at sherwood park because it was new to her she filled the house with company and noise but this only increased my discontent my birthday arrivedi wished myself deadand i resolved to shoot myself at the close of the day i put a pistol into my pocket and stole out towards the evening unobserved by my jovial companions lady glenthorn and her set were dancing and i was tired of these sounds of gaiety i took the private way to the forest which was near the house but one of my grooms met me with a fine horse which an old tenant had just sent as a present on my birthday the horse was saddled and bridled the groom held the stirrup and up i got the fellow told me the private gate was locked and i turned as he pointed to go through the grand entrance at the outside of the gate sat upon the ground huddled in a great red cloak an old woman who started up and sprang forwards the moment she saw me stretching out her arms and her cloak with one and the same motion ogh is it you i see cried she in a strong irish tone at this sound and this sight my horse that was shy backed a little i called to the woman to stand out of my way heaven bless your sweet face im the nurse that suckled yees when ye was a baby in ireland manys the day ive been longing to see you continued she clasping her hands and standing her ground in the middle of the gateway regardless of my horse which i was pressing forward stand out of the way for gods sake my good woman or i shall certainly ride over you so so so said i patting my restless horse oh hes only shy god bless him hes as quite now as a lamb and kiss one or other of yees i must cried she throwing her arms about the horses neck the horse unaccustomed to this mode of salutation suddenly plunged and threw me my head fell against the pier of the gate the last sound i heard was the report of a pistol but i can give no account of what happened afterwards i was stunned by my fall and senseless when i opened my eyes i found myself stretched on one of the cushions of my landau and surrounded by a crowd of people who seemed to be all talking at once in the buzz of voices i could not distinguish any thing that was said till i heard captain crawleys voice above the rest saying send for a surgeon instantly but its all over its all over take the body the back way to the banquetinghouse i must run to lady glenthorn i perceived that they thought me dead i did not at this moment feel that i was hurt i was curious to know what they would all do so i closed my eyes again before any one perceived that i had opened them i lay motionless and they proceeded with me according to captain crawleys orders to the banquetinghouse when we arrived there my servants laid me on one of the turkish sofas and the crowd after having satisfied their curiosity dropped off one by one till i was left with a single footman and my steward i dont believe hes quite dead said the footman for his heart beats oh hes the same as dead for he does not stir hand or foot and his skull they say is fractured for certain but it will all be seen when the surgeon comes i am sure he will never do crawley will have every thing his own way now and i may as well decamp ay and among them said the footman i only hope i may get my wages what a fool that crawley made of my lord said the steward what a fool my lord made of himself said the footman to be ruled and let all his people be ruled by such an upstart with your leave mr turner ill just run to the house to say one word to james and be back immediately no no you must stay robert whilst i step home to lock my places before crawley begins to rummage the footman was now left alone with me scarcely had the steward been gone two minutes when i heard a low voice near me saying in a tone of great anxiety is he dead i half opened my eyes to see who it was that spoke the voice came from the door which was opposite to me and whilst the footman turned his back i raised my head and beheld the figure of the old woman who had been the cause of my accident she was upon her knees on the thresholdher arms crossed over her breast i never shall forget her face it was so expressive of despair is he dead she repeated i tell you yes replied the footman for the love of god let me come in if he is here cried she come in then and stay here whilst i run to the house the footman ran off and my old nurse on seeing me burst into an agony of grief i did not understand one word she uttered as she spoke in her native language but her lamentations went to my heart for they came from hers she hung over me and i felt her tears dropping upon my forehead i could not refrain from whispering dont cryi am alive blessings on him exclaimed she starting back she then dropped down on her knees to thank god then calling me by every fondling name that nurses use to their children she begged my forgiveness and alternately cursed herself and prayed for me the strong affections of this poor woman touched me more than any thing i had ever yet felt in my life she seemed to be the only person upon earth who really cared for me and in spite of her vulgarity and my prejudice against the tone in which she spoke she excited in my mind emotions of tenderness and gratitude my good woman if i live i will do something for you tell me what i can do said i live live god bless you live thats all in the wide world i want of you my jewel and till you are well let me watch over you at nights as i used to do when you were a child and i had you in my arms all to myself dear three or four people now ran into the room to get before captain crawley whose voice was heard at this instant at a distance i had only time to make the poor woman understand that i wished to appear to be dead she took the hint with surprising quickness captain crawley came up the steps talking in the tone of a master to the steward and people who followed what is this old hag doing here where is robert where is thomas i ordered them to stay till i came mr turner why did not you stay what has not the coroner been here yet the coroner must see the body i tell you good god what a parcel of blockheads you all are how many times must i tell you the same thing nothing can be done till the coroner has seen him then well talk about the funeral mr turnerone thing at a time every thing shall be done properly mr turner lady glenthorn trusts every thing to melady glenthorn wishes that i should order every thing to be sureno doubtvery properi dont say against that but continued crawley turning towards the sofa upon which i lay and seeing ellinor kneeling beside me what keeps this old irish witch here still what business have you here pray and who are you or what are you plase your honour i was his nurse formerly and so had a natral longing to see him once again before i would die and did you come all the way from ireland on this wise errand troth i didevery inch of the way from his own sweet place why you are little better than a fool i think said crawley little better plase your honour but i was always so about them childer that i nursed childer well get along about your business now you see your nursing is not wanted here ill not stir out of this while he is here said my nurse catching hold of the leg of the sofa and clinging to it youll not stir you say cried captain crawley turn her out oh sure you would not have the crulty to turn his old nurse out before hes even cowld and wont you let me see him buried out with her out with her the old irish hag well have no howling here out with her john said crawley to my groom the groom hesitated i fancy for crawley repeated the order more imperiously out with her or go yourself may be its you that will go first yourself said she go first myself cried captain crawley furiously are you insolent to me and are not you crul to me and to my child i nursed that lies all as one as dead before you and was a good friend to you in his day no doubt crawley seized hold of her but she resisted with so much energy that she dragged along with her the sofa to which she clung and on which i lay stop cried i starting up there was sudden silence i looked round but could not utter another syllable now for the first time i was sensible that i had been really hurt by the fall my head grew giddy and my stomach sick i just saw crawleys fallen countenance and him and the steward looking at one another they were like hideous faces in a dream i sunk back ay lie down my darling dont be disturbing yourself for such as them said my nurse let them do what they will with me its little id care for them if you were but once in safe hands i beckoned to the groom who had hesitated to turn out ellinor and bid him go to the housekeeper and have me put to bed she added i pointing to my old nurse is to sit up with me at night it was all i could say what they did with me afterwards i do not know but i was in my bed and a bandage was round my temples and my poor nurse was kneeling on one side of the bed with a string of beads in her hand and a surgeon and physician and crawley and my lady glenthorn were on the other side whispering together the curtain was drawn between me and them but the motion i made on wakening was instantly observed by crawley who immediately left the room lady glenthorn drew back my curtain and began to ask me how i did but when i fixed my eyes upon her she sunk upon the bed trembling violently and could not finish her sentence i begged her to go to rest and she retired the physician ordered that i should be kept quiet and seemed to think i was in danger i asked what was the matter with me and the surgeon with a very grave face informed me that i had an ugly contusion on my head i had heard of a concussion of the brain but i did not know distinctly what it was and my fears were increased by my ignorance the life which but a few hours before i had been on the point of voluntarily destroying because it was insupportably burdensome i was now the moment it was in danger most anxious to preserve and the interest which i perceived others had in getting rid of me increased my desire to recover my recovery was however for some time doubtful i was seized with a fever which left me in a state of alarming debility my old nurse whom i shall henceforward call by her name of ellinor attended me with the most affectionate solicitude during my illness she scarcely stirred from my bedside night or day and indeed when i came to the use of my senses she was the only person whom i really liked to have near me i knew that she was sincere and however unpolished her manners and however awkward her assistance the goodwill with which it was given made me prefer it to the most delicate and dexterous attentions which i believed to be interested the very want of a sense of propriety and the freedom with which she talked to me regardless of what was suited to her station or due to my rank instead of offending or disgusting me became agreeable besides the novelty of her dialect and of her turn of thought entertained me as much as a sick man could be entertained i remember once her telling me that if it plased god she would like to die on a christmasday of all days because the gates of heaven they say will be open all that day and who knows but a body might slip in unknownst when she sat up with me at nights she talked on eternally for she assured me there was nothing like talking as she had found to put one asy asleep i listened or not just as i liked any way she was contint she was inexhaustible in her anecdotes of my ancestors all tending to the honour and glory of the family she had also an excellent memory for all the insults or traditions of insults which the glenthorns had received for many ages back even to the times of the old kings of ireland long and long before they stooped to be lorded when their names which it was a pity and a murder and moreover a burning shame to change was oshaughnessy she was wellstored with histories of irish and scotish chiefs the story of oneill the irish blackbeard i am sure i ought to remember for ellinor told it to me at least six times then she had a large assortment of fairies and shadowless witches and banshees and besides she had legions of spirits and ghosts and haunted castles without end my own castle of glenthorn not excepted in the description of which she was extremely eloquent she absolutely excited in my mind some desire to see it for many a long year she said it had been her nightly prayer that she might live to see me in my own castle and often and often she was coming over to england to tell me so only her husband as long as he lived would not let her set out on what he called a fools errand but it pleased god to take him to himself last fair day and then she resolved that nothing should hinder her to be with her own child against his birthday and now could she see me in my own castle glenthorn she would die contintand what a pity but i should be in it i was only a lord as she said in england but i could be all as one as a king in ireland ellinor impressed me with the idea of the sort of feudal power i should possess in my vast territory over tenants who were almost vassals and amongst a numerous train of dependents we resist the efforts made by those who we think exert authority or employ artifice to change our determinations whilst the perverse mind insensibly yields to those who appear not to have power or reason or address sufficient to obtain a victory i should not have heard any human being with patience try to persuade me to go to ireland except this ignorant poor nurse who spoke as i thought merely from the instinct of affection to me and to her native country i promised her that i would some time or other visit glenthorn castle but this was only a vague promise and it was but little likely that it should be accomplished as i regained my strength my mind turned or rather was turned to other thoughts chapter iv one morningit was the day after my physicians had pronounced me out of all dangercrawley sent me a note by ellinor congratulating me upon my recovery and begging to speak to me for half an hour i refused to see him and said that i was not yet well enough to do business the same morning ellinor came with a message from turner my steward who with his humble duty requested to see me for five minutes to communicate to me something of importance i consented to see turner he entered with a face of suppressed joy and affected melancholy sad news i am bound in duty to be the bearer of my lord i was determined whatever came to pass however not to speak till your honour was out of danger which i thank heaven is now the case and i am happy to be able to congratulate your lordship upon looking as well as never mind my looks i will excuse your congratulations mr turner said i impatiently for the recollection of the banquetinghouse and the undertaker whom turner was so eager to introduce came full into my mind go on if you please five minutes is all i am at present able to give to any business and you sent me word you had something of importance to communicate true my lord but in case your lordship is not at present well enough or not so disposed i will wait your lordships leisure now or never mr turner speak but speak at once my lord i would have done so long ago but was loth to make mischief and besides could not believe what i heard whispered and would scarce believe what i verily saw though now as i cannot reasonably have a doubt i think it would be a sin and a burden upon my conscience not to speak only that i am unwilling to shock your lordship too much when but just recovering for that is not the time one would wish to tell or to hear disagreeable things mr turner either come to the point at once or leave me for i am not strong enough to bear this suspense i beg pardon my lord why then my lord the point is captain crawley what of him i never desire to hear his name again nor i i am sure my lord but there are some in the house might not be of our opinion who you sneaking fellow speak out cant you my ladymy lordnow it is out shell go off with him this night if not prevented my surprise and indignation were as great as if i had always been the fondest and the most attentive of husbands i was at length roused from that indifference and apathy into which i had sunk and though i had never loved my wife the moment i knew she was lost to me for ever was exquisitely painful astonishment the sense of disgrace the feeling of rage against that treacherous parasite by whom she had been seduced all combined to overwhelm me i could command my voice only enough to bid turner leave the room and tell no one that he had spoken to me on this subject not a soul he said should be told or could guess it left to my own reflections as soon as the first emotions of anger subsided i blamed myself for my conduct to lady glenthorn i considered that she had been married to me by her friends when she was too young and too childish to judge for herself that from the first day of our marriage i had never made the slightest effort to win her affections or to guide her conduct that on the contrary i had shown her marked indifference if not aversion with fashionable airs i had professed that provided she left me at liberty to spend the large fortune which she brought me and in consideration of which she enjoyed the title of countess of glenthorn i cared for nothing farther with the consequences of my neglect i now reproached myself in vain lady glenthorns immense fortune had paid my debts and had for two years supplied my extravagance or rather my indolence little remained and she was now in her twentythird year to be consigned to public disgrace and to a man whom i knew to be destitute of honour and feeling i pitied her and resolved to go instantly and make an effort to save her from destruction ellinor who watched all crawleys motions informed me that he was gone to a neighbouring town and had left word that he should not be home till after dinner lady glenthorn was in her dressingroom which was at a part of the house farthest from that which i now inhabited i had never left my room since my illness and had scarcely walked farther than from my bed to my armchair but i was so much roused by my feelings at this instant that to ellinors great astonishment i started from my chair and forbidding her to follow me walked without any assistance along the corridor which led to the backstairs and to lady glenthorns apartment i opened the private door of her dressingroom suddenlythe room was in great disorderher woman was upon her knees packing a trunk lady glenthorn was standing at a table with a parcel of open letters before her and a diamond necklace in her hand she started at the sight of me as if she had beheld a ghost the maid screamed and ran to a door at the farther end of the room to make her escape but that was bolted lady glenthorn was pale and motionless till i approached and then recollecting herself she reddened all over and thrust the letters into her tabledrawer her woman at the same instant snatched a casket of jewels swept up in her arms a heap of clothes and huddled them all together into the halfpacked trunk leave the room said i to her sternly she locked the trunk pocketed the key and obeyed i placed a chair for lady glenthorn and sat down myself we were almost equally unable to stand we were silent for some moments her eyes were fixed upon the ground and she leaned her head upon her hand in an attitude of despair i could scarcely articulate but making an effort to command my voice i at last said lady glenthorn i blame myself more than you for all that has happened for what said she making a feeble attempt at evasion yet at the same time casting a guilty look towards the drawer of letters you have nothing to conceal from me said i nothing said she in a feeble voice nothing said i for i know every thingshe startedand am willing to pardon every thing she looked up in my face astonished i am conscious continued i that you have not been well treated by me you have had much reason to complain of my neglect to this i attribute your error forget the pasti will set you the example promise me never to see the man more and what has happened shall never be known to the world she made me no answer but burst into a flood of tears she seemed incapable of decision or even of thought i felt suddenly inspired with energy write this moment continued i placing a pen and ink before her write to forbid him ever to return to this house or ever more to appear in your presence if he should appear in mine i know how to chastise him and to vindicate my own honour to preserve your reputation i refrain upon these conditions from making my contempt of him public i put a pen into lady glenthorns hand but she trembled so that she could not write she made several ineffectual attempts then tore the paper and again giving way to tears exclaimed i cannot writei cannot thinki do not know what to say write what you will and i will sign it i write to captain crawley write what i will lady glenthorn it must be your will to write not mine if it be not your will say so oh i do not say soi do not say that give me a moments time i do not know what i say i have been very foolishvery wicked you are very goodbut it is too late it will all be known crawley will betray me he will tell it to mrs mattocks so whichever way i turn i am undone oh what will become of me she wrung her hands and wept and was for an hour in this state in all the indecision and imbecility of a child at last she wrote a few scarcely legible lines to crawley forbidding him to see or think of her more i despatched the note and she was full of penitence and gratitude and tears the next morning when i wakened i in my turn received a note from her ladyship since i saw you captain crawley has convinced me that i am his wife in the eye of heaven and i therefore desire a divorce as much as your whole conduct since my marriage convinces me you must in your heart whatever may be your motives to pretend otherwise before you receive this i shall be out of your way and beyond your reach so do not think of pursuing one who is no longer yours a crawley after reading this note i thought not of pursuing or saving lady glenthorn i was as anxious for a divorce as she could be some months afterwards the affair was brought to a public trial when the cause came on so many circumstances were brought in mitigation of damages to prove my utter carelessness respecting my wifes conduct that a suspicion of collusion arose from this imputation i was clear in the opinion of all who really knew me and i repelled the charge publicly with a degree of indignation that surprised all who knew the usual apathy of my temper i must observe that during the whole time my divorcebill was pending and whilst i was in the greatest possible anxiety my health was perfectly good but no sooner was the affair settled and a decision made in my favour than i relapsed into my old nervous complaints chapter v twas doing nothing was his curse is there a vice can plague us worse the wretch who digs the mine for bread or ploughs that others may be fed feels less fatigue than that decreed to him who cannot think or read illness was a sort of occupation to me and i was always sorry to get well when the interest of being in danger ceased i had no other to supply its place i fancied that i should enjoy my liberty after my divorce but even freedom grew tasteless i do not recollect any thing that wakened me from my torpor during two months after my divorce except a violent quarrel between all my english servants and my irish nurse whether she assumed too much upon the idea that she was a favourite or whether national prejudice was alone the cause of the hatred that prevailed against her i know not but they one and all declared that they could not and would not live with her she expressed the same dislike to consorting with them but would put up with worse ay with the devils themselves to oblige my honour and to lie under the same roof wid my honour the rest of the servants laughed at her blunders this she could bear with goodhumour but when they seriously affected to reproach her with having by her uncouth appearance at her first presenting herself at sherwood park endangered my life she retorted and who cared for him in the wide world but i amongst you all when he lay for dead i ask you that said she to this there was no reply and they hated her the more for their having been silenced by her shrewdness i protected her as long as i could but for the sake of peace i at last yielded to the combined forces of the stewards room and the servants hall and despatched ellinor to ireland with a renewal of the promise that i would visit glenthorn castle this year or the next to comfort her at parting i would have made her a considerable present but she would take only a few guineas to bear her expenses back to her native place the sacrifice i made did not procure me a peace of any continuance in my own houseruined by indulgence and by my indolent reckless temper my servants were now my masters in a large illregulated establishment domestics become like spoiled children discontented capricious and the tyrants over those who have not the sense or steadiness to command i remember one delicate puppy parted with me because as he informed me the curtains of his bed did not close at the foot he had never been used to such a thing and had told the housekeeper so three times but could obtain no redress which necessitated him to beg my permission to retire from the service in his stead another coxcomb came to offer himself who with an incomparably easy air begged to know whether i wanted a man of figure or a man of parts for the benefit of those to whom this fashionable classification of domestics may not be familiar i should observe that the department of a man of figure is specially and solely to announce company on gala days the business of the man of parts is multifarious to write cards of invitation to speak to impertinent tradesmen to carry confidential messages et cetera now where there is an et cetera in an agreement there is always an opening for dispute the functions of the man of parts not being accurately defined i unluckily required from him some service which was not in his bond i believe it was to go for my pocket handkerchief he could not possibly do it because it was not his business and i the laziest of mortals after waiting a full quarter of an hour whilst they were settling whose business it was to obey me was forced to get up and go for what i wanted i comforted myself by the recollection of the poor king of spain and le brasier with a regal precedent i could not but be satisfied all great people said i to myself are obliged to submit to these inconveniences i submitted with so good a grace that my submission was scarcely felt to be a condescension my bachelors house soon exhibited in perfection high life below stairs it is said that a foreign nobleman permitted his servants to take their own way so completely that one night he and his guests being kept waiting an unconscionable time for supper he at last went down stairs to inquire into the cause of the delay he found the servant whose business it was to take up supper quietly at cards with a large party of his friends the man coolly remonstrated that it was impossible to leave his game unfinished the master candidly acknowledged the force of his plea but insisted upon the mans going up stairs to lay the cloth for supper whilst he took his cards sat down and finished the game for him the suavity of my temper never absolutely reached this degree of complaisance my home was disagreeable to me i had not the resolution to remove the causes of the discontents every day i swore i would part with all these rascals the next morning but still they stayed abroad i was not happier than at home i was disgusted with my former companions they had convinced me the night of my accident at sherwood park that they cared not whether i was alive or dead and ever since that time i had been more and more struck with their selfishness as well as folly it was inexpressibly fatiguing and irksome to me to keep up a show of good fellowship and joviality with these people though i had not sufficient energy to make the attempt to quit them when these dashers and loungers found that i was not always at their disposal they discovered that glenthorn had always something odd about him that glenthorn had always a melancholy turn that it ran in the family c satisfied with these phrases they let me take my own way and forgot my existence public amusements had lost their charm i had sufficient steadiness to resist the temptation to game but for want of stimulus i could hardly endure the tedium of my days at this period of my life ennui was very near turning into misanthropy i balanced between becoming a misanthrope and a democrat whilst i was in this critical state of ineptitude my attention was accidentally roused by the sight of a boxingmatch my feelings were so much excited and the excitation was so delightful that i was now in danger of becoming an amateur of the pugilistic art it did not occur to me that it was beneath the dignity of a british nobleman to learn the vulgar terms of the boxing trade i soon began to talk very knowingly of firstrate bruisers game men and pleasing fighters making playbeating a man under the ropessparringrallyingsawingand chopping what farther proficiency i might have made in this language or how long my interest in these feats of prizefighters might have continued had i been left to myself i cannot determine but i was unexpectedly seized with a fit of national shame on hearing a foreigner of rank and reputation express astonishment at our taste for these savage spectacles it was in vain that i repeated the arguments of some of the parliamentary panegyrists of boxing and bullbaiting and asserted that these diversions render a people hardy and courageous my opponent replied that he did not perceive the necessary connexion between cruelty and courage that he did not comprehend how the standing by in safety to see two men bruise each other almost to death could evince or inspire heroic sentiments or warlike dispositions he observed that the romans were most eager for the fights of gladiators during the reigns of the most effeminate and cruel emperors and in the decline of all public spirit and virtue these arguments would have probably made but a feeble impression on an understanding like mine unaccustomed to general reasoning and on a temper habituated to pursue without thought of consequences my immediate individual gratification but it happened that my feelings were touched at this time by the dreadful sufferings of one of the pugilistic combatants he died a few hours after the battle he was an irishman most of the spectators being english and triumphing in the victory of their countryman the poor fellows fate was scarcely noticed i spoke to him a little while before he died and found that he came from my own county his name was michael noonan he made it his dying request that i would carry halfaguinea the only money he possessed to his aged father and a silk handkerchief he had worn round his neck to his sister pity for this unfortunate irishman recalled ireland to my thoughts many small reasons concurred to make me now desirous of going to that country i should get rid at once of a tormenting establishment and of servants without the odium of turning them away for most of them declined going into banishment as they called it besides this i should leave my companions with whom i was disgusted i was tired of england and wanted to see something new even if it were to be worse than what i had seen before these were not my ostensible reasons i professed to have more exalted motives for my journey it was my duty i said to visit my irish estate and to encourage my tenantry by residing some time among them duties often spring up to our view at a convenient opportunity then my promise to poor ellinor it was impossible for a man of honour to break a promise even to an old woman in short when people are determined upon any action they seldom fail to find arguments capable of convincing them that their resolution is reasonable mixed motives govern the conduct of half mankind so i set out upon my journey to ireland chapter vi es tu contente a la fleur de tes ans as tu des gouts et des amusemens tu dois mener une assez douce vie lautre en deux mots repondait je mennuie cest un grand mal dit la fee et je crois quun beau secret est de rester chez soi i was detained six days by contrary winds at holyhead sick of that miserable place in my illhumour i cursed ireland and twice resolved to return to london but the wind changed my carriage was on board the packet so i sailed and landly safely in dublin i was surprised by the excellence of the hotel at which i was lodged i had not conceived that such accommodation could have been found in dublin the house had as i was told belonged to a nobleman it was fitted up and appointed with a degree of elegance and even magnificence beyond what i had been used to in the most fashionable hotels in london ah sir said an irish gentleman who found me in admiration upon the staircase this is all very good very fine but it is too good and too fine to last come here again in two years and i am afraid you will see all this going to rack and ruin this is too often the case with us in ireland we can project but we cant calculate we must have every thing upon too large a scale we mistake a grand beginning for a good beginning we begin like princes and we end like beggars i rested only a few days in a capital in which i took it for granted there could be nothing worth seeing by a person who was just come from london in driving through the streets i was however surprised to see buildings which my prejudices could scarcely believe to be irish i also saw some things which recalled to my mind the observations i had heard at my hotel i was struck with instances of grand beginnings and lamentable want of finish with mixture of the magnificent and the paltry of admirable and execrable taste though my understanding was wholly uncultivated these things struck my eye of all the faculties of my mind my taste had been most exercised because its exercise had given me least trouble impatient to see my own castle i left dublin i was again astonished by the beauty of the prospects and the excellence of the roads i had in my ignorance believed that i was never to see a tree in ireland and that the roads were almost impassable with the promptitude of credulity i now went from one extreme to the other i concluded that we should travel with the same celerity as upon the bath road and i expected that a journey for which four days had been allotted might be performed in two like all those who have nothing to do any where i was always in a prodigious hurry to get from place to place and i ever had a noble ambition to go over as much ground as possible in a given space of time i travelled in a light barouche and with my own horses my own man an englishman and my cook a frenchman followed in a hackney chaise i cared not how so that they kept up with me the rest was their affair at night my gentleman complained bitterly of the irish post carriages and besought me to let him follow at an easier rate the next day but to this i could by no means consent for how could i exist without my own man and my french cook in the morning just as i was ready to set off and had thrown myself back in my carriage my englishman and frenchman came to the door both in so great a rage that the one was inarticulate and the other unintelligible at length the object of their indignation spoke for itself from the inn yard came a hackney chaise in a most deplorable crazy state the body mounted up to a prodigious height on unbending springs nodding forwards one door swinging open three blinds up because they could not be let down the perch tied in two places the iron of the wheels half off half loose wooden pegs for linchpins and ropes for harness the horses were worthy of the harness wretched little dogtired creatures that looked as if they had been driven to the last gasp and as if they had never been rubbed down in their lives their bones starting through their skin one lame the other blind one with a raw back the other with a galled breast one with his neck poking down over his collar and the other with his head dragged forward by a bit of a broken bridle held at arms length by a man dressed like a mad beggar in half a hat and half a wig both awry in opposite directions a long tattered greatcoat tied round his waist by a hayrope the jagged rents in the skirts of his coat showing his bare legs marbled of many colours while something like stockings hung loose about his ankles the noises he made by way of threatening or encouraging his steeds i pretend not to describe in an indignant voice i called to the landlord i hope these are not the horsesi hope this is not the chaise intended for my servants the innkeeper and the pauper who was preparing to officiate as postilion both in the same instant exclaimed sorrow better chaise in the county sorrow said i what do you mean by sorrow that theres no better plase your honour can be seen we have two more to be sure but one has no top and the other no bottom any way theres no better can be seen than this same and these horses cried i why this horse is so lame he can hardly stand oh plase your honour tho he cant stand hell go fast enough he has a great deal of the rogue in him plase your honour hes always that way at first setting out and that wretched animal with the galled breast hes all the better for it when once he warms its he that will go with the speed of light plase your honour sure is not he knockecroghery and didnt i give fifteen guineas for him barring the luck penny at the fair of knockecroghery and he rising four year old at the same time i could not avoid smiling at this speech but my gentleman maintaining his angry gravity declared in a sullen tone that he would be cursed if he went with such horses and the frenchman with abundance of gesticulation made a prodigious chattering which no mortal understood then ill tell you what youll do said paddy youll take four as becomes gentlemen of your quality and youll see how well powder along and straight he put the knuckle of his forefinger in his mouth and whistled shrill and strong and in a moment a whistle somewhere out in the fields answered him i protested against these proceedings but in vain before the first pair of horses were fastened to the chaise up came a little boy with the others fresh from the plough they were quick enough in putting these to yet how they managed it with their tackle i know not now were fixed handsomely said paddy but this chaise will break down the first mile is it this chaise plase your honour ill engage it will go the worlds end the universe wouldnt break it down now sure it was mended but last night then seizing his whip and reins in one hand he clawed up his stockings with the other so with one easy step he got into his place and seated himself coachmanlike upon a wellworn bar of wood that served as a coachbox throw me the loan of a trusty bartly for a cushion said he a frieze coat was thrown up over the horses headspaddy caught it where are you hosey cried he sure im only rowling a wisp of straw on my leg replied hosey throw me up added this paragon of postilions turning to one of the crowd of idle bystanders arrah push me up cant ye a man took hold of his knee and threw him upon the horse he was in his seat in a trice then clinging by the mane of his horse he scrambled for the bridle which was under the other horses feetreached it and well satisfied with himself looked round at paddy who looked back to the chaisedoor at my angry servants secure in the last event of things in vain the englishman in monotonous anger and the frenchman in every note of the gamut abused paddy necessity and wit were on paddys side he parried all that was said against his chaise his horses himself and his country with invincible comic dexterity till at last both his adversaries dumbfoundered clambered into the vehicle where they were instantly shut up in straw and darkness paddy in a triumphant tone called to my postilions bidding them get on and not be stopping the way any longer without uttering a syllable they drove on but they could not nor could i refrain from looking back to see how those fellows would manage we saw the forehorses make towards the right then to the left and every way but straight forwards whilst paddy bawled to hoseykeep the middle of the road cant ye i dont want ye to draw a pound atallatall at last by dint of whipping the four horses were compelled to set off in a lame gallop but they stopped short at a hill near the end of the town whilst a shouting troop of ragged boys followed and pushed them fairly to the top half an hour afterwards as we were putting on our dragchain to go down another steep hillto my utter astonishment paddy with his horses in full gallop came rattling and chehupping past us my people called to warn him that he had no drag but still he cried never fear and shaking the long reins and stamping with his foot on he went thundering down the hill my englishmen were aghast the turn yonder below at the bottom of the hill is as sharp and ugly as ever i see said my postilion after a moments stupified silence he will break their necks as sure as my name is john quite the contrary when we had dragged and undragged and came up to paddy we found him safe on his legs mending some of his tackle very quietly if that had broken as you were going down the steep hill said i it would have been all over with you paddy thats true plase your honour but it never happened me going down hillnor never will by the blessing of god if ive any luck with this mixed confidence in a special providence and in his own good luck paddy went on much to my amusement it was his glory to keep before us and he rattled on till he came to a narrow part of the road where they were rebuilding a bridge here there was a dead stop paddy lashed his horses and called them all manner of names but the wheel horse knockecroghery was restive and at last began to kick most furiously it seemed inevitable that the first kick which should reach the splinterbar at which it was aimed must demolish it instantly my english gentleman and my frenchman both put their heads out of the only window which was pervious and called most manfully to be let out never fear said paddy to open the door for themselves was beyond their force or skill one of the hind wheels which had belonged to another carriage was too high to suffer the door to be opened and the blind at the other side prevented their attempts so they were close prisoners the men who had been at work on the broken bridge came forward and rested on their spades to see the battle as my carriage could not pass i was also compelled to be a spectator of this contest between man and horse never fear reiterated paddy ill engage ill be up wid him now for it knockecroghery oh the rogue he thinks he has me at a nonplush but ill show him the differ after this brag of war paddy whipped knockecroghery kicked and paddy seemingly unconscious of danger sat within reach of the kicking horse twitching up first one of his legs then the other and shifting as the animal aimed his hoofs escaping every time as it were by miracle with a mixture of temerity and presence of mind which made us alternately look upon him as a madman and a hero he gloried in the danger secure of success and of the sympathy of the spectators ah didnt i compass him cleverly then oh the villain to be browbating me im too cute for him yet see there now hes come to and ill be his bail hell go asy enough wid me ogh he has a fine spirit of his own but its i that can match him twould be a poor case if a man like me coudnt match a horse any way let alone a mare which this is or it never would be so vicious after this hardfought battle and suitable rejoicing for the victory paddy walked his subdued adversary on a few yards to allow us to pass him but to the dismay of my postilions a hayrope was at this instant thrown across the road before our horses by the roadmakers who to explain this proceeding cried out plase your honour the road is so dry wed expect a trifle to wet it what do these fellows mean said i its only a tester or a hog they want your honour to give em to drink your honours health said paddy a hog to drink my health ay that is a thirteen plase your honour all as one as an english shilling i threw them a shilling the hayrope was withdrawn and at last we went on we heard no more of paddy till evening he came in two hours after us and expected to be doubly paid for driving my honours gentlemen so well i must say that on this journey though i met with many delays and disasters though one of my horses was lamed in shoeing by a smith who came home drunk from a funeral and though the back pannel of my carriage was broken by the pole of a chaise and though one day i went without my dinner at a large desolate inn where nothing was to be had but whiskey and though one night i lay in a little smoky den in which the meanest of my servants in england would have thought it impossible to sleep and though i complained bitterly and swore it was impracticable for a gentleman to travel in ireland yet i never remember to have experienced on any journey less ennui i was out of patience twenty times a day but i certainly felt no ennui and i am convinced that the benefit some patients receive from a journey is in an inverse proportion to the ease and luxury of their mode of travelling when they are compelled to exert their faculties and to use their limbs they forget their nerves as i did upon this principle i should recommend to wealthy hypochondriacs a journey in ireland preferably to any country in the civilized world i can promise them that they will not only be moved to anger often enough to make their blood circulate briskly but they will even in the acme of their impatience be thrown into salutary convulsions of laughter by the comic concomitants of their disasters besides if they have hearts their best feelings cannot fail to be awakened by the warm generous hospitality they will receive in this country from the cabin to the castle late in the evening of the fourth day we came to an inn on the verge of the county where my estate was situate it was one of the wildest parts of ireland we could find no horses nor accommodations of any sort and we had several miles farther to go for our only comfort the dirty landlady who had married the hostler and wore gold drop earrings reminded us that sure if we could but wait an hour and take a fresh egg we should have a fine moon after many fruitless imprecations my french cook was obliged to mount one of my saddlehorses my groom was left to follow us the next day i let my gentleman sit on the barouche box and proceeded with my own tired horses the moon which my landlady had promised me rose and i had a full view of the face of the country as we approached my maritime territories the cottages were thinly scattered and the trees had a stunted appearance they all slanted one way from the prevalent winds that blew from the ocean our road presently stretched along the beach and i saw nothing to vary the prospect but rocks and their huge shadows upon the water the road being sandy the feet of the horses made no noise and nothing interrupted the silence of the night but the hissing sound of the carriagewheels passing through the sand what oclock is it now think you john said one of my postilions to the other past twelve for sartain said john and this bees a strange irish place continued he in a drawling voice with no possible way o getting at it as i see john after a pause resumed i say timothy to the best of my opinion this here road is leading on us into the sea john replied that he did suppose there might be such a thing as a boat farther on but where he could not say for sartain dismayed and helpless they at last stopped to consult whether they had come the right road to the house in the midst of their consultation there came up an irish carman whistling as he walked beside his horse and car honest friend is this the road to glenthorn castle to glenthorn sure enough your honour whereabouts is the castle forenent you if you go on to the turn forenent you as the postilions pondered upon this word the carman leaving his horse and car turned back to explain by action what he could not make intelligible by words see isnt here the castle cried he darting before us to the turn of the road where he stood pointing at what we could not possibly see as it was hid by a promontory of rock when we f reached the spot where he was stationed we came full upon the view of glenthorn castle it seemed to rise from the sea abrupt and insulated in all the gloomy grandeur of ancient times with turrets and battlements and a huge gateway the pointed arch of which receded in perspective between the projecting towers its my lord himself im fond to believe said our guide taking off his hat i had best step on and tell em at the castle no my good friend there is no occasion to trouble you farther you had better go back to your horse and car which you have left on the road oh they are used to that plase your honour theyll go on very quite and ill run like a redshank with the news to the castle he ran on before us with surprising velocity whilst our tired horses dragged us slowly through the sand as we approached the gateway of the castle opened and a number of men who appeared to be dwarfs when compared with the height of the building came out with torches in their hands by their bustle and the vehemence with which they bawled to one another one might have thought that the whole castle was in flames but they were only letting down a drawbridge as i was going over this bridge a casement window opened in the castle and a voice which i knew to be old ellinors exclaimed mind the big hole in the middle of the bridge god bless yees i passed over the broken bridge and through the massive gate under an arched way at the farthest end of which a lamp had just been lighted then i came into a large open area the court of the castle the hollow sound of the horses feet and of the carriage rumbling over the drawbridge was immediately succeeded by the strange and eager voices of the people who filled the court with a variety of noises contrasting in the most striking manner with the silence in which we had travelled over the sands the great effect that my arrival instantaneously produced upon the multitude of servants and dependants who issued from the castle gave me an idea of my own consequence beyond any thing which i had ever felt in england these people seemed born for my use the officious precipitation with which they ran to and fro the style in which they addressed me some crying long life to the earl of glenthorn some blessing me for coming to reign over them all together gave more the idea of vassals than of tenants and carried my imagination centuries back to feudal times the first person i saw on entering the hall of my castle was poor ellinor she pushed her way up to me tis himself cried she then turning about suddenly ive seen him in his own castleive seen him and if it pleases god this minute to take me to himself i would die with pleasure my good ellinor said i touched to the heart by her affection my good ellinor i hope you will live many a happy year and if i can contribute and himself to speak to me so kind before them all interrupted she oh this is too muchquite too much she burst into tears and hiding her face with her arm made her way out of the hall the flights of stairs which i had to ascend and the length of galleries through which i was conducted before i reached the apartment where supper was served gave me a vast idea of the extent of my castle but i was too much fatigued to enjoy fully the gratifications of pride to the simple pleasures of appetite i was more sensible i ate heartily of one of the most profusely hospitable suppers that ever was prepared for a noble baron even in the days when oxen were roasted whole then i grew so sleepy that i was impatient to be shown to my bed i was ushered through another suite of chambers and galleries and as i was traversing one of these a door of some strange dormitory opened and a group of female heads were thrust out in the midst of which i could distinguish old ellinors face but as i turned my head the door closed so quickly that i had no time to speak i only heard the words blessings on him thats he i was so sleepy that i rejoiced having escaped an occasion where i might have been called upon to speak yet i was really grateful to my poor nurse for her blessing the state tower in which after reiterated entreaties i was at last left alone to repose was hung with magnificent but ancient tapestry it was so like a room in a haunted castle that if i had not been too much fatigued to think of any thing i should certainly have thought of mrs radcliffe i am sorry to say that i have no mysteries or even portentous omens to record of this night for the moment that i lay down in my antiquated bed i fell into a profound sleep chapter vii when i awoke i thought that i was on shipboard for the first sound i heard was that of the sea booming against the castle walls i arose looked out of the window of my bedchamber and saw that the whole prospect bore an air of savage wildness as i contemplated the scene my imagination was seized with the idea of remoteness from civilized society the melancholy feeling of solitary grandeur took possession of my soul from this feeling i was relieved by the affectionate countenance of my old nurse who at this instant put her head half in at the door i only just made bold to look in at the fire to see did it burn because i lighted it myself and would not be blowing of it for fear of wakening you come in ellinor come in said i come quite in i will since youve nobody with you that i need be afraid of said she looking round satisfied when she saw my own man was not in the room you need never be afraid of any body ellinor whilst i am alive said i for i will always protect you i do not forget your conduct when you thought i was dead in the banquetingroom oh dont be talking of that thanks be to god there was nothing in it i see you well now long life to you sure you must have been tired to death last night for this morning early you lay so quite sleeping like an angel and i could see a great likeness in yees to what you were when you were a child in my arms but sit down sit down my good ellinor said i and let us talk a little of your own affairs and are not these my own affairs said she rather angrily certainly but i mean that you must tell me how you are going on in the world and what i can do to make you comfortable and happy theres one thing would make me happy said she name it said i to be let light your fire myself every morning and open your shutters dear i could not help smiling at the simplicity of the request i was going to press her to ask something of more consequence but she heard a servant coming along the gallery and starting from her chair she ran and threw herself upon her knees before the fire blowing it with her mouth with great vehemence the servant came to let me know that mr mleod my agent was waiting for me in the breakfastroom and will i be let light your fire then every morning said ellinor eagerly turning as she knelt and welcome said i then you wont forget to speak about it for me said she else may be i wont be let up by them english god bless you and dont forget to speak for me i will remember to speak about it said i but i went down stairs and forgot it mr mleod whom i found reading the newspaper in the breakfastroom seemed less affected by my presence than any body i had seen since my arrival he was a hardfeatured strongbuilt perpendicular man with a remarkable quietness of deportment he spoke with deliberate distinctness in an accent slightly scotch and in speaking he made use of no gesticulation but held himself surprisingly still no part of him but his eyes moved and they had an expression of slow but determined good sense he was sparing of his words but the few that he used said much and went directly to the point he pressed for the immediate examination and settlement of his accounts he enumerated several things of importance which he had done for my service but he did this without pretending the slightest attachment to me he mentioned them only as proofs of his having done his duty to his employer for which he neither expected nor would accept of thanks he seemed to be cold and upright in his mind as in his body i was not influenced in his favour even by his striking appearance of plaindealing so strong was the general abhorrence of agents which crawleys treachery had left in my mind the excess of credulity when convinced of its error becomes the extreme of suspicion persons not accustomed to reason often argue absurdly because from particular instances they deduce general conclusions and extend the result of their limited experience of individuals indiscriminately to whole classes the labour of thinking was so great to me that having once come to a conclusion upon any subject i would rather persist in it right or wrong than be at the trouble of going over the process again to revise and rectify my judgment upon this occasion national prejudice heightened the prepossession which circumstances had raised mr mleod was not only an agent but a scotchman and i had a notion that all scotchmen were crafty therefore i concluded that his blunt manner was assumed and his plaindealing but a more refined species of policy after breakfast he laid before me a general statement of my affairs obliged me to name a day for the examination of his accounts and then without expressing either mortification or displeasure at the coldness of my behaviour or at my evident impatience of his presence he unmoved of spirit rang for his horse wished me a good morning and departed by this time my castleyard was filled with a crowd of greatcoated suitors who were all come to seecould they see my lordship or waiting just to say two words to my honour in various lounging attitudes leaning against the walls or pacing backwards and forwards before the window to catch my eye they with a patience passing the patience of courtiers waited hour after hour the livelong day for their turn or their chance of an audience i had promised myself the pleasure of viewing my castle this day and of taking a ride through my grounds but that was totally out of the question i was no longer a man with a will of my own or with time at my own disposal long may you live to reign over us was the signal that i was now to live like a prince only for the service of my subjects how these subjects of mine had contrived to go on for so many years in my absence i was at a loss to conceive for the moment i was present it seemed evident that they could not exist without me one had a wife and six childer and not a spot in the wide world to live in if my honour did not let him live under me in any bit of a skirt of the estate that would feed a cow another had a brother in jail who could not be got out without me another had three lives dropped in a lase for ever another wanted a renewal another a farm another a house and one expected my lard would make his son an exciseman and another that i would make him a policeman and another was racked if i did not settle the mearing between him and corny corkran and half a hundred had given in proposials to the agent for lands that would be out next may and half a hundred more came with legends of traditionary promises from the old lord my lordships father that was and for hours i was forced to listen to long stories out of the face in which there was such a perplexing and provoking mixture of truth and fiction involved in language so figurative and tones so new to my english ears that with my utmost patience and strained attention i could comprehend but a very small portion of what was said to me never were my ears so weary any day of my life as they were this day i could not have endured the fatigue if i had not been supported by the agreeable idea of my own power and consequence a power seemingly next to despotic this new stimulus sustained me for three days that i was kept a stateprisoner in my own castle by the crowds who came to do me homage and to claim my favour and protection in vain every morning was my horse led about saddled and bridled i never was permitted to mount on the fourth morning when i felt sure of having despatched all my tormentors i was in astonishment and despair on seeing my levee crowded with a fresh succession of petitioners i gave orders to my people to say that i was going out and absolutely could see nobody i supposed that they did not understand what my english servants said for they never stirred from their posts on receiving a second message they acknowledged that they understood the first but replied that they could wait there till my honour came back from my ride with difficulty i mounted my horse and escaped from the closing ranks of my persecutors at night i gave directions to have the gates kept shut and ordered the porter not to admit any body at his peril when i got up i was delighted to see the coast clear but the moment i went out lo at the outside of the gate the host of besiegers were posted and in my lawn and along the road and through the fields they pursued me and when i forbade them to speak to me when i was on horseback the next day i found parties in ambuscade who laid wait for me in silence with their hats off bowing and bowing till i could not refrain from saying well my good friend what do you stand bowing there for then i was fairly prisoner and held by the bridle for an hour in short i found that i was now placed in a situation where i could hope neither for privacy nor leisure but i had the joys of power my rising passion for which would certainly have been extinguished in a short time by my habitual indolence if it had not been kept alive by jealousy of mr mleod one day when i refused to hear an importunate tenant and declared that i had been persecuted with petitioners ever since my arrival and that i was absolutely tired to death the man answered true for ye my lard and its a shame to be troubling you this way then may be its to mr mleod ill go sure the agent will do as well and no more about it mr mleod will do every thing the same way as usual mr mleod will do every thing said i hastily no by no means who will we speak to then said the man to myself said i with as haughty a tone as louis xiv could have assumed when he announced to his court his resolution to be his own minister after this intrepid declaration to act for myself i could not yield to my habitual laziness so much had my pride been hurt as well as my other feelings by captain crawleys conduct that i determined to show the world i was not to be duped a second time by an agent when on the day appointed mr mleod came to settle accounts with me i with an air of selfimportant capability as if i had been all my life used to look into my own affairs sat down to inspect the papers and incredible as it may appear i went through the whole at a sitting without a single yawn and for a man who never before had looked into an account i understood the nature of debtor and creditor wonderfully well but with my utmost desire to evince my arithmetical sagacity i could not detect the slightest error in the accounts and it was evident that mr mleod was not captain crawley yet rather than believe that he could be both an agent and an honest man i concluded that if he did not cheat me out of my money his aim was to cheat me out of power and fancying that he wished to be a man of influence and consequence in the county i transferred to him instantly the feelings that were passing in my own mind and took it for granted that he must be actuated by a love of power in every thing that he did apparently for my service about this time i remember being much disturbed in my mind by a letter which mr mleod received in my presence and of which he read to me only a part i never rested till i saw the whole the epistle proved well worth the trouble of deciphering it related merely to the paving of my chickenyard like the king of prussia who was said to be so jealous of power that he wanted to regulate all the mousetraps in his dominions i soon engrossed the management of a perplexing multiplicity of minute insignificant details alas i discovered to my cost that trouble is the inseparable attendant upon power and many times in the course of the first ten days of my reign i was ready to give up my dignity from excessive fatigue chapter viii early one morning after having passed a feverish night tortured in my dreams by the voices and faces of the people who had surrounded me the preceding day i was awakened by the noise of somebody lighting my fire i thought it was ellinor and the idea of the disinterested affection of this poor woman came full into my mind contrasted in the strongest manner with the recollection of the selfish encroaching people by whom of late i had been worried how do you do my good ellinor said i i have not seen any thing of you this week past its not ellinor at all my lard said a new voice and why so why does not ellinor light my fire myself does not know my lard go for her directly shes gone home these three days my lard gone is she sick not as i know on my lard myself does not know what ailed her except she would be jealous of my lighting the fire but i cant say what ailed her for she went away without a word good or bad when she seen me lighting this fire which i did by the housekeepers orders i now recollected poor ellinors request and reproached myself for having neglected to fulfil my promise upon an affair which however trifling in itself appeared of consequence to her in the course of my mornings ride i determined to call upon her at her own house and make my apologies but first i satisfied my curiosity about a prodigious number of parks and towns which i had heard of upon my estate many a ragged man had come to me with the modest request that i would let him one of the parks near the town the horsepark the deerpark the cowpark were not quite sufficient to answer the ideas i had attached to the word park but i was quite astonished and mortified when i beheld the bits and corners of land near the town of glenthorn on which these highsounding titles had been bestowedjust what would feed a cow is sufficient in ireland to constitute a park when i heard the names of above a hundred towns on the glenthorn estate i had an exalted idea of my own territories and i was impatient to make a progress through my dominions but upon visiting a few of these places my curiosity was satisfied two or three cabins gathered together were sufficient to constitute a town and the land adjoining thereto is called a townland the denominations of these townlands having continued from generation to generation according to ancient surveys of ireland it is sufficient to show the boundaries of a townland to prove that there must be a town and a tradition of a town continues to be satisfactory even when only a single cabin remains i turned my horses head away in disgust from one of these traditionary towns and desired a boy to show me the way to ellinor odonoghoes house so i will plase your honour my lard sure ive a right to know for shes my own granny the boy or as he was called the gossoon ran across some fields where there was abundance of fern and of rabbits the rabbits sitting quietly at the entrance of their holes seemed to consider themselves as proprietors of the soil and me and my horse as intruders the boy apologized for the number of rabbitholes on this part of the estate it would not be so my lard if i had a gun allowed me by the gamekeeper which he would give me if he knew it would be plasing to your honour the ingenuity with which even the young boys can introduce their requests in a favourable moment sometimes provoked me and sometimes excited my admiration this boy made his just at the time he was rolling out of my way a car that stopped a gap in the hedge and he was so hot and out of breath with running in my service that i could not refuse him a token to the gamekeeper that he might get a gun as soon as i understood what it meant we came to ellinors house a wretchedlooking low and mudwalled cabin at one end it was propped by a buttress of loose stones upon which stood a goat reared on his hind legs to browse on the grass that grew on the housetop a dunghill was before the only window at the other end of the house and close to the door was a puddle of the dirtiest of dirty water in which ducks were dabbling at my approach there came out of the cabin a pig a calf a lamb a kid and two geese all with their legs tied followed by turkeys cocks hens chickens a dog a cat a kitten a beggarman a beggarwoman with a pipe in her mouth children innumerable and a stout girl with a pitchfork in her hand all together more than i looking down upon the roof as i sat on horseback and measuring the superficies with my eye could have possibly supposed the mansion capable of containing i asked if ellinor odonoghoe was at home but the dog barked the geese cackled the turkeys gobbled and the beggars begged with one accord so loudly that there was no chance of my being heard when the girl had at last succeeded in appeasing them all with her pitchfork she answered that ellinor odonoghoe was at home but that she was out with the potatoes and she ran to fetch her after calling to the lays who was within in the room smoking to come out to his honour as soon as they had crouched under the door and were able to stand upright they welcomed me with a very good grace and were proud to see me in the kingdom i asked if they were all ellinors sons all entirely was the first answer not one but one was the second answer the third made the other two intelligible plase your honour we are all her sonsinlaw except myself who am her lawful son then you are my fosterbrother no plase your honour its not me but my brother and hes not in it not in it no plase your honour becaase hes in the forge up abow abow said i what does he mean sure hes the blacksmith my lard and what are you im ody plase your honour the short for owen and what is your trade trade plase your honour i was bred to none more than another but expects only that my mothers not willing to part with me to go into the militia next month and im sure shed let me if your honours lordship would spake a word to the colonel to see to get me made a serjeant immadiately as ody made his request all his companions came forward in sign of sympathy and closed round my horses head to make me sinsible of their expectations but at this instant ellinor came up her old face colouring all over with joy when she saw me so ellinor said i you were affronted i hear and left the castle in anger in anger and if i did more shame for mebut anger does not last long with me any way and against you my lord dear how could it oh think how good he is coming to see me in such a poor place i will make it a better place for you ellinor said i far from being eager to obtain promises she still replied that all was good enough for her i desired that she would come and live with me at the castle till a better house than her present habitation could be built for her but she seemed to prefer this hovel i assured her that she should be permitted to light my fire oh its better for me not said she better keep out of the way i could not be asy if i got any one illwill i assured her that she should be at liberty to do just as she liked and whilst i rode home i was planning a pretty cottage for her near the porters lodge i was pleased with myself for my gratitude to this poor woman before i slept i actually wrote a letter which obtained for ody the honour of being made a serjeant in the militia and ellinor dazzled by this military glory was satisfied that he should leave home though he was her favourite well let him leave me then said she i wont stand in his light i never thought of my living to see ody a serjeant now ody have done being wild honeydear and be a credit to your family and to his honours commendationgod bless him for ever for it from the very first i knew it was he that had the kind heart i am not sure that it was a very good action to get a man made a serjeant of whom i knew nothing but that he was son to my nurse selfcomplacency however cherished my first indistinct feelings of benevolence though not much accustomed to reflect upon my own sensations i think i remember at this period suspecting that the feeling of benevolence is a greater pleasure than the possession of barouches and horses and castles and parksgreater even than the possession of power of this last truth however i had not as yet a perfectly clear conception even in my benevolence i was as impatient and unreasonable as a child money i thought had the power of aladdins lamp to procure with magical celerity the gratification of my wishes i expected that a cottage for ellinor should rise out of the earth at my command but the slaves of aladdins lamp were not irishmen the delays and difficulties and blunders in the execution of my orders provoked me beyond measure and it would have been difficult for a cool spectator to decide whether i or my workmen were most in fault they for their dilatory habits or i for my impatient temper well plase your honour when the pratees are set and the turf cut well fallto at ellinors house confound the potatoes and the turf you must fallto as you call it directly is it without the lime and plase your honour sure that same is not drawn yet nor the stones quarried since it is of stone it will benor the foundations itself dug and the horses were all putting out dung then after the bog and the potatoes came funerals and holidays innumerable the masons were idle one week waiting for the mortar and the mortar another week waiting for the stones and then they were at a stand for the carpenter when they came to the doorcase and the carpenter was looking for the sawyer and the sawyer was gone to have the saw mended then there was a stop again at the windowsills for the stonecutter and he was at the quartersessions processing his brother for tin and tinpence haymoney and when in spite of all delays and obstacles the walls reached their destined height the roof was a new plague the carpenter the slater and the nailer were all at variance and i cannot tell which was the most provoking rogue of the three at last however the house was roofed and slated then i would not wait till the walls were dry before i plastered and papered and furnished it i fitted it up in the most elegant style of english cottages for i was determined that ellinors habitation should be such as had never been seen in this part of the world the day when it was finished and when i gave possession of it to ellinor paid me for all my trouble i tasted a species of pleasure that was new to me and which was the sweeter from having been earned with some difficulty and now when i saw a vast number of my tenants assembled at a rural feast which i gave on ellinors installation my benevolence enlarged even beyond the possibility of its gratification and i wished to make all my dependants happy provided i could accomplish it without much trouble the method of doing good which seemed to require the least exertion and which i therefore most willingly practised was giving away money i did not wait to inquire much less to examine into the merits of the claimants but without selecting proper objects i relieved myself from the uneasy feeling of pity by indiscriminate donations to objects apparently the most miserable i was quite angry with mr mleod my agent and considered him as a selfish hardhearted miser because he did not seem to sympathize with me or to applaud my generosity i was so much irritated by his cold silence that i could not forbear pressing him to say something i doubt then said he since you desire me to speak my mind my lord i doubt whether the best way of encouraging the industrious is to give premiums to the idle but idle or not these poor wretches are so miserable that i cannot refuse to give them something and surely when one can do it so easily it is right to relieve misery is it not undoubtedly my lord but the difficulty is to relieve present misery without creating more in future pity for one class of beings sometimes makes us cruel to others i am told that there are some indian brahmins so very compassionate that they hire beggars to let fleas feed upon them i doubt whether it might not be better to let the fleas starve i did not in the least understand what mr mleod meant but i was soon made to comprehend it by crowds of eloquent beggars who soon surrounded me many who had been resolutely struggling with their difficulties slackened their exertions and left their labour for the easier trade of imposing upon my credulity the money i had bestowed was wasted at the dramshop or it became the subject of familyquarrels and those whom i had relieved returned to my honour with fresh and insatiable expectations all this time my industrious tenants grumbled because no encouragement was given to them and looking upon me as a weak goodnatured fool they combined in a resolution to ask me for long leases or reduction of rent the rhetoric of my tenants succeeded in some instances and again i was mortified by mr mleods silence i was too proud to ask his opinion i ordered and was obeyed a few leases for long terms were signed and sealed and when i had thus my own way completely i could not refrain from recurring to mr mleods opinion i doubt my lord said he whether this measure may be as advantageous as you hope these fellows these middlemen will underset the land and live in idleness whilst they rack a parcel of wretched undertenants but they said they would keep the land in their own hands and improve it and that the reason why they could not afford to improve before was that they had not long leases it may be doubted whether long leases alone will make improving tenants for in the next county to us there are many farms of the dowager lady ormsbys land let at ten shillings an acre and her tenantry are beggars and the land now at the end of the leases is worn out and worse than at their commencement i was weary listening to this cold reasoning and resolved to apply no more for explanations to mr mleod yet in my indolence i wanted the support of his approbation at the very time i was jealous of his interference at one time i had a mind to raise the wages of labour but mr mleod said it might be doubted whether the people would not work less when they could with less work have money enough to support them i was puzzled and then i had a mind to lower the wages of labour to force them to work or starve still provoking mr mleod said it might be doubted whether it would not be better to leave them alone i gave marriageportions to the daughters of my tenants and rewards to those who had children for i had always heard that legislators should encourage population still mr mleod hesitated to approve he observed that my estate was so populous that the complaint in each family was that they had not land for the sons it might be doubted whether if a farm could support but ten people it were wise to encourage the birth of twenty it might be doubted whether it were not better for ten to live and be well fed than for twenty to be born and to be halfstarved to encourage manufactures in my town of glenthorn i proposed putting a clause in my leases compelling my tenants to buy stuffs and linens manufactured at glenthorn and no where else stubborn mleod as usual began with i doubt whether that will not encourage the manufacturers at glenthorn to make bad stuffs and bad linen since they are sure of a sale and without danger of competition at all events i thought my tenants would grow rich and independent if they made every thing at home that they wanted yet mr mleod perplexed me by his doubt whether it would not be better for a man to buy shoes if he could buy them cheaper than he could make them he added something about the division of labour and smiths wealth of nations to which i could only answersmiths a scotchman i cannot express how much i dreaded mr mleods i doubtandit may be doubted from the pain of doubt and the labour of thought i was soon most agreeably reprieved by the company of a mr hardcastle whose visits i constantly encouraged by a most gracious reception mr hardcastle was the agent of the dowager lady ormsby who had a large estate in my neighbourhood he was the very reverse of my mr mleod in his deportment and conversation talkative selfsufficient peremptory he seemed not to know what it was to doubt he considered doubt as a proof of ignorance imbecility or cowardice can any man doubt was his usual beginning on every subject of human knowledge taste morals politics economy legislation on all affairs civil military or ecclesiastical he decided at once in the most confident tone yet he never read not he he had nothing to do with books he consulted only his own eyes and ears and appealed only to common sense as to theory he had no opinion of theory for his part he only pretended to understand practice and experienceand his practice was confined steadily to his own practice and his experience uniformly to what he had tried at newtownhardcastle at first i thought him a mighty clever man and i really rejoiced to see my doubter silenced after dinner when he had finished speaking in this decisive manner i used frequently to back him with avery truevery fairvery clearthough i understood what he said as little as he did himself but it was an ease to my mind to have a disputed point settledand i filled my glass with an air of triumph whilst mleod never contradicted my assertions nor controverted mr hardcastles arguments there was still an air of content and quiet selfsatisfaction in mleods very silence which surprised and vexed me one day when hardcastle was laying down the law upon several subjects in his usual dictatorial manner telling us how he managed his people and what order he kept them in i was determined that mleod should not enjoy the security of his silence and i urged him to give us his general opinion as to the means of improving the poor people in ireland i doubt said mleod whether any thing effectual can be done till they have a better education educationpshawthere it is nowthese bookmen cried hardcastle why my dear sir can any man alive who knows this country doubt that the common people have already too much education as it is calleda vast deal too much too many of them know how to read and write and cipher which i presume is all you mean by education not entirely said mleod a good education comprehends something more the more the worse interrupted hardcastle the more they know the worse they are sir depend on that i know the people of this country sir i have a good right to know them sir being born amongst them and bred amongst them so i think i may speak with some confidence on these matters and i give it as my decided humble opinion founded on irrefragable experience which is what i always build upon that the way to ruin the poor of ireland would be to educate them sir look at the poor scholars as they call themselves and what are they a parcel of young vagabonds in rags with a book under their arm instead of a spade or a shovel sir and what comes of this that they grow up the worstdisposed and the most troublesome seditiousrascals in the community i allow none of them about newtownhardcastlenonebanished them all useless vagrantshornets vipers sir and show me a quieter bettermanaged set of people than i have made of mine i go upon experience sir and thats the only thing to go upon and ill go no farther than newtownhardcastle if that wont bring conviction home to you nothing will i never was at newtownhardcastle said mleod drily well sir i hope it will not be the case long but in the mean time my good sir do give me leave to put it to your own common sense what can reading or writing do for a poor man unless he is to be a bailiff or an exciseman and you know all men cant expect to be bailiffs or excisemen can all the booklearning in the world sir dig a poor mans potatoes for him or plough his land or cut his turf then sir in this country wheres the advantage of education i humbly ask no sir no trust mekeep the irish common people ignorant and you keep em quiet and thats the only way with them for they are too quiet and smart as it is naturally teach them to read and write and its just adding fuel to firefire to gunpowder sir teach them any thing and directly you set them up now its our business to keep them down unless sir youd wish to have your throat cut education sir lord bless your soul sir they have a great deal too much they know too much already which makes them so refractory to the laws and so idle i will go no farther than newtownhardcastle to prove all this so my good sir concluded he triumphantly education i grant you is necessary for the rich but tell me if you can whats the use of education to the poor much the same i apprehend as to the rich answered mleod the use of education as i understand it is to teach men to see clearly and to follow steadily their real interests all morality you know is comprised in this definition and very true sir but all this can never apply to the poor in ireland why sir are they not men men to be sure but not like men in scotland the irish know nothing of their interests and as to morality thats out of the question they know nothing about it my dear sir that is the very thing of which i complain said mleod they know nothing because they have been taught nothing they cannot be taught sir did you ever try i did sir no later than last week a fellow that i caught stealing my turf instead of sending him to jail i said to him with a great deal of lenity my honest fellow did you never hear of the eighth commandment thou shalt not steal he confessed he had but did not know it was the eighth i showed it to him and counted it to him myself and set him for a punishment to get his whole catechism well sir the next week i found him stealing my turf again and when i caught him by the wrist in the fact he said it was because the priest would not let him learn the catechism i gave him because it was a protestant one now you see sir theres a bar for ever to all education mr mleod smiled said something about time and patience and observed that one experiment was not conclusive against a whole nation any thing like a general argument mr hardcastle could not comprehend he knew every blade of grass within the reach of his tether but could not reach an inch beyond any thing like an appeal to benevolent feelings was lost upon him for he was so frank in his selfishness that he did not even pretend to be generous by sundry selfcomplacent motions he showed whilst his adversary spoke that he disdained to listen almost as much as to read but as soon as mleod paused he said what you observe sir may possibly be very true but i have made up my mind then he went over and over again his assertions in a louder and a louder voice ending with a tone of interrogation that seemed to set all answer at defiance what have you to answer to me now sircan any man alive doubt this sir mleod was perfectly silent the company broke up and as we were going out of the room i maliciously asked mleod why he who could say so much in his own defence had suffered himself to be so completely silenced he answered me in his low deliberate voice in the words of moirequestce que la raison avec un filet de voix contre une gueule comme cellela at some other time added mr mleod my sentiments shall be at your lordships disposal indolent persons love positive people when they are of their own opinion because they are saved the trouble of developing their thoughts or supporting their assertions but the moment the positive differs in sentiment from the indolent man there is an end of the friendship the indolent man then hates his pertinacious adversary as much as he loved his sturdy friend so it happened between mr hardcastle and me this gentleman was a prodigious favourite with me so long as his opinions were not in opposition to my own but an accident happened which brought his love of power and mine into direct competition and then i found his peremptory mode of reasoning and his ignorance absurd and insufferable before i can do justice to my part of this quarrel i must explain the cause of the interest which i took in behalf of the persons aggrieved during the time that my first hot fit of benevolence was on me i was riding home one evening after dining with mr hardcastle and i was struck with the sight of a cabin more wretched than any i had ever before beheld the feeble light of a single rushcandle through the window revealed its internal misery does any body live in that hovel said i ay sure does there the noonans plase your honour replied a man on the road noonans i recollected the name to be that of the pugilist who had died in consequence of the combat at which i had been present in london who had with his dying breath besought me to convey his only halfguinea and his silk handkerchief to his poor father and sister i alighted from my horse asking the man at the same time if the son of this noonan had not died in england he had sir a son in england mick noonan who used to send him odd guineas i mind and was a good lad to his father though wild and theres been no account of him atallatall this long while but the old man has another boy a sober lad whos abroad with the army in the east indies and its he that is the hope of the family and theres the fatherand old as he is and poor and a cripple id engage there is not a happier man in the three counties at this very time speaking for it is just now i seen young jemmy riley the daughters bachelor go by with a letter what news says i great news says he a letter from tom noonan to his father and im going in to read it for him by the time my voluble informant had come to this period i had reached the cabin door who could have expected to see smiles and hear exclamations of joy under such a roof i saw the father with his hands clasped in ecstasy and looking up to heaven with the strong expression of delight in his aged countenance i saw every line of his face for the light of the candle was full upon it the daughter a beautiful girl kneeling beside him held the light for the young man who was reading her brothers letter i was sorry to interrupt them your honours kindly welcome said the old man making an attempt to rise pray dont let me disturb you it was only a letter from a boy of mine thats over the seas we was reading said the old man a better boy to an ould father thats good for nothing now in this world never was plase your honour see what he has sent me a draft here for ten guineas out of the little pay he has god for ever bless himas he surely will after a few minutes conversation the old mans heart was so much opened towards me that he talked as freely as if he had known me for years i led to the subject of his other son michael who was mentioned in the letter as a wild chap ah your honour thats what lies heaviest on my heart and will to my dying day that mick before he died which they say he did surely a twelvemonth ago over there in england never so much as sent me one line good or bad or his sister a token to remember him by even had he but sent us the least bit of a word or the least token in life i had been content said the sister wiping her eyes we dont so much as know how he died i took this moment to relate the circumstances of michael noonans death and when i told them of his dying request about the halfguinea and the silk handkerchief they were all so much touched that they utterly forgot the tenguinea draft which i saw on the ground in the dirt under the old mans feet whilst he contemplated the halfguinea which his poor michael had sent him repeating poor fellow poor fellow twas all he had in the world god bless himpoor michael he was a wild chap but none better to his parents than he while the life was in him poor michael in no country have i found such strong instances of filial affection as in ireland let the sons go where they may let what will befall them they never forget their parents at home they write to them constantly the most affectionate letters and send them a share of whatever they earn when i asked the daughter of this noonan why she had not married the old man answered thats her own faultif it be a fault to abide by an old father she wastes her youth here in the way your honour sees tending him who has none other to mind him oh let alone that said the girl with a cheerful smile we be too poor to think of marrying yet by a great deal so father dear youre no hinderance any way for dont i know and doesnt jemmy there know that its a sin and a shame as my mother used to say for them that have nothing to marry and set up housekeeping like the rogue that ruined my father thats true said the young man with a heavy sigh but times will mend or well strive and mend them with the blessing of god i left this miserable but in admiration of the generosity of its inhabitants i desired the girl to come to glenthorn castle the next day that i might give her the silk handkerchief which her poor brother had sent her the more i inquired into the circumstances of this family the more cause i found for pity and approbation the old man had been a good farmer in his day as the traditions of the aged and the memories of the young were ready to witness but he was unfortunately joined in copartnership with a drunken rogue who ran away and left an arrear of rent which ruined noonan mr hardcastle the agent called upon him to pay it and sold all that the old man possessed and this being insufficient to discharge the debt he was forced to give up his farm and retire with his daughter to this hovel and soon afterwards he lost the use of his side by a paralytic stroke i was so much pleased with the goodness of these poor people that in despite of my indolent disposition i bestirred myself the very next day to find a better habitation for them on my own estate i settled them infinitely to their satisfaction in a small farm and the girl married her lover who undertook to manage the farm for the old man to my utter surprise i found that mr hardcastle was affronted by the part i took in this affair he complained that i had behaved in a very ungentlemanlike manner and had spirited the tenants away from lady ormsbys estate against the regulation which he had laid down for all the tenants not to emigrate from the estate jemmy riley it seems was one of the cotters on the ormsby estate a circumstance with which i was unacquainted indeed i scarcely at that time understood what was meant by a cotter mr hardcastles complaint in matter and manner was unintelligible to me but i was quite content to leave off visiting him as he left off visiting mebut here the matter did not stop this overwise and overbusy gentleman took upon him amongst other offices the regulation of the markets in the town of ormsby and as he apprehended for reasons best and only known to himself a year of scarcity he thought fit to keep down the price of oats and potatoes he would allow none to be sold in the market of ormsby but at the price which he stipulated the poor people grumbled and to remedy the injustice made private bargains with each other he had information of this and seized the corn that was selling above the price he had fixed young riley noonans soninlaw came to me to complain that his little oats were seized and detained i remonstrated hardcastle resented the appeal to me and bid him wait and be damned the young man who was rather of a hasty temper and who did not much like either to wait or be damned seized his own oats and was marching off when they were recaptured by hardcastles bailiff whom young riley knocked down and who as soon as he got up again went straight and swore examinations against riley then i was offended as i had a right to be by the custom of the country with the magistrate who took an examination against my tenant without writing first to me then there was a race between the examinations of my justice of peace and his justice of peace my indolence was conquered by my love of power i supported the contest the affair came before our grand jury i conquered and mr hardcastle was ever after of course my enemy to english ears the possessive pronouns my and his may sound extraordinary prefixed to a justice of peace but in many parts of ireland this language is perfectly correct a great man talks of making a justice of the peace with perfect confidence a very great man talks with as much certainty of making a sheriff and a sheriff makes the jury and the jury makes the law we must not forget however that in england during the reign of elizabeth a member of parliament defined a justice of peace to be an animal who for half a dozen chickens will dispense with half a dozen penal statutes time is necessary to enforce the sanctions of legislation and civilizationbut i am anticipating reflections which i made at a much later period of my life to return to my history my benevolence was soon checked by slight disappointments ellinors cottage which i had taken so much pains to build became a source of mortification to me one day i found my old nurse sitting at her wheel in the midst of the wreck and litter of all sorts of household furniture singing her favourite song of there was a lady loved a swine honey says she ill give ye a silver trough hunk says he ellinor seemed alas to have as little taste for the luxuries with which i had provided her as the pig had for the silver trough what i called conveniences were to her incumbrances she had not been used to them she was put out of her way and it was a daily torment to one of her habits to keep her house clean and neat there may be as some philosophers assure us that there is an innate love of order in the human mind but of this instinctive principle my poor ellinor was totally destitute her ornamented farmhouse became in a wonderfully short time a scene of dirt rubbish and confusion there was a partition between two rooms which had been built with turf or peat instead of bricks by the wise economy i had employed of course this was pulled down to get at the turf the stairs also were pulled down and burned though there was no scarcity of firing as the walls were plastered and papered before they were quite dry the paper grew mouldy and the plaster fell off in the hurry of finishing some of the woodwork had but one coat of paint in ireland they have not faith in the excellent dutch proverb paint costs nothing i could not get my workmen to give a second coat of paint to any of the sashes and the wood decayed divers panes of glass in the windows were broken and their places filled up with shoes an old hat or a bundle of rags some of the slates were blown off one windy night the slater lived at ten miles distance and before the slates were replaced the rain came in and ellinor was forced to make a bedchamber of the parlour and then of the kitchen retreating from corner to corner as the rain pursued till at last when it would come every way upon her bed she petitioned me to let her take the slates off and thatch the house for a slatedhouse she said was never so warm as a tatched cabin and as there was no smoke she was kilt with the cowld in my life i never felt so angry i was ten times more angry than when crawley ran away with my wife in a paroxysm of passion i reproached ellinor with being a savage an irishwoman and an ungrateful fool savage i am for any thing i know and fool i am thats certain but ungrateful i am not said she bursting into tears she went home and took to her bed and the next thing i heard from her son was that she was lying in the rheumatism which had kept her awake many a long night before she would come to complain to my honour of the house in dread that i should blame myself for sending of her into it afore it was dry the rheumatism reconciled me immediately to ellinor i let her take her own way and thatch the house and have as much smoke as she pleased and she recovered but i did not entirely recover my desire to do good to my poor tenants after forming in the first enthusiasm of my benevolence princely schemes for their advantage my ardour was damped and my zeal discouraged by a few slight disappointments i did not consider that there is often amongst uncultivated people a mixture of obstinate and lazy content which makes them despise the luxuries of their richer neighbours like those mountaineers who proud of their own hard fare out of a singular species of contempt call the inhabitants of the plains mangerotis eaters of roast meat i did not consider that it must take time to change local and national habits and prejudices and that it is necessary to raise a taste for comforts before they can be properly enjoyed in the pettishness of my disappointment i decided that it was in vain to attempt to improve and civilize such people as the irish i did not recollect perhaps at that time i did not know that even in the days of the great queen elizabeth the greatest part of the buildings in the cities and good towns of england consisted only of timber cast over with thick clay to keep out the wind the new houses of the nobility were indeed either of brick or stone and glass windows were then beginning to be used in england and clean rushes were strewed over the dirty floors of the royal palace in the impatience of my zeal for improvement i expected to do the work of two hundred years in a few months and because i could not accelerate the progress of refinement in this miraculous manner i was out of humour with myself and with a whole nation so easily is the humanity of the rich and great disgusted and discouraged as if any people could be civilized in a moment and at the word of command of ignorant pride or despotic benevolence chapter ix he sawand but that admiration had been too active too like passion or had he been to ton less true cupid had shot him through and through i have not thought it necessary to record every visit that i received from all my country neighbours but i must now mention one which led to important consequences a visit from sir harry ormsby a very young dashing man of fortune who in expectation of the happy moment when he should be of age resided with his mother the dowager lady ormsby her ladyship had heard that there had been some disagreement between her agent mr hardcastle and my people but she took the earliest opportunity of expressing her wishes that our families should be on an amicable footing lady ormsby was just come to the country with a large party of her fashionable friendssome irish some english lord and lady kilrush my lady kildangan and her daughter the lady geraldine the knowing widow oconnor the english dasher lady hauton the interesting mrs norton separated but not parted from her husband the pleasant miss bland the three miss ormsbys better known by the name of the swanlinbar graces two english aidesdecamp from the castle and a brace of brigadiers besides other men of inferior note i perceived that sir harry ormsby took it for granted that i must be acquainted with the pretensions of all these persons to celebrity his talkativeness and my taciturnity favoured me so fortunately that he never discovered the extent of my ignorance he was obligingly impatient to make me personally acquainted with those of whom i must have heard so much in england observing that ormsby villa was too far from glenthorn castle for a morning visit he pressed me to waive ceremony and to do lady ormsby and him the honour of spending a week with them as soon as i could make it convenient i accepted this invitation partly from a slight emotion of curiosity and partly from my habitual inability to resist any reiterated importunity arrived at ormsby villa and introduced to this crowd of people i was at first disappointed by seeing nothing extraordinary i expected that their manners would have been as strange to me as some of their names appeared but whether it was from my want of the powers of discrimination or from the real sameness of the objects i could scarcely in this fashionable flock discern any individual marks of distinction at first view the married ladies appeared much the same as those of a similar class in england whom i had been accustomed to see the young ladies i thought as usual best distinguished by black brown and fair but i had not yet seen lady geraldine and a great part of the conversation the first day i was at ormsby villa was filled with lamentations on the unfortunate toothache which prevented her ladyship from appearing she was talked of so much and as a person of such importance and so essential to the amusement of society that i could not help feeling a slight wish to see her the next day at breakfast she did not appear but five minutes before dinner her ladyships humble companion whispered now lady geraldine is coming my lord i was always rather displeased to be called upon to attend to any thing or any body yet as lady geraldine entered i gave one involuntary glance of curiosity i saw a tall finelyshaped woman with the commanding air of a woman of rank she moved well not with feminine timidity but with ease promptitude and decision she had fine eyes and a fine complexion yet no regularity of feature the only thing that struck me as really extraordinary was her indifference when i was introduced to her every body had seemed extremely desirous that i should see her ladyship and that her ladyship should see me and i was rather surprised by her unconcerned air this piqued me and fixed my attention she turned from me and began to converse with others her voice was agreeable she did not speak with the irish accent but when i listened maliciously i detected certain hibernian inflections nothing of the vulgar irish idiom but something that was more interrogative more exclamatory and perhaps more rhetorical than the common language of english ladies accompanied with much animation of countenance and demonstrative gesture this appeared to me peculiar and unusual but not affected she was uncommonly eloquent and yet without action her words were not sufficiently rapid to express her ideas her manner appeared foreign yet it was not quite french if i had been obliged to decide i should however have pronounced it rather more french than english to determine what it was or whether i had ever seen any thing similar i stood considering her ladyship with more attention than i had ever bestowed on any other woman the words strikingfascinatingbewitching occurred to me as i looked at her and heard her speak i resolved to turn my eyes away and shut my ears for i was positively determined not to like her i dreaded so much the idea of a second hymen i retreated to the farthest window and looked out very soberly upon a dirty fishpond dinner was announced i observed lady kildangan manoeuvring to place me beside her daughter geraldine but lady geraldine counteracted this movement i was again surprised and piqued after yielding the envied position to one of the swanlinbar graces i heard lady geraldine whisper to her next neighbour baffled mamma it was strange to me to feel piqued by a young ladys not choosing to sit beside me after dinner i left the gentlemen as soon as possible because the conversation wearied me lord kilrush the chief orator was a courtier and could talk of nothing but dublin castle and my lord lieutenants levees the moment that i went to the ladies i was seized upon by the officious miss bland she could not speak of any thing but lady geraldine who sat at so great a distance and who was conversing with such animation herself that she could not hear her proneuse miss bland inform me that her friend lady geraldine was extremely clever so clever that many people were at first a little afraid of her but that there was not the least occasion for that where she liked nobody could be more affable and engaging this judicious friend a minute afterwards told me as a very great secret that lady geraldine was an admirable mimic that she could draw or speak caricatures that she was also wonderfully happy in the invention of agnomens and cognomens so applicable to the persons that they could scarcely be forgotten or forgiven i was a little anxious to know whether her ladyship would honour me with an agnomen i could not learn this from miss bland and i was too prudent to betray my curiosity i afterwards heard it however pairing me and mr mleod whom she had seen together her ladyship observed that sawney and yawney were made for each other and she sketched in strong caricature my relaxed elongation of limb and his rigid rectangularity a slight degree of fear of lady geraldines powers kept my attention alert in the course of the evening lady kildangan summoned her daughter to the musicroom and asked me to come and hear an irish song i exerted myself so far as to follow immediately but though summoned lady geraldine did not obey miss bland tuned the harp and opened the musicbooks on the piano but no lady geraldine appeared miss bland was sent backwards and forwards with messages but lady geraldines ultimatum was that she could not possibly sing because she was afraid of the toothache god knows her mouth had never been shut all the evening well but said lady kildangan she can play for us cannot she no her ladyship was afraid of the cold in the musicroom do my lord glenthorn go and tell the dear capricious creature that we are very warm here very reluctantly i obeyed the lady geraldine with her circle round her heard and answered me with the air of a princess do you the honour to play for you my lord excuse me i am no professori play so ill that i make it a rule never to play but for my own amusement if you wish for music there is miss bland she plays incomparably and i dare say will think herself happy to oblige your lordship i never felt so silly or so much abashed as at this instant this comes thought i of acting out of character what possessed me to exert myself to ask a lady to play i that have been tired to death of music why did i let myself be sent ambassador when i had no interest in the embassy to convince myself and others of my apathy i threw myself on a sofa and never stirred or spoke the remainder of the night i presume i appeared fast asleep else lady geraldine would not have said within my hearing mamma wants me to catch somebody and to be caught by somebody but that will not be for do you know i think somebody is nobody i was offended as much as it was in my nature to be offended and i began to meditate apologies for shortening my visit at ormsby villa but though i was shocked by the haughtiness of lady geraldine and accused her in my own mind of want of delicacy and politeness yet i could not now suspect her of being an accomplice with her mother in any matrimonial designs upon me from the moment i was convinced of this my conviction was i suppose visible to her ladyships penetrating eyes and from that instant she showed me that she could be polite and agreeable now soothed to a state of ease and complacency i might have sunk to indifference and ennui but fresh singularities in this lady struck me and kept my attention awake and fixed upon her character if she had treated me with tolerable civility at first i never should have thought about her highborn and highbred she seemed to consider more what she thought of others than what others thought of her frank candid and affable yet opinionated insolent and an egotist her candour and affability appeared the effect of a naturally good temper her insolence and egotism only those of a spoiled child she seemed to talk of herself purely to oblige others as the most interesting possible topic of conversation for such it had always been to her fond mother who idolized her ladyship as an only daughter and the representative of an ancient house confident of her talents conscious of her charms and secure of her station lady geraldine gave free scope to her high spirits her fancy and her turn for ridicule she looked spoke and acted like a person privileged to think say and do what she pleased her raillery like the raillery of princes was without fear of retort she was not illnatured yet careless to whom she gave offence provided she produced amusement and in this she seldom failed for in her conversation there was much of the raciness of irish wit and the oddity of irish humour the singularity that struck me most about her ladyship was her indifference to flattery she certainly preferred frolic miss bland was her humble companion miss tracey her butt her ladyship appeared to consider miss bland as a necessary appendage to her rank and person like her dress or her shadow and she seemed to think no more of the one than of the other she suffered miss bland to follow her but she would go in quest of n miss tracey miss bland was allowed to speak but her ladyship listened to miss tracey miss bland seldom obtained an answer but miss tracey never opened her lips without a repartee in describing miss tracey lady geraldine said poor simpleton she cannot help imitating all she sees us do yet would you believe it she really has starts of common sense and some tolerable ideas of her own spoiled by bad company in the language of the birdfanciers she has a few notes nightingale and all the rest rubbish it was one of lady geraldines delights to humour miss traceys rage for imitating the fashions of fine people now you shall see miss tracey appear at the ball tomorrow in every thing that i have sworn to her is fashionable nor have i cheated her in a single article but the tout ensemble i leave to her better judgment and you shall see her i trust a perfect monster formed of every creatures best lady kilrushs feathers mrs moores wig mrs oconnors gown mrs lightons sleeves and all the necklaces of all the miss ormsbys she has no taste no judgment none at all poor thing but she can imitate as well as those chinese painters who in their drawings give you the flower of one plant stuck on the stalk of another and garnished with the leaves of a third miss traceys appearance the ensuing night justified all lady geraldines predictions and surpassed her ladyships most sanguine hopes even i albeit unused to the laughing mood could not forbear smiling at the humour and ease with which her ladyship played off this girls credulous vanity at breakfast the next morning lord kilrush in his grave manner always too solemn by half for the occasion declared that no man was more willing than himself to enter into a jest in proper time and season and measure and so forth but that it was really positively morally unjustifiable in his apprehension the making this poor girl so publicly ridiculous my good lord replied lady geraldine all the world are ridiculous some way or other some in public some in private now continued she with an appealing look to the whole company now after all what is there more extravagant in my miss traceys delighting at sixteen in six yards of pink riband than in your courtier sighing at sixty for three yards of blue riband or what is there more ridiculous in her coming simpering into a ballroom fancying herself the mirror of fashion when she is a figure for a printshop than in the courtier rising solemnly in the house of lords believing himself an orator and expecting to make a vast reputation by picking up in every debate the very worst arguments that every body else let fall there would be no living in this world if we were all to see and expose one anothers ridicules my plan is much the bestto help my friends to expose themselves and then they are infinitely obliged to me satisfied with silencing all opposition and seeing that the majority was with her lady geraldine persisted in her course and i was glad she was incorrigible because her faults entertained me as to love i thought i was perfectly safe because though i admired her quickness and cleverness yet i still at times perceived or fancied i perceived some want of polish and elegance and tact she was not exactly cut out according to my english pattern of a woman of fashion so i thought i might amuse myself without danger as it was partly at her ladyships expense but about this time i was alarmed for myself by a slight twinge of jealousy as i was standing lounging upon the steps at the halldoor almost as ennuye as usual i saw a carriage at a distance between the trees driving up the approach and at the same instant i heard lady geraldines eager voice in the hall oh they are coming he is coming they are come run miss bland run and give lord craiglethorpe my message before he gets out of the carriagebefore any body sees him afraid of hearing what i should not hear i walked down the steps deliberately and turned into a shrubberywalk to leave the coast clear out ran miss bland and then it was that i felt the twingevery slight however who is this lord craiglethorpe with whom lady geraldine is on such favourable terms i wonder what kind of looking man he is and what could the message meanbut at all events it cannot concern me yet i am curious to see this lord craiglethorpe i wonder any woman can like a man with so strange a name but does she like him after allwhy do i plague myself about it as i returned from my saunter i was met by miss bland a charming day maam said i endeavouring to pass on a charming day my lord but i must stop your lordship a moment oh i am so out of breathi went the wrong way the wrong way indeed i am sorry i am concerned you should have had so much trouble no trouble in the world only i want to beg youll keep our secretmy lady geraldines secret undoubtedly madama man of honourlady geraldine cannot doubther ladyships secret is perfectly safe but do you know it you dont know it yet my lord pardon me i was on the steps just now i thought you saw me i did my lordbut i dont understand nor i neither interrupted i half laughing for i began to think i was mistaken in my suspicions pray explain yourself my dear miss bland i was very rude to be so quick in interrupting you miss bland then made me the confidant of a charming scheme of lady geraldines for quizzing miss tracey she has never in her life seen lord craiglethorpe who is an english lord travelling through ireland continued miss bland now you must know that miss tracey is passionately fond of lords let them be what they may now lord craiglethorpe this very morning sent his groom with a note and excuse to lady ormsby for not coming to us today because he said he was bringing down in the chaise with him a surveyor to survey his estate near here and he could not possibly think of bringing the surveyor who is a low man to ormsby villa but lady ormsby would take no apology and wrote by the groom to beg that lord craiglethorpe would make no scruple of bringing the surveyor for you know she is so polite and accommodating and all that well the note was scarcely gone before lady geraldine thought of her charming scheme and regretted of all things she had not put it into it it into it repeated i to myself maam said i looking a little bewildered but continued my clear narrator i promised to remedy all that by running to meet the carriage which was what i ran for when you saw me my lord in such a hurry i bowedand was as wise as ever so my lord you comprehend that the surveyor whose name whose odious name is gabbitt is to be my lord craiglethorpe and my lord craiglethorpe is to be passed for mr gabbitt upon miss tracey and you will see miss tracey will admire mr gabbitt prodigiously and call him vastly genteel when she thinks him a lord your lordship will keep our secret and she is sure lord craiglethorpe will do any thing to oblige her because he is a near connexion of hers but i assure you it is not every body could get lord craiglethorpe to join in a joke for he is very stiff and cold and high of course your lordship will know which is the real lord at first sight he is a full head taller than gabbitt never was explanation finally more satisfactory and whether the jest was really well contrived and executed or whether i was put into a humour to think so i cannot exactly determine but i confess i was amused with the scenes that followed though i felt that they were not quite justifiable even in jest the admiration of miss tracey for the false craiglethorpe as lady geraldine called mr gabbitt the awkwardness of mr gabbitt with his title and the awkwardness of lord craiglethorpe without it were fine subjects of her ladyships satirical humour in another point of view lord craiglethorpe afforded her ladyship amusement as an english traveller full of english prejudices against ireland and every thing irish whenever miss tracey was out of the room lady geraldine allowed lord craiglethorpe to be himself again but he did not fare the better for this restoration to his honours lady geraldine contrived to make him as ridiculous in his real as in his assumed character lord craiglethorpe was as miss bland had described him very stiff cold and high his manners were in the extreme of english reserve and his illbred show of contempt for the irish was sufficient provocation and justification of lady geraldines ridicule he was much in awe of his fair and witty cousin she could easily put him out of countenance for he was extremely bashful his lordship had that sort of bashfulness which makes a man surly and obstinate in his taciturnity which makes him turn upon all who approach him as if they were going to assault him which makes him answer a question as if it were an injury and repel a compliment as if it were an insult once when he was out of the room lady geraldine exclaimed that cousin craiglethorpe of mine is scarcely an agreeable man the awkwardness of mauvaise honte might be pitied and pardoned even in a nobleman continued her ladyship if it really proceeded from humility but here when i know it is connected with secret and inordinate arrogance tis past all endurance even his ways of sitting and standing provoke me they are so selfsufficient have you observed how he stands at the fire oh the caricature of the english fireside outdone then if he sits we hope that change of posture may afford our eyes transient relief but worse again bolstered up with his back against his chair his hands in his pockets and his legs thrown out in defiance of all passengers and all decorum there he sits in magisterial silence throwing a gloom upon all conversation as the frenchman said of the englishman for whom even his politeness could not find another compliment il faut avouer que ce monsieur a un grand talent pour le silence he holds his tongue till the people actually believe that he has something to say a mistake they could never fall into if he would but speak some of the company attempted to interpose a word or two in favour of lord craiglethorpes timidity but the vivacious and merciless lady went on i tell you my good friends it is not timidityit is all pride i would pardon his dulness and even his ignorance for one as you say might be the fault of his nature and the other of his education but his selfsufficiency is his own fault and that i will not and cannot pardon somebody says that nature may make a fool but a coxcomb is always of his own making now my cousinas he is my cousin i may say what i please of himmy cousin craiglethorpe is a solemn coxcomb who thinks because his vanity is not talkative and sociable that its not vanity what a mistake his silent superciliousness is to me more intolerable than the most garrulous egotism that ever laid itself open to my ridicule miss bland and miss ormsby both confessed that lord craiglethorpe was vastly too silent for the honour of my country continued lady geraldine i am determined to make this man talk and he shall say all that i know he thinks of us poor irish savages if he would but speak one could answer him if he would find fault one might defend if he would laugh one might perhaps laugh again but here he comes to hospitable openhearted ireland eats as well as he can in his own country drinks better than he can in his own country sleeps as well as he can in his own country accepts all our kindness without a word or a look of thanks and seems the whole time to think that born for his use we live but to oblige him there he is at this instant look at him walking in the park with his notebook in his hand setting down our faults and conning them by rote we are even with him i understand lady kilrush that my bright cousin craiglethorpe means to write a book a great book upon ireland lady kilrush replied that she understood lord craiglethorpe had it in contemplation to publish a tour through ireland or a view of ireland or something of that nature he with his means of acquiring information exclaimed lady geraldine posting from one great mans house to another what can he see or know of the manners of any rank of people but of the class of gentry which in england and ireland is much the same as to the lower classes i dont think he ever speaks to them or if he does what good can it do him for he cant understand their modes of expression nor they his if he inquire about a matter of fact i defy him to get the truth out of them if they dont wish to tell it and for some reason or other they will nine times in ten not wish to tell it to an englishman there is not a man woman or child in any cabin in ireland who would not have wit and cuteness enough to make my lard believe just what they please so after posting from dublin to cork and from the giants causeway to killarney after travelling east west north and south my wise cousin craiglethorpe will know just as much of the lower irish as the cockney who has never been out of london and who has never in all his born days seen an irishman but on the english stage where the representations are usually as like the originals as the chinese pictures of lions drawn from description are to the real animal now now look at his lordship cried miss bland he has his notebook out again mercy on us said miss callwell how he is writing yes yes write on my good cousin craiglethorpe pursued lady geraldine and nil the little notebook which will soon turn to a ponderous quarto i shall have a copy bound in morocco no doubt from the author if i behave myself prettily and i will earn it by supplying valuable information you shall see my friends how ill deserve well of my country if youll only keep my counsel and your own countenances presently lord craiglethorpe entered the room walking very pompously and putting his notebook up as he advanced oh my dear lord open the book again i have a bull for you lady geraldine after putting his lordship in good humour by this propitiatory offering of a bull continued to supply him either directly or indirectly by some of her confederates with the most absurd anecdotes incredible facts stale jests and blunders such as were never made by trueborn irishmen all which my lord craiglethorpe took down with an industrious sobriety at which the spectators could scarcely refrain from laughing sometimes he would pause and exclaim a capital anecdote a curious fact may i give my authority may i quote your ladyship yes if youll pay me a compliment in the preface whispered lady geraldine and now dear cousin do go up stairs and put it all in ink when she had despatched the noble author her ladyship indulged her laughter but now cried she only imagine a set of sober english readers studying my cousin craiglethorpes new view of ireland and swallowing all the nonsense it will contain when lord kilrush remonstrated against the cruelty of letting the man publish such stuff and represented it as a fraud upon the public lady geraldine laughed still more and exclaimed surely you dont think i would use the public and my poor cousin so ill no i am doing him and the public the greatest possible service just when he is going to leave us when the writingbox is packed i will step up to him and tell him the truth i will show him what a farrago of nonsense he has collected as materials for his quarto and convince him at once how utterly unfit he is to write a book at least a book on irish affairs wont this be deserving well of my country and of my cousin neither on this occasion nor on any other were the remonstrances of my lord kilrush of power to stop the course of this ladys flow of spirits and raillery whilst she was going on in this manner with the real lord craiglethorpe miss tracey was taking charming walks in the park with mr gabbitt and the young lady began to be seriously charmed with her false lord this was carrying the jest farther than lady geraldine had intended or foreseen and her goodnature would probably have disposed her immediately to dissolve the enchantment had she not been provoked by the interference of lord kilrush and the affected sensibility of miss clementina ormsby who to give me an exalted opinion of her delicacy expostulated incessantly in favour of the deluded fair one but my dear lady geraldine i do assure you it really hurts my feelings this is going too farwhen it comes to the heart i cant laugh i ownthe poor girls affections will be engagedshe is really falling in love with this odious surveyor but now my dear clementina i do assure you it really hurts my feelings to hear you talk so childishly when it comes to the heart affections engaged you talk of falling in love as if it were a terrible fall for my part i should pity a person much more for falling down stairs why my dear where is the mighty height from which miss tracey could fall she does not live in the clouds clementina as you do no ladies live there now for the best of all possible reasons because there are no men there so my love make haste and come down before you are out of your teens or you may chance to be left there till you are an angel or an old maid trust me my dear i who have tried tell you there is no such thing as falling in love nowadays you may slip slide or stumble but to fall in love i defy you i saw lady kildangans eyes fix upon me as her daughter pronounced the last sentence geraldine my dear you do not know what you are talking about said her ladyship your time may come geraldine nobody should be too courageous cupid does not like to be defied lady kildangan walked away as she spoke with a very wellsatisfied air leaving a party of us young people together lady geraldine looked haughtily vexed when in this mood her wit gave no quarter spared neither sex nor age every body says whispered she that mamma is the most artful woman in the world and i should believe it only that every body says it now if it were true nobody would know it lady geraldines air of disdain towards me was resumed i did not quite understand was it pride was it coquetry she certainly blushed deeply and for the first time that i ever saw her blush when her mother said your time may come geraldine my week being now at an end i resolved to take my leave when i announced this resolution i was assailed with the most pressing entreaties to stay a few days longerone day longer lady ormsby and sir harry said every thing that could be said upon the occasion indeed it seemed a matter of general interest to all except to lady geraldine she appeared wholly indifferent and i was not even gratified by any apparent affectation of desiring my departure curiosity to see whether this would be sustained by her ladyship to the last gave me resolution sufficient to resist the importunities of sir harry and i departed rejoicing that my indifference was equal to her ladyships as tasso said of some fair one whom he met at the carnival of mantua i ran some risk of falling in love i had been so far roused from my habitual apathy that i actually made some reflections as i returned home i began to perceive that there was some difference between woman and woman besides the distinctions of rank fortune and figure i think i owe to lady geraldine my first relish for wit and my first idea that a woman might be if not a reasonable at least a companionable animal i compared her ladyship with the mere puppets and parrots of fashion of whom i had been wearied and i began to suspect that one might find in a ladys lively nonsense a relief from ennui these reflections however did not prevent me from sleeping the greatest part of the morning on my way home nor did i dream of any thing that i can remember at the porters lodge i saw ellinor sitting at her spinningwheel and my thoughts took up my domestic affairs just where i had left them the preceding week chapter x in vain i attempted to interest myself in my domestic affairs the silence and solitude of my own castle appeared to me intolerably melancholy after my return from ormsby villa there was a blank in my existence during a week in which i can remember nothing that i did said or thought except what passed during one ride which mr mcleod compelled my politeness to take with him he came with the same face to see me and the same set of ideas as those he had before i went to ormsby villa he began to talk of my schemes for improving my tenantry and of my wish that he should explain his notions relative to the education of the poor of ireland which he said as i now seemed to be at leisure he was ready to do as concisely as possible as concisely as possible were the only words of his address that i heard with satisfaction but of course i bowed said i was much obliged and i should be happy to have the advantage of mr mleods opinions and sentiments what these were i cannot recollect for i settled myself in a reverie soon after his voice began to sound upon my ear but i remember at last he wakened me by proposing that i should ride with him to see a schoolhouse and some cottages which he had built on a little estate of his own in my neighbourhood for said he tis better my lord to show you what can be done with these people than to talk of what might be effected very true said i agreeing readily because i wanted to finish a conversation that wearied me and to have a refreshing ride it was a delightful evening and when we came on mleods estate i really could not help being pleased and interested in an unfavourable situation with all nature vegetable and animal against him he had actually created a paradise amid the wilds there was nothing wonderful in any thing i saw around me but there was such an air of neatness and comfort order and activity in the people and in their cottages that i almost thought myself in england and i could not forbear exclaiminghow could all this be brought about in ireland chiefly by not doing and not expecting too much at first said mleod we took time and had patience we began by setting them the example of some very slight improvements and then lured on by the sight of success they could make similar trials themselves my wife and i went among them and talked to them in their cottages and took an interest in their concerns and did not want to have every thing our own way and when they saw that they began to consider which way was best so by degrees we led where we could not have driven and raised in them by little and little a taste for conveniences and comforts then the business was done for the moment the taste and ambition were excited to work the people went to gratify them and according as they exerted themselves we helped them perhaps it was best for them and for us that we were not rich for we could not do too much at a time and were never tempted to begin grand schemes that we could not finish there said mcleod pointing to a cottage with a pretty porch covered with woodbine and a neat garden in which many children were busily at work that house and that garden were the means of doing all the rest that is our schoolhouse we could not expect to do much with the old whose habits were fixed but we tried to give the young children better notions and it was a long time before we could bring that to bear twentysix years we have been at this work and in that time if we have done any thing it was by beginning with the children a race of our own training has now grown up and they go on in the way they were taught and prosper to our hearts content and what is better still to their hearts content mcleod habitually grave and taciturn seemed quite enlivened and talkative this day but i verily believe that not the slightest ostentation or vanity inspired him for i never before or since heard him talk or allude to his own good deeds i am convinced his motive was to excite me to persevere in my benevolent projects by showing what had been done by small means he was so truly in earnest that he never perceived how tired i was indeed he was so little in the habit of expecting sympathy or applause that he never missed even the ordinary expressions of concurrent complaisance religion continued he is the great difficulty in ireland we make no difference between protestants and catholics we always have admitted both into our school the priest comes on saturday morning and the parish minister on saturday evening to hear the children belonging to each church their catechisms and to instruct them in the tenets of their faith and as we keep to our word and never attempt making proselytes nor directly or indirectly interfere with their religious opinions the priests are glad to let us instruct the catholic children in all other points which they plainly see must advance their temporal interests mr mcleod invited me to go in and look at the school in a hedge or ditch school said he which i once passed on this road and in which i saw a crowd of idle children i heard the schoolmaster cry out rehearse rehearse theres company going by and instantly all the boys snatched up their books and began gabbling as fast as ever they could to give an idea to the passenger of their diligence in repeating their lessons but here my lord continued mleod you will not see any exhibitions got up for company i hate such tricks walk in my lord if you please i walked in but am ashamed to say that i observed only that every thing looked as if it had been used for many years and yet not worn out and the whole school appeared as if all were in their places and occupied and intent upon their business but this general recollection is all i have retained the enthusiasm for improvement had subsided in my mind and though i felt a transient pleasure in the present picture of the happiness of these poor people and their healthy children yet as i rode home the images faded away like a dream i resolved indeed at some future period to surpass all that mr mleod had done or all that with his narrow income he could ever accomplish and to this resolution i was prompted by jealousy of this man rather than by benevolence before i had arranged even in imagination my plans young ormsby came one morning and pressed me to return with him to ormsby villa i yielded to his solicitations and to my own wishes when i arrived the ladies were all at their toilettes except miss bland who was in the bookroom with the gentlemen ready to receive me with her perpetual smile wherever miss bland went she was always lamie de la maison accustomed to share with the lady of the house the labour of entertaining her guests this double of lady ormsby talked to me most courteously of all the nothings of the day and informed me of the changes which had taken place in the evervarying succession of company at ormsby villa the two brigadiers and one of the aidesdecamp were gone but captain andrews another castle aidedecamp was come and my lord otoole had arrived then followed a byconversation between miss bland and some of the gentlemen about the joy and sorrow which his lordships arrival would create in the hearts of two certain ladies one of whom as i gathered from the innuendoes was lady hauton and the other lady otoole as i knew nothing of dublin intrigues and scandal i was little attentive to all this miss bland persisting in entertaining me proceeded to inform me that my lord otoole had brought down with him mr cecil devereux who was a wit and a poet very handsome and gallant and one of the most fashionable young men in dublin i determined not to like himi always hated a flourish of trumpets whoever enters announced in this parading manner appears to disadvantage mr cecil devereux entered just as the flourish ceased he was not at all the sort of person i was prepared to see though handsome and with the air of a man used to good company there was nothing of a coxcomb in his manner on the contrary there was such an appearance of carelessness about himself and deference towards others that notwithstanding the injudicious praise that had been bestowed on him and my consequent resolution to dislike him i was pleased and familiar with him before i had been ten minutes in his company lord kilrush introduced him to me with great pomposity as a gentleman of talents for whom he and his brother otoole interested themselves much this air of patronage i saw disgusted mr devereux and instead of suffering himself to be shown off he turned the conversation from his own poems to general subjects he asked me some questions about a curious cavern or subterraneous way near glenthorn castle which stretched from the seashore to a considerable distance under the rock and communicated with an old abbey near the castle mr devereux said that such subterraneous places had been formerly used in ireland as granaries by the ancient inhabitants but a gentleman of the neighbourhood who was present observed that the caverns on this coast had within his memory been used as hidingplaces by smugglers on this hint lord kilrush began a prosing dissertation upon smugglers and contraband traders and talked to me a prodigious deal about exports and imports and bounties and the balance of trade not one word he said did i comprehend and i question whether his lordship understood the subjects upon which he spoke so dictatorially but he thought he succeeded in giving me an opinion of his wisdom and information his brother otoole appeared next he did not look like a man of gallantry as i had been taught to expect from the hints thrown out respecting lady hauton his lordships whole soul seemed devoted to ambition and he talked so much of great men and state affairs and court intrigues and honours and preferments that i began to fancy i had been buried alive because i knew little of these things i was tired of hearing him yet mortified that i could not speak exactly in the same manner and with the same air of being the best possible authority i began to wish that i also had some interest at court the cares and troubles of the ambitious man so utterly repugnant to the indolence of my disposition vanished in this moment of infatuation from my view and i thought only of the pleasures of power such is the infectious nature of ambition mr devereux helped me to throw off this dangerous contagion before it did me any injury he happened to stay in the room with me a quarter of an hour after the other gentlemen went to dress though not often disposed to conversation with a stranger yet i was won by this gentlemans easy address he politely talked of the english fashionable world with which he knew that i was well acquainted i with equal politeness recurred to the irish great world we fastened together upon lord otoole who took us to dublin castle and i began to express my regret that i had not yet been at the irish court and that i had not earlier in life made myself of political consequence ambition said i might help to keep a man awake and alive all common pleasures have long since ceased to interest methey really cannot make me stir my lord said mr devereux you would do better to sit or lie still all your life than to toil for such vain objects full little knowest thou that hast not tried what hell it is in sueing long to bide your lordship may remember spensers description of that hell not exactly said i unwilling to lower the good opinion this gentleman seemed to have taken for granted of my literature he took spensers poems out of the bookcase and i actually rose from my seat to read the passage for what trouble will not even the laziest of mortals take to preserve the esteem of one by whom he sees that he is overvalued i read the following ten lines without yawning full little knowest thou that hast not tried what hell it is in sueing long to bide to lose good days that might be better spent to waste long nights in pensive discontent to speed today to be put back tomorrow to feed on hope to pine with fear and sorrow to fret thy soul with crosses and with cares to eat thy heart through comfortless despairs to fawn to crouch to wait to ride to run to spend to give to want to be undone very strong indeed said i with a competent air as if used to judge of poetry and it comes with still greater force when we consider by whom it was written a man you know my lord who had been secretary to a lord lieutenant i felt my nascent ambition die away within me i acknowledged it was better to spend an easy life my determination was confirmed at this instant by the appearance of lady geraldine ambition and love it is said are incompatible passions neither of them had yet possession of my heart but love and lady geraldine had perhaps a better chance than ambition and lord otoole lady geraldine appeared in high spirits and though i was not a vain man i could not help fancying that my return to ormsby villa contributed to her charming vivacity this gratified me secretly and soberly as much as it visibly delighted her mother miss bland to pay her court to lady kildangan observed that lady geraldine was in uncommonly fine spirits this evening lady geraldine threw back a haughty frown over her left shoulder this was the only time i ever saw her notice in any manner any thing that fell from her obsequious friend to avert the fair ones displeasure i asked for miss tracey and mr gabbitt mr gabbitt said her ladyship resuming her goodhumour instantly mr gabbitt is gone off the happiest man in ireland with the hopes of surveying my lord otooles estate a good job which i was bound in honour to obtain for him as a reward for taking a good joke after mocking him with the bare imagination of a feast you know the barmecide in the arabian tales gave poor shakabac a substantial dinner a full equivalent for the jest and miss tracey said i what did your ladyship do for her i persuaded her mamma that the sweet creature was falling into an atrophy so she carried the forlorn damsel post haste to the black rock for the recovery of her health or her heart clementina my dear no reproachful looks in your secret soul do not you know that i could not do a young lady a greater favour than to give her a plausible excuse for getting away from home i was afraid that lady geraldine would feel the want of her butt however i found that miss traceys place was supplied by captain andrews one of the castles aidesdecamp and when captain andrews was out of the way lord kilrush and his brother otoole were good marks high and mighty as these personages thought themselves and respectfully nay obsequiously as they were treated by most others to this lady their characters appeared only a good study and to laugh at them seemed only a good practice perhaps my lord said she to me you do not yet know my lord otoole i have had the honour to be introduced to him thats well for he thinks that not to know him argues yourself unknown but as your lordship is a stranger in this country you may be pardoned and i will make you better acquainted with him i suppose you know there are many tooles in ireland some very ancient respectable and useful this however is but a mere political tool and the worst of all tools a cats paw theres one thing to the credit of these brothers they agree vastly well for one delights in being always on the stage and the other always behind the scenes these brothers with captain andrewsi hope they are none of them within hearingform a charming trio all admirable in their way my lord otoole isartifice without art my lord kilrushimportance without power and captain andrewspliability without ease poor andrews hes a defenceless animalsafe in impenetrable armour give him but timeas a man said who once showed me a landtortoisegive him but time to draw his head into his shell and a broadwheeled waggon may go over him without hurting him lord glenthorn did you ever observe captain andrewss mode of conversation no i never heard him converse converse nor i indeed but you have heard him talk i have heard him sayvery trueand of course lord glenthorn is quite severe this evening said mrs oconnor but though your lordship continued lady geraldine may have observed captain andrewss wonderful economy of words do you know whence it arises perhaps you think from his perception of his own want of understanding not from his perception of the want said i again again said mrs oconnor with an insulting tone of surprise lord glenthorns quite witty this evening lady geraldine looked as if she were fully sensible of the want of politeness in mrs oconnors mode of praising but my lord pursued she you wrong captain andrews if you attribute his monosyllabic replies either to stupidity or timidity you have not guessed the reason why he never gives on any subject more than half an opinion it was in the diplomatic school he was taught that art said mr devereux you must know pursued lady geraldine that captain andrews is only an aidedecamp till a diplomatic situation can be found for him and to do him justice he has been so well trained in the diplomatic school that he will not hazard an assertion on any subject he is not certain of any thing not even of his own identity he assuredly wants said devereux the only proof of existence which descartes would admiti think therefore i am he has such a holy horror of committing himself continued lady geraldine that if you were to ask him if the sun rose this morning he would answer with his sweet smileso i am toldorso i am informed begging your ladyships pardon cried mr devereux that is much too affirmative in the pure diplomatic style impersonal verbs must ever be used in preference to active or passive so i am told lays him open to the dangerous questions who told you or by whom were you informed then he is forced into the imprudence of giving up his authorities whereas he is safe in the impersonality of so it is said or so it is reported how i should like to see a meeting between two perfectly finished diplomatists cried lady geraldine that is demonstrably impossible said mr devereux for in certain political as well as in certain geometrical lines there is a continual effort to approach without a possibility of meeting lady geraldines raillery like all other things would perhaps soon have become tiresome to me but that there was infinite variety in her humour at first i had thought her merely superficial and intent solely upon her own amusement but i soon found that she had a taste for literature beyond what could have been expected in one who lived so dissipated a life a depth of reflection that seemed inconsistent with the rapidity with which she thought and above all a degree of generous indignation against meanness and vice which seemed incompatible with the selfish character of a fine lady and which appeared quite incomprehensible to the imitating tribe of her fashionable companions i mentioned a mrs norton and lady hauton amongst the company of ormsby villa these two english ladies whom i had never met in any of the higher circles in london who were persons of no consequence and of no marked character in their own country made it seems a prodigious sensation when they came over to ireland and turned the heads of half dublin by the extravagance of their dress the impertinence of their airs and the audacity of their conduct fame flew before them to the remote parts of the country and when they arrived at ormsby villa all the country gentlemen and ladies were prepared to admire these celebrated fashionable belles all worshipped them present and abused them absent except lady geraldine who neither joined in the admiration nor inquired into the scandal one morning mrs norton and lady hauton had each collected her votaries round her one group begging patterns of dress from lady hauton who stood up in the midst of them to have everything she wore examined and envied the other group sat on a sofa apart listening to mrs norton who sotto voce was telling interesting anecdotes of an english crim con which then occupied the attention of the fashionable world mrs norton had letters from the best authorities in london which she was entreated by her auditors to read to them mrs norton went to look for the letters lady hauton to direct her woman to furnish some patterns of i know not what articles of dress and in the mean time all the company joined in canvassing the merits and demerits of the dress and characters of the two ladies who had just left the room lady geraldine who had kept aloof and who was examining some prints at the farther end of the room at this instant laid down her book and looked upon the whole party with an air of magnanimous disdain then smiling as in scorn she advanced towards them and in a tone of irony addressing one of the swanlinbar graces my dear theresa said her ladyship you are absolutely ashamed i see of not being quite naked and you my good bess will no doubt very soon be equally scandalized at the imputation of being a perfectly modest woman go on my friends go on and prosper beg and borrow all the patterns and precedents you can collect of the newest fashions of folly and vice make haste make haste they dont reach our remote island fast enough we irish might live in innocence half a century longer if you didnt expedite the progress of profligacy we might escape the plague that rages in neighbouring countries if we didnt without any quarantine and with open arms welcome every suspected stranger if we didnt encourage the importation of whole bales of tainted fineries that will spread the contagion from dublin to cork and from cork to galway la said miss ormsby how severe your ladyship is and all only for ones asking for a pattern but you know pursued mrs oconnor that lady geraldine is too proud to take pattern from any body too proud am i well then ill be humble ill abase myselfshall i proud as i am ill put myself to school and ill do what the ladies hauton and norton shall advise to heighten my charms and preserve my reputation i must begin must not i mrs oconnor by learning not to blush for i observed you were ashamed for me yesterday at dinner when i blushed at something said by one of our fair missionaries then to whatever lengths flirtations and gallantry may go between unmarried or married people i must look on i may shut my eyes if i please and look down but not from shamefrom affectation i may as often as i please or to show my eyelashes memorandumto practise this before clementina ormsby my mirror of fashion so far so good for my looks but now for my language i must reform my barbarous language and learn from mrs norton with her pretty accommodating voice to call an intrigue an arrangement and a crim con an affair in doctors commons or that business before the lords we never mention hell to ears polite how virtuous we shall be when we have no name for vice but stay i must mind my lessonsi have more much more to learn from the dashing lady hauton i may learn if my head be but strong and my courage intrepid enough to touch the brink of all we hate without tumbling headlong into the gulf and from the interesting mrs norton as i hear it whispered amongst you ladies i may learn how with the assistance of a humanesociety to save a halfdrowned reputation it is i understand the glory of one class of fashionable females to seem worse than they are and of another class the privilege to be worse than they seem here clamorous voices interrupted lady geraldinesome justifying some attacking lady hauton and mrs norton oh lady geraldine i assure you notwithstanding all that was said about general and mrs norton i am convinced there was nothing in it and my dear lady geraldine though lady hauton does go great lengths in coquetting with a certain lord you must see that theres nothing wrong and that she means nothing but to provoke his ladys jealousy you know his lordship is not a man to fall in love with so because lady hautons passion is hatred instead of love and because her sole object is to give pain to a poor wife and to make mischief in families all her sins are to be forgiven now if i were forced to forgive any illconducted female i would rather excuse the woman who is hurried on by love than she who is instigated by hatred miss bland now began to support her ladyships opinion that lady hauton was much the worst of the two and all the scandal that was in circulation was produced by the partisans of each of these ladies no matter no matter which is the worst cried lady geraldine dont let us waste our time in repeating or verifying scandalous stories of either of them i have no enmity to these ladies i only despise them or rather their follies and their faults it is not the sinner but the sin we should reprobate oh my dear countrywomen cried lady geraldine with increasing animation of countenance and manneroh my dear countrywomen let us never stoop to admire and imitate these secondhand airs and graces follies and vices let us dare to be ourselves my eyes were fixed upon her animated countenance and i believe i continued gazing even after her voice ceased mrs oconnor pointed this out and i was immediately embarrassed miss bland accounted for my embarrassment by supposing that what lady geraldine had said of english crim cons had affected me from a look and a whisper among the ladies i guessed this but lady geraldine was too wellbred to suppose i could suspect her of illbreeding and illnature or that i could apply to myself what evidently was not intended to allude to my family misfortunes by an openness of manner and sweetness of expression which i cannot forget she in one single look conveyed all this to me and then resuming her conversation pray my lord said she you who have lived so much in the great world in england say for you can whether i am right or wrong in my suspicion that these ladies who have made such a noise in ireland have been little heard of in england i confirmed her ladyships opinion by my evidence the faces of the company changed thus in a few seconds the empire of lady hauton and of mrs norton seemed shaken to the foundation and never recovered from this shock the warmth of lady geraldines expressions on this and many other occasions wakened dormant feelings in my heart and made me sensible that i had a soul and that i was superior to the puppets with whom i had been classed one day lady kilrush in her mixed mode with partly the graces of a fine lady and partly the airs of a bel esprit was talking of mr devereux whom she affected to patronise and produce here devereux cried she cecil devereux what can you be thinking of i am talking to you heres this epitaph of francis the first upon petrarchs laura that you showed me the other day do you know i dote upon it i must have it translated nobody can do it so well as you i have not time but i shall not sleep tonight if it is not done and you are so quick so sit down here theres a dear man and do it in your elegant way for me whilst i go to my toilette perhaps you did not know that my name was laura said she leaving the room with a very sentimental air what will become of me cried devereux never was a harder task set by cruel patroness i would rather turn a persian tale for halfacrown read this my lord and tell me whether it will be easy to turn my lady kilrush into petrarchs laura this sonnet to be sure is rather difficult to translate or at least to modernize as bespoke said lady geraldine after she had perused the sonnet but i think mr devereux you brought this difficulty upon yourself how came you to show these lines to such an amateur such a fetcher and carrier of bays as lady kilrush you might have been certain that had they been trash with the name of francis the first and with your fashionable approbation and something to say about petrarch and laura my lady kilrush would talk for ever et se pamerait daffectation mr devereux said i has only to abide by the last lines as a good and sufficient apology to lady kilrush for his silence qui te pourra louer quen se taisant car la parole est toujours reprimee quand le sujet surmonte le disant there is no way to get out of my difficulties said mr devereux with a very melancholy look and with a deep sigh he sat down to attempt the translation of the poem in a few minutes however he rose and left the room declaring that he had the bad habit of not being able to do any thing in company lady geraldine now with much energy of indignation exclaimed against the pretensions of rich amateurs and the mean and presumptuous manner in which some wouldbe great people affect to patronise genius oh the baseness the emptiness of such patronising ostentation cried she i am accused of being proud myself but i hopei believei am sure that my pride is of another sort persons of any elevation or generosity of mind never have this species of pride but it is your mean secondrate folk who imagine that people of talent are a sort of rareeshow for their entertainment at best they consider men of genius only as artists formed for their use who if not in a situation to be paid with money are yet to be easily recompensed by praiseby their praisetheir praise heavens what conceit and these amateurpatrons really think themselves judges and presume to advise and direct genius and employ it to their petty purposes like that pietro de medici who at some of his entertainments set michael angelo to make a statue of snow my lord did you ever happen to meet with les memoires de madame de stael no i did not know that they were published you mistake me i mean madame de stael of louis the fourteenth and the regents time mademoiselle de launay i had never heard of such a person and i blushed for my ignorance nay i met with them myself only yesterday said lady geraldine i was struck with the character of the duchess de la ferte in which this kind of proud patronising ignorance is admirably painted from the life it is really worth your while my lord to look at it theres the book on that little table here is the passage you see this duchess de la ferte is showing off to a sisterduchess a poor girl of genius like a puppet or an ape allons mademoiselle parlezmadame vous allez voir comme elle parleelle vit que jhesitois a repondre et pensa quil falloit maider comme une chanteuse a qui lon indique ce quon desire dentendreparlez un peu de religion mademoiselle vous direz ensuite autre chose this speech mr devereux tells me has become quite proverbial in paris continued lady geraldine and it is often quoted when any one presumes in the duchess de la fertes style ignorance either in high or low life is equally selfsufficient i believe said i exerting myself to illustrate her ladyships remarks a gentleman of my acquaintance lately went to buy some razors at packwoods mrs packwood alone was visible upon the gentlemans complimenting her on the infinite variety of her husbands ingenious and poetical advertisements she replied la sir and do you think husband has time to write them there things hisself why sir we keeps a poet to do all that there work though lady geraldine spoke only in general of amateurpatrons and of men of genius yet i could not help fancying from the warmth with which she expressed herself and from her dwelling on the subject so long that her feelings were peculiarly interested for some individual of this description thus i discovered that lady geraldine had a heart and i suspected that her ladyship and mr devereux had also made the same discovery this suspicion was strengthened by a slight incident which occurred the following evening lady geraldine and cecil devereux as we were drinking coffee were in a recessed window while some of the company stood round them amused by their animated conversation they went on repartee after repartee as if inspired by each others spirits you two said a little girl of six years old who was playing in the window go on singing to one another like two nightingales and this shall be your cage added she drawing the drapery of the windowcurtains across the recessed window you shall live always together in this cage will you pretty birds no no some birds cannot live in a cage my dear cried lady geraldine playfully struggling to get free whilst the child held her prisoner mr devereux seems tolerably quiet and contented in his cage said the shrewd mrs oconnor i cant get out i cant get out cried devereux in the melancholy tone of the starling in the sentimental journey what is all this said my lady kildangan sailing up to us only two birds the child began singingbirds interrupted lady geraldine catching the little girl up in her arms and stopping her from saying more by beginning to sing most charmingly lady kildangan returned to the sofa without comprehending one word of what had passed for my part i now felt almost certain of the justice of my suspicions i was a little vexed but not by any means in that despair into which a man heartily in love would have been thrown by such a discovery well thought i it is well it is no worse it was very lucky that i did not fall quite in love with this fair lady since it seems that she has given her heart away but am i certain of this i was mistaken once let me examine more carefully now i had a new motive to keep my attention awake chapter xi to preserve the continuity of my story and not to fatigue the reader with the journals of my comings and goings from ormsby villa to glenthorn castle and from glenthorn castle to ormsby villa i must here relate the observations i made and the incidents that occurred during various visits at sir harry ormsbys in the course of the summer after the incident of the birds and cage my sagacity was for some time at fault i could not perceive any further signs of intelligence between the parties on the contrary all communication seemed abruptly to cease as i was not well versed in such affairs this quieted my suspicions and i began to think that i had been entirely mistaken cecil devereux spent his days shut up in his own apartment immersed as far as i could understand in the study of the persian language he talked to me of nothing but his hopes of an appointment which lord otoole had promised to procure for him in india when he was not studying he was botanizing or mineralogizing with otooles chaplain i did not envy him his new mode of life lady geraldine took no notice of it when they did meet which happened as seldom as possible there was an air of haughty displeasure on her part on his steady and apparently calm respect and selfsatisfaction her spirits were exuberant but variable and at times evidently forced his were not high but even and certain towards me her ladyships manners were free from coquetry yet politely gratifying as she marked by the sort of conversation she addressed to me her opinion that i was superior in ability and capability to what she had at first thought me and to what i had always thought myself mr devereux though with more effort treated me with distinction and showed a constant desire to cultivate my friendship on every occasion he endeavoured to raise my opinion of myself to give me ambition and courage to cultivate my mind once when i was arguing in favour of natural genius and saying that i thought no cultivation could make the abilities of one man equal to those of another he without seeming to perceive that i was apologizing at once for my own indolence and my intellectual inferiority answered in general terms it is difficult to judge what are the natural powers of the mind they appear so different in different circumstances you can no more judge of a mind in ignorance than of a plant in darkness a philosophical friend told me that he once thought he had discovered a new and strange plant growing in a mine it was common sage but so degenerated and altered that he could not know it he planted it in the open air and in the light and gradually it resumed its natural appearance and character mr devereux excited without fatiguing my mind by his conversation and i was not yet sufficiently in love to be seriously jealous i was resolved however to sound him upon the subject of lady geraldine i waited for a good opportunity at length as we were looking together over the prints of buergers lenore he led to the sort of conversation that i desired by telling me an anecdote relative to the poet which he had lately heard from a german baron burger was charmed with a sonnet which an unknown fair one addressed to him in praise of his poetry he replied in equal strains and they went on flattering one another till both believed themselves in love without ever having met they determined to marry they at length met and married they quarrelled and parted in other words the gentleman was terribly disappointed in his unknown mistress and she consoled herself by running away from him with another lover the imprudence of this poetic couple led us to reflections on love and marriage in general keeping far away from all allusion to lady geraldine i rallied mr devereux about the fair clementina who was evidently a romantic admirer of his who except cupid would barter his liberty for a butterfly said he and cupid was a child men nowadays are grown too wise to enslave themselves for women love occupies a vast space in a womans thoughts but fills a small portion in a mans life women are told that the great th important business of their life is love but men know that they are born for something better than to sing mournful ditties to a mistresss eyebrow as to marriage what a serious terrible thing some quaint old author says that man is of too smooth and oily a nature to climb up to heaven if to make him less slippery there be not added to his composition the vinegar of marriage this may be but i will keep as long as possible from the vinegar really devereux said i smiling you talk so like a cynic and an old bachelor and you look so little like either that it is quite ridiculous a man must be ridiculous sometimes said he and bear to be thought so no man ever distinguished himself who could not bear to be laughed at mr devereux left the room singing no more for amynta fresh garlands i wove ambition i said will soon cure me of love i was uncertain what to think of all this i inclined to believe that ambition was his ruling passion notwithstanding the description of that hell which he showed me in spenser his conduct to his patronlords by which a surer judgment of his character could be formed than by his professions was not however that of a man merely intent upon rising in the world i remember once hearing lord otoole attack a friend of this gentlemans calling him in a certain tone a philosopher mr devereux replied that he could not consider that as a term of reproach that where a false or pretended philosopher was meant some other name should be used equivalent to the italian term of reproach filosofastro lord otoole would by no means admit of this italianism he would make no distinctions he deemed philosophers altogether a race of beings dangerous and inimical to states for states read statesmen said devereux who persisted in the vindication of his friend till lord otoole grew pale with anger while captain andrews smiled with ineffable contempt at the political bevue lady geraldine glowed with generous indignation afterwards in speaking to me of lord otoole devereux said his lordships classification of men is as contracted as the savages classification of animals he divides mankind into two classes knaves and fools and when he meets with an honest man he does not know what to make of him my esteem for mr devereux was much increased by my daily observations upon his conduct towards lady geraldine i thought it particularly honourable when her displeasure evidently merged in esteem when her manners again became most winning and attractive his continued uniformly the same never passing the bounds of friendly respect or swerving in the slightest degree from the line of conduct which he had laid down for himself i thought i now understood him perfectly that he liked lady geraldine i could scarcely doubt but i saw that he refrained from aiming at the prize which he knew he ought not to obtain that he perceived her ladyships favourable disposition towards him yet denied himself not only the gratification of his vanity but the exquisite pleasure of conversing with her lest he should stand in the way of her happier prospects he frequently spoke to me of her ladyship in terms of the warmest approbation he said that all the world saw and admired her talents and beauty but that he had had opportunities as a relation of studying her domestic life with all her vivacity she has a heart formed for tenderness said he a high sense of duty the best security for a womans conduct and in generosity and magnanimity i never found her superior in either sex in short i never saw any woman whose temper and disposition were more likely to make a man of sense and feeling supremely happy i could not forbear smiling and asking cecil devereux how all this accorded with his late professions of hatred to marriage my professions were sincere said he it would be misery to me to marry any inferior woman and i am not in circumstances to marry as i could wish i could not think of lady geraldine without a breach of trust of which your lordship i hope cannot suspect me her mother places confidence in me i am not only a relation but treated as a friend of the family i am not in love with lady geraldine i admire esteem respect her ladyship and i wish to see her united to a man if such a man there be who may deserve her we understand one another now your lordship will have the goodness never more to speak to me on this subject he spoke with much emotion but with steadiness and left me penetrated with feelings that were entirely new to me much as i admired his conduct i was yet undecided as to my own my aversion to a second marriage was not yet conqueredi was amused i was captivated by lady geraldine but i could not bring myself to think of making a distinct proposal captain andrews himself was not more afraid of being committed than i was upon this tender subject to gain time i now thought it necessary to verify all the praises mr devereux had bestowed on her ladyship magnanimity was a word that particularly struck my ear as extraordinary when applied to a female however by attending carefully to this lady i thought i discovered what mr devereux meant lady geraldine was superior to manoeuvring little arts and petty stratagems to attract attention she would not stoop even to conquer from gentlemen she seemed to expect attention as her right as the right of her sex not to beg or accept of it as a favour if it were not paid she deemed the gentleman degraded not herself far from being mortified by any preference shown to other ladies her countenance betrayed only a sarcastic sort of pity for the bad taste of the men or an absolute indifference and look of haughty absence i saw that she beheld with disdain the paltry competitions of the young ladies her companions as her companions indeed she hardly seemed to consider them she tolerated their foibles forgave their envy and never exerted any superiority except to show her contempt of vice and meanness to be in any degree excepted from the common herd to be in any degree distinguished by a lady so proud and with so many good reasons to be proud was flattering to my selflove she gave me no direct encouragement but i never advanced far enough to require encouragement much less to justify repulse sometimes i observed or i fancied that she treated me with more favour when mr devereux was present than at other times perhapsfor she was a woman not an angelto pique devereux and try if she could move him from the settled purpose of his soul he bore it all with surprising constancy his spirits however and his health began visibly to decline if i do not intrude too much on your valuable time mr devereux said her ladyship to him one evening in her most attractive manner may i beg you to read to us some of these beautiful poems of sir william jones there was a seat beside her ladyship on the sofa the book was held out by the finest arm in the world nay said lady geraldine do not look so respectfully miserable if you have any other engagements you have only to say so or if you cannot speak you may bow a bow you know is an answer to every thing and here is my lord glenthorn ready to supply your place pray do not let me detain you prisoner you shall not a second time say i cant get out devereux made no further effort to escape but took the book and his dangerous seat he remained with us contrary to his custom the whole evening afterwards as if he felt that some apology was necessary to me for the pleasure in which he had indulged himself perhaps my lord said he another man in my situation and with my feelings would think it necessary to retreat and prudent to secure his safety by flight but flight is unworthy of him who can combat and conquer the man who is sure of himself does not skulk away to avoid danger but advances to meet it armed secure in honesty this proud and rash security in his own courage strength of mind and integrity was the only fault of cecil devereux he never prayed not to be led into temptation he thought himself so sure of avoiding evil unconscious of his danger even though his disease was at its height he now braved it most imprudently he was certain that he should never pass the bounds of friendship he had proved this to himself and was satisfied he told me that he could with indifference nay with pleasure see lady geraldine mine in the mean time upon the same principle that he deemed flight inglorious he was proud to expose himself to the full force of loves artillery he was with us now every day and almost all day and lady geraldine was more charming than ever the week was fixed for her departure still i could not decide i understood that her ladyship would pass the ensuing winter in dublin where she would probably meet with new adorers and even if mr devereux should not succeed some adventurous knight might win and wear the prize this was an alarming thought it almost decided me to hazard the fatal declaration but then i recollected that i might follow her ladyship to town the next winter and that if the impression did not as might be hoped wear off during the intervening autumn it would be time enough to commit myself when i should meet my fair one in dublin this was at last my fixed resolution respited from the agonies of doubt i now waited very tranquilly for that moment to which most lovers look forward with horror the moment of separation i was sensible that i had accustomed myself to think about this lady so much that i had gradually identified my existence with hers and i thus found my spirit of animation much increased i dreaded the departure of lady geraldine less than the return of ennui in this frame of mind i was walking one morning in the pleasure grounds with lady geraldine when a slight accident made me act in direct contradiction to all my resolutions and i think inconsistently with my character but such is the nature of man and i was doomed to make a fool of myself even in the very temple of minerva among the various ornamental buildings in the grounds at ormsby villa there was a temple dedicated to this goddess from which issued a troop of hoyden young ladies headed by the widow oconnor and lady kilrush all calling to us to come and look at some charming discovery which they had just made in the temple of minerva thither we proceeded accompanied by the merry troop we found in the temple only a poetical inscription of lady kilrushs pompously engraved on a fine marble tablet we read the lines with all the attention usually paid to a ladys poetry in the presence of the poetess lady geraldine and i turned to pay some compliments on the performance when we found that lady kilrush and all her companions were gone gone all gone said lady geraldine and there they are making their way very fast down to the temple of folly lady kilrush you know is so baaashful she could not possibly stay to receive nos hommages i love to laugh at affectation call them back do my lord and you shall see the fair author go through all the evolutions of mock humility and end by yielding quietly to the notion that she is the tenth muse but run my lord or they will be out of our reach i never was seen to run on any occasion but to obey lady geraldine i walked as fast as i could to the door and to my surprise found it fastened locked i declare some of the witty tricks of the widow oconnor or the hoyden miss callwells how i hate hoydens cried lady geraldine but let us take patience they will be back presently if young ladies must perform practical jokes because quizzing is the fashion i wish they would devise something new this lockingup is so stale a jest to be sure it has lately to boast the authority of high rank in successful practice but these bungling imitators never distinguish between cases the most dissimilar imaginable silly creatures we have only to be wise and patient her ladyship sat down to reperuse the tablet i never saw her look so beautifulthe dignified composure of her manner charmed me it was so unlike the paltry affectation of some of the fashionable ladies by whom i had been disgusted i recollected the precedent to which she alluded i recollected that the lockingup ended in matrimony and as lady geraldine made some remarks upon the verses i suppose my answers showed my absence of mind why so grave my lord why so absent i assure you i do not suspect your lordship of having any hand in this vulgar manoeuvre i acquit you honourably therefore you need not stand any longer like a criminal what decided me at this instant i cannot positively tell whether it was the awkwardness of my own situation or the grace of her ladyships manner but all my prudential arrangements were forgotten all my doubts vanished before i knew that the words passed my lips i replied that her ladyship did me justice by such an acquittal but that though i had no part in the contrivance yet i felt irresistibly impelled to avail myself of the opportunity it afforded of declaring my real sentiments i was at her ladyships feet and making very serious love before i knew where i was in what words my longdelayed declaration was made i cannot recollect but i well remember lady geraldines answer my lord i assure you that you do not know what you are saying you do not know what you are doing this is all a mistake as you will find half an hour hence i will not be so cruelly vain as to suppose you serious not serious no man ever was more serious no nono no no i swore of course most fervently oh rise rise i beseech you my lord and dont look so like a hero though you have done an heroical action i grant how you ever brought yourself to it i cannot imagine but now for your comfort you are safevous voila quitte pour la peur do not however let this encourage you to venture again in the same foolish manner i know but few very few young ladies to whom lord glenthorn could offer himself with any chance or reasonable hope of being refused so take warning never again expect to meet with such another as my whimsical self never never can i expect to meet with any thing resembling your charming self cried i this was a new text for a lovers rhapsody it is not necessary and might not be generally interesting to repeat all the ridiculous things i said even if i could remember them lady geraldine listened to me and then very calmly replied granting you believe all that you are saying at this minute which i must grant from common gratitude and still more common vanity nevertheless permit me to assure you my lord that this is not love it is only a fancyonly the nettlerash not the plague you will not die this time i will insure your life so now jump out of the window as fast as you can and unlock the dooryou need not be afraid of breaking your neckyou know your life is insured come take the lovers leap and get rid of your passion at once i grew angry only a cloud said lady geraldineit will blow over i became more passionatei did not know the force of my own feelings till they met with an obstacle they suddenly rose to a surprising height now my lord cried lady geraldine with a tone and look of comic vexation this is really the most provoking thing imaginable you have no idea how you distress me nor of what exquisite pleasures you deprive meall the pleasures of coquetry legitimate pleasures in certain circumstances as i am instructed to think them by one of the first moral authorities there is a casei quote from memory my lord for my memory like that of most other people on subjects where i am deeply interested is tolerably tenaciousthere is a case says the best of fathers in his legacy to the best of daughtersthere is a case where a woman may coquet justifiably to the utmost verge which her conscience will allow it is where a gentleman purposely declines making his addresses till such time as he thinks himself perfectly sure of her consent now my lord if you had had the goodness to do so i might have made this delightful case my own and what charming latitude i might have allowed my conscience but now alas it is all over and i must be as frank as you have been under pain of forfeiting what i value more even than admirationmy own good opinion she paused and was silent for a few moments then suddenly changing her manner she exclaimed in a serious energetic tone yes i must i will be sincere let it cost me what it may i will be sincere my lord i never can be yours my lord you will believe me even from the effort with which i speak her voice softened and her face suffused with crimson as she spoke i love anothermy heart is no longer in my own possession whether it will ever be in my power consistently with my duty and his principles to be united with the man of my choice is doubtfulmore than doubtfulbut this is certain that with such a prepossession such a conviction in my mind i never could nor ought to think of marrying any other person i pleaded that however deserving of her preference the object of her favour might be yet that if there were as her own prudence seemed to suggest obstacles rendering the probability of her union with that person more than doubtful it might be possible that her superior sense and strength of mind joined to the persevering affection of another lover who would spare no exertions to render himself worthy of her might perhaps in time no no said she interrupting me do not deceive yourself i will not deceive you i give you no hopes that my sentiments may change i know my own mindit will not change my attachment is founded on the firm basis of esteem my affection has grown from the intimate knowledge of the principles and conduct of the man i love no other man let his merits be what they may could have these advantages in my opinion and when i say that the probability of our being united is more than doubtful i do not mean to deny that i have distant hope that change of circumstances might render love and duty compatible without hope i know love cannot long exist you see i do not talk romantic nonsense to you all that you say of prudence and time and the effect of the attentions of another admirer would be perfectly just and applicable if my attachment were a fancy of yesterdayif it were a mere young ladys commonplace first love but i am not a very young lady nor is this though a first love commonplace i do not you see in the usual style tell you that the man i adore is an angel and that no created form ever did or ever can resemble this angel in green and gold but on the contrary do justice to your lordships merit and believing as i do that you are capable of a real love still more believing that such an attachment would rouse you to exertion and bring to life and light a surprising number of good qualities yet i should deceive you unpardonably fatally for my own peace of mind if not for yours were i not frankly and decidedly to assure you that i never could reward or return your affection my attachment toi trust entirely where i trust at allmy attachment to mr devereux is for life he deserves itdeserves it all cried i struggling for utterance that is as much as a rival can say not more than i expected from you my lord but your ladyship says there is a hope of duty and love being compatible would lady kildangan ever consent she looked much disturbed no certainly not unlesslord otoole has promisednot that i depend on courtiers promisesbut lord otoole is a relation of ours and he has promised to obtain an appointment abroad in india for mr devereux if that were done he might appear of more consequence in the eyes of the world my mother might then perhaps be propitious my lord i give you the strongest proof of my esteem by speaking with such openness i have had the honour of your lordships acquaintance only a few months but without complimenting my own penetration i may securely trust to the judgment of mr devereux and his example has taught me to feel confidence in your lordship your conduct now will i trust justify my good opinion by your secrecy and by desisting from useless pursuit you will entitle yourself to my esteem and gratitude these i presume you will think worth securing my soul was so completely touched that i could not articulate mr devereux is righti see my lord that you have a soul that can be touched kissing hands i protest exclaimed a shrill voice at the window we turned and saw mrs oconnor and a group of tittering faces peeping in kissing hands after a good hours teteatete oh pray lady kildangan make haste here continued mrs oconnor make haste before lady geraldines blushes are over were you ever detected in the crime of blushing in your life mrs oconnor said i i never was found out locked up with so fine a gentleman replied mrs oconnor then it hurts your conscience only to be found out like all the rest of the vast family of the surfaces said lady geraldine resuming her spirit found outlocked upbless me bless me what is all this cried lady kildangan puffing up the hill for shame young ladies for shame continued her ladyship with a decent suppression of her satisfaction when she saw or thought she saw how matters stood unlock the door pray dont be vexed my geraldine fie fie mrs oconnor but quizzing is now so fashionablenobody can be angry with any body my geraldine consider we are all friends the door unlocked and as we were going out lady geraldine whispered to mefor mercys sake my lord dont break my poor mothers heart never let her know that a coronet has been within my grasp and that i have not clutched it lady kildangan who thought that all was now approaching that happy termination she so devoutly wished was so full of her own happy presentiments that it was impossible for me to undeceive her ladyship even when i announced before her to sir harry ormsby that i was obliged to return home immediately on particular business she was i am sure persuaded that i was going to prepare matters for marriagesettlements when i mounted my horse mr devereux pressed through a crowd assembled on the steps at the halldoor and offered me his hand with a look and manner that seemed to sayhave you sufficient generosity to be still my friend i know the value of your friendship mr devereux said i and i hope to deserve it better every year that i live for the effort which it cost me to say this i was rewarded lady geraldine who had retired behind her companions at this instant approached with an air of mingled grace and dignity bowed her head and gave me a smile of grateful approbation this is the last image left on my mind the last look of the charming geraldinei never saw her again after i got home i did not shave for two days and scarcely ever spoke i should have taken to my bed to avoid seeing any human creature but i knew that if i declared myself ill no power would keep my old nurse ellinor from coming to moan over me and i was not in a humour to listen to stories of the irish black beard or the ghost of king odonoghoe nor could i however troublesome have repulsed the simplicity of her affection instead of going to bed therefore i continued to lie stretched upon a sofa ruminating sweet and bitter thoughts after giving absolute orders that i should not be disturbed on any account whatever whilst i was in this state of reverie one of my servantsan odd irish fellow who under pretence of being halfwitted took more liberties than his companionsbolted into my presence plase your lordship i thought it my duty in spite of em all below to come up to advertise to your lordship of the news thats going through the country that they are all upside down at ormsby villa all mad entirelyfighting and setting off through the kingdom every one their own way and they say its all on account of something that miss clemmy ormsby told that lady geraldine said about my lord otooles being no better than a cats paw or something that way which made his lordship quite mad and he said in the presence of captain andrews and my lady kildangan and lady geraldine and all that were in it something that vexed lady geraldine which made mr cecil devereux mad next and he said something smart in reply that lord otoole could not digest he said which made his lordship madder than ever and he discharged mr devereux from his favour and he is not to get that place that was vacant the lordlieutenancy of some place in the indies that he was to have had this made lady geraldine mad and it was found out she was in love with mr devereux which made her mother mad the maddest of all they say so that none can hold her and she is crying night and day how her daughter might have had the first coronet in the kingdom maning you my lard if it had not been that she prefarred a beggarman maning mr cecil devereux who is as poor they say as a connaughtmanand hes forbid to think of her and shes forbid under pain of bread and water ever to set her eyes upon him the longest day ever she lives so the horses and coaches are ordered and they are all to be off with the first light for dublin and thats all my lard and all truth not a word of lies im telling i was inclined not to credit a story so oddly told but upon inquiry i found it true in its material points my own words to mr devereux and the parting look of lady geraldine were full in my recollection i was determined by an unexpected exertion to surprise both the lovers and to secure for ever their esteem and gratitude the appointment which mr devereux desired was not yet given away the fleet was to sail in a few days i started up from my sofaordered my carriage instantlyshaved myselfsent a courier on before to have horses ready at every stage to carry me to dublingot there in the shortest time possiblefound lord otoole but just arrived though unused to diplomatic language and political negotiation i knew pretty well on what they all hinge i went directly to the point and showed that it would be the interest of the party concerned to grant my request by expressing a becoming desire that my boroughs upon a question where a majority was required should strengthen the hands of government i obtained for my friend the favour he deserved before i quitted lord otoole his secretary captain andrews was instructed to write a letter announcing to mr devereux his appointment a copy of the former letter of refusal now lay before me it was in his lordships purest diplomatic styleas follows private lord otoole is concerned to inform mr devereux that he cannot feel himself justified in encouraging mr d under the existing circumstances to make any direct application relative to the last conversation his lordship had the honour to hold with mr devereux to cecil devereux esq c thursday the letter which i obtained and of which i took possession ran as follows private lord otoole is happy to have it in command to inform mr devereux that his lordships representations on the subject of their last conversation have been thought sufficient and that an official notification of the appointment to india which mr d desired will meet the wishes of mr devereux captain andrews has the honour to add his congratulations to cecil devereux esq c thursday having despatched this business with a celerity that surprised all the parties concerned and most myself i called at the lodgings of mr devereux delivered the letter to his servant and left town i could not bear to see either mr devereux or lady geraldine i had the pleasure to hear that the obtaining this appointment was followed by lady kildangans consent to their marriage soon after my return to glenthorn castle i received a letter of warm thanks from devereux and a polite postscript from lady geraldine declaring that though she felt much pleasure she could feel no surprise in seeing her opinion of lord glenthorn justified persuaded as she and mr devereux had always been that only motive and opportunity were wanting to make his lordships superior qualities known to the world and what was still more difficult to himself they left ireland immediately afterwards in consequence of their appointment in india i was raised in my own estimationi revelled a short time in my selfcomplacent reflections but when nothing more remained to be done or to be saidwhen the hurry of action the novelty of generosity the glow of enthusiasm and the freshness of gratitude were over i felt that though large motives could now invigorate my mind i was still a prey to habitual indolence and that i should relapse into my former state of apathy and disease chapter xii i remember to have heard in some epilogue to a tragedy that the tide of pity and of love whilst it overwhelms fertilizes the soul that it may deposit the seeds of future fertilization i believe but some time must elapse before they germinate on the first retiring of the tide the prospect is barren and desolate i was absolutely inert and almost imbecile for a considerable time after the extraordinary stimulus by which i had been actuated was withdrawn i was in this state of apathy when the rebellion broke out in ireland nor was i roused in the least by the first news of the disturbances the intelligence however so much alarmed my english servants that with one accord they left me nothing could persuade them to remain longer in ireland the parting with my english gentleman affected my lethargic selfishness a little his loss would have been grievous to such a helpless being as i was had not his place been immediately supplied by that halfwitted irishman joe kelly who had ingratiated himself with me by a mixture of drollery and simplicity and by suffering himself to be continually my laughingstock for in imitation of lady geraldine i thought it necessary to have a butt i remember he first caught my notice by a strange answer to a very simple question i asked what noise is that i hear my lard said he it is only the singing in my ears i have had it these six months another time when i reproached him for having told me a lie he answered why now indeed and plase your honour my lard i tell as few lies as possibly i can this fellow the son of a bricklayer had originally been intended for a priest and he went as he told me to the college of maynooth to study his humanities but unluckily the charms of some irish heloise came between him and the altar he lived in a cabin of love till he was weary of his smokedried heloise and then thought it convanient to turn sarving man as he could play on the flute and brush a coat remarkably well which he larned at maynooth by brushing the coats of the superiors though he was willing to be laughed at joe kelly could in his turn laugh and he now ridiculed without mercy the pusillanimity of the english renegadoes as he called the servants who had just left my service he assured me that to his knowledge there was no manner of danger excepted a man prefarred being afraid of his own shadow which some did rather than have nothing to talk of or enter into resolutions about with some of the spirited men in the chair unwilling to be disturbed i readily believed all that lulled me in my security i would not be at the trouble of reading the public papers and when they were read to me i did not credit any paragraph that militated against my own opinion nothing could awaken me i remember one day lying yawning on my sofa repeating to mr mleod who endeavoured to open my eyes to the situation of the country pshaw my dear sir there is no danger be assurednone at allnone at all for mercys sake talk to me of something more diverting if you would keep me awake time enough to think of these things when they come nearer to us evils that were not immediately near me had no power to affect my imagination my tenantry had not yet been contaminated by the epidemic infection which broke out soon after with such violence as to threaten the total destruction of all civil order i had lived in englandi was unacquainted with the causes and the progress of the disease and i had no notion of my danger all i knew was that some houses had been robbed of arms and that there was a set of desperate wretches called defenders but i was annoyed only by the rout that was now made about them having been used to the regular course of justice which prevailed in england i was more shocked at the summary proceedings of my neighbours than alarmed at the symptoms of insurrection whilst my mind was in this mood i was provoked by the conduct of some of the violent party which wounded my personal pride and infringed upon my imagined consequence my fosterbrothers forge was searched for pikes his house ransacked his bed and bellows as possible hiding places were cut open by accident or from private malice he received a shot in his arm and though not the slightest cause of suspicion could be found against him the party left him with a broken arm and the consolation of not being sent to jail as a defender without making any allowance for the peculiar circumstances of the country my indignation was excited in the extreme by the injury done to my fosterbrother his sufferings the tears of his mother the taunts of mr now captain hardcastle and the opposition made by his party called forth all the faculties of my mind and body the poor fellow who was the subject of this contest showed the best disposition imaginable he was excessively grateful to me for interesting myself to get him justice but as soon as he found that parties ran high against me he earnestly dissuaded me from persisting let it drop and plase your honour my lord let it drop and dont be making of yourself inimies for the likes of me sure what signifies my arm and before the next assizes shant i be as well as ever arm and all continued he trying to appear to move the arm without pain and theres the new bellows your honour has give me it does my heart good to look at em and it wont be long before i will be blowing them again as stout as ever and so god bless your honour my lord and think no more about itlet it drop entirely and dont be bringing yourself into trouble ay dont be bringing yourself into trouble dear added ellinor who seemed half distracted between her feelings for her son and her fears for me its a shame to think of the way theyve treated christybut theres no help now and its best not to be making bad worse and so as christy says let the thing drop jewel and dont be bringing yourself into trouble you dont know the natur of them people dearyou are too innocent for them entirely and myself does not know the mischief they might do yees true for ye pursued christy i wouldnt for the best cow ever i see that your honour ever larnt a sentence about me or my arm and it is not for such as we to be minding every little accidentso god lend you long life and dont be plaguing yourself to death let it drop and ill sleep well the night which i did not do the week for thinking of all the trouble you got and would get god presarve ye this generous fellows eloquence produced an effect directly contrary to what was intended both my feelings and my pride were now more warmly interested in his cause i insisted upon his swearing examinations before mr mleod who was a justice of the peace mr mleod behaved with the utmost steadiness and impartiality and in this trying moment when it was infamy to seem my friend he defended my conduct calmly but resolutely in private and in public and gave his unequivocal testimony in few but decided words in favour of my injured tenant i should have respected mr mleod more if i had not attributed this conduct to his desire of being returned for one of my boroughs at the approaching election he endeavoured with persevering goodness to convince me of the reality of the danger in the country my eyes were with much difficulty forced open so far as to perceive that it was necessary to take an active part in public affairs to vindicate my loyalty and to do away the prejudices that were entertained against me nor did my incredulity as to the magnitude of the peril prevent me from making exertions essential to the defence of my own character if not to that of the nation how few act from purely patriotic and rational motives at all events i acted and acted with energy and certainly at this period of my life i felt no ennui party spirit is an effectual cure for ennui and perhaps it is for this reason that so many are addicted to its intemperance all my passions were roused and my mind and body kept in continual activity i was either galloping or haranguing or fearing or hoping or fighting and so long as it was said that i could not sleep in my bed i slept remarkably well and never had so good an appetite as when i was in hourly danger of having nothing to eat the rebels were up and the rebels were downand lord glenthorns spirited conduct in the chair and indefatigable exertions in the field were the theme of daily eulogium amongst my convivial companions and immediate dependants but unfortunately my sudden activity gained me no credit amongst the violent party of my neighbours who persisted in their suspicions and my reputation was now still more injured by the alternate charge of being a trimmer or a traitor nay i was further exposed to another danger of which from my ignorance of the country i could not possibly be aware the disaffected themselves as i afterwards found really believed that as i had not begun by persecuting the poor i must be a favourer of the rebels and all that i did to bring the guilty to justice they thought was only to give a colour to the thing till the proper moment should come for my declaring myself of this absurd and perverse mode of judging i had not the slightest conception and i only laughed when it was hinted to me my treating the matter so lightly confirmed suspicion on both sides at this time all objects were so magnified and distorted by the mist of prejudice that no inexperienced eye could judge of their real proportions neither party could believe the simple truth that my tardiness to act arose from the habitual inertia of my mind and body whilst prepossessions were thus strong the time the important time in ireland the most important season of the year the assizes arrived my fosterbrothers cause or as it was now generally called lord glenthorns cause came on to be tried i spared no expense i spared no exertions i feed the ablest counsel and not content with leaving them to be instructed by my attorney i explained the affair to them myself with indefatigable zeal one of the lawyers whom i had seen or by whom i had been seen in my former inert state of existence at some wateringplace in england could not refrain from expressing his astonishment at my change of character he could scarcely believe that i was the same lord glenthorn of whose indolence and ennui he had formerly heard and seen so much alas all my activity all my energy on the present occasion proved ineffectual after a dreadful quantity of false swearing the jury professed themselves satisfied and without retiring from the box acquitted the persons who had assaulted my fosterbrother the mortification of this legal defeat was not all that i had to endure the victorious party mobbed me as i passed some time afterwards through a neighbouring town where captain hardcastle and his friends had been carousing i was hooted and pelted and narrowly escaped with my lifei who but a few months ago had imagined myself possessed of nearly despotic power but opinions had changed and on opinion almost all power is founded no individual unless he possess uncommon eloquence joined to personal intrepidity can withstand the combination of numbers and the force of prejudice such was the result of my first public exertions yet i was now happier and better satisfied with myself than i had ever been before i was not only conscious of having acted in a manly and generous manner but the alarms of the rebels and of the french and of the loyalists and the parading and the galloping and the quarrelling and the continual agitation in which i was kept whilst my character and life were at stake relieved me effectually from the intolerable burden of ennui chapter xiii and for the book of knowledge fair presented with an universal blank of natures works to me expunged and rased unfortunately for me the rebellion in ireland was soon quelled the nightly scouring of our county ceased the poor people returned to their duty and their homes the occupation of upstart and ignorant associators ceased and their consequence sunk at once things and persons settled to their natural level the influence of men of property and birth and education and character once more prevailed the spirit of party ceased to operate my neighbours wakened as if from a dream and wondered at the strange injustice with which i had been treated those who had lately been my combined enemies were disunited and each was eager to assure me that he had always been privately my friend but that he was compelled to conceal his sentiments each exculpated himself and threw the blame on others all apologized to me and professed to be my most devoted humble servants my popularity my power and my prosperity were now at their zenith unfortunately for me because my adversity had not lasted long enough to form and season my character i had been driven to exertion by a mixture of pride and generosity my understanding being uncultivated i had acted from the virtuous impulse of the moment but never from rational motive which alone can be permanent in its operation when the spur of the occasion pressed upon me no longer i relapsed into my former inactivity when the great interests and strong passions by which i had been impelled to exertion subsided all other feelings and all less objects seemed stale flat and unprofitable for the tranquillity which i was now left to enjoy i had no taste it appeared to me a dead calm most spiritless and melancholy i remember hearing some years afterwards a frenchman who had been in imminent danger of been guillotined by robespierre and who at last was one of those who arrested the tyrant declare that when the bustle and horror of the revolution were over he could hardly keep himself awake and that he thought it very insipid to live in quiet with his wife and family he further summed up the catalogue of robespierres crimes by exclaiming dailleurs cetoit un grand philanthrope i am not conscious of any disposition to cruelty and i heard this mans speech with disgust yet upon a candid selfexamination i must confess that i have felt though from different causes some degree of what he described perhaps ennui may have had a share in creating revolutions a french author pronounces ennui to be a moral indigestion caused by a monotony of situations i had no wife or family to make domestic life agreeable nor was i inclined to a second marriage my first had proved so unfortunate and the recollection of my disappointment with lady geraldine was so recent even the love of power no longer acted upon me my power was now undisputed my jealousy and suspicions of my agent mr mleod were about this time completely conquered by his behaviour at a general election i perceived that he had no underhand design upon my boroughs and that he never attempted or wished to interfere in my affairs except at my particular desire my confidence in him became absolute and unbounded but this was really a misfortune to me for it became the cause of my having still less to do i gave up all business and from all manner of trouble i was now free yet i became more and more unhappy and my nervous complaints returned i was not aware that i was taking the very means to increase my own disease the philosophical dr cullen observes that whatever aversion to application of any kind may appear in hypochondriacs there is nothing more pernicious to them than absolute idleness or a vacancy from all earnest pursuit it is owing to wealth admitting of indolence and leading to the pursuit of transitory and unsatisfying amusements or exhausting pleasures only that the present times exhibit to us so many instances of hypochondriacism i fancied that change of air and change of place would do me good and as it was fine summer weather i projected various parties of pleasure the giants causeway and the lake of killarney were the only things i had ever heard mentioned as worth seeing in ireland i suffered myself to be carried into the county of antrim and i saw the giants causeway from the description given by dr hamilton of some of these wonders of nature the reader may judge how much i ought to have been astonished and delighted in the bold promontory of bengore you behold as you look up from the sea a gigantic colonnade of basaltes supporting a black mass of irregular rock over which rises another range of pillars forming altogether a perpendicular height of one hundred and seventy feet from the base of which the promontory covered over with rock and grass slopes down to the sea for the space of two hundred feet more making in all a mass of near four hundred feet in height which in the beauty and variety of its colouring in elegance and novelty of arrangement and in the extraordinary magnificence of its objects cannot be rivalled yet i was seized with a fit of yawning as i sat in my pleasureboat to admire this sublime spectacle i looked at my watch observed that we should be late for dinner and grew impatient to be rowed back to the place where we were to dine not that i was hungry but i wanted to be again set in motion neither science nor taste expanded my view and i saw nothing worthy of my admiration or capable of giving me pleasure the watching a straw floating down the tide was the only amusement i recollect to have enjoyed upon this excursion i was assured however by lady ormsby that i could not help being enchanted with the lake of killarney the party was arranged by this lady who having the preceding summer seen me captivated by lady geraldine and pitying my disappointment had formed the obliging design of restoring my spirits and marrying me to one of her near relatives she calculated that as i had been charmed by lady geraldines vivacity i must be enchanted with the fine spirits of lady jocunda lawler so far were the thoughts of marriage from my imagination that i only was sorry to find a young lady smuggled into our party because i was afraid she would be troublesome but i resolved to be quite passive upon all occasions where attentions to the fair sex are sometimes expected my arm or my hand or my assistance in any manner i was determined not to offer the lounging indifference which some fashionable young men affect towards ladies i really felt and besides nobody minds unmarried women this fashion was most convenient to my indolence in my state of torpor i was not however long left in peace lady jocunda was a highbred romp who made it a rule to say and do whatever she pleased in a hundred indirect ways i was called upon to admire her charming spirits but the rattling voice loud laughter flippant wit and hoyden gaiety of lady jocunda disgusted me beyond expression a thousand times on my journey i wished myself quietly asleep in my own castle arrived at killarney such blowing of horns such boating such seeing of prospects such prosing of guides all telling us what to admire then such exclamations and such clambering i was walked and talked till i was halfdead i wished the rocks and the hangingwoods and the glens and the waterfalls and the arbutus and the myrtles and the upper and lower lakes and the islands and mucruss and mucruss abbey and the purple mountain and the eagles nest and the grand turk and the lights and the shades and the echoes and above all the lady jocunda fairly at the devil a nobleman in the neighbourhood had the politeness to invite us to see a staghunt upon the water the account of this diversion which i had met with in my guide to the lakes promised well i consented to stay another day that day i really was revived by this spectacle for it was new the sublime and the beautiful had no charms for me novelty was the only power that could waken me from my lethargy perhaps there was in this spectacle something more than novelty the romans had recourse to shows of wild beasts and gladiators to relieve their ennui at all events i was kept awake this whole morning though i cannot say that i felt in such ecstasies as to be in any imminent danger of jumping out of the boat of our journey back from killarney i remember nothing but my being discomfited by lady jocundas practical jests and overpowering gaiety when she addressed herself to me my answers were as constrained and as concise as possible and as i was afterwards told i seemed at the close of my reply to each interrogative of her ladyships to answer with odins prophetess now my weary lips i close leave me leave me to repose this she never did till we parted and at that moment i believe my satisfaction appeared so visible that lady ormsby gave up all hopes of me arrived at my own castle i threw myself on my bed quite exhausted i took three hours additional sleep every day for a week to recruit my strength and rest my nerves after all that i had been made to suffer by this young ladys prodigious animal spirits chapter xiv i could now boast that i had travelled all over ireland from north to south but in fact i had seen nothing of the country or of its inhabitants in these commodious parties of pleasure every thing had been provided to prevent the obstacles that roused my faculties accustomed by this time to the hibernian tone i fancied that i knew all that could be known of the irish character familiarized with the comic expressions of the lower class of people they amused me no longer on this journey however i recollect making one observation and once laughing at what i thought a practical bull we saw a number of labourers at work in a bog on a very hot day with a fire lighted close to them when i afterwards mentioned before mr mleod this circumstance which i had thought absurd he informed me that the irish labourers often light fires that the smoke may drive away or destroy those myriads of tiny flies called midges by which they are often tormented so much that without this remedy they would in hot and damp weather be obliged to abandon their work had i been sufficiently active during my journey to pen a journal i should certainly without further inquiry have noted down that the irish labourers always light fires in the hottest weather to cool themselves and thus i should have added one more to the number of cursory travellers who expose their own ignorance whilst they attempt to ridicule local customs of which they have not inquired the cause or discovered the utility a foreigner who has lately written letters on england has given a laughable instance of this promptitude of misapprehension he says he had heard much of the venality of the british parliament but he had no idea of the degree to which it extended till he actually was an eyewitness of the scene the moment the minister entered the house all the members ran about exclaiming places places which means give us placesgive us places my heavy indolence fortunately preserved me from exposing myself like these volatile tourists i was at least secure from the danger of making mistakes in telling what i never saw as to the mode of living of the irish their domestic comforts or grievances their habits and opinions their increasing or decreasing ambition to better their condition the proportion between the population and the quantity of land cultivated or capable of cultivation the difference between the profits of the husbandman and the artificer the relation between the nominal wages of labour and the actual command over the necessaries of lifethese were questions wholly foreign to my thoughts and at this period of my life absolutely beyond the range of my understanding i had travelled through my own country without making even a single remark upon the various degrees of industry and civilization visible in different parts of the kingdom in fact it never occurred to me that it became a british nobleman to have some notion of the general state of that empire in the legislation of which he has a share nor had i the slightest suspicion that political economy was a study requisite or suitable to my rank in life or situation in society satisfied with having seen all that is worth seeing in ireland the giants causeway and the lake of killarney i was now impatient to return to england during the rebellion i could not with honour desert my post but now that tranquillity was apparently restored i determined to quit a country of which my partial knowledge had in every respect been unfortunate this resolution of mine to leave ireland threw ellinor into despair and she used all her eloquence to dissuade me from the journey i was quite surprised by the agony of grief into which she was thrown by the dread of my departure i felt astonished that one human being could be so attached to another and i really envied her sensibility my new man joe kelly also displayed much reluctance at the thoughts of leaving his native country and this sentiment inclined ellinor to think more favourably of him though she could not quite forgive him for being a kelly of ballymuddy troth said she to him one day in my presence none of them kellys of ballymuddy but what are a bad clan joey is not there your own broders uncle lying in the jail of at this present time for the murder of a womanwell replied joe and if he was so unfortunate to be put up which was not asy done neither is it not better and more creditabler to lie in a jail for a murder than a robbery i ask you this new scale of crimes surprised me but joe spoke what was the sense of many of his countrymen at that period by various petty attentions this man contrived to persuade me of the sincerity of his attachment chiefly by the art of appearing to be managed by me in all things he insensibly obtained power over my pride and by saving me daily trouble secured considerable influence over my indolence more than any one whom i had ever seen he had the knack of seeming halfwittedtoo simple to overreach and yet sufficiently acute and droll to divert his master i liked to have him about me as uncultivated kings like to have their fools one of our ancient monarchs is said to have given three parishes to his joculator i gave only three farms to mine i had a sort of mean pride in making my favourite an object of envy besides i fell into the common mistake of the inexperienced great who fancy that attachment can be purchased and that gratitude can be secured by favours disproportioned to deserts joe kelly by sundry manoeuvres too minute for description contrived to make me delay from day to day the preparations for my journey to england from week to week it was put off till the autumn was far advanced at length kelly had nothing left to suggest but that it would be best to wait for answers from my english steward to the letters that had been written to inquire whether every thing was ready for my reception during this interval i avoided every human creature except joe kelly and was in great danger of becoming a misanthrope from mere indolence i did not hate my fellowcreatures but i dreaded the trouble of talking to them my only recreation at this period was sauntering out in the evening beside the seashore it was my regular practice to sit down upon a certain large stone at the foot of a rock to watch the ebbing of the tide there was something in the contemplation of the sea and of the tides which was fascinating to my mind i could sit and look at the ocean whole hours together for without any exertion of my own i beheld a grand operation of nature accompanied with a sort of vast monotony of motion and sound which lulled me into reverie late one evening as i was seated on my accustomed stone my attention was slightly diverted from the sea by the sight of a man descending the crag above me in rather a perilous manner with one end of a rope coiled round his body and the other fastened to a stake driven into the summit of the rock he let himself halfway down the terrible height one foot now rested on a projecting point one hand held the rope and hanging thus midway in the air he seemed busy searching in the crevices of the rock for the eggs of waterfowl this dangerous trade i had seen frequently plied on this coast so that i should scarcely have regarded the man if he had not turned from time to time as if to watch me when he saw that he had fixed my eye he threw down as i thought a white stone which fell nearly at my feet i stooped to examine it the man waited till he saw it in my hands then coiled himself swiftly up his rope to the summit of the rock and disappeared i found a paper tied round the stone and on this paper in a handwriting that seemed to be feigned were written these words your life and caracter one or tothersay both is in danger dont be walking here any more late in the evening near them caves nor dont go near the old abbey any timeand dont be trusting to joe kelly any waylave the kingdom entirely the wind sarves so prays your true wellwisher ps lave the castle the morrow and say nothing of this to joe kelly or youll repent when its all over wid you i was startled a little by this letter at first but in half an hour i relapsed into my apathy many gentlemen in the country had received anonymous letters i had been tired of hearing of them during the rebellion this i thought might be only a quiz or a trick to hurry me out of the kingdom contrived by some of those who desired my absence in short the labour of thinking about the matter fatigued me i burned the letter as soon as i got home and resolved not to puzzle or plague myself about it any more my stewards answer came the next morning from england kelly made no difficulty when i ordered him to be ready to set out in three days this confirmed me in my opinion that the letter was malicious or a jest mr mleod came to take leave of me i mentioned the circumstance to him slightly and in general terms he looked very serious and said all these things are little in themselves but are to be heeded as marking the unsettled minds of the peoplestraws that show which way the wind blows i apprehend we shall have a rough winter again though we have had so still a summer the people about us are too hush and too prudentit is not their naturestheres something contriving among them they dont break one anothers heads at fairs as they used to do they keep from whiskey there must be some strong motive working this change upon themgood or bad tis hard to say which my lord if we consider the condition of these poor people and if we consider the causes oh for heavens sake do not let us consider any more about it now i am more than half asleep already said i yawning and our considering about it can do no good to me at least for you know i am going out of the kingdom and when i am gone mleod you in whom i have implicit confidence must manage as you always used to do you know and as well as you can true said mleod calmly that is what i shall do indubitably for that is my duty and since your lordship has implicit confidence in me my pleasure i wish your lordship a good night and a good journey i shall not set out in the morning not till the day after tomorrow i believe said i for i feel consumedly tired tonight they have plagued me about so many things today so much business always before one can get away from a place and then joe kelly has no head have a care he has not too much head my lord as your anonymous correspondent hintshe may be right there i told you from the first i would not go security for joe kellys honesty and where there is not strict honesty i conceive there ought not to be implicit confidence oh hang it as to honesty they are none of them honest i know that but would you have me plague myself till i find a strictly honest servant joes as honest as his neighbours i dare say the fellow diverts me and is attached to me and thats all i can expect i must submit to be cheated as all men of large fortunes are more or less mr mleod listened with stubborn patience and replied that if i thought it necessary to submit to be cheated he could make no objection except where it might come under his cognizance and then he must take the liberty to remonstrate or to give up his agency to some of the many who could play better than he could the part of the dog in the fable pretending to guard his masters meat the cold ungracious integrity of this man even in my own cause at once excited my spleen and commanded my respect after shaking my leg as i sat for two minutes in silence i called after mleod who moved towards the door why what can i do mr mleod what would you have me do now dont give me one of your dry answers but let me have your notions as a friend you know mleod i cannot help having the most perfect confidence in you he bowed but rather stiffly i am proud to hear you cannot help that my lord said he as to a friend i never considered myself upon that footing till now but as you at present honour me so far as to ask my counsel i am free to give it part with joe kelly tonight and whether you go or stay you are safer without him joes a rogue he can do no good and may do harm then said i you are really frightened by this anonymous letter cannot a man take prudent precautions without being frightened said mleod but have you any particular reason to believein short toto think there can be any real danger for my life no particular reason my lord but the general reasons i have mentioned the symptoms among the common people lead me to apprehend there may be fresh risings of the people soon and you as a man of fortune and rank must be in danger captain hardcastle says that he has had informations of seditious meetings but he being a prejudiced man i dont trust altogether to what he says trust altogether to what he says exclaimed i no surely for my part i do not trust a word he says and his giving it as his opinion that the people are illinclined would decide me to believe the exact contrary it would hardly be safe to judge that way either said mleod for that method of judging by contraries might make anothers folly the master of ones own sense i dont comprehend you now safe way of judging or not captain hardcastles opinion shall never lead mine when i asked for your advice mr mleod it was because i have a respect for your understanding but i cannot defer to captain hardcastles i am now decided in my own opinion that the people in this neighbourhood are perfectly welldisposed and as to this anonymous letter it is a mere trick depend upon it my good sir i am surprised that a man of your capacity should be the dupe of such a thing i should not be surprised if hardcastle himself or some of his people wrote it i should said mleod coolly you should cried i warmly why so and why do you pronounce so decidedly my good friend have not i the same means of judging as you have unless indeed you have some private reason with which i am unacquainted perhaps cried i starting half up from the sofa on which i lay charmed with a bright idea which had just struck me perhaps mleod you wrote the letter yourself for a jest did you thats a question my lord said mleod growing suddenly red and snatching up his hat with a quicker motion than i ever saw from him before thats a question my lord which i must take leave not to answer a question give me leave to add my lord glenthorn continued he speaking in a broader scotch accent than i had ever heard from him before which i should knock my equal doon for putting to me a mleod my lord in jest or in earnest would scorn to write to any man breathing that letter to which he would not put his name and more a mleod would scorn to write or to say that thing to which he ought not to put his name your humble servant my lord glenthorn said he and making a hasty bow departed i called after him and even followed him to the head of the stairs to explain and apologize but in vain i never saw him angry before its very weel my lord its very weel if you say you meant nothing offensive its very weel but if you think fit my lord we will sleep upon it before we talk any more i am a wee bit warmer than i could wish and your lordship has the advantage of me in being cool a mleod is apt to grow warm when hes touched on the point of honour and theres no wisdom in talking when a mans not his own master my good friend said i seizing his hand as he was buttoning up his coat i like you the better for this warmth but i wont let you sleep upon your wrath you must shake hands with me before that halldoor is opened to you then so i do for theres no standing against this frankness and to be as frank with you my lord i was wrong myself to be so testyi ask pardon too a mleod never thought it a disgrace to crave a pardon when he was wrong we shook hands and parted better friends than ever i spoke the exact truth when i said that i liked him the better for his warmth his anger wakened me and gave me something to think of and some emotion for a few minutes joe kelly presently afterwards came with the simplest face imaginable to inquire what i had determined about the journey to put it off till the day after tomorrow said i light me to bed he obeyed but observed that it was not his fault now if there was puttingsoff for his share every thing was ready and he was willing and ready to follow me at a moments warning to the worlds end as he had a good right to do let alone inclination for parting me he could never be right in himself and though loth to part his country he had rather part that nor me then without dwelling upon these expressions of attachment he changed to a merry mood and by his drolleries diverted me all the time i was going to bed and at last fairly talked me asleep chapter xv when the first grey light of morning began to make objects indistinctly visible i thought i saw the door of my apartment open very softly i was broad awake and kept my eyes fixed upon itit opened by very slow degrees my head was so full of visions that i expected a ghost to enterbut it was only ellinor ellinor cried i is it you at this time in the morning hush hush said she shutting the door with great precaution and then coming on tiptoe close to my bedside for the love of god speak softly and make no stir to awake them thats asleep near and too near you its unknown to all that i come up for may be when them people are awake and about i might not get the opportunity to speak or they might guess i knew something by my looks her looks were full of terrori was all amazement and expectation before she would say a word more she searched the closets carefully and looked behind the tapestry as if she apprehended that she might be overheard satisfied that we were alone she went on speaking but still in a voice that with my utmost strained attention i could but just hear as you hope to live and breathe said she never go again after nightfall any time walking in that lone place by the seashore its a mercy you escaped as you did but if you go again youll never come back alivefor never would they get you to do what they want and to be as wicked as themselves the wicked villains who said i what wicked villains i do not understand you are you in your right senses that i am and wish you was as much in yours but its time yet by the blessing of god what wicked villains am i talking of of three hundred that have sworn to make you their captain or in case you refuse to have your life this night what villains am i talking of of him the wickedest of all who is now living in the very house with you that is now lying in the very next room to you joe kelly that same from the first minute i saw him in the castle i should have hated him but for his causing you for to put off the journey to england i never could abide him but that blinded me or i am sure i would have found him out long ago and what have you found out concerning him that he is speaking very low a unitedman and stirring up the rubbles again here and they have their meetings at night in the great cave where the smugglers used to hide formerly under the big rock opposite the old abbeyand theres a way up into the abbey that you used to be so fond of walking to dear good heavens can this be true true it is and too true dear but how did you find all this out ellinor it was none of i found it nor ever could any such things have come into my headbut it pleased god to make the discovery of all by one of the childermy own grandsonthe boy you gave the gun to long and long ago to shoot them rabbits he was after a hare yesterday and it took him a chase over that mountain and down it went and took shelter in the cave and in went the boy after it and as he was groping about he lights on an old great coat and he brought it home with him and was showing it as i was boiling the potatoes for their dinner yesterday to his father forenent me and turning the pockets inside out what should come up but the broken head of a pipe then he sarches in the other pocket and finds a paper written all overi could not read itthank god i never could read none of them wicked things nor could the boyby very great luck he could not being no scholar or it would be all over the country before this well well but what was in the paper after all did any body read it ay did theythat is christy read itnone but christybut he would not tell us what was in itbut said it was no matter and hed not be wasting his time reading an old songso we thought no more and he sent the boy up to the castle with a bill for smiths work as soon as we had eat the potatoes and i thought no more about any things being going wrong no more than a child and in the evening christy said he must go to the funeral of a neighbour and should not be home till early in the morning may be and its not two hours since he came home and wakened me and told me where he had been which was not to the funeral at all but to the cave where the coat was found and he put the coat and the broken head of the pike and the papers all in the pockets just as we found it in the caveand the paper was a list of the names of them rubbles that met there and a letter telling how they would make lord glenthorn their captain or have his life this was what made christy to try and find out moreso he hid hisself in a hole in the side of the cave and built hisself up with rubbish only just leaving a place for hisself to breatheand there he stayed till nightfall and then on till midnight god help us so sure enough them villains all come filling fast into the cave he had good courage god bless him for itbut he always hadand there he heard and saw alland this was how they were talkingfirst one began by saying how they must not be delaying longer to show themselves they must make a rising in the countrythen named the numbers in other parts that would join and that they would not be put down so asy as afore for they would have good leadersthen some praised you greatly and said they was sure you favoured them in your heart by all the illwill you got in the county the time of the last ruction but again others said you was milk and water and did not go far enough and never would and that it was not in you and that you was a sleepy man and not the true thing at all and neither beef nor vael again thim that were for you spoke and said you would show yourself soonand the others made reply and observed you must now spake out or never spake more you must either head em or be tramped under foot along with the rest so it did not signify talking and joey kelly should not be fribbling any more about it and it was a wonder said they he was not the night at the meeting and what was this about your being going off for englandwhat would they do when you was gone with mleod the scotchman to come in over them again agent who was another guess sort of man from you and never slept at all and would scent em out and have his corps after em and that once mleod was master there would be no making any head again his head so not to be tiring you too much with all they said backward and forward one that was a captain or something that way took the word and bid em all hold their peace for they did not know what they was talking on and said that joey kelly and he had settled it all and that the going to england was put off by joe and all a sham and that when you would be walking out tomorrow at nightfall in those lone places by the seaside or the abbey he and joe was to seize upon you and when you would be coming back near the abbey to have you down through the trapdoor into the cave and any way they would swear you to join and head them and if you would not out with you and shove you into the sea and no more about it for it would be give out you drown yourself in a fit of the melancholy lunacy which none would question and it would be proved too you made away wid yourself by your hat and gloves lying on the banklord save us what are you laughing at in that when it is truth every word and joe kelly was to find the body after a great search well again say you would swear and join them and head them and do whatever they pleased still that would not save you in the end for they would quarrel with you at the first turn because you would not be ruled by them as captain and then they would shoot or pike you god save the mark dear and give the castle to joe kelly and the plunder all among em entirely so it was all laid out and they are all to meet in the cave tomorrow eveningthey will go along bearing a funeral seemingly to the abbeyground and now you know the whole truth and the lord preserve you and what will be done my poor head has no more power to think for you no more than an infants and im all in a tremble ever since i heard it and afraid to meet any one lest they should see all in my face oh what will become of yees nowthey will be the death of you whatever you do by the time she came to these last words ellinors fears had so much overpowered her that she cried and sobbed continually repeatingwhat will be done now what will be done theyll surely be the death of you whatever you do as to me the urgency of the danger wakened my faculties i rose instantly wrote a note to mr mleod desiring to see him immediately on particular business lest my note should by any accident be intercepted or opened i couched it in the most general and guarded terms and added a request that he would bring his last settlement of accounts with him so that it was natural to suppose my business with him was of a pecuniary nature i gradually quieted poor ellinor by my own appearance of composure i assured her that we should take our measures so as to prevent all mischiefthanked her for the timely warning she had given meadvised her to go home before she was observed and charged her not to speak to any one this day of what had happened i desired that as soon as she should see mr mleod coming through the gate she would send christy after him to the castle to get his bill paid so that i might then without exciting suspicion talk to him in private and we might learn from his own lips the particulars of what he saw and heard in the cavern ellinor returned home promising to obey me exactly especially as to my injunction of secrecyto make sure of herself she said she would go to bed straight and have the rheumatism very bad all day so as not to be in a way to talk to none who would call in the note to mleod was despatched by one of my grooms and i returning to bed was now left at full leisure to finish my mornings nap joe kelly presented himself at the usual hour in my room i turned my head away from him and in a sleepy tone muttered that i had passed a bad night and should breakfast in my own apartment some time afterwards mr mleod arrived with an air of sturdy pride and produced his accounts of which i suffered him to talk till the servant who waited upon us had left the room i then explained the real cause of my sending for him so suddenly i was rather vexed that i could not produce in him by my wonderful narrative any visible signs of agitation or astonishment he calmly observedwe are lucky to have so many hours of daylight before us the first thing we have to do is to keep the old woman from talking i answered for ellinor then the next thing is for me who am a magistrate to take the examinations of her son and see if he will swear to the same that he says christy was summoned into our presence and he came with his bill for smiths work done so that the servants could have no suspicion of what was going forward his examinations were taken and sworn to in a few minutes his evidence was so clear and direct that there was no possibility of doubting the truth the only variation between his story and his mothers report to me was as to the numbers he had seen in the cavernher fears had turned thirteen into three hundred christy assured us that there were but thirteen at this meeting but that they said there were three hundred ready to join them you were a very bold fellow christy said i to hazard yourself in the cave with these villains if you had been found out in your hidingplace they would have certainly murdered you true for me said christy but a man must die some way please your honour and wheres the way i could die better sure i could not but remember how good you was to me that time i was shot and all you suffered for it it would have been bad indeed if i would stay quiet and let em murder you after all no no christy odonoghoe would not do thatany way i hope if theres to be any fighting your honour would not wrong me so much as not to give me a blunderbush and let me fight a bit along wid de rest for yees we are not come to that yet my good fellow said mr mleod who went on methodically if you are precipitate you will spoil all go home to your forge and work as usual and leave the rest to us and i promise that you shall have your share if there is any fighting very reluctantly christy obeyed mr mleod then deliberately settled our plan of operations i had a fishinglodge at a little distance and a pleasureboat there to this place mleod was to go as if on a fishingparty with his nephew a young man who often went there to fish they were to carry with them some yeomen in coloured clothes as their attendants and more were to come as their guests to dinner at the lodge there was a small fourpounder which had been frequently used in times of public rejoicing a naval victory announced in the papers of the day afforded a plausible pretence for bringing it out we were aware that the rebels would be upon the watch and therefore took every precaution to prevent their suspecting that we had made any discovery our fishingparty was to let the mockfuneral pass them quietly to ask some trifling questions and to give money for pipes and tobacco towards evening the boat with the fourpounder on board was to come under shore and at a signal given by me was to station itself opposite to the mouth of the cave at the same signal a trusty man on the watch was to give notice to a party hid in the abbey to secure the trapdoor above the signal was to be my presenting a pistol to the captain of the rebels who intended to meet and seize me on my return from my evenings walk mr mleod at first objected to my hazarding a meeting with this man but i insisted upon it and i was not sorry to give a public proof of my loyalty and my personal courage as to joe kelly i also undertook to secure him mr mleod left me and went to conduct his fishingparty as soon as he was gone i sent for joe kelly to play on the flute to me i guarded my looks and voice as well as i could and he did not see or suspect any thinghe was too full of his own schemes to disguise his own plots he affected great gaiety and to divert me alternately played on the flute and told me good stories all the morning i would not let him leave me the whole day towards evening i began to talk of my journey to england proposed setting out the next morning and sent kelly to look for some things in what was called the strong closeta closet with a stout door and ironbarred windows out of which no mortal could make his escape whilst he was busy searching in a drawer i shut the door upon him locked it and put the key into my pocket as i left the castle i said in a jesting tone to some of the servants who met mei have locked joe kelly up in the strong room if he calls to you to let him out never mind him he will not get out till i come home from my walki owe him this trick the servants thought it was some jest and i passed on with my loaded pistols in my pocket i walked for some time by the seashore without seeing any one at last i espied our fishingboat just peering out and then keeping close to the shore i was afraid that the party would be impatient at not seeing my signal and would come out to the mouth of the cave and show themselves too soon if mr mleod had not been their commander this as i afterwards learned would have infallibly happened but he was so punctual cool and peremptory that he restrained the rest of the party declaring that if it were till midnight he would wait till the signal agreed upon was given at last i saw a man creeping out of the cavei sat down upon my wonted stone and yawned as naturally as i could then began to describe figures in the sand with my stick as i was wont to do still watching the image of the man in the water as he approached he was muffled up in a frieze great coat he sauntered past and went on to a turn in the road as if looking for some one i knew well for whom he was looking as no joe kelly came to meet him he returned in a few minutes towards me i had my hand upon the pistol in my pocket you are my lard glenthorn i presume said he i am then you will come with me if you plase my lard said he make no resistance or i will shoot you instantly cried i presenting my pistol with one hand and seizing him by the collar with the other i dragged him for i had force enough now my energy was roused to the spot appointed for my signal the boat appeared opposite the mouth of the cave every thing answered my expectation there said i pointing to the boat there are my armed friends they have a fourpounderthe match is ready lightedyour plot is discovered go in to your confederates in that cave tell them so the trapdoor is secured above there is no escape for them bid them surrender if they attempt to rush out the grape shot will pour upon them and they are dead men i cannot say that my rebel captain showed himself as stout as i could have wished for the honour of my victory the surprise disconcerted him totally i felt him tremble under my grasp he obeyed my orderswent into the cave to bring his associates to submission his parley with them however was not immediately successful i suppose there were some braver fellows than he amongst them whose counsel might be for open war in the mean time our yeomen landed and surrounded the cave on all sides so that there was no possibility of escape for those within at last they yielded themselves our prisoners i am sorry i have no bloody battle for the entertainment of such of my readers as like horrors but so it was that they yielded without a drop of blood being spilled or a shot fired we let them out of their hidingplace one by one searching each as he issued forth to be secure that they had no concealed weapons after they had given up the arms which were concealed in the cave the next question was what to do with our prisoners as it was now late and they could not all be examined and committed with due legal form to the county gaol mr mleod advised that we should detain them in the place they had chosen for themselves till morning accordingly in the cave we again stowed them and left a guard at each entrance to secure them for the night we returned to the castle i stopped at the gate to tell ellinor and christy that i was safe they were sitting up watching for the news the moment ellinor saw me she clasped her hands in an ecstasy of joy but could not speak christy was voluble in his congratulations but in the midst of his rejoicing he could not help reproaching me with forgetting to give him the blunderbush and to let him have a bit of the fighting upon my honour said i there was none or you should have been there oh dont be plaguing and gathering round him now said ellinor sure he is tired and look how hotno wonderlet him get home and to bed ill run and warm it with the pan myself and not be trusting them she would not be persuaded that i did not desire to have my bed warmed but by some short cut got in before us on entering the castlehall i found her with the warmingpan in her hand held back by the inquisitive servants who were all questioning her about the news of which she was the first and not very intelligible enunciator i called for bread and water for my prisoner in the strongroom and then i heard various exclamations of wonder ay it is all true it is no jest joe is at the bottom of all i never liked joe kellyi always knew joe was not the right thingand i always said so and i and i and i and it was but last week i was saying so and it was but yesterday i said so and so i passed through the gossiping crowd with bread and water for my culprit mcleod instantly saw and followed me i will make bold to come with you said he a pent rats a dangerous animali thanked him and acquiesced but there was no need for the precaution when we opened the door we found the conscience or terrorstruck wretch upon his knees and in the most abject terms he implored for mercy from the windows of the room which looked into the castleyard he had heard enough to guess all that had happened i could not bear to look at him after i had set down his food he clung to my knees crying and whining in a most unmanly manner mcleod with indignation loosened him from me threw him back and locked the door cowardice and treachery said he usually go together and courage and sincerity said i and now well go to supper my good friends i hope you are all as hungry as i am i never did eat any meal with so much appetite tis a pity my lord said mcleod but that there was a conspiracy against you every day of your life it seems to do you so much good chapter xvi what new wonders what new misfortunes ellinor said i as ellinor with a face of consternation appeared again in the morning in my room just as i was going down to breakfast what new misfortunes ellinor oh the worst that could befall me cried she wringing her hands the worst the very worstto be the death of my own child said she with inexpressible horror oh save him save him for the love of heaven dear save him if you dont save him tis i shall be his death she was in such agony that she could not explain herself farther for some minutes it was i gave the information against them all to you but how could i ever have thought owen was one of them my son my own son the unfortunate cratur i never thought but what he was with the militia far away and how could it ever come into my head that owen could have any hand in a thing of the kind but i did not see him last night interrupted i oh he was there one of his own friends one of the military that went with you saw him among the prisoners and came just now to tell me of it that owen should be guilty of the likeoh what could have come over him he must have been out of his rason and against you to be plotting thats what i never will believe if even id hear it from himself but hes among them that were taken last night and will i live to see him go to gaoland will i live to seeno id rather die first a thousand and a thousand times over oh for mercys sake said she dropping on her knees at my feet have pity on me and dont let the blood of my own child be upon me in my old days what would you have me do ellinor said i much moved by her distress there is but one thing to do said she let him off sure a word from you would be enough for the soldiers that are over them on guard and mr mcleod has not yet seen him and if he was just let escape there would be no more about it and id i engage he shall fly the country the unfortunate cratur and never trouble you more this is all i ask and sure dear you cant refuse it to your own ellinor your old nurse that carried ye in her arms and fed ye with her milk and watched over ye manys the long night and loved ye ay none ever loved or could love ye so well i am sensible of it i am grateful interrupted i but what you ask of me ellinor is impossiblei cannot let him escape but i will do my utmost troth nothing will save him if you would not say the word for him now ah why cannot you let him off then i should lose my honour i should lose my character you know that i have been accused of favouring the rebels alreadyyou saw the consequences of my protecting your other son though he was innocent and injured and bore an excellent character christy ay true but poor owen unlucky as he is and misguided has a better claim upon you how can that be is not the other my fosterbrother in the first place true for him and had not i proofs of his generous conduct and attachment to me owen is naturally fonder of you by a great deal interrupted she ill answer for that what when he has just been detected in conspiring against my life thats what ill never believe cried ellinor vehemently that he might be drawn in may be when out of his rasonhe was always a wild boyto be a unitedman and to hope to get you for his captain might be the case and bad enough that but jewel youll find he did never conspire against you id lay down my life upon that she threw herself again at my feet and clung to my knees as you hope for mercy yourself in this world or the world to come show some now and do not be so hardhearted as to be the death of both mother and son her supplicating looks and gestures her words her tears moved me so much that i was on the point of yielding but recollecting what was due to justice and to my own character with an effort of what i thought virtuous resolution i repeated it is impossible my good ellinor urge me no farther ask any thing else and it shall be granted but this is impossible as i spoke i endeavoured to raise her from the ground but with the sudden force of angry despair she resisted no you shall not raise me cried she here let me lie and break my heart with your cruelty tis a judgment upon meits a judgment and its fit i should feel it as i do but you shall feel too in spite of your hard heart yes your heart is harder than the marble you want the natural touch you do for your mother has knelt at your feet and you have denied her prayer my mother and what was her prayerto save the life of your brother my brother good heavens what do i hear you hear the truth you hear that i am your lawful mother yes you are my son you have forced that secret from me which i thought to have carried with me to my grave and now you know all and now you know how wicked i have been and it was all for you for you that refused me the only thing ever i asked and that too in my greatest distress when my heart was just breaking and all this time too theres christypoor good christy he that ive wronged and robbed of his rightful inheritance has been as a son a dutiful good son to me and never did he deny me any thing i could ask but in you i have found no touch of tenderness then its fit i should tell you again and again and again that he who is now slaving at the forge to give me the earnings of his labour he that lives and has lived all his days upon potatoes and salt and is content he who has the face and the hands so disguised with the smoke and the black that yourself asked him tother day did he ever wash his face since he was borni tell ye he it is who should live in this castle and sleep on that soft bed and be lord of all herehe is the true and real lord glenthorn and to the wide world ill make it known ay be pale and tremble do its your turn now ive touched you now but its too late in the face of day i shall confess the wrong ive done and i shall call upon you to give back to him all that by right is his own ellinor stopped short for one of my servants at this instant came into the room my lord mr mcleod desires me to let you know the guard has brought up the prisoners and he is going to commit them to gaol and would be glad to know if you choose to see them first my lord stupified by all i had just heard i could only reply that i would come presently ellinor rushed past the servantare they come cried she where will i get a sight of them i stayed for a few minutes alone to decide upon what i ought to say and do a multitude of ideas more than had ever come in my mind in a twelvemonth passed through it in these few minutes as i was slowly descending the great staircase ellinor came running as fast as she could run to the foot of the stairs exclaiming its a mistake its all a mistake and i was a fool to believe them that brought me the word sure odys not there at all nor ever was in it ive seen them all face to face and my sons not one of them nor ever was and i was a fool from beginning to endand i beg your pardon entirely whispered she coming close to my ear i was out of my reason at the thought of that boys being to suffer and i his mother the cause of it forgive all i said in my passion my own best jewel you was always good and tender to me and be the same still dear ill never say a word more about it to any one living the secret shall die with me sure when my conscience has borne it so long it may strive and bear it a little longer for your sake and it cant be long i have to live so that will make all easy hark they are asking for you do you go your ways into the great parlour to mr mcleod and think no more of any thing at all but joy my sons not one of them i must go to the forge and tell christy the good news ellinor departed quite satisfied with herself with me and with all the world she took it for granted that she left me in the same state of mind and that i should obey her injunctions and think of nothing but joy of what happened in the great parlour and of the examinations of the prisoners i have but a confused recollection i remember that mr mcleod seemed rather surprised by my indifference to what concerned me so nearly and that he was obliged to do all the business himself the men were i believe all committed to gaol and joe kelly turned kings evidence but as to any further particulars i know no more than if i had been in a dream the discovery which ellinor had just made to me engrossed all my powers of attention chapter xvii le vrai nest pas toujours vraisemblable says an acute observer of human affairs the romance of real life certainly goes beyond all other romances and there are facts which few writers would dare to put into a book as there are skies which few painters would venture to put into a picture when i had leisure to reflect i considered that as yet i had no proof of the truth of ellinors strange story except her own assertions i sent for her again to examine her more particularly i was aware that if i alarmed her i should so confuse her imagination that i should never obtain the truth therefore i composed myself and assumed my usual external appearance of nonchalance i received her lolling upon my sofa as usual and i questioned her merely as if to gratify an idle curiosity troth dear said she ill tell you the whole story how it was to make your mind asy which god knows mine never was from that minute it first came into my head till this very time being you mind the time you got the cut in your headno not you jewel but the little lord that was then christy there below that iswell the cut was a terrible cut as ever you seen got by a fall on the fender from the nurses arms that was drunk three days after he was born i remember to have heard my father talk of some accident of this sort which happened to me when i was an infant ay sure enough it did and that was what first put him in the notion of taking the little lord out of the hands of the dublin nursetenders and them that were about my lady glenthom and did not know how to manage her which was the cause of her death and he said hed have his own way about his son and heir any way and have him nursed by a wholesome woman in a cabin and brought up hardy as he and the old lord and all the family were before him so with that he sends for me and he puts the young lord god bless him into my arms himself and a donny thing he was that same time to look at for he was but just out of the surgeons hands the head just healed and scarred over like and my lord said there should be no more doctors never about him so i took him that is christy and you to a house at the sea for the salt water and showed him every justice and my lord often came to see him whilst he was in the country but then he was off after a time to dublin and i was in a lone place where nobody came and the child was very sick with me and you was all the time as fine and thriving a child as ever you see and i thought to be sure one night that he would die wid me he was very bad very bad indeed and i was sitting up in bed rocking him backwards and forwards this ways i thought with myself what a pity it was the young lord should die and he an only son and heir and the estate to go out of the family the lord knows where and then the grief the father would be in and then i thought how happy he would be if he had such a fine babby as you dear and you was a fine babby to be sure and then i thought how happy it would be for you if you was in the place of the little lord and then it came into my head just like a shot where would be the harm to change you for i thought the real lord would surely die and then what a gain it would be to all if it was never known and if the dead child was carried to the grave since it must go as only poor ellinor odonoghoes and no more about it well if it was a wicked thought it was the devil himself put it in my head to be sure for only for him i should never have had the sense to think of such a thing for i was always innocent like and not worldly given but so it was the devil put it in my head and made me do it and showed me how and all in a minute so i mind your eyes and hair were both of the very same colour dear and as to the rest theres no telling how those young things alter in a few months and my lord would not be down from dublin in a hurry so i settled it all right and as there was no likelihood at all the real lord would live that quieted my conscience for i argued it was better the father should have any sort of child at all than none so when my lord came down i carried him the child to see that is you jewel he praised me greatly for all the care i had taken of his boy and said how finely you was come on and i never see a father in greater joy and it would have been a sin i thought to tell him the truth after he took the change that was put upon him so well and it made him so happy like well i was afeard of my life hed pull off the cap to search for the scar so i would not let your head be touched any way dear saying it was tinder and soft still with the fall and youd cry if the cap was stirred and so i made it out indeed very well for god forgive me i twitched the string under your chin dear and made you cry like mad when they would come to touch you so there was no more about it and i had you home to myself and all in good time the hair grew and fine thick hair it was god bless you and so there was no more about it and i got into no trouble at all for it all fell out just as i had laid it out except that the real little young lord did not die as i thought and it was a wonder but he did for you never saw none so near death and backwards and forwards what turns of sickness he took with me for months upon months and year after year so that none could think no more than me there was any likelihood at all of rearing him to mans estate so that kept me easier in my mind concerning what id done for as i kept saying to myself better the family should have an heir to the estate suppose not the right than none at all and if the father nor nobody never found it out there was he and all the family made happy for life and my child made a lord of and none the wiser or the worse well so i downargued my conscience and any way i took to little christy as he was now to be calledand i loved him all as one as if he was my ownnot that he was ever as welllooking as ody or any of the childer i had but i never made any differ betwixt him and any of my ownhe cant say as i did any how and he has no reason to complain of my being an unnatral mother to him and being my fosterchild i had a right to love him as i did and i never wronged him in any way except in the one article of changing him at nurse which he being an infant and never knowing wa never a bit the worse for nor never will now so alls right dear and make your mind asy jewel theres the whole truth of the story for you but it is a very strange story ellinor after all andand i have only your word for it and may be you are only taking advantage of my regard for you to make me believe you what is it plase your honour said she stepping forward as if she did not hear or understand me i say ellinor that after all i have no proof of the truth of this story except your word and is not that enough and wheres the use of having more but if it will make you asy sure i can give you proofsure need you go farther than the scar on his head if he was shaved tomorrow id engage youd see it fast enough but sure cant you put your hand up to your head this minute and feel there never was no scar there nor if all the hair you have god save the mark was shaved this minute never a bit of a scar would be to be seen but proof is it you wantwhy theres the surgeon that dressed the cut in the childs head before he ever came to me sure hes the man that cant forget it and that will tell all so to make your mind asy see him dear but for your life dont let him see your head to feel it for hed miss the scar and might suspect something by your going to question him where does he live interrupted i not above twelve miles off is he alive ay if he beent dead since candlemas at first i thought of writing to this man but afterwards being afraid of committing myself by writing i went to him he had long before this time left off business and had retired to enjoy his fortune in the decline of life he was a whimsical sort of character he had some remains of his former taste for anatomy and was a collector of curiosities i found him just returned from a lake which he had been dragging for a moosedeers horns to complete the skeleton of a moosedeer which he had mounted in his hall i introduced myself desiring to see his museum and mentioned to him the thighbone of a giant found in ray neighbourhood then by favour of this bone i introduced the able cure that he had made of a cut in my head when i was a child a cut in your head sir yes my lord i recollect perfectly well it was a very ugly cut especially in an infants head but i am glad to find you feel no bad effects from it have you any cicatrice on the placeeleven feet high did you say and is the giants skeleton in your neighbourhood i humoured his fancy and by degrees he gave me all the information i wanted without in the least suspecting my secret motives he described the length breadth and depth of the wound to me showed me just where it was on the head and observed that it must have left an indelible mark but that my fine hair covered it when he seemed disposed to search for it i defended myself with the giants thighbone and warded off his attacks most successfully to satisfy myself upon this point i affected to think that he had not been paid he said he had been amply paid and he showed me his books to prove it i examined the dates and found that they agreed with ellinors precisely on my return home the first thing i did was to make christy a present of a new wig which i was certain would induce him to shave his head for the lower irish agree with the beaux and belles of london and paris in preferring wigs to their own hair ellinor told me that i might safely let his head be shaved because to her certain knowledge he had scars of so many cuts which he had received at fairs upon his skull that there would appear nothing particular in one more or less as soon as the head was shaved and the wig was worn i took an opportunity one day of stopping at the forge to have one of my horses shoes changed and whilst this was doing i took notice of his new wig and how well it fitted him as i expected he took it off to show it me better and to pay his own compliments to it sure enough you are a very fine wig said he apostrophising it as he held it up on the end of his hammer and god bless him that give it me and it fits me as if it was nailed to my head you seem to have had a good many nails in your head already christy said i if one may judge by all these scars oh yes please your honour my lord said he theres no harm in them neither they are scratches got when i was no wiser than i should be at fairs fighting with the boys of shrawdnascoob whilst he fought his battles oer again i had leisure to study his head and i traced precisely all the boundary lines the situation size and figure of the cicatrice which the surgeon and ellinor had described to me were so visible and exact that no doubt could remain in my mind of christys being the real son of the late lord and lady glenthorn this conviction was still more impressed upon my mind a few days afterwards i recollected having seen a file of family pictures in a lumberroom in the castle and i rummaged them out to see if i could discover amongst them any likeness to christy i found one the picture of my grandfatheri should say of his grandfather to which christy bore a striking resemblance when i saw him with his face washed and in his sunday clothes my mind being now perfectly satisfied of the truth of ellinors story i was next to consider how i ought to act to be or not to be lord glenthorn or in other words to be or not to be a villain was now the question i could not dissemble to my conscience this plain state of the case that i had no right to keep possession of that which i knew to be anothers lawful property yet educated as i had been and accustomed to the long enjoyment of those luxuries which become necessaries to the wealthy habituated to attendance as i had been and even amongst the dissipated and idle notorious for extravagance the most unbounded and indolence the most inveterate how was i at once to change my habits to abdicate my rank and power to encounter the evils of poverty i was not compelled to make such sacrifices for though ellinors transient passion had prompted her to threaten me with a public discovery yet i knew that she would as soon cut off her own right hand as execute her threats her affection for me and her pride in my consequence were so strong that i knew i might securely rely upon her secrecy the horrid idea of being the cause of the death of one of her own children had for a moment sufficient power to balance her love for me yet there was but little probability that any similar trial should occur nor had i reason to apprehend that the reproaches of her conscience should induce her to make a voluntary discovery for all her ideas of virtue depended on the principle of fidelity to the objects of her affection and no scrupulous notions of justice disturbed her understanding or alarmed her selfcomplacency conscious that she would willingly sacrifice all she had in the world for any body she loved and scarcely comprehending that any one could be selfish she in a confused way applied the maxim of do as you would be done by and was as generous of the property of others as of her own at the worst if a lawsuit commenced against me i knew that possession was nine points of the law i also knew that ellinors health was declining and that the secret would die with her unlawful possession of the wealth i enjoyed could not however satisfy my own mind and after a severe conflict between my love of ease and my sense of rightbetween my tastes and my principlesi determined to act honestly and honourably and to relinquish what i could no longer maintain without committing injustice and feeling remorse i was perhaps the more ready to do rightly because i felt that i was not compelled to it the moment when i made this virtuous decision was the happiest i had at that time ever felt my mind seemed suddenly relieved from an oppressive weight my whole frame glowed with new life and the consciousness of courageous integrity elevated me so much in my own opinion that titles and rank and fortune appeared as nothing in my estimation i rang my bell eagerly and ordered that christy odonoghoe should be immediately sent for the servant went instantly but it seemed to me an immoderately long time before christy arrived i walked up and down the room impatiently and at last threw myself at full length upon the sofa the servant returned the smith is below in the hall my lord show him uphe was shown up into the antechamber the smith is at the door my lord show him in cannot you what detains him my brogues my lord id be afraid to come in with em on the carpet saying this christy came in stepping fearfully astonished to find himself in a splendid drawingroom were you never in this room before christy said i never my lord plase your honour barring the day i mended the bolt it is a fine room is not it christy troth it is the finest ever i see sure enough how should you like to have such a room of your own christy is it i plase your honour replied he laughing what should i do with the like how should you feel if you were master of this great castle its a poor figure i should make to be sure said he turning his head over his shoulder towards the door and resting upon the lock id rather be at the forge by a great dale are you sure of that christy should not you like to be able to live without working any more and to have horses and servants of your own what would i do with them plase your honour i that have never been used to them sure theyd all laugh at me and id not be the better o that no more than of having nothing to do i that have been always used to the work what should i do all the day without it but sure my lord continued he changing his voice to a more serious tone the horse that i shod yesterday for your honour did not go lame did he the horse is very well shod i believe i have not ridden him since i know nothing of the matter because i was thinking may be it was that made your honour send for me up in the hurryi was afeard id find your honour mad with me and id be very sorry to disoblige you my lord and im glad to see your honour looking so well after all the trouble youve been put to by them rubbles the villains to be consarting against you underground but thanks be to god you have em all in gaol now i thought my mother would have died of the fright she took when the report came that ody was one of them i told her there could not be no truth in it at all but she would not mind me it would be a strange unnatural thing indeed of any belonging to her to be plotting against your honour i knew ody could not be in it and be a brother of mine and thats what i kept saying all the time but she never heeded me for your honour knows when the women are frighted and have taken a thing into their heads you cant asy get it out again very true but to return to what i was saying should not you like to change places with me if you could your honour my lord is a very happy jantleman and a very good jantleman theres no doubt and theres few but would be proud to be like you in any thing at all thank you for that compliment but now in plain english as to yourself would you like to be in my placeto change places with me in your honours placei i would not my lord and thats the truth now said he decidedly i would not no offenceyour honour bid me to speak the truth for ive all i want in the world a good mother and a good wife and good childer and a reasonable good little cabin and my little pratees and the grazing of the cow and work enough always and not called on to slave and i get my health thank god for all and what more could i have if i should be made a lord tomorrow sure my good woman would never make a lady and what should i do with her id be grieved to see her the laughingstock of high and low besides being the same myself and my boy after me that would never answer for me so i am not like them that would overturn all to get uppermost i never had any hand art or part in a thing of the kind i always thought and knew i was best as i am not but what if i was to change with any it is with you my lord i would be proud to change because if i was to be a jantleman at all id wish to be of a raal good ould family born you are then what you wish to be said i och said he laughing and scratching his head your honours jesting me about them kings of ireland that they say the odonoghoes was once but thats what i never think on thats all idle talk for the like of me for sure thats a long time ago and what use going back to it one might as well be going back to adam that was the father of all but which makes no differ now but you do not understand me interrupted i i am not going back to the kings of ireland i mean to tell you that you were born a gentlemannay i am perfectly serious listen to me i do plase your honour though it is mocking me i know you are i would be sorry not to take a joke as well as another this is no joke i repeat that i am serious you are not only a gentleman but a nobleman to you this castle and this great estate belongs and to you they shall be surrendered he stood astonished and his eyes opening wide showed a great circle of white in his black face eh cried he drawing that long breath which astonishment had suppressed but how can this be your mother can explain better than i can your mother did i say she is not your mother lady glenthorn was your mother i cant understand it at alli cant understand it at all ill lave it all to your honour said he making a motion with his hands as if to throw from him the trouble of comprehending it did you never hear of such a thing as a childs being changed at nurse i did plase your honour but my mother would never do the like ill answer for her any way and them that said any thing of the kind belied her and dont be believing them my lord but ellinor was the person who told me this secret was she so oh she must have been draaming she was always too good a mother to me to have sarved me so but added he struggling to clear his intellects you say its not my mother she is but whose mother is she then can it be that she is yours tis not possible to think such a great lord was the son of such as her to look at you both and was you the son of my father johnny odonoghoe how is that again he rubbed his forehead and i could scarcely forbear laughing at his odd perplexity though the subject was of such serious importance when he clearly understood the case and thoroughly believed the truth he did not seem elated by this sudden change of fortune he really thought more of me than of himself well ill tell you what you will do then continued he after a pause of deep reflection say nothing to nobody but just keep asy on even as we are dont let there be any surrendering at all and ill speak to my mother that is ellinor odonoghoe and settle it so and let it be so settled in the name of god and no more about it and none need never be the wiser tis so best for all a good day to your honour and ill go shoe the mare stay said i you may hereafter repent of this sudden determination i insist upon your taking fourandtwenty hoursno that would be too littletake a month to consider of it coolly and then let me know your final determination oh plase your honour i will say the same then as now it would be a poor thing indeed of me after all you done for me and mine to be putting you to more trouble it would be a poor thing of me to forget how you liked to have lost your life all along with me at the time of the ruction no ill not take the fortin from you any how put gratitude to me out of the question said i far be it from me to take advantage of your affectionate temper i do not consider you as under any obligations to me nor will i be paid for doing justice sure enough your honour desarved to be born a gentleman said christy at least i have been bred a gentleman said i let me see you again this day month and not till then you shall notthat is you shall plase your honour but for fear any one would suspect any thing id best go shoe the mare any way chapter xviii what riches give us let us then inquire meat fire and clotheswhat moremeat clothes and fire the philosophy we learn from books makes but a faint impression upon the mind in comparison with that which we are taught by our own experience and we sometimes feel surprised to find that what we have been taught as maxims of morality prove true in real life after having had for many years the fullest opportunities of judging of the value of riches when i reflected upon my past life i perceived that their power of conferring happiness is limited nearly as the philosophic poet describes that all the changes and modifications of luxury must in the sum of actual physical enjoyment be reduced to a few elementary pleasures of which the industrious poor can obtain their share a small share perhaps but then it is enjoyed with a zest that makes it equal in value perhaps to the largest portion offered to the sated palate of ennui these truths are as old as the world but they appeared quite new to me when i discovered them by my own experience during the month which i had allowed to my fosterbrother for reflection i had leisure to philosophize and my understanding made a rapid progress i foresaw the probability of christys deciding to become earl of glenthorn notwithstanding that his good sense had so clearly demonstrated to him in theory that with his education and habits he must be happier working in his forge than he could be as lord of glenthorn castle i was not dismayed by the idea of losing my wealth and rank i was pleased with myself for my honest conduct and conscious of a degree of pleasure from my own approbation superior to what my riches had ever procured the day appointed for christys final determination arrived i knew by the first motion of his shoulder as he came into the room what his decision would be well christy said i you will be earl of glenthorn i perceive you are glad now that i did not take you at your word and that i gave you a months time for consideration your honour was always considerate but if id wish now to be changing my mind said he hesitating and shifting from leg to leg it is not upon my own account any way but upon my son johnnys my good friend said i no apology is necessary i should be very unjust if i were offended by your decision and very mean if after the declarations i have made i could for an instant hesitate to restore to you that property which it is your right and your choice to reclaim christy made a low bow and seemed much at a loss what he was to say next i hope continued i that you will be as happy when you are earl of glenthorn as you have been as christy odonoghoe may be not plase your honour but i trust my childer will be happy after me and its them and my wife im thinking of as in duty bound but it is hard your honour should be astray for want of the fortin youve been bred to and this weighs with me greatly on the other side if your honour could live on here and share with usbut i see your honours displeased at my naming that it was my wife thought o that i knew it could not do but then what i think is that your honour should name what you would be pleased to keep to live upon for to be sure you have a right to live as a gentleman that have always lived as one as every body knows and none better than i would your honour be so kind then as just to put down on a bit of paper what youd wish to keep and that same whatever it is none shall touch but yourself and i would not own a child for mine that would begrudge it you ill step down and wait below while your honour writes what you plase the generosity of this man touched me to the heart i accepted from him three hundred a year and requested that the annuity i allowed to the unfortunate lady glenthorn might be continued that the house which i had built for ellinor and the land belonging to it might be secured to her rentfree for life and that all my debts should be paid i recommended mr mleod in the strongest manner as an agent whose abilities and integrity would be to him an invaluable treasure christy when i gave him the paper on which i had stated these requests took a pen instantly and would have signed his name without reading it but to this i absolutely objected well then said he ill take it home and read it over and take time as you desire to consider theres no danger of my changing my mind about this i hope your honour cant think there is the next day on returning it to me he observed that it was making very little of him to put down only such a trifle and he pressed me to make the hundreds thousandsthis i refused but i hope your honour wont object to what i am going to propose is not there a house in london and is not there another in england in the country and sure i and mine cant live there and here and every where at once if youd just condescend to occupy one of them youd do me a great pleasure and a great sarvice too for every thing would be right instead of going wrong as it might under an agent and me at a distance that does not know well how to manage such great estates i hope youll not refuse me that if its only to show me i dont lose your honours goodwill the offer was made with so much earnestness and even delicacy that i could not abruptly refuse it at the moment though one of these magnificent houses could be of no use tome with an income of l per annum as to the annuity continued christy that shall be paid as punctual as the day mr mleod will pay it and he shall have it all settled right and put upon a stamp by the lawyers in case any thing should happen me then as to ellinor sure she is my mother for i never can think of her any other way and except in that single article of changing me at nurse was always the best of mothers to me and even that same trick she played me though very wicked to be sure was very natralay very natralto prefar her own flesh and blood if she could and no one could be more sorry for the wrong she did me than she is now there she is crying at home ready to break her heart but as i tell her theres no use in repenting a thing when once it is done and as i forgive her none can ever bring it up against her and as to the house and farm she shall surely have that and shall never want for any thing so i hope your honours mind will be asy on that matter and whatever else you recollect to wish that shall be done if in my power it is with pleasure that i recollect and record all these instances of goodness of heart in poor christy which notwithstanding the odd mixture of absurdity and sense in his language and ideas will i make no doubt please my readers though they cannot affect them as much as they affected me i now prepared for my departure from glenthorn castle never more to return to spare me from unnecessary mortification christy had the wonderful selfcommand to keep the secret faithfully so that none of the people in the neighbourhood nor even my servants had the slightest idea of the truth having long talked of returning to england the preparations for my journey excited no surprise every thing went on as usual except that christy instead of being at the forge was almost every day at the whiskeyshop i thought it proper to speak openly of my affairs to mr mleod he was the only person who could make out a correct list of my debts besides i wished to recommend him as agent to the future earl to whom an honest and able agent would be peculiarly necessary ignorant as he was both of the world and of business and surrounded as he must probably be on his accession to his estate by a herd of vulgar and designing flatterers albeit not easily moved to surprise mr mleod really did for an instant look astonished when i informed him that christy odonoghoe was earl of glenthorn but i must resolve not to stop to describe the astonishment that each individual showed upon this occasion else i shall never have finished my story it was settled that mr mleod should continue agent and for his credit i must observe that after he was made acquainted with my loss of rank and fortune he treated me with infinitely more respect and regard than he had ever shown me whilst he considered me only as his employer our accounts were soon settled and when this was done and they were all regularly signed mr mleod came up to me and in a low voice of great emotion said i am not a man of professions but when i say i am a mans friend i hope i shall ever be found to be so as far as can be in my power and i cannot but esteem and admire the man who has acted so nobly as you have done mleod wrung my hand as he spoke and the tears stood in his eyes i knew that the feeling must indeed be strong which could extort from him even these few words of praise and this simple profession of regard but i did not know till long afterwards the full warmth of his affections and energy of his friendship the very next day unfortunately for me he was obliged to go to scotland to his mother who was dying and at this time i saw no more of him in due legal form i now made a surrender of all claim upon the hereditary property of the earl of glenthorn and every thing was in readiness for my journey during this time poor ellinor never appeared at the castle i went to see her to comfort her about my going away but she was silent and seemingly sullen and would not be comforted ive enough to grieve me said she i know what will be the end of all i see it as plain as if youd told me theres no hiding nothing from a mother no theres no use in striving to comfort me every method which i tried to console her seemed to grieve her more the day before that which was fixed for my departure i sent to desire to see her this request i had repeatedly made but she had from day to day excused herself saying that she was unwell and that she would be up on the morrow at last she came and though but a few days had elapsed since i had seen her she was so changed in her appearance that i was shocked the moment i beheld her countenance you dont look well ellinor said i sit down no matter whether i sit or stand said she calmly im not long for this world i wont live long after you are gone thats one comfort her eyes were fixed and tearless and there was a dead unnatural tranquillity in her manner they are making a wonderful great noise nailing up the boxes and i seen them cording the trunks as i came through the hall i asked them could i be of any use but they said i could be of none and thats true for when i put my hand to the cord to pull it i had no more strength than an infant it was sevenandtwenty years last midsummerday since i first had you an infant in my arms i was strong enough then and youwas a sweet babby had i seen that time all that would come to pass this day but thats over now i have done a wicked thing but ill send for father murphy and get absolution before i die she sighed deeply then went on speaking more quickly but i can do nothing until you go what time will you go in the morning dear its better go early is it in the coach youll go i see it in the yard but i thought you must leave the coach with all the rest to the rightful heir but my heads not clear about it all i believeand no matter her ideas rambled from one subject to another in an unconnected manner i endeavoured in vain to recall her understanding by speaking of her own immediate interests of the house that was secured to her for life and of the promise that had been made me that she should never want for any thing and that she should be treated with all possible kindness she seemed to listen to me but showed that she did not comprehend what i said by her answers and at every pause i made she repeated the same question what time will you go in the morning dear at last i touched her feelings and she recovered her intellect when i suddenly asked if she would accompany me to england the next morning ay that i will cried she go with you through the wide world she burst into tears and wept bitterly for some time ah now i feel right again said she this is what i wanted but could not cry this many a daynever since the word came to me that you was going and all was lost i assured her that i now expected to be happier than i had ever been oh cried she and have you never been happy all this time what a folly it was for me then to do so wicked a thing and all my comfort was the thinking you was happy dear and what will become of you now and is it on foot youll go her thoughts rambled again whatever way i go you shall go with me said i you are my mother and now that your son has done what he knows to be honest and just he will prosper in the world and will be truly happy and so may you be happy now that you have nothing more to conceal she shook her head its too late said she quite too late i often told christy i would die before you left this place dear and so i will you will see god bless you god bless you and pray to him to forgive me none that could know what ive gone through would ever do the like no not for their own child was he even such as you and that would be hard to find god bless you dear i shall never see you more the hand of death is upon megod for ever bless you dear she died that night and i lost in her the only human being who had ever shown me warm disinterested affection her death delayed for a few days my departure from glenthorn castle i stayed to see her laid in the grave her funeral was followed by crowds of people by many from the general habit of attending funerals by many who wished to pay their court to me in showing respect to the memory of my nurse when the prayers over the dead were ended and the grave closed just as the crowd were about to disperse i stood up on a monument belonging to the glenthorn family and the moment it was observed that i wished to address the multitude the moving waves were stilled and there was a dead silence every eye was fixed upon me with eager expectation it was the first time in my life that i had ever spoken before numbers but as i was certain that i had something to say and quite indifferent about the manner words came without difficulty amazement appeared in every face when i declared myself to be the son of the poor woman whom we had just interred and when i pointed to the real earl of glenthorn and when i declared that i relinquished to him his hereditary title and lawful property my auditors looked alternately at me and at my fosterbrother seeming to think it impossible that a man with face and hands so black as christys usually were known to be could become an earl when i concluded my narrative and paused the silence still continued all seemed held in mute astonishment and now my good friends continued i let me bid you farewell probably you will never see or hear of me more but whether he be rich or poor or high or lowborn every honest man must wish to leave behind him a fair character therefore when i am gone and as it were dead to you speak of me not as of an impostor who long assumed a name and enjoyed a fortune that was not his own but remember that i was bred to believe myself heir to a great estate and that after having lived till the age of sevenandtwenty in every kind of luxury i voluntarily gave up the fortune i enjoyed the moment i discovered that it was not justly mine that you did indeed interrupted christy and of that i am ready to bear witness for you in this world and in the next god bless and prosper you wherever you go and sure enough he will for he cannot do other than prosper one that deserves it so well i never should have known a sentence of the secret continued he addressing his neighbours if it had not been for his generosity to tell it me and even had i found it out by any maracle where would have been the gain of that to me for you know he could had he been so inclined have kept me out of all by the laway baffled me on till my heart was sick and till my little substance was wasted and my bones rotten in the ground but gods blessing be upon him hes an honest man and done that which many a lord in his place would not have done but a good conscience is a kingdom in itself and that he cannot but have wherever he goesand all which grieves me is that he is going away from us if hed be prevailed with by me hed stay where he is and wed share and share alike but hes too proud for thatand no wonderhe has a right to be proud for no matter who was his mother hell live and die a gentleman every inch of him any man you see may be made a lord but a gentleman a man must make himself and yourselves can witness has not he reigned over us like a gentleman and a raal gentleman and shown mercy to the poor and done justice to all as well as to me and did not he take me by the hand when i was persecuted and none else in the wide world to befrind me and did not he stand up for me against the tyrants that had the sway then ay and did not he put himself to trouble day and night go riding here and there and spaking and writing for me well as they say he loves his ease and thats the worse can be said of him he took all this pains for a poor man and had like to have lost his life by it and now wherever he is and whatever can i help loving and praying for him or could you and since you will go added he turning to me with tears in his eyes take with you the blessings of the poor which they say carry a man straight to heaven if any thing can the surrounding crowd joined with one voice in applauding this speech it is he that has said what we all think cried they following me with acclamations to the castle when they saw the chaise at the door which was to carry me away their acclamations suddenly ceasedbut is he goingbut cant he stayand is he going this minute troth its a pity and a great pity again and again these honest people insisted upon taking leave of me and i could not force myself away without difficulty they walked on beside my carriage christy at their head and in this species of triumph melancholy indeed but grateful to my heart i quitted glenthorn castle passed through that park which was no longer mine and at the verge of the county shook hands for the last time with these affectionate and generous people i then bid my postilion drive on fast and i never looked back never once cast a lingering look at all i left behind i felt proud of having executed my purpose and conscious i had not the insignificant inefficient character that had formerly disgraced me as to the future i had not distinctly arranged my plans nor was my mind during the remainder of the day sufficiently tranquil for reflection i felt like one in a dream and could scarcely persuade myself of the reality of the events that had succeeded each other with such astonishing rapidity at night i stopped at an inn where i was not known and having no attendants or equipage to command respect from hostlers waiters and innkeepers i was made immediately sensible of the reality at least of the change in my fortune but i was not mortifiedi felt only as if i were travelling incognito and i contrived to go to bed without a valetdechambre and slept soundly for i had earned a sound sleep by exertion both of body and mind chapter xix in the morning i awoke with a confused notion that something extraordinary had happened but it was a good while before i recollected myself sufficiently to be perfectly sensible of the absolute and irrevocable change in my circumstances an inn may not appear the best possible place for meditation especially if the moralizers bedchamber be next the yard where carriages roll and hostlers swear perpetually yet so situated i this morning as i lay awake in my bed thought so abstractedly and attentively that i heard neither wheels nor hostlers i reviewed the whole of my past life i regretted bitterly my extravagance my dissipation my waste of time i considered how small a share of enjoyment my wealth had procured either for myself or others how little advantage i had derived from my education and from all my opportunities of acquiring knowledge it had been in my power to associate with persons of the highest talents and of the best information in the british dominions yet i had devoted my youth to loungers and gamesters and epicures and knew that scarcely a trace of my existence remained in the minds of those selfish beings who once called themselves my friends i wished that i could live my life over again and i felt that were it in my power i should live in a manner very different from that in which i had fooled away existence in the midst of my selfreproaches however i had some consolation in the idea that i had never been guilty of any base or dishonourable action i recollected with satisfaction my behaviour to lady glenthorn when i discovered her misconduct i recollected that i had always shown gratitude to poor ellinor for her kindness i recollected with pleasure that when trusted with power i had not used it tyrannically my exertions in favour of my fosterbrother when he was oppressed i remembered with much satisfaction and the steadiness with which i behaved when a conspiracy was formed against my life gave me confidence in my own courage and after having sacrificed my vast possessions to a sense of justice no mortal could doubt my integrity so that upon the whole notwithstanding my past follies i had a tolerably good opinion of myself or rather good hopes for the future i was certain that there was more in me than the world had seen and i was ambitious of proving that i had some personal merit independently of the adventitious circumstances of rank and fortune but how was i to distinguish myself just as i came to this difficult question the chambermaid interrupted my reverie by warning me in a shrill voice that it was very late and that she had called me above two hours before wheres my man send up my man oh i beg your pardonnothing at all only my good girl i should be obliged to you if you could let me have a little warm water that i may shave myself it was new and rather strange to me to be without attendants but i found that when i was forced to it i could do things admirably well for myself that i had never suspected i could perform without assistance after i had travelled two days without servants how i had travelled with them was the wonder i once caught myself saying of myself that careless blockhead has forgotten my nightcap for some time i was liable to make odd blunders about my own identity i was apt to mistake between my old and my new habits so that when i spoke in the tone and imperative mood in which lord glenthorn had been accustomed to speak people stared at me as if i were mad and i in my turn was frequently astonished by their astonishment and perplexed by their ease of behaviour in my presence upon my arrival in dublin i went to a small lodging which mr mleod had recommended to me it was such as suited my reduced finances but at first view it was not much to my taste however i ate with a good appetite my very frugal supper upon a little table covered with a little tablecloth on which i could not wipe my mouth without stooping low the mistress of the house a northcountry woman was so condescending as to blow my fire remarking at the same time that coals were a very scarce article she begged to know whether i would choose a fire in my bedroom and what quantity of coals she should lay in she added many questions about boarding and smallbeer and tea and sugar and butter and blankets and sheets and washerwomen which almost overwhelmed my spirits and must i think of all these things for myself said i in a lamentable tone and i suppose with a most deplorable length of face for the woman could not refrain from laughing as she left the room i heard her exclaim lord help him he looks as much astray as if he was just new from the isle of skye the cares of life were coming fast upon me and i was terrified by the idea of a host of petty evils i sat ruminating with my feet upon the bars of the grate till past midnight when my landlady who seemed to think it incumbent upon her to supply me with common sense came to inform me that there was a good fire burning to waste in the bedroom and that i should find myself a great deal better there than sitting over the cinders i suffered myself to be removed to the bedchamber and again established my feet upon the upper bar of the grate lack sir youll burn your boots said my careful landlady who after bidding me good night put her head back into the room to beg i would be sure to rake the fire and throw up the ashes safe before i went to bed left to my own meditations i confess i did feel rather forlorn i reflected upon my helplessness in all the common business of life and the more i considered that i was totally unfit for any employment or profession by which i could either earn money or distinguish myself the deeper became my despondency i passed a sleepless night vainly regretting the time that never could be recalled in the morning my landlady gave me some letters which had been forwarded for me from glenthorn castle the direction to the earl of glenthorn scratched out and in its place inserted my new address c odonoghoe esq no dukestreet dublin i remember i held the letters in my hand contemplating the direction for some minutes and at length reading it aloud repeatedly to my landladys infinite amusementshe knew nothing of my history and seemed in doubt whether to think me extremely silly or mad one of my letters was from lord y an irish nobleman with whom i was not personally acquainted but for whose amiable character and literary reputation i had always even during my days of dissipation peculiar respect he wrote to me to make inquiries respecting the character of a mr lyddell who had just proposed himself as tutor to the son of one of his friends mr lyddell had formerly been my favourite tutor the man who had encouraged me in every species of ignorance and idleness in my present state of mind i was not disposed to speak favourably of this gentleman and i resolved that i would not be instrumental in placing another young nobleman under his guidance i wrote an explicit indignant and i will say eloquent letter upon this occasion but when i came to the signature i felt a repugnance to signing myself c odonoghoe and i recollected that as my history could not yet be public lord y would be puzzled by this strange name and would be unable to comprehend this answer to his letter i therefore determined to wait upon his lordship and to make my explanations in person besides my other reasons for determining on this visit i had a strong desire to become personally acquainted with a nobleman of whom i had heard so much his lordships porter was not quite so insolent as some of his brethren and though i did not come in a showy equipage and though i had no laced footmen to enforce my rights i gained admission i passed through a gallery of fine statues to a magnificent library which i admired till the master of the house appeared and from that moment he commanded or rather captivated my attention lord y was at this time an elderly gentleman in his address there was a becoming mixture of ease and dignity he was not what the french call maniere his politeness was not of any particular school but founded on those general principles of good taste good sense and goodnature which must succeed in all times places and seasons his desire to please evidently arose not from vanity but benevolence in his conversation there was neither the pedantry of a recluse nor the coxcombry of a man of the world his knowledge was select his wit without effort the play of a cultivated imagination the happiness of his expressions did not seem the result of care and his allusions were at once so apposite and elegant as to charm both the learned and the unlearned all he said was sufficiently clear and just to strike every person of plain sense and natural feeling while to the man of literature it had often a further power to please by its less obvious meaning lord ys superiority never depressed those with whom he conversed on the contrary they felt themselves raised by the magic of politeness to his level instead of being compelled to pay tribute they seemed invited to share his intellectual dominion and to enjoy with him the delightful preeminence of genius and virtue i shall be forgiven for pausing in my own insignificant story to dwell on the noble character of a departed friend that he permitted me to call him my friend i think the greatest honour of my life but let me if i can go on regularly with my narrative lord y took it for granted during our first halfhours conversation that he was speaking to the earl of glenthorn he thanked me with much warmth for putting him on his guard against the character of mr lyddell and his lordship was also pleased to thank me for making him acquainted as he said with my own character for convincing him how ill it had been appreciated by those who imagined that wealth and title were the only distinctions which the earl of glenthorn might claim this compliment went nearer to my heart than lord y could guess my character said i since your lordship encourages me to speak of myself with freedom my character has i hope been much changed and improved by circumstances and perhaps those which might at present be deemed the most unfortunate may ultimately prove of the greatest advantage by urging me to exertionyour lordship is not aware of what i allude to a late event in my singular history continued i taking up the newspapers which lay on his library tablemy singular history has not yet i fancy got into the public newspapers perhaps you will hear it most favourably from myself lord y was politely benevolently attentive whilst i related to him the sudden and singular change in my fortune when i gave an account of the manner in which i had conducted myself after the discovery of my birth tears of generous feeling filled his eyes he laid his hand upon mine when i paused whatever you have lost said he you have gained a friend do not be surprised continued he by this sudden declaration before i saw you this morning your real character was better known to me than you imagine i learnt it from a particular friend of mine of whose judgment and abilities i have the highest opinion mr cecil devereux i saw him just after his marriage and the very evening before they sailed i remember when lady geraldine and he were talking of the regret they felt in leaving ireland among the friends whom they lamented that they should not see again perhaps for years you were mentioned with peculiar esteem and affection they called you their generous benefactor and fully explained to me the claim you had to this titlea title which never can be lost but mr devereux was anxious to convince me that he was not influenced by the partiality of gratitude in his opinion of his benefactors talents he repeated an assertion that was supported with much energy by the charming lady geraldine that lord glenthorn had abilities to be any thing tie pleased and the high terms in which they spoke of his talents and the strong proofs they adduced of the generosity of his character excited in my mind a warm desire to cultivate his acquaintance a desire which has been considerably increased within this last hour may i hope that the irish rapidity with which i have passed from acquaintance to friendship may not shock english habits of reserve and may not induce you to doubt the sincerity of the man who has ventured with so little hesitation or ceremony to declare himself your friend i was so much moved by this unexpected kindness that though i felt how much more was requisite i could answer only with a bow and i was glad to make my retreat as soon as possible the very next day his lordship returned my visit to my landladys irrecoverable astonishment and i had increasing reason to regard him with admiration and affection he convinced me that i had interested him in my concerns and told me i must forgive him if he spoke to me with the freedom of a friend thus i was encouraged to consult him respecting my future plans plans indeed i had none regularly formed but lord y by his judicious suggestions settled and directed my ideas without overpowering me by the formality of advice my ambition was excited to deserve his friendship and to accomplish his predictions the profession of the law was that to which he advised me to turn my thoughts he predicted that if for five years i would persevere in application to the necessary preparatory studies i should afterwards distinguish myself at the bar more than i had ever been distinguished by the title of earl of glenthorn five years of hard labour the idea alarmed but did not utterly appal my imagination and to prevent my dwelling upon it too long at the first lord y suddenly changed the conversation and in a playful tone said before you immerse yourself in your studies i must however claim some of your time you must permit me to carry you home with me today to introduce you to two ladies of my acquaintance the one prudent and oldif a lady can ever be old the other young and beautiful and graceful and witty and wise and reasonable one of these ladies is much prepossessed in your favour the other strongly prejudiced against youfor the best of all possible reasons because she does not know you i accepted lord ys invitation not a little curious to know whether it was the old and prudent or the young beautiful graceful witty wise and reasonable lady who was much prepossessed in my favour notwithstanding my usual indifference to the whole race of very agreeable young ladies i remember trying to form a picture in my imagination of this allaccomplished female chapter xx upon my arrival at y house i found two ladies in the drawingroom in earnest conversation with lady y in their external appearance they were nearly what my friend had described except that the beauty of the youngest infinitely surpassed my expectations the elegance of her form and the charming expression of her countenance struck me with a sort of delightful surprise that was quickly succeeded by a most painful sensation lady y give me leave to introduce to you mr odonoghoe shocked by the sound of my own name i was ready to recoil abashed the elderly lady turned her eyes upon me for an instant with that indifference with which we look at an uninteresting stranger the young lady seemed to pity my confusion for though so well and so long used to varieties of the highest company when placed in a situation that was new to me i was unaccountably disconcerted ah thought i how differently should i be received were i still earl of glenthorn i was rather angry with lord y for not introducing me as he had promised to this fair lady and yet the repetition of my name would have increased my vexation in short i was unjust and felt an impatience and irritability quite unusual to my temper lady yaddressed some conversation to me in an obliging manner and i did my best to support my part till she left me but my attention was soon distracted by a conversation that commenced at another part of the room between her and the elderly lady my dear lady y have you heard the extraordinary news the most incredible thing that ever was heard for my part i cannot believe it yet though we have the intelligence from the best authority lord glenthorn that is to say the person we always called lord glenthorn turns out to be the son of the lord knows whothey dont mention the name at this speech i was ready to sink into the earth lord y took my arm and led me into another room i have some cameos said he which are thought curious would you like to look at them can you conceive it continued the elderly lady whose voice i still heard as the foldingdoors of the room were open changed at nurse one hears of such things in novels but in real life i absolutely cannot believe it yet here in this letter from lady ormsby are all the particulars and a blacksmith is found to be earl of glenthorn and takes possession of glenthorn castle and all the estates and the man is married to some vulgarian of course and he has a son and may have half a hundred you know so there is an end of our hopes and there is an end too of all my fine schemes for cecilia i felt myself change colour again i believe said i to lord y i ought not to hear this if your lordship will give me leave i will shut the door no no said he smiling and stopping me you ought to hear it for it will do you a great deal of good you know i have undertaken to be your guide philosopher and friend so you must let me have my own way and if it should so happen hear yourself abused patientlyis not this a fine bust of socrates some part of the conversation in the next room i missed whilst his lordship spoke the next words i heard were but my dear lady y look at ceciliawould not any other girl be cast down and miserable in cecilias place yet see see how provokingly happy and well she looks yes replied lady y i never saw her appear better but we are not to judge of her by what any other young lady would be in her place for i know of none at all comparable to miss delamere miss delamere said i to lord y is this the miss delamere who is heiress at law to the glenthorn estate yesdo not let the head of socrates fall from your hands said his lordship smiling i again lost something that was said in the next room but i heard the old lady going on with i only say my dear that if the man had been really what he was said to be you could not have done better dearest mother you cannot be serious replied the sweetest voice i ever heard i am sure that you never were in earnest upon this subject you could not wish me to be united to such a man as lord glenthorn was said to be why what was he said to be my deara little dissipated a little extravagant only and if he had a fortune to support it child what matter pursued the mother all young men are extravagant nowadaysyou must take the world as it goes the lady who married lord glenthorn i suppose acted upon that principle and you see what was the consequence oh my dear as to her ladyship it ran in the blood let her have married whom she would she would have done the same and i am told lord glenthorn made an incomparably good husband a cousin of lady glenthorns assured me that she was present one day when her ladyship expressed a wish for a gold chain to wear round her neck or braid her hair i forget for what but that very hour lord glenthorn bespoke for her a hundred yards of gold chain at ten guineas a yard another time she longed for an indian shawl and his lordship presented her next day with three dozen real india shawls theres a husband for you cecilia not for me mamma said cecilia laughing ah you are a strange romantic girl and never will be married after all i fear never to a fool i hope said cecilia miss delamere will however allow said lady y that a man may have his follies without being a fool or wholly unworthy of her esteem otherwise what a large portion of mankind she would deprive of hope as to lord glenthorn he was no fool i promise you continued the mother has not he been living prudently enough these three years we have not heard of late of any of his extraordinary landaus but i have been told said cecilia that he is quite uninformed without any taste for literature and absolutely incapable of exertiona victim to ennui how miserable a woman must be with such a husband but said lady y what could be expected from a young nobleman bred up as lord glenthorn was nothing said cecilia and that is the very reason i never wished to see him perhaps miss delameres opinion might be changed if she had known him said lady y ay for he is a very handsome man i have heard said the mother lady jocunda lawler told me so in one of her letters and lady jocunda was very near being married to him herself i can tell you for he admired her prodigiously a certain proof that he never would have admired me said cecilia for two women so opposite in every respect no man could have loved lord bless you child how little you know of the matter after all i dare say if you had been acquainted with him you might have been in love yourself with lord glenthorn possibly said cecilia if i had found him the reverse of what he is reported to be company came in at this instant lord y was called to receive them and i followed glad at this instant that i was not lord glenthorn at dinner the conversation turned upon general subjects and lord y with polite and friendly attention drew me out without seeming to do so in the kindest manner possible i had the pleasure to perceive that cecilia delamere did not find me a fool i never even in the presence of lady geraldine exerted myself so much to avoid this disgrace after all the company except mrs and miss delamere were gone lord y called me aside will you pardon said he the means i have taken to convince you how much superior you are to the opinion that has been commonly formed of lord glenthorn will you forgive me for convincing you that when a man has sufficient strength of mind to rely upon himself and sufficient energy to exert his abilities he becomes independent of common report and vulgar opinion he secures the suffrages of the best judges and they in time lead all the rest of the world will you permit me now to introduce you to your prudent friend and your fair enemy mrs delameremiss delameregive me leave to introduce to you the late earl of glenthorn of the astonishment in the opening eyes of mrs delamere i have some faint recollection i can never forget the crimson blush that instantaneously spread over the celestial countenance of cecilia she was perfectly silent but her mother went on talking with increased rapidity good heavens the late lord glenthorn why i was talkingbut he was not in the room the ladies exchanged looks which seemed to say i hope he did not hear all we said of him my dear lord y why did not you tell us this before suppose we had spoken of his lordship you would have been answerable for all the consequences certainly said lord y but seriously said the old lady have i the pleasure to speak to lord glenthorn or have i not i believe i began unluckily to talk of a strange story i had heard but perhaps all this is a mistake and my country correspondent may have been amusing herself at the expense of my credulity i assure you i was not imposed upon i never believed half the story you may believe the whole of it madam said i the story is perfectly true oh my good sir how sorry i am to hear you say it is all true and the blacksmith is really earl of glenthorn and has taken possession of the castle and is married and has a son lord bless me how unfortunate well i can only say sir i wish with all my heart you were earl of glenthorn still after hearing from lord y the circumstances of what he was pleased to call my generous conduct mrs delamere observed that i had acted very generously to be sure but that few in my place would have thought themselves bound to give up possession of an estate which i had so long been taught to believe was my own to have and to hold she observed always went together in law and she could not help thinking i had done very injudiciously and imprudently not to let the law decide for me i was consoled for mrs delameres reprehensions by her daughters approving countenance after this visit lord y gave me a general invitation to his house where i frequently saw miss delamere and frequently compared her with my recollection of lady geraldine cecilia delamere was not so entertaining but she was more interesting than lady geraldine the flashes of her ladyships wit though always striking were sometimes dangerous cecilias wit though equally brilliant shone with a more pleasing and inoffensive light with as much generosity as lady geraldine could show in great affairs she had more forbearance and delicacy of attention on everyday occasions lady geraldine had much pride and it often gave offence cecilia perhaps had more pride but it never appeared except upon the defensive without having less candour she had less occasion for it than lady geraldine seemed to have and cecilias temper had more softness and equability perhaps cecilia was not so fascinating but she was more attractive one had the envied art of appearing to advantage in publicthe other the more desirable power of being happy in private i admired lady geraldine long before i loved her i loved cecilia long before i admired her whilst i possibly could i called what i felt for miss delamere only esteem but when i found it impossible to conceal from myself that i loved i resolved to avoid this charming woman how happy thought i would the fortune i once possessed now make me but in my present circumstances what have i to hope surely my friend lord y has not shown his usual prudence in exposing me to such a temptation but it is to be supposed he thinks that the impossibility of my obtaining miss delamere will prevent my thinking of her or perhaps he depends on the inertness and apathy of my temper unfortunately for me my sensibility has increased since i have become poor for many years when i was rich and could have married easily i never wished to marry and now that i have not enough to support a wife i immediately fall desperately in love again and again i pondered upon my circumstances three hundred ayear was the amount of all my worldly possessions and miss delamere was not rich and she had been bred expensively for it had never been absent from her mothers mind that cecilia would be heiress to the immense glenthorn estate the present possessor was however an excellent life and he had a son stout and healthy so all these hopes of mrs delameres were at an end and as there was little chance as she said laughing of persuading her daughter to marry johnny the young lord and heir apparent it was now necessary to turn her views elsewhere and to form for cecilia some suitable alliance rank and large fortune were in mrs delameres opinion indispensable to happiness cecilias ideas were far more moderate but though perfectly disinterested and generous she was not so romantic or so silly as to think of marrying any man without the probability of his being able to support her in the society of her equals nor even if i could have thought it possible to prevail upon miss delamere to make an unbecoming and imprudent choice would i have taken advantage of the confidence reposed in me by lord y to destroy the happiness of a young friend for whom he evidently had a great regard i resolved to see her no moreand for some weeks i kept my resolution i refrained from going to y house i deem this the most virtuous action of my life it certainly was the most painful sacrifice i ever made to a sense of duty at last lord y came to me one morning and after reproaching me in a friendly manner for having so long absented myself from his house declared that he would not be satisfied with any of those common excuses which might content a mere acquaintance that his sincere anxiety for my welfare gave him a right to expect from me the frankness of a friend it was a relief to my mind to be encouraged in this manner i confessed with entire openness my real motive lord y heard me without surprise it is gratifying to me said his lordship to be convinced that i was not mistaken in my judgment either of your taste or your integrity permit me to assure you that i foresaw exactly how you would feel and precisely how you would act there are certain moral omens which old experience never fails to interpret rightly and from which unerring predictions of the future conduct and consequently of the future fate of individuals may be formed i hold that we are the artificers of our own fortune if there be any whom the gods wish to destroy these are first deprived of understanding whom the gods wish to favour they first endow with integrity inspire with understanding and animate with activity have i not seen integrity in you and shall i not see activity yes that supineness of temper or habit with which you reproach yourself has arisen believe me only from want of motive but you have now the most powerful of motives and in proportion to your exertions will be your success in our country you know the highest offices of the state are open to talents and perseverance a man of abilities and application cannot fail to secure independence and obtain distinction time and industry are necessary to prepare you for the profession to which you will hereafter be an honour and you will courageously submit time and industry the mighty two which bring our wishes nearer to our view as to the probability that your present wishes may be crowned with success i can judge only from my general knowledge of the views and disposition of the lady whom you admire i know that her views with respect to fortune are moderate and that her disposition and excellent understanding will in the choice of a husband direct her preference to the essential good qualities and not to the accidental advantages of the candidates for her favour as to the mothers influence that will necessarily yield to the daughters superior judgment cecilia possesses over her mother that witchcraft of gentle manners which in the female sex is always irresistible even over violent tempers prudential considerations have a just though not exclusive claim to miss delameres attention but her relations i fancy could find means of providing against any pecuniary embarrassments if she should think proper to unite herself to a man who can be content as she would be with a competence and who should have proved himself able by his own exertions to maintain his wife in independence on this last condition i must dwell with emphasis because it is indispensable and i am convinced that without it miss delameres consent even after she is of age and at liberty to judge for herself could never be obtained you perceive then how much depends upon your own exertions and this is the best hope and the best motive that i can give to a strong and generous mind farewellpersevere and prosper such was the general purport of what lord y said to me indeed i believe that i have repeated his very words for they made a great and ineffaceable impression upon my mind from this day i date the commencement of a new existence fired with ambitioni hope generous ambitionto distinguish myself among men and to win the favour of the most amiable and the most lovely of women all the faculties of my soul were awakened i became active permanently active the enchantment of indolence was dissolved and the demon of ennui was cast out for ever chapter xxi if among those who maybe tempted to peruse my history there should be any mere novel readers let me advise them to throw the book aside at the commencement of this chapter for i have no more wonderful incidents to relate no more changes at nurse no more sudden turns of fortune i am now become a plodding man of business poring over lawbooks from morning till night and leading a most monotonous life yet occupation and hope and the constant sense of approaching nearer to my object rendered this mode of existence dull as it may seem infinitely more agreeable than many of my apparently prosperous days when i had more money and more time than i knew how to enjoy i resolutely persevered in my studies about a month after i came to town the doors of my lodging were blockaded by half a dozen cars loaded with huge packingcases on which i saw in the handwriting which i remembered often to have seen in my blacksmiths bills a direction to christopher odonoghoe esquirethis side upwards to be kept dry one of the carmen fumbled in what he called his pocket and at last produced a very dirty note my dear and honourable fosterbrother larning from mr mleod that you are thinking of studdeing i send you inclosed by the bearer who is to get nothing for the carrige all the bookes from the big bookeroom at the castle which i hope being of not as much use as i could wish to me your honour will not scorn to accept with the true veneration of your everloving fosterbrother and grateful humble servant to command ps no name needful for you will not be astray about the hand this goodnatured fellows present was highly valuable and useful to me among my pleasures at this studious period of my life when i had few events to break the uniform tenor of my days i must mention letters which i frequently received from mr devereux and lady geraldine who still continued in india mr devereux was acquainted with almost all the men of eminence at the irish bar men who are not mere lawyers but persons of literature of agreeable manners and gentlemanlike habits mr desvereux wrote to his friends so warmly in my favour that instead of finding myself a stranger in dublin my only difficulty was how to avoid the numerous invitations which tempted me from my studies those gentlemen of the bar who were intimate with mr devereux honoured me with particular attention and their society was peculiarly useful as well as agreeable to me they directed my industry to the best and shortest means of preparing myself for their profession they put into my hands the best books told me all that experience had taught them of the art of distinguishing in the mass of lawprecedents the useful from the useless instructed me in the methods of indexing and commonplacing and gave me all those advantages which solitary students so often want and the want of which so often makes the study of the law appear an endless maze without a plan when i found myself surrounded with books and reading assiduously day and night i could scarcely believe in my own identity i could scarcely imagine that i was the same person who but a few months before this time lolled upon a sofa half the day and found it an intolerable labour to read or think for half an hour together such is the power of motive during the whole time i pursued my studies and kept my terms in ireland the only relaxation i allowed myself was in the society at lord ys house in dublin and during my vacations in excursions which i made with his lordship to different parts of the country lord y had two countryseats in the most beautiful parts of ireland how differently the face of nature appeared to me now with what different sensations i beheld the same objects no brighter colours paint th enamelld fields no sweeter fragrance now the garden yields whence then this strange increase of joy is it to love these new delights i owe it was not to love that i owed these new delights for cecilia was not there but my powers of observation were awakened and the confinement and labour to which i had lately submitted gave value to the pleasures of rest and liberty and to the freshness of country air and the beautiful scenes of nature so true it is that all our pleasures must be earned before they can be enjoyed when i saw on lord ys estates and on those of several other gentlemen which he occasionally took me to visit the neat cottages the wellcultivated farms the air of comfort industry and prosperity diffused through the lower classes of the people i was convinced that much may be done by the judicious care and assistance of landlords for their tenantry i saw this with mixed sensations of pleasure and of painof pain for i reflected how little i had accomplished and how ill i had done even that little whilst the means of doing good to numbers had been in my power for the very trifling services i did to some of my poor tenants i am sure i had abundant gratitude and i was astonished and touched by instances of this shown to me after i had lost my fortune and when i scarcely had myself any remembrance of the people who came to thank me trivial as it is i cannot forbear to record one of the many instances of gratitude i met with from a poor irishman whilst i was in dublin as i was paying a morning visit to lord y sitting with him in his library we heard some disturbance in the inner court and looking out of the window we saw a countryman with a basket on his arm struggling with the porter and two footmen he is here i know to a certainty he is here and i shall see him say what you plase now i tell you my lord is not at home said the porter whats the matter said lord y opening the window see theres my lord himself at the window are not you ashamed of yourself now said the footman and why would i be ashamed that am telling no lies and hindering no one said the countryman looking up to us with so sudden a motion that his hat fell of i knew his face but could not recollect his name oh there he is his own honour ive found him and axe pardon for my boldness but its because ive been all day yesterday and this day running through dublin after yees and when certified by the lady of the lodgings you was in it here i could not lave town without my errand which is no more than a cheese from my wife of her own making to be given to your honours own hands and she would not see me if i did not do it let him come up said lord y this continued his lordship turning to me reminds me of henry the fourth and the gascon peasant with his fromages de boeuf but our countryman brings his offering to an abdicated monarch said i the poor fellow presented his wifes cheese to me with as good a grace as any courtier could have made his offering unembarrassed his manners and his words gave the natural and easy expression of a grateful heart he assured me that he and his wife were the happiest couple in all ireland and he hoped i would one day be as happy myself in a wife as i desarved who had made others so and there were many on the estate remembered as well as he did the good i did to the poor during my reign then stepping up closer to me he said in a lower voice im jimmy riley that married ould noonans daughter and now that it is all over i may tell you a bit of a secret which made me so eager to get to the speech of your honour that i might tell it to your own ear aloneno offence to this gentleman before whom id as soon say it as yourself becaase i see he is all as one as another yourself then the thing isdoes your honour remember the boy with the cord round his body looking for the birds eggs in the rock and the nonymous bit of a letter that you got twas i wrote it and the gossoon that threw it to your honour was a cousin of my own that i sent that nobody nor yourself even might not know him and the way i got the information i never can tell till i die and then only to the priest becaase i swore i would not never but dont go for to think it was by being a rubble any way no man can i thank my god charge me with indifferency so rejoiced to see you the same i wish you a good morrow and long life and a happy deathwhen it comes about this time i frequently used to receive presents to a considerable amount and of things which were most useful to me but always without any indication by which i could discover to whom i was indebted for them at last by means of my scotch landlady i traced them to mr mleod his kindness was so earnest and peremptory that it would admit neither thanks nor refusals and i submitted to be obliged to a man for whom i felt such high esteem i looked upon it as not the least of his proofs of regard that he gave me what i knew he valued more than any thing elsehis time whenever he came to dublin though he was always hurried by business so that he had scarcely leisure to eat or sleep he used constantly to come to see me in my obscure lodgings and when in the country though he hated all letterwriting except letters of business yet he regularly informed me of every thing that could be interesting to me glenthorn castle he described as a scene of riotous living and of the most wasteful vulgar extravagance my poor fosterbrother the bestnatured and most generous fellow in the world had not sufficient prudence or strength of mind to conduct his own family his wife filled the castle with tribes of her vagabond relations she chose to be descended from one of the kings of ireland and whoever would acknowledge her high descent and whoever would claim relationship with her were sure to have their claims allowed and were welcome to live in all the barbaric magnificence of glenthorn castle every instance that she could hear of the former lady glenthorns extravagance or of mineand alas there were many upon record she determined to exceed her diamonds and her pearls and her finery surpassed every thing but the extravagance of some of the russian favourites of fortune decked out in the most absurd manner this descendant of kings as mr mleod assured me often indulged in the pleasures of the banquet till no longer able to support the regal diadem she was carried by some of the meanest of her subjects to her bed the thefts committed during these interregnums were amazing in their amount and the jewels of the crown were to be replaced as fast as they were stolen poor christy all this time was considered as a meanspirited cratur who had no notion of living like a prince and whilst his wife and her relations were revelling in this unheardof manner he was scarcely considered as the master of the house he lived by the fireside disregarded in winter and in summer he spent his time chiefly in walking up and down his garden and picking fruit he once made an attempt to amuse himself by mending the lock of his own room door but he was detected in the fact and exposed to such loud ridicule by his ladys favourites that he desisted and sighing said to mr mleodand isnt it now a great hardship upon a man like me to have nothing to do or not to be let do any thing if it had not been for my son johnnys sake i never would have quit the forge and now all will be spent in coshering and johnny at the last will never be a penny the better but the worse for my consinting to be lorded and what grieves me more than all the rest she is such a negre that i havent a guinea i can call my own to send as id always laid out to do at odd times such little tokens of my love and duty as would be becoming to my dear fosterbrother there in dublin and now you tell me he is going away too beyond sea to england to finish making a lawyer of himself in london and what friends will he find there without money in his pocket and i had been thinking this while past ever since you gave me notice of his being to quit ireland that i would go up to dublin myself to see him and wish him a good journey kindly before he would go and i had a little compliment here in a private drawer that i had collected unknownst to my wife but here last night she lit upon it and now that her hand has closed upon it not a guinea of it shall i ever see more nor a farthing the better of it will my dear fosterbrother ever be for it or for me and this is what grieves me more than all and goes to the quick of my heart when mr mleod repeated to me these lamentations of poor christy i immediately wrote to set his heart at ease as much as i could by the assurance that i was in no distress for money and that my three hundred a year would support me in perfect comfort and independence while i was making a lawyer of myself in london i farther assured my good fosterbrother that i was so well convinced of his affectionate and generous disposition towards me that it would be quite unnecessary ever to send me tokens of his regard i added a few words of advice about his wife and his affairs which like most words of advice were as i afterwards found absolutely thrown away though i had taken care to live with so much economy that i was not in any danger of being in pecuniary embarrassments yet i felt much distress of another kind in leaving ireland i left miss delamere surrounded with admirers her mother using her utmost art and parental influence to induce cecilia to decide in favour of one of these gentlemen who was a person of rank and of considerable fortune i had seen all this going on and was bound in honour the whole time to remain passive not to express my own ardent feelings not to make the slightest attempt to win the affections of the woman who was the object of all my labours of all my exertions the last evening that i saw her at lord ys just before i sailed for england i suffered more than i thought it was in my nature to feel especially at the moment when i went up to make my bow and take leave of her with all the cold ceremony of a common acquaintance at parting however in the presence of her mother and of lord y cecilia with her sweet smile and i think with a slight blush said a few words upon which i lived for months afterwards i sincerely wish you sir the success your perseverance so well deserves the recollection of these words was often my solace in my lonely chambers in the temple and often after a days hard study the repeating them to myself operated as a charm that dissipated all fatigue and revived at once my exhausted spirits to be sure there were moments when my fire was out and my candle sinking in the socket and my mind overwearied saw things in the most gloomy point of view and at these times i used to give an unfavourable interpretation to cecilias words and i fancied that they were designed to prevent my entertaining fallacious hopes and to warn me that she must yield to her mothers authority or perhaps to her own inclinations in favour of some of her richer lovers this idea would have sunk me into utter despondency and i should have lost with my motive all power of exertion had not i opposed to this apprehension the remembrance of lord ys countenance at the moment cecilia was speaking to me i then felt assured that his lordship at least understood the words in a favourable sense else he would have suffered for me and would not certainly have allowed me to go away with false hopes reanimated by this consideration i perseveredfor it was by perseverance alone that i could have any chance of success it was fortunate for me that stimulated by a great motive i thus devoted my whole time and thoughts to my studies otherwise i must on returning to london have felt the total neglect and desertion of all my former associates in the fashionable world of all the vast number of acquaintance who used to lounge away their hours in my company and partake of the luxuries of my table and the festivities of my house some whom i accidentally met in the street just at my reappearance in town thought proper indeed to know me again at first that they might gratify their curiosity about the paragraphs which they had seen in the papers and the reports which they had heard of my extraordinary change of fortune but no sooner had they satisfied themselves that all they had heard was true than their interest concerning me ceased when they found that instead of being earl of glenthorn and the possessor of a large estate i was now reduced to three hundred a year lodging in small chambers in the temple and studying the law they never more thought me worthy of their notice they affected according to their different humours either to pity me for my misfortunes or to blame me for my folly in giving up my estate but they unanimously expressed astonishment at the idea of my becoming a member of any active profession they declared that it was impossible that i could ever endure the labour of the law or succeed in such an arduous career their prophecies intimidated me not i was conscious that these people did not in the least know me and i hoped and believed that i had powers and a character which they were incapable of estimating their contempt rather excited than depressed my mind and their pity i returned with more sincerity than it was given i had lived their life knew thoroughly what were its pleasures and its pains i could compare the ennui i felt when i was a bondstreet lounger with the selfcomplacency i enjoyed now that i was occupied in a laborious but interesting and honourable pursuit i confess i had sometimes however the weakness to think the worse of human nature for what i called the desertion and ingratitude of these my former companions and flatterers and i could not avoid comparing the neglect and solitude in which i lived in london where i had lavished my fortune with the kindness and hospitalities i had received in dublin where i lived only when i had no fortune to spend after a little time however i became more reasonable and just for i considered that it was my former dissipated mode of life and imprudent choice of associates which i should blame for the mortifications i now suffered from the desertion of companions who were in fact incapable of being friends in london i had lived with the most worthless in dublin with the best company and in each place i had been treated as in fact i deserved but leaving the history of my feelings i must proceed with my narrative one night after i had dined with an irish gentleman a friend of lord ys at the west end of the town as i was returning late to my lodgings i was stopped for some time by a crowd of carriages in one of the fashionable streets i found that there was a masquerade at the house of a lady with whom i had been intimately acquainted the clamours of the mob eager to see the dresses of those who were alighting from their carriages the gaudy and fantastic figures which i beheld by the light of the flambeaux the noise and the bustle put me in mind of various similar nights of my past life and it seemed to me like a dream or reminiscence of some former state of existence i passed on as soon as the crowd would permit and took my way down a narrow street by which i hoped to get by a shorter way than usual to my quiet lodgings the rattling of the carriages the oaths of the footmen and the shouts of the mob still sounded in my ears and the masquerade figures had scarcely faded from my sight when i saw coming slowly out of a miserable entry by the light of a few wretched candles and lanterns a funeral the contrast struck me i stood still to make way for the coffin and i heard one say to another what matter how shes buried i tell you be at as little expense as possible for hell never pay a farthing i had a confused recollection of having heard the voice before as one of the bearers lifted his lantern i saw the face of the woman who spoke and had a notion of having seen her before i asked whose funeral it was and i was answered it is one mrs crawleyslady glenthorn that was added the woman i heard no more i was so much shocked that i believe i should have fallen in the street if i had not been immediately supported by somebody near me when i recovered my recollection i saw the funeral had moved on some paces and the person who supported me i now found was a clergyman in a mild voice he told me that his duty called him away from me at present but he added that if i would tell him where i could be found he would see me in the morning and give me any information in his power as he supposed that i was interested for this unfortunate woman i put a card with my address into his hands thanked him and got home as well as i could in the morning the clergyman called upon mea most benevolent man unknown to fame but known to all the wretched within the reach of his consolatory religion he gave me a melancholy account of the last days of the unhappy woman whose funeral i had just seen i told him who i was and what she had been to me she had almost in her last moments as he assured me expressed her sense of what she called my generosity to her and had shown deep contrition for her infidelity she died in extreme poverty and wretchedness with no human being who was or even seemed interested for her but a maidservant the woman whose voice i recollected whose services were purchased to the last by presents of whatever clothes or trinkets were left from the wreck of her mistresss fortune crawley it seems had behaved brutally to his victim after having long delayed to perform his promise of marrying her he declared that he could never think of a woman who had been divorced in any other way than a mistress she poor weak creature consented to live with him on any terms but as his passions and his interest soon turned to new objects he cast her off without scruple refusing to pay any of the tradesmen who had supplied her while she bore his name he refused to pay the expenses even of her funeral though she had shared with him her annuity and every thing she possessed i paid the funeral expenses and some arrears of the maids wages together with such debts for necessaries as i had reason to believe were justly due the strict economy with which i had lived for three years and the parting with a watch and some other trinkets too fine for my circumstances enabled me to pay this money without material inconvenience and it was a satisfaction to my mind the good clergyman who managed these little matters became interested for me and our acquaintance with each other grew every day more intimate and agreeable when he found that i was studying the law he begged to introduce me to a brother of his who had been one of the most eminent special pleaders in london and who now on a high salary undertook to prepare students for the bar i was rather unwilling to accept of this introduction because i was not rich enough to become a pupil of this gentlemans but my clergyman guessed the cause of my reluctance and told me that his brother had charged him to overrule all such objections my brother and i continued he though of different professions have in reality but one mind between us he has heard from me all the circumstances i know of you and they have interested him so much that he desires in plain english to be of any service he can to you this offer was made in earnest and if i had given him the largest salary that could have been offered by the most opulent of his pupils i could not have met with more attention or have been instructed with more zeal than i was by my new friend the special pleader he was also so kind as to put me at ease by the assurance that whenever i should begin to make money by my profession he would accept of remuneration he jestingly said that he would make the same bargain with me that was made by the famous sophist protagoras of old with his pupil that he should have the profits of the first cause i should wincertain that i would not like his treacherous pupil evathlus employ the rhetoricians arms against himself to cheat him out of his promised reward my special pleader was not a mere man of forms and law rigmaroles he knew the reason for the forms he used he had not only a technical but a rational knowledge of his business and what is still more uncommon he knew how to teach what he had learnt he did not merely set me down at a desk and leave me skins after skins of parchment to pore over in bewildered and hopeless stupidity he did not use me like a mere copying machine to copy sheet after sheet for him every morning from nine till four and again every evening from five till ten mine was a law tutor of a superior sort wherever he could he gave me a clue to guide me through the labyrinth and when no reason could be devised for what the law directs he never puzzled me by attempting to explain what could not be explained he did not insist upon the total surrender of my rational faculties but with wonderful liberality would allow me to call nonsense nonsense and would after two or three hours hard scrivening as the case might requirefor this i thank him more than all the restpermit me to yawn and stretch and pity myself and curse the useless repetitions of lawyers sinking under the weight of declarations and replications and double pleas and dilatory pleas of horse pleas traverses demurrers jeofails imparlances and errors averments bars and profestandoes o cecilia what pains did i endure to win your applause yet that i may state the whole truth let me acknowledge that even these my dullest hardest tasks were light compared with the burden i formerly bore of ennui at length my period of probation in my pleaders office was over i escaped from the dusky desk and the smell of musty parchments and the close smoky room i finished eating my terms at the temple and returned even as the captain of the packet swore in the face and teeth of the wind to dublin but in my haste to return i must not omit to notice for the sake of poetical equity that just when i was leaving england i heard that slow but surepaced justice at last overtook that wretch crawley he was detected and convicted of embezzling considerable sums the property of a gentleman in cheshire who had employed him as his agent i saw him as i passed through chester going to prison amidst the execrations of the populace chapter xxii as i was not as formerly asleep in my carriage on deck when we came within sight of the irish shore i saw and hailed with delight the beautiful bay of dublin the moment we landed instead of putting myself out of humour as before with every thing at the marine hotel i went directly to my friend lord ys i made my sortie from the hotel with so much extraordinary promptitude that a slipshod waiter was forced to pursue me running or shuffling after me the whole length of the street before he could overtake me with a letter which had been waiting for my honour at the hotel since yesterdays holyhead packet this was a mistake as the letter had never come or gone by any holyhead packet it was only a letter from mr mleod to welcome me to ireland again and to tell me that he had taken care to secure good wellaired lodgings for me he added an account of what was going on at glenthorn castle the extravagance of my lady had by this time reduced the family to great difficulties for ready money as they could neither sell nor mortgage any part of the glenthorn estate which was settled on the son my poor fosterbrother had it seems in vain attempted to restrain the wasteful folly of his wife and to persuade johnny the young heirapparent to larn to be a jantleman in vain christy tried to prevail on his lordship to refrain drinking whisky preferably to claret the youth pleaded both his fathers and mothers examples and said that as he was an only son and his father had but a lifeinterest in the estate he expected to be indulged he repeated continually a short life and a merry one for me mr mleod concluded this letter by observing that far from its being a merry life he never saw any thing more sad than the life this foolish boy led and that glenthorn castle was so melancholy and disgusting a scene of waste riot and intemperance that he could not bear to go there i was grieved by this account for the sake of my poor fosterbrother but it would have made a deeper impression upon me at any other time i must own that i forgot the letter and all that it contained as i knocked at lord ys door lord y received me with open arms and with all the kindness of friendship anticipated the questions i longed yet feared to ask cecilia delamere is still unmarriedlet these words be enough to content you for the present all the rest is i hope in your own power in my powerdelightful thought yet how distant that hope for i was now after all my labours but just called to the bar not yet likely for years to make a guinea much less a fortune by my profession many of the greatest of our lawyers have gone circuit for ten or twelve years before they made a fashionable life hundred a year and i was at this time fourandthirty i confessed to my lord y that these reflections alarmed and depressed me exceedingly but he encouraged me by this answerperseveredeserve success and trust the rest not to fortune but to your friends it is not required of you to make ten thousand or one thousand a year at the bar in any given time but it is expected from you to give proofs that you are capable of conquering the indolence of your disposition or of your former habits it is required from you to give proofs of intellectual energy and ability when you have convinced me that you have the knowledge and assiduity that ought to succeed at the bar i shall be certain that only time is wanting to your actual acquisition of a fortune equal to what i ought to require for my fair friend and relation when it comes to that point it will my dear sir be time enough for me to say more till it comes to that point i have promised mrs delamere that you will not even attempt to see her daughter she blames me for having permitted cecilia and you to see so much of each other as you did in this house when you were last in ireland perhaps i was imprudent but your conduct has saved me from my own reproaches and i fear no other i end where i began with persevereand may the success your perseverance deserves be your reward if i recollect right these were nearly miss delameres own words at parting with you in truth i had not forgotten them and i was so much excited by their repetition at this moment and by my excellent friends encouraging voice that all difficulties all dread of future labours or evils vanished from my view i went my first circuit and made two guineas and was content for lord y was not disappointed he told me it would it must be so but though i made no money i obtained gradually amongst my associates at the bar the reputation for judgment and knowledge of this they could judge by my conversation and by the remarks on the trials brought on before us the elder counsel had been prepared in my favour first by mr devereux and afterwards by my diligence in following their advice during my studies in dublin they perceived that i had not lost my time in london and that my mind was in my possession they prophesied that from the moment i began to be employed i should rise rapidly opportunity they told me was now all that i wanted and for that i must wait with patience i waited with as much patience as i could i had many friends some among the judges some among a more powerful class of men the attorneys some of these friends made for me by mr devereux and lady geraldine some by lord y some may i say it by myself yet the utmost that even the highest patronage from the bench can do for a young barrister is to give him an opportunity of distinguishing himself in preference to other competitors this was all i hoped and i was not deceived in this hope it happened that a cause of considerable moment which had come on in our circuit and to the whole course of which i had attended with great care was removed by an appeal to dublin i fortunately i should say prudently was in the habit of constant attendance at the courts the counsel who was engaged to manage this cause was suddenly taken ill and was disabled from proceeding the judge called upon me the attorneys and the other counsel were all agreed in wishing me to take up the business for they knew i was prepared and competent to the question the next day the cause which was then to be finally decided came on i sat up all night to look over my documents and to make myself sure of my points ten years before this if any one had prophesied this of me how little could i have believed them the trial came oni rose to speak how fortunate it was for me that i did not know my lord y was in the court i am persuaded that i could not have uttered three sentences if he had caught my eye in the exordium of this my first harangue every man of sensibilityand no man without it can be an oratorevery man of sensibility knows that it is more difficult to speak in the presence of one anxious friend of whose judgment we have a high opinion than before a thousand auditors who are indifferent and are strangers to us not conscious who was listening to me whose eyes were upon me whose heart was beating for me i spoke with confidence and fluency for i spoke on a subject of which i had previously made myself completely master and i was so full of the matter that i thought not of the words perhaps this and my having the right side of the question were the causes of my success i heard a buzz of thanks and applause round me the decree was given in our favour at this moment i recollected my bargain and my debt to my good master the special pleader but all bargains all debts all special pleaders vanished the next instant from my mind for the crowd opened lord y appeared before me seized my hand congratulated me actually with tears of joy carried me away to his carriage ordered the coachman to drive homefast fast and now said he to me i am satisfied your trial is oversuccessfully overyou have convinced me of your powers and your perseverance all the hopes of friendship are fulfilled may all the hopes of love be accomplished you have now my free and full approbation to address my ward and relation cecilia delamere you will have difficulties with her mother perhaps but none beyond what we good and great lawyers shall i trust be able to overrule mrs delamere knows that as i have an unsettled estate and but one son i have it in my power to provide for her daughter as if she were my own it has always been my intention to do so but if you marry miss delamere you will still find it necessary to pursue your profession diligently to maintain her in her own rank and style of life and now that you have felt the pleasures of successful exertion you will consider this necessity as an additional blessing from what i have heard this day there can be no doubt that by pursuing your profession you can secure in a few years not only ease and competence but affluence and honourshonours of your own earning how far superior to any hereditary title the carriage stopped at lord ys door my friend presented me to cecilia whom i saw this day for the first time since my return to ireland from this hour i date the commencement of my life of real happiness how unlike that life of pleasure to which so many give erroneously the name of happiness lord y with his powerful influence supported my cause with mrs delamere who was induced though with an ill grace to give up her opposition cecilia she said was now threeandtwenty an age to judge for herself and lord ys judgment was a great point in favour of mr odonoghoe to be sure and no doubt mr odonoghoe might make a fortune since he had made a figure already at the bar in short she could not oppose the wishes of lord y and the affections of her daughter since they were so fixed but after all said mrs delamere what a horrid thing it will be to hear my girl called mrs odonoghoe only conceive the sound ofmrs odonoghoes carriage theremrs odonoghoes carriage stops the way your objection my dear madam replied lord y is fully as well founded as that of a young lady of my acquaintance who could not prevail on her delicacy to become the wife of a merchant of the name of sheepshanks he very wisely or very gallantly paid five hundred pounds to change his name i make no doubt that your future soninlaw will have no objection to take and bear the name and arms of delamere and i think i can answer for it that a kings letter may be obtained empowering him to do so with this part of the business allow me to charge myself i spare the reader the protracted journal of a lovers hopes and fears cecilia convinced by the exertions in which i had so long persevered that my affection for her was not only sincere and ardent but likely to be permanent did not torture me by the vain delays of female coquetry she believed she said that a man capable of conquering habitual indolence could not be of a feeble character and she therefore consented without hesitation to entrust her happiness to my care i hope my readers have by this time too favourable an opinion of me to suspect that in my joy i forgot him who had been my steady friend in adversity i wrote to mleod as soon as i knew my own happiness and assured him that it would be incomplete without his sympathy i do not think there was at our wedding a face of more sincere though sober joy than mleods cecilia and i have been now married above a twelvemonth and she permits me to say that she has never for a moment repented her choice that i have not relapsed into my former habits the judicious and benevolent reader will hence infer and yet i have been in a situation to be spoiled for i scarcely know a wish of my heart that remains ungratified except the wish that my friend mr devereux and lady geraldine should return from india to see and partake of that happiness of which they first prepared the foundation they first awakened my dormant intellects made me know that i had a heart and that i was capable of forming a character for myself the loss of my estate continued the course of my education forced me to exert my own powers and to rely upon myself my passion for the amiable and charming cecilia was afterwards motive sufficient to urge me to persevering intellectual labour fortunately my marriage has obliged me to continue my exertions and the labours of my profession have made the pleasures of domestic life most delightful the rich says a philosophic moralist are obliged to labour if they would be healthy or happy and they call this labour exercise whether if i were again a rich man i should have sufficient voluntary exertion to take a due portion of mental and bodily exercise i dare not pretend to determine nor do i wish to be put to the trial desiring nothing in life but the continuance of the blessings i possess i may here conclude my memoirs by assuring my readers that after a full experience of most of what are called the pleasures of life i would not accept of all the glenthorn and sherwood estates to pass another year of such misery as i endured whilst i was stretched on the rack of a too easy chair the preceding memoirs were just ready for publication when i received the following letter honoured fosterbrother since the day i parted yees nothing in life but misfortins has happened me owing to my being overruled by my wife who would be a lady all i could say again it but thats over and theres no help for all and all that ever she can say will do no good the castles burnt down all to the ground and my johnnys dead and i wish i was dead in his place the occasion of his death was owing to drink which he fell into from getting too much money and nothing to doand a snuff of a candle when going to bed last night a little in liquor what does he do but takes the candle and sticks it up against the head of his bed as he used oftentimes to do without detriment in the cabin where he was reared against the mudwall but this was close to an ould window curtain and a deal of ould wood in the bed which was all in a smother and he lying asleep after drinking when he was ever hard to wake and before he waked at all it appears the unfortunit cratur was smothered and none heard a sentence of it till the ceiling of my room the blue bedchamber with a piece of the big wood cornice fell and wakened me with terrible uproar and all above and about me was flame and smoke and i just took my wife on my back and down the stairs with her which did not give in till five minutes after and she screeching and all them relations she had screeching and running every one for themselves and no thought in any to save any thing at all but just what they could for themselves and not a sarvant that was in his right rason i got the ladder with a deal of difficulty and up to johnnys room and there was a sight for mehe a corpse and how even to get the corpse out of that myself could not tell for i was bewildered and how they took me down i dont well know when i came to my sinses i was lying on the ground in the court and all confusion and screaming still and the flames raging worse than ever theres no use in describing allthe short of it is theres nothing remaining of the castle but the stones and its little id think o that if i could have johnny backsuch as he used to be in my good days since hes gone i am no good i write this to beg you being married of which i give you joy to miss delamere that is the hare at law will take possession of all immediately for i am as good as dead and will give no hindrance i will go back to my forge and by the help of god forget at my work what has passed and as to my wife she may go to her own kith and kin if she will not abide by me i shall not trouble her long mr mleod is a good man and will follow any directions you send and may the blessing of god attind and come to reign over us again when you will find me as heretofore your loyal fosterbrother christy donoghoe glenthorn castle is now rebuilding and when it is finished and when i return thither i will if it should be desired by the public give a faithful account of my feelings i flatter myself that i shall not relapse into indolence my understanding has been cultivatedi have acquired a taste for literature and the example of lord y convinces me that a man may at once be rich and noble and active and happy written in printed in footnotes clodius albinus i was not the nobleman who laid a wager that he could ride a fine horse to death in fifteen minutes indeed i must do myself the justice to say that i rejoiced at this mans losing his bet he blew the horse in four minutes and killed it but it did not die within the time prescribed by the bet if any one should think it impossible that a man of lord glenthorns consequence should at the supposed moment of his death thus be neglected let them recollect the scenes that followed the death of tiberiusof henry the fourth of franceof william rufus and of george the second for fostering i did never hear or read that it was in use or reputation in any country barbarous or civil as it hath been and yet is in ireland in the opinion of this people fostering hath always been a stronger alliance than blood and the fosterchildren do love and are beloved of their fosterfathers and their sept or clan more than of their natural parents and kindred and do participate of their means more frankly and do adhere unto them in all fortunes with more affection and constancy such a general custom in a kingdom in giving and taking children to foster making such a firm alliance as it doth in

horseback the spectator enjoys the diversion on the lake where the cry of hounds the harmony of the horn resounding from the hills on every side the universal shouts of joy along the valleys and mountains which are often lined with footpeople who come in vast numbers to partake and assist at the diversion reecho from hill to hill and give the highest glee and satisfaction that the imagination can conceive possible to arise from the chase and perhaps can nowhere be enjoyed with that spirit and sublime elevation of soul that a thoroughbred sportsman feels at a staghunt on the lake of

society says a celebrated writer it is a melancholy and distressing sight to observe not unfrequently a man of a noble and ingenuous disposition once feelingly alive to a sense of honour and integrity gradually sinking under the pressure of his circumstances making his excuses at first with a blush of conscious shame afraid to see the faces of his friends from whom he may have borrowed money reduced to the meanest tricks and subterfuges to delay or avoid the payment of his just debts till ultimately grown familiar with falsehood and at enmity with the world he loses all the grace and dignity of man colonel pembroke the subject of the following story had not at the time his biographer first became acquainted with him grown familiar with falsehood his conscience was not entirely callous to reproach nor was his heart insensible to compassion but he was in a fair way to get rid of all troublesome feelings and principles he was connected with a set of selfish young men of fashion whose opinions stood him in stead of law equity and morality to them he appealed in all doubtful cases and his selfcomplacency being daily and hourly dependent upon their decisions he had seldom either leisure or inclination to consult his own judgment his amusements and his expenses were consequently regulated by the example of his companions not by his own choice to follow them in every absurd variety of the mode either in dress or equipage was his first ambition and all their factitious wants appeared to him objects of the first necessity no matter how good the boots the hat the coat the furniture or the equipage might be if they had outlived the fashion of the day or even of the hour they were absolutely worthless in his eyes nobody could be seen in such thingsthen of what use could they be to any body colonel pembrokes finances were not exactly equal to the support of such liberal principles but this was a misfortune which he had in common with several of his companions it was no check to their spiritthey could live upon creditcredit that talisman which realizes every thing it imagines and which can imagine every thing see des casaux sur le mechanisme de la societe without staying to reflect upon the immediate or remote consequences of this system pembroke in his first attempts found it easy to reduce it to practice but as he proceeded he experienced some difficulties tradesmens bills accumulated and applications for payment became every day more frequent and pressing he defended himself with much address and ingenuity and practice perfected him in all the fabian arts of delay no faith with duns became as he frankly declared a maxim of his morality he could now with a most plausible face protest to a poor devil upon the honour of a gentleman that he should be paid tomorrow when nothing was farther from his intentions or his power than to keep his word and when tomorrow came he could with the most easy assurance damn the rascal for putting a gentleman in mind of his promises but there were persons more difficult to manage than poor devils colonel pembrokes tailor who had begun by being the most accommodating fellow in the world and who had in three years run him up a bill of thirteen hundred pounds at length began to fail in complaisance and had the impertinence to talk of his large family and his urgent calls for money etc and next the colonels shoe and bootmaker a man from whom he had been in the habit of taking two hundred pounds worth of shoes and boots every year for himself and his servants now pretended to be in distress for ready money and refused to furnish more goods upon credit ungrateful dog pembroke called him and he actually believed his creditors to be ungrateful and insolent when they asked for their money for men frequently learn to believe what they are in the daily habit of asserting rochefoucault especially if their assertions be not contradicted by their audience he knew that his tradesmen overcharged him in every article he bought and therefore he thought it but just to delay payment whilst it suited his convenience confound them they can very well afford to wait as to their pleas of urgent demands for ready money large families c he considered these merely as words of course tradesmens cant which should make no more impression upon a gentleman than the whining of a beggar one day when pembroke was just going out to ride with some of his gay companions he was stopped at his own door by a pale thin miserablelooking boy eight or nine years old who presented him with a paper which he took for granted was a petition he threw the child halfacrown there take that said he and stand out of the way of my horses heels i advise you my little fellow the boy however still pressed closer and without picking up the halfcrown held the paper to colonel pembroke who had now vaulted into his saddle o no no thats too much my ladi never read petitionsid sooner give halfacrown at any time than read a petition but sir this is not a petitionindeed sir i am not a beggar what is it thenheyday a billthen youre worse than a beggara duna dun in the public streets at your time of life you little rascal why what will you come to before you are your fathers age the boy sighed if pursued the colonel i were to serve you right i should give you a good horsewhipping do you see this whip i do sir said the boy but but what you insolent little dunbut what my father is dying said the child bursting into tears and we have no money to buy him bread or any thing struck by these words pembroke snatched the paper from the boy and looking hastily at the total and title of the bill readtwelve pounds fourteenjohn white weaveri know of no such personi have no dealings with weavers child said the colonel laughing my names pembrokecolonel pembroke colonel pembrokeyes sir the very person mr close the tailor sent me to close the tailor dn the rascal was it he sent you to dun me for this trick he shall not see a farthing of my money this twelvemonth you may tell him so you little whining hypocriteand hark you the next time you come to me take care to come with a better storylet your father and mother and six brothers and sisters be all lying ill of the feverdo you understand he tore the bill into bits as he spoke and showered it over the boys head pembrokes companions laughed at this operation and he facetiously called it powdering a dun they rode off to the park in high spirits and the poor boy picked up the halfcrown and returned home his home was in a lane in moorfields about three miles distant from this gay part of the town as the child had not eaten any thing that morning he was feeble and grew faint as he was crossing covent garden he sat down upon the corner of a stage of flowers what are you doing there cried a surly man pulling him up by the arm what business have you lounging and loitering here breaking my best balsam i did not mean to do any harmi am not loitering indeed sirim only weak said the boy and hungry oranges oranges fine china oranges cried a woman rolling her barrow full of fine fruit towards him if youve a twopence in the world you cant do better than take one of these fine ripe china oranges i have not twopence of my own in the world said the boy whats that i see through the hole in your waistcoat pocket said the woman is not that silver yes halfacrown which i am carrying home to my father who is ill and wants it more than i do pooh take an orange out of itits only twopenceand it will do you goodim sure you look as if you wanted it badly enough that may be but father wants it worseno i wont change my halfcrown said the boy turning away from the tempting oranges the gruff gardener caught him by the hand here ive moved the balsam a bit and it is not broke i see sit ye down child and rest yourself and eat this said he putting into his hand half a ripe orange which he just cut thank yougod bless you sirhow good it isbut said the child stopping after he had tasted the sweet juice i am sorry i have sucked so much i might have carried it home to father who is ill and what a treat it would be to himill keep the rest nothat you shant said the orangewoman but ill tell you what you shall dotake this home to your father which is a better one by halfim sure it will do him goodi never knew a ripe china orange do harm to man woman or child the boy thanked the good woman and the gardener as only those can thank who have felt what it is to be in absolute want when he was rested and able to walk he pursued his way home his mother was watching for him at the streetdoor well john my dear what news has he paid us the boy shook his head then we must bear it as well as we can said his mother wiping the cold dew from her forehead but look mother i have this halfcrown which the gentleman thinking me a beggar threw to me run with it love to the bakers nostay youre tiredill go myself and do you step up to your father and tell him the bread is coming in a minute dont run for youre not able mother dont hurry so said the boy calling after her and holding up his orange see i have this for father whilst you are away he clambered up three flights of dark narrow broken stairs to the room in which his father lay the door hung by a single hinge and the child had scarcely strength enough to raise it out of the hollow in the decayed floor into which it had sunk he pushed it open with as little noise as possible just far enough to creep in let those forbear to follow him whose fine feelings can be moved only by romantic elegant scenes of distress whose delicate sensibility shrinks from the revolting sight of real misery here are no pictures for romance no stage effect to be seen no poetic language to be heard nothing to charm the imaginationevery thing to disgust the senses this room was so dark that upon first going into it after having been in broad daylight you could scarcely distinguish any one object it contained and no one used to breathe a pure atmosphere could probably have endured to remain many minutes in this garret there were three beds in it one on which the sick man lay divided from it by a tattered rug was another for his wife and daughter and a third for his little boy in the farthest corner underneath the window was fixed a loom at which the poor weaver had worked hard many a day and yeartoo hard indeedeven till the very hour he was taken ill his shuttle now lay idle upon his frame a girl of about sixteenhis daughterwas sitting at the foot of his bed finishing some plain work oh anne how your face is all flushed said her little brother as she looked up when he came into the room have you brought us any money whispered she dont say no loud for fear father should hear you the boy told her in a low voice all that had passed speak out my dear im not asleep said his father so you are come back as you went no father not quitetheres bread coming for you give me some more water anne for my mouth is quite parched the little boy cut his orange in an instant and gave a piece of it to his father telling him at the same time how he came by it the sick man raised his hands to heaven and blessed the poor woman who gave it to him oh how i love her and how i hate that cruel unjust rich man who wont pay father for all the hard work he has done for him cried the child how i hate him god forgive him said the weaver i dont know what will become of you all when im gone and no one to befriend you or even to work at the loom anne i think if i was up said he raising himself i could still contrive to do a little good dear father dont think of getting up the best you can do for us is to lie still and take rest rest i can take no rest anne rest theres none for me in this world and whilst im in it is not it my duty to work for my wife and children reach me my clothes and ill get up it was in vain to contend with him when this notion seized him that it was his duty to work till the last all opposition fretted and made him worse so that his daughter and his wife even from affection were forced to yield and to let him go to the loom when his trembling hands were scarcely able to throw the shuttle he did not know how weak he was till he tried to walk as he stepped out of bed his wife came in with a loaf of bread in her hand at the unexpected sight he made an exclamation of joy sprang forward to meet her but fell upon the floor in a swoon before he could put one bit of the bread which she broke for him into his mouth want of sustenance the having been overworked and the constant anxiety which preyed upon his spirits had reduced him to this deplorable state of weakness when he recovered his senses his wife showed him his little boy eating a large piece of bread she also ate and made anne eat before him to relieve his mind from that dread which had seized itand not without some reasonthat he should see his wife and children starve to death you find father theres no danger for today said anne and tomorrow i shall be paid for my plain work and then we shall do very well for a few days longer and i dare say in that time mr close the tailor will receive some money from some of the great many rich gentlemen who owe him so much and you know he promised that as soon as ever he was able he would pay us with such hopes and the remembrance of such promises the poor mans spirits could not be much raised he knew alas how little dependence was to be placed on them as soon as he had eaten and felt his strength revive he insisted upon going to the loom his mind was bent upon finishing a pattern for which he was to receive five guineas in ready money he worked and worked then lay down and rested himselfthen worked again and so on during the remainder of the day and during several hours of the night he continued to throw the shuttle whilst his little boy and his wife by turns wound spools for him he completed his work and threw himself upon his bed quite exhausted just as the neighbouring clock struck one at this hour colonel pembroke was in the midst of a gay and brilliant assembly at mrs yorks in a splendid saloon illuminated with waxlights in profusion the floor crayoned with roses and myrtles which the dancers feet effaced the walls hung with the most expensive hothouse flowers in short he was surrounded with luxury in all its extravagance it is said that the peaches alone at this entertainment amounted to six hundred guineas they cost a guinea apiece the price of one of them which colonel pembroke threw away because it was not perfectly ripe would have supported the weaver and his whole family for a week there are political advocates for luxury who assert perhaps justly that the extravagance of individuals increases the wealth of nations but even upon this system those who by false hopes excite the industrious to exertion without paying them their just wages commit not only the most cruel private injustice but the most important public injury the permanence of industry in any state must be proportioned to the certainty of its reward amongst the masks at mrs yorks were three who amused the company particularly the festive mob followed them as they moved and their bonmots were applauded and repeated by all the best that is to say the most fashionable male and female judges of wit the three distinguished characters were a spendthrift a bailiff and a dun the spendthrift was supported with great spirit and truth by colonel pembroke and two of his companions were great and correct in the parts of the bailiff and the dun the happy idea of appearing in these characters this night had been suggested by the circumstance that happened in the morning colonel pembroke gave himself great credit he said for thus striking novelty even from difficulty and he rejoiced that the rascal of a weaver had sent his boy to dun him and had thus furnished him with diversion for the evening as well as the morning we are much concerned that we cannot for the advantage of posterity record any of the innumerable good things which undoubtedly were uttered by this trio even the newspapers of the day could speak only in general panegyric the probability however is that the colonel deserved the praises that were lavished upon his manner of supporting his character no man was better acquainted than himself with all those anecdotes of men of fashion which could illustrate the spendthrift system at least fifty times he had repeated and always with the same glee the reply of a great character to a creditor who upon being asked when his bond debts were likely to be paid answered on the day of judgment probably the admiration which this and similar sallies of wit have excited must have produced a strong desire in the minds of many young men of spirit to perform similar feats and though the ruin of innumerable poor creditors may be the consequence that will not surely be deemed by a certain class of reasoners worthy of a moments regret or even a moments thought persons of tender consciences may perhaps be shocked at the idea of committing injustice and cruelty by starving their creditors but they may strengthen their minds by taking an enlarged political view of the subject it is obvious that whether a hundred guineas be in the pocket of a or b the total sum of the wealth of the nation remains the same and whether the enjoyments of a be as and those of b as or whether these enjoyments be equally divided between a and bis a matter of no importance to the political arithmetician because in both cases it is obvious that the total sum of national happiness remains the same the happiness of individuals is nothing compared with the general mass and if the individual b should fancy himself illused by our political arithmetician and should take it into his head to observe that though the happiness of b is nothing to the general mass yet that it is every thing to him the politician of course takes snuff and replies that his observation is foreign to the purposethat the good of the whole society is the object in view and if b immediately accede to this position and only ask humbly whether the good of the whole be not made up of the good of the parts and whether as a part he have not some right to his share of good the dexterous logical arithmetician answers that b is totally out of the question because b is a negative quantity in the equation and if obstinate b still conceiving himself aggrieved objects to this total annihilation of himself and his interests and asks why the lot of extinction should not fall upon the debtor c or even upon the calculator himself by whatever letter of the alphabet he happens to be designated the calculator must knit his brow and answerany thing he pleasesexcept i dont knowfor this is a phrase below the dignity of a philosopher this argument is produced not as a statement of what is really the case but as a popular argument against political sophistry colonel pembroke notwithstanding his success at mrs yorks masquerade in his character of a spendthrift could not by his utmost wit and address satisfy or silence his impertinent tailor mr close absolutely refused to give further credit without valuable consideration and the colonel was compelled to pass his bond for the whole sum which was claimed which was fifty pounds more than was strictly due in order to compound with the tailor for the want of ready money when the bond was fairly signed sealed and delivered mr close produced the poor weavers bill colonel pembroke said he i have a trifling bill herei am really ashamed to speak to you about such a triflebut as we are settling all accountsand as this white the weaver is so wretchedly poor that he or some of his family are with me every day of my life dunning me to get me to speak about their little demand who is this white said mr pembroke you recollect the elegant waistcoat pattern of which you afterwards bought up the whole piece lest it should become common and vulgarthis white was the weaver from whom we got it bless me why thats two years ago i thought that fellow was paid long ago no indeed i wish he had been for he has been the torment of my life this many a monthi never saw people so eager about their money but why do you employ such miserable greedy creatures what can you expect but to be dunned every hour of your life very true indeed colonel it is what i always on that principle avoid as far as possibly i can but i cant blame myself in this particular instance for this white at the time i employed him first was a very decent man and in a very good way for one of his sort but i suppose he has taken to drink for he is worth not a farthing now what business has a fellow of his sort to drink he should leave that for his betters said colonel pembroke laughing drinkings too great a pleasure for a weaver the drunken rascals money is safer in my hands tell him than in his own the tailors conscience twinged him a little at this instant for he had spoken entirely at random not having the slightest grounds for his insinuation that this poor weaver had ruined himself by drunkenness upon my word sir said close retracting the man may not be a drunken fellow for any thing i know positivelyi purely surmised that might be the case from his having fallen into such distress which is no otherwise accountable for to my comprehension except we believe his own story that he has money due to him which he cannot get paid and that this has been his ruin colonel pembroke cleared his throat two or three times upon hearing this last suggestion and actually took up the weavers bill with some intention of paying it but he recollected that he should want the ready money he had in his pocket for another indispensable occasion for he was obliged to go to brookess that night so he contented his humanity by recommending it to mr close to pay white and have done with him if you let him have the money you know you can put it down to my account or make a memorandum of it at the back of the bond in short settle it as you will but let me hear no more about it i have not leisure to think of such triflesgood morning to you mr close mr close was far from having any intention of complying with the colonels request when the weavers wife called upon him after his return home he assured her that he had not seen the colour of one guinea or one farthing of colonel pembrokes money and that it was absolutely impossible that he could pay mr white till he was paid himselfthat it could not be expected he should advance money for any body out of his own pocketthat he begged he might not be pestered and dunned any more for that he really had not leisure to think of such trifles for want of this trifle of which neither the fashionable colonel nor his fashionable tailor had leisure to think the poor weaver and his whole family were reduced to the last degree of human miseryto absolute famine the man had exerted himself to the utmost to finish a pattern which had been bespoken for a tradesman who promised upon the delivery of it to pay him five guineas in hand this money he received but four guineas of it were due to his landlord for rent of his wretched garret and the remaining guinea was divided between the baker to whom an old bill was due and the apothecary to whom they were obliged to have recourse as the weaver was extremely ill they had literally nothing now to depend upon but what the wife and daughter could earn by needlework and they were known to be so miserably poor that the prudent neighbours did not like to trust them with plain work lest it should not be returned safely besides in such a dirty place as they lived in how could it be expected that they should put any work out of their hands decently clean the woman to whom the house belonged however at last procured them work from mrs carver a widow lady who she said was extremely charitable she advised anne to carry home the work as soon as it was finished and to wait to see the lady herself who might perhaps be as charitable to her as she was to many others anne resolved to take this advice but when she carried home her work to the place to which she was directed her heart almost failed her for she found mrs carver lived in such a handsome house that there was little chance of a poor girl being admitted by the servants farther than the halldoor or the kitchen the lady however happened to be just coming out of her parlour at the moment the halldoor was opened for anne and she bid her come in and show her workapproved of itcommended her industryasked her several questions about her familyseemed to be touched with compassion by annes account of their distressand after paying what she had charged for the work put halfaguinea into her hand and bid her call the next day when she hoped that she should be able to do something more for her this unexpected bounty and the kindness of voice and look with which it was accompanied had such an effect upon the poor girl that if she had not caught hold of a chair to support herself she would have sunk to the ground mrs carver immediately made her sit downoh madam im well quite well nowit was nothingonly surprise said she bursting into tears i beg your pardon for this foolishnessbut it is only because im weaker today than usual for want of eating for want of eating my poor child how she trembles she is weak indeed and must not leave my house in this condition mrs carver rang the bell and ordered a glass of wine but anne was afraid to drink it as she was not used to wine and as she knew that it would affect her head if she drank without eating when the lady found that she refused the wine she did not press it but insisted upon her eating something oh madam said the poor girl it is long long indeed since i have eaten so heartily and it is almost a shame for me to stay eating such dainties when my father and mother are all the while in the way they are but ill run home with the halfguinea and tell them how good you have been and they will be so joyful and so thankful to you my mother will come herself im sure with me tomorrow morningshe can thank you so much better than i can those only who have known the extreme of want can imagine the joy and gratitude with which the halfguinea was received by this poor family halfaguineacolonel pembroke spent six halfguineas this very day in a fruitshop and ten times that sum at a jewellers on seals and baubles for which he had no manner of use when anne and her mother called the next morning to thank their benefactress she was not up but her servant gave them a parcel from his mistress it contained a fresh supply of needlework a gown and some other clothes which were directed for anne the servant said that if she would call again about eight in the evening his lady would probably be able to see her and that she begged to have the work finished by that time the work was finished though with some difficulty by the appointed hour and anne dressed in her new clothes was at mrs carvers door just as the clock struck eight the old lady was alone at tea she seemed to be well pleased by annes punctuality said that she had made inquiries respecting mr and mrs white and that she heard an excellent character of them that therefore she was disposed to do every thing she could to serve them she added that she should soon part with her own maid and that perhaps anne might supply her place nothing could be more agreeable to the poor girl than this proposal her father and mother were rejoiced at the idea of seeing her so well placed and they now looked forward impatiently for the day when mrs carvers maid was to be dismissed in the mean time the old lady continued to employ anne and to make her presents sometimes of clothes and sometimes of money the money she always gave to her parents and she loved her good old lady as she always called her more for putting it in her power thus to help her father and mother than for all the rest the weavers disease had arisen from want of sufficient food from fatigue of body and anxiety of mind and he grew rapidly better now that he was relieved from want and inspired with hope mrs carver bespoke from him two pieces of waistcoating which she promised to dispose of for him most advantageously by a raffle for which she had raised subscriptions amongst her numerous acquaintance she expressed great indignation when anne told her how mr white had been ruined by persons who would not pay their just debts and when she knew that the weaver was overcharged for all his working materials because he took them upon credit she generously offered to lend them whatever ready money might be necessary which she said anne might repay at her leisure out of her wages oh madam said anne you are too good to us indeedtoo good and if you could but see into our hearts you would know that we are not ungrateful i am sure that is what you never will be my dear said the old lady at least such is my opinion of you thank you maam thank you from the bottom of my heartwe should all have been starved if it had not been for you and it is owing to you that we are so happy nowquite different creatures from what we were quite a different creature indeed you look child from what you did the first day i saw you tomorrow my own maid goes and you may come at ten oclock and i hope we shall agree very well togetheryoull find me an easy mistress and i make no doubt i shall always find you the good grateful girl you seem to be anne was impatient for the moment when she was to enter into the service of her benefactress and she lay awake half the night considering how she should ever be able to show sufficient gratitude as mrs carver had often expressed her desire to have anne look neat and smart she dressed herself as well as she possibly could and when her poor father and mother took leave of her they could not help observing as mrs carver had done the day before that anne looked quite a different creature from what she was a few weeks ago she was indeed an extremely pretty girl but we need not stop to relate all the fond praises that were bestowed upon her beauty by her partial parents her little brother john was not at home when she was going away he was at a carpenters shop in the neighbourhood mending a wheelbarrow which belonged to that goodnatured orangewoman who gave him the orange for his father anne called at the carpenters shop to take leave of her brother the woman was there waiting for her barrowshe looked earnestly at anne when she entered and then whispered to the boy is that your sisteryes said the boy and as good a sister she is as ever was born maybe so said the woman but she is not likely to be good for much long in the way she is going on now what waywhat do you mean said anne colouring violently oh you understand me well enough though you look so innocent i do not understand you in the least nowhy is not it you that i see going almost every day to that house in chiswellstreet mrs carversyes mrs carvers indeed cried the woman throwing an orangepeel from her with an air of disdaina pretty comeoff indeed as if i did not know her name and all about her as well as you do do you said anne then i am sure you know one of the best women in the world the woman looked still more earnestly than before in annes countenance and then taking hold of both her hands exclaimed you poor young creature what are you about i do believe you dont know what you are aboutif you do you are the greatest cheat i ever looked in the face long as ive lived in this cheating world you frighten my sister said the boy do pray tell her what you mean at once for look how pale she turns so much the better for now i have good hope of her then to tell you all at onceno matter how i frighten her its for her goodthis mrs carver as you call her is only mrs carver when she wants to pass upon such as you for a good woman to pass for a good woman repeated anne with indignation oh she is she is a good womanyou do not know her as i do i know her a great deal better i tell you if you choose not to believe me go your waysgo to your ruingo to your shamego to your graveas hundreds have gone by the same road before you your mrs carver keeps two houses and one of them is a bad houseand thats the house youll soon go to if you trust to her now you know the whole truth the poor girl was shocked so much that for several minutes she could neither speak nor think as soon as she had recovered sufficient presence of mind to consider what she should do she declared that she would that instant go home and put on her rags again and return to the wicked mrs carver all the clothes she had given her but what will become of us allshe has lent my father moneya great deal of money how can he pay heroh i will pay her alli will go into some honest service now i am well and strong enough to do any sort of hard work and god knows i am willing full of these resolutions anne hurried home intending to tell her father and mother all that had happened but they were neither of them within she flew to the mistress of the house who had first recommended her to mrs carver and reproached her in the most moving terms which the agony of her mind could suggest her landlady listened to her with astonishment either real or admirably well affecteddeclared that she knew nothing more of mrs carver but that she lived in a large fine house and that she had been very charitable to some poor people in moorfieldsthat she bore the best of charactersand that if nothing could be said against her but by an orangewoman there was no great reason to believe such scandal anne now began to think that the whole of what she had heard might be a falsehood or a mistake one moment she blamed herself for so easily suspecting a person who had shown her so much kindness but the next minute the emphatic words and warning looks of the woman recurred to her mind and though they were but the words and looks of an orangewoman she could not help dreading that there was some truth in them the clock struck ten whilst she was in this uncertainty the woman of the house urged her to go without farther delay to mrs carvers who would undoubtedly be displeased by any want of punctuality but anne wished to wait for the return of her father and mother they will not be back either of them these three hours for your mother is gone to the other end of the town about that old bill of colonel pembrokes and your father is gone to buy some silk for weavinghe told me he should not be home before three oclock notwithstanding these remonstrances anne persisted in her resolution she took off the clothes which she had received from mrs carver and put on those which she had been used to wear her mother was much surprised when she came in to see her in this condition and no words can describe her grief when she heard the cause of this change she blamed herself severely for not having made inquiries concerning mrs carver before she had suffered her daughter to accept of any presents from her and she wept bitterly when she recollected the money which this woman had lent her husband she will throw him into jail i am sure she willwe shall be worse off a thousand times than ever we were in our worst days the work that is in the loom by which he hoped to get so much is all for her and it will be left upon our hands now and how are we to pay the woman of this house for the lodgingsoh i see it all coming upon us at once continued the poor woman wringing her hands if that colonel pembroke would but let us have our ownbut there ive been all the morning hunting him out and at last when i did see him he only swore and said we were all a family of duns or some such nonsense and then he called after me from the top of his fine stairs just to say that he had ordered close the tailor to pay us and when i went to him there was no satisfaction to be got from himhis shop was full of customers and he hustled me away giving me for answer that when colonel pembroke paid him he would pay us and no sooner ah these purseproud tradesfolk and these sparks of fashion what do they know of all we suffer what do they care for usit is not for charity i ask any of themonly for what my own husband has justly earned and hardly toiled for too and this i cannot get out of their hands if i could we might defy this wicked womanbut now we are laid under her feet and she will trample us to death in the midst of these lamentations annes father came in when he learned the cause of them he stood for a moment in silence then snatched from his daughters hand the bundle of clothes which she had prepared to return to mrs carver give them to me i will go to this woman myself cried he with indignation anne shall never more set her foot within those doors dear father cried anne stopping him as he went out of the door perhaps it is all a mistake do pray inquire from somebody else before you speak to mrs carvershe looks so good she has been so kind to me i cannot believe that she is wicked do pray inquire of a great many people before you knock at the door he promised that he would do all his daughter desired with most impatient anxiety they waited for his return the time of his absence appeared insupportably long and they formed new fears and new conjectures every instant every time they heard a footstep upon the stairs they ran out to see who it was sometimes it was the landladysometimes the lodgers or their visitorsat last came the person they longed to see but the moment they beheld him all their fears were confirmed he was pale as death and his lips trembled with convulsive motion he walked directly up to his loom and without speaking one syllable began to cut the unfinished work out of it what are you about my dear cried his wife consider what you are aboutthis work of yours is the only dependence we have in the world you have nothing in this world to depend upon i tell you cried he continuing to cut out the web with a hurried handyou must not depend on meyou must not depend on my worki shall never throw this shuttle more whilst i livethink of me as if i was deadtomorrow i shall be dead to youi shall be in a jail and there must lie till carried out in my coffin here take this work just as it is to our landladyshe met me on the stairs and said she must have her rent directlythat will pay herill pay all i can as for the loom thats only hiredthe silk i bought today will pay the hireill pay all my debts to the uttermost farthing as far as i am ablebut the ten guineas to that wicked woman i cannot payso i must rot in a jail dont cry anne dont cry so my good girlyoull break my heart wife if you take on so why have not we one comfort that let us go out of this world when we may or how we may we shall go out of it honest having no ones ruin to answer for having done our duty to god and man as far as we are ablemy child continued he catching anne in his arms i have you safe and i thank god for it when this poor man had thus in an incoherent manner given vent to his first feelings he became somewhat more composed and was able to relate all that had passed between him and mrs carver the inquiries which he made before he saw her sufficiently confirmed the orangewomans story and when he returned the presents which anne had unfortunately received mrs carver with all the audacity of a woman hardened in guilt avowed her purpose and her professiondeclared that whatever ignorance and innocence anne or her parents might now find it convenient to affect she was confident they had all the time perfectly understood what she was about and that she would not be cheated at last by a parcel of swindling hypocrites with horrid imprecations she then swore that if anne was kept from her she would have vengeanceand that her vengeance should know no bounds the event showed that these were not empty threatsthe very next day she sent two bailiffs to arrest annes father they met him in the street as he was going to pay the last farthing he had to the baker the wretched man in vain endeavoured to move the ear of justice by relating the simple truth mrs carver was richher victim was poor he was committed to jail and he entered his prison with the firm belief that there he must drag out the remainder of his days one faint hope remained in his wifes heartshe imagined that if she could but prevail upon colonel pembrokes servants either to obtain for her a sight of their master or if they would carry to him a letter containing an exact account of her distress he would immediately pay the fourteen pounds which had been so long due with this money she could obtain her husbands liberty and she fancied all might yet be well her son who could write a very legible hand wrote the petition ah mother said he dont hope that colonel pembroke will read ithe will tear it to pieces as he did one that i carried him before i can but try said she i cannot believe that any gentleman is so cruel and so unjusthe must and will pay us when he knows the whole truth colonel pembroke was dressing in a hurry to go to a great dinner at the crown and anchor tavern one of pembrokes gay companions had called and was in the room waiting for him it was at this inauspicious time that mrs white arrived her petition the servant at first absolutely refused to take from her hands but at last a young lad whom the colonel had lately brought from the country and who had either more natural feeling or less acquired power of equivocating than his fellows consented to carry up the petition when he should as he expected be called by his master to report the state of a favourite horse that was sick while his masters hair was dressing the lad was summoned and when the health of the horse had been anxiously inquired into the lad with country awkwardness scratched his head and laid the petition before his master sayingsir theres a poor woman below waiting for an answer and if so be what she says is true as i take it to be tis enough to break ones heart your heart my lad is not seasoned to london yet i perceive said colonel pembroke smiling why your heart will be broke a thousand times over by every beggar you meet no no i be too much of a man for that replied the groom wiping his eyes hastily with the back of his handnot such a noodle as that comes to neitherbeggars are beggars and so to be treatedbut this woman sir is no common beggar not she nor is she begging any waysonly to be paid her billso i brought it as i was coming up then sir as you are going down you may take it down again if you please cried colonel pembroke and in future sir i recommend it to you to look after your horses and to trust me to look after my own affairs the groom retreated and his master gave the poor womans petition without reading it to the hairdresser who was looking for a piece of paper to try the heat of his irons i should be pestered with bills and petitions from morning till night if i did not frighten these fellows out of the trick of bringing them to me continued colonel pembroke turning to his companion that blockhead of a groom is but just come to town he does not yet know how to drive away a dunbut hell learn they say that the american dogs did not know how to bark till they learnt it from their civilized betters colonel pembroke habitually drove away reflection and silenced the whispers of conscience by noisy declamation or sallies of wit at the bottom of the singed paper which the hairdresser left on the table the name of white was sufficiently visible white exclaimed colonel pembroke as i hope to live and breathe these whites have been this halfyear the torment of my life he started up rang the bell and gave immediate orders to his servant that these whites should never more be let in and that no more of their bills and petitions in any form whatever should be brought to him ill punish them for their insolencei wont pay them one farthing this twelvemonth and if the woman is not gone pray tell her soi bid close the tailor pay them if he has not it is no fault of mine let me not hear a syllable more about itill part with the first of you who dares to disobey me the woman is gone i believe sir said the footman it was not i let her in and i refused to bring up the letter you did right let me hear no more about the matter we shall be late at the crown and anchor i beg your pardon my dear friend for detaining you so long whilst the colonel went to his jovial meeting where he was the life and spirit of the company the poor woman returned in despair to the prison where her husband was confined we forbear to describe the horrible situation to which this family were soon reduced beyond a certain point the human heart cannot feel compassion one day as anne was returning from the prison where she had been with her father she was met by a porter who put a letter into her hands then turned down a narrow lane and was out of sight before she could inquire from whom he came when she read the letter however she could not be in doubtit came from mrs carver and contained these words you can gain nothing by your present obstinacyyou are the cause of your fathers lying in jail and of your mothers being as she is nearly starved to death you can relieve them from misery worse than death and place them in ease and comfort for the remainder of their days be assured they do not speak sincerley to you when they pretend not to wish that your compliance should put an end to their present sufferings it is you that are cruel to themit is you that are cruel to yourself and can blame nobody else you might live all your days in a house as good as mine and have a plentiful table served from one years end to another with all the dainties of the season and you might be dressed as elegantly as the most elegant lady in london which bythebye your beauty deserves and you would have servants of your own and a carriage of your own and nothing to do all day long but take your pleasure and after all what is asked of youonly to make a person happy whom half the town would envy you that would make it a study to gratify you in every wish of your heart the person alluded to you have seen and more than once when you have been talking to me of work in my parlour he is a very rich and generous gentleman if you come to chiswellstreet about six this evening you will find all i say trueif not you and yours must take the consequences coarse as the eloquence of this letter may appear anne could not read it without emotion it raised in her heart a violent contest virtue with poverty and famine were on one sideand vice with affluence love and every worldly pleasure on the other those who have been bred up in the lap of luxury whom the breath of heaven has never visited too roughly whose minds from their earliest infancy have been guarded even with more care than their persons who in the dangerous season of youth are surrounded by all that the solicitude of experienced friends and all that polished society can devise for their security are not perhaps competent to judge of the temptations by which beauty in the lower classes of life may be assailed they who have never seen a father in prison or a mother perishing for want of the absolute necessaries of lifethey who have never themselves known the cravings of famine cannot form an adequate idea of this poor girls feelings and of the temptation to which she was now exposed she weptshe hesitatedand the woman that deliberates is lost perhaps those who are the most truly virtuous of her sex will be the most disposed to feel for this poor creature who was literally half famished before her good resolutions were conquered at last she yielded to necessity at the appointed hour she was in mrs carvers house this woman received her with triumphshe supplied anne immediately with food and then hastened to deck out her victim in the most attractive manner the girl was quite passive in her hand she promised though scarcely knowing that she uttered the words to obey the instructions that were given to her and she suffered herself without struggle or apparent emotion to be led to destruction she appeared quite insensiblebut at last she was roused from this state of stupefaction by the voice of a person with whom she found herself alone the stranger who was a young and gay gentleman pleasing both in his person and manners attempted by every possible means to render himself agreeable to her to raise her spirits and calm her apprehensions by degrees his manner changed from levity to tenderness he represented to her that he was not a brutal wretch who could be gratified by any triumph in which the affections of the heart have no share and he assured her that in any connexion which she might be prevailed upon to form with him she should be treated with honour and delicacy touched by his manner of speaking and overpowered by the sense of her own situation anne could not reply one single word to all he saidbut burst into an agony of tears and sinking on her knees before him exclaimed save me save me from myselfrestore me to my parents before they have reason to hate me the gentleman seemed to be somewhat in doubt whether this was acting or nature but he raised anne from the ground and placed her upon a seat beside him am i to understand then that i have been deceived and that our present meeting is against your own consent no i cannot say thatoh how i wish that i couldi did wrong very wrong to come herebut i repenti was halfstarvedi have a father in jaili thought i could set him free with the moneybut i will not pretend to be better than i ami believe i thought that beside relieving my father i should live all my days without ever more knowing what distress isand i thought i should be happybut now i have changed my mindi never could be happy with a bad consciencei knowby what i have felt this last hour her voice failed and she sobbed for some moments without being able to speak the gentleman who now was convinced that she was quite artless and thoroughly in earnest was struck with compassion but his compassion was not unmixed with other feelings and he had hopes that by treating her with tenderness he should in time make it her wish to live with him as his mistress he was anxious to hear what her former way of life had been and she related at his request the circumstances by which she and her parents had been reduced to such distress his countenance presently showed how much he was interested in her storyhe grew red and palehe started from his seat and walked up and down the room in great agitation till at last when she mentioned the name of colonel pembroke he stopped short and exclaimed i am the mani am colonel pembrokei am that unjust unfeeling wretch how often in the bitterness of your hearts you must have cursed me oh nomy father when he was at the worst never cursed you and i am sure he will have reason to bless you now if you send his daughter back again to him such as she was when she left him that shall be done said colonel pembroke and in doing so i make some sacrifice and have some merit it is time i should make some reparation for the evils i have occasioned continued he taking a handful of guineas from his pocket but first let me pay my just debts my poor father exclaimed anne tomorrow he will be out of prison i will go with you to the prison where your father is confinedi will force myself to behold all the evils i have occasioned colonel pembroke went to the prison and he was so much struck by the scene that he not only relieved the misery of this family but in two months afterwards his debts were paid his racehorses sold and all his expenses regulated so as to render him ever afterwards truly independent he no longer spent his days like many young men of fashion either in dreading or in damning duns edgeworthstown the end
