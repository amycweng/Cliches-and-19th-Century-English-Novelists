london chapman and hall piccadilly the right of translation is reserved lotta schmidt illustration text decoration lotta schmidt as all the world knows the old fortifications of vienna have been pulled down the fortifications which used to surround the centre or kernel of the city and the vast spaces thus thrown open and forming a broad ring in the middle of the town have not as yet been completely filled up with those new buildings and gardens which are to be there and which when there will join the outside city and the inside city together so as to make them into one homogeneous whole the work however is going on and if the war which has come and passed has not swallowed everything appertaining to austria into its maw the ugly remnants of destruction will be soon carted away and the old glacis will be made bright with broad pavements and gilded railings and well built lofty mansions and gardens beautiful with shrubs and beautiful with turf also if austrian patience can make turf to grow beneath an austrian sky on an evening of september when there was still something left of daylight at eight oclock two girls were walking together in the burgplatz or large open space which lies between the city palace of the emperor and the gate which passes thence from the old town out to the new town here at present stand two bronze equestrian statues one of the archduke charles and the other of prince eugene and they were standing there also both of them when these two girls were walking round them but that of the prince had not as yet been uncovered for the public there was coming a great gala day in the city emperors and empresses archdukes and grand dukes with their archduchesses and grand duchesses and princes and ministers were to be there and the new statue of prince eugene was to be submitted to the art critics of the world there was very much thought at vienna of the statue in those days well since that the statue has been submitted to the art critics and henceforward it will be thought of as little as any other huge bronze figure of a prince on horseback a very ponderous prince is poised in an impossible position on an enormous dray horse but yet the thing is grand and vienna is so far a finer city in that it possesses the new equestrian statue of prince eugene there will be such a crowd lotta said the elder of the two girls that i will not attempt it besides we shall have plenty of time for seeing it afterwards oh yes said the younger girl whose name was lotta schmidt of course we shall all have enough of the old prince for the rest of our lives but i should like to see the grand people sitting up there on the benches and there will be something nice in seeing the canopy drawn up i think i will come herr crippel has said that he would bring me and get me a place i thought lotta you had determined to have nothing more to say to herr crippel i dont know what you mean by that i like herr crippel very much and he plays beautifully surely a girl may know a man old enough to be her father without having him thrown in her teeth as her lover not when the man old enough to be her father has asked her to be his wife twenty times as herr crippel has asked you herr crippel would not give up his holiday afternoon to you if he thought it was to be for nothing there i think you are wrong marie i believe herr crippel likes to have me with him simply because every gentleman likes to have a lady on such a day as that of course it is better than being alone i dont suppose he will say a word to me except to tell me who the people are and to give me a glass of beer when it is over it may be as well to explain at once before we go any further that herr crippel was a player on the violin and that he led the musicians in the orchestra of the great beer hall in the volksgarten let it not be thought that because herr crippel exercised his art in a beer hall therefore he was a musician of no account no one will think so who has once gone to a vienna beer hall and listened to such music as is there provided for the visitors the two girls marie weber and lotta schmidt belonged to an establishment in which gloves were sold in the graben and now having completed their work for the day and indeed their work for the week for it was saturday evening had come out for such recreation as the evening might afford them and on behalf of these two girls as to one of whom at least i am much interested i must beg my english readers to remember that manners and customs differ much in vienna from those which prevail in london were i to tell of two london shop girls going out into the streets after their days work to see what friends and what amusement the fortune of the evening might send to them i should be supposed to be speaking of young women as to whom it would be better that i should be silent but these girls in vienna were doing simply that which all their friends would expect and wish them to do that they should have some amusement to soften the rigours of long days of work was recognised to be necessary and music beer dancing with the conversation of young men are thought in vienna to be the natural amusements of young women and in vienna are believed to be innocent the viennese girls are almost always attractive in their appearance without often coming up to our english ideas of prettiness sometimes they do fully come up to our english idea of beauty they are generally dark tall light in figure with bright eyes which are however very unlike the bright eyes of italy and which constantly remind the traveller that his feet are carrying him eastward in europe but perhaps the peculiar characteristic in their faces which most strikes a stranger is a certain look of almost fierce independence as though they had recognised the necessity and also acquired the power of standing alone and of protecting themselves i know no young women by whom the assistance of a mans arm seems to be so seldom required as the young women of vienna they almost invariably dress well generally preferring black or colours that are very dark and they wear hats that are i believe of hungarian origin very graceful in form but which are peculiarly calculated to add something to that assumed savageness of independence of which i have spoken both the girls who were walking in the burgplatz were of the kind that i have attempted to describe marie weber was older and not so tall and less attractive than her friend but as her position in life was fixed and as she was engaged to marry a cutter of diamonds i will not endeavour to interest the reader specially in her personal appearance lotta schmidt was essentially a viennese pretty girl of the special viennese type she was tall and slender but still had none of that appearance of feminine weakness which is so common among us with girls who are tall and slim she walked as though she had plenty both of strength and courage for all purposes of life without the assistance of any extraneous aid her hair was jet black and very plentiful and was worn in long curls which were brought round from the back of her head over her shoulders her eyes were blue dark blue and were clear and deep rather than bright her nose was well formed but somewhat prominent and made you think at the first glance of the tribes of israel but yet no observer of the physiognomy of races would believe for half a moment that lotta schmidt was a jewess indeed the type of form which i am endeavouring to describe is in truth as far removed from the jewish type as it is from the italian and it has no connexion whatever with that which we ordinarily conceive to be the german type but overriding everything in her personal appearance in her form countenance and gait was that singular fierceness of independence as though she were constantly asserting that she would never submit herself to the inconvenience of feminine softness and yet lotta schmidt was a simple girl with a girls heart looking forward to find all that she was to have of human happiness in the love of some man and expecting and hoping to do her duty as a married woman and the mother of a family nor would she have been at all coy in saying as much had the subject of her lifes prospects become matter of conversation in any company no more than one lad would be coy in saying that he hoped to be a doctor or another in declaring a wish for the army when the two girls had walked twice round the hoarding within which stood all those tons of bronze which were intended to represent prince eugene they crossed over the centre of the burgplatz passed under the other equestrian statue and came to the gate leading into the volksgarten there just at the entrance they were overtaken by a man with a fiddle case under his arm who raised his hat to them and then shook hands with both of them ladies he said are you coming in to hear a little music we will do our best herr crippel always does well said marie weber there is never any doubt when one comes to hear him marie why do you flatter him said lotta i do not say half to his face that you said just now behind his back said marie and what did she say of me behind my back said herr crippel he smiled as he asked the question or attempted to smile but it was easy to see that he was too much in earnest he blushed up to his eyes and there was a slight trembling motion in his hands as he stood with one of them pressed upon the other as marie did not answer at the moment lotta replied for her i will tell you what i said behind your back i said that herr crippel had the firmest hand upon a bow and the surest fingers among the strings in all vienna when his mind was not wool gathering marie is not that true i do not remember anything about the wool gathering said marie i hope i shall not be wool gathering to night but i shall doubtless i shall doubtless for i shall be thinking of your judgment shall i get you seats at once there you are just before me you see i am not coward enough to fly from my critics and he placed them to sit at a little marble table not far from the front of the low orchestra in the foremost place in which he would have to take his stand many thanks herr crippel said lotta i will make sure of a third chair as a friend is coming oh a friend said he and he looked sad and all his sprightliness was gone maries friend said lotta laughing do not you know carl stobel then the musician became bright and happy again i would have got two more chairs if you would have let me one for the frauleins sake and one for his own and i will come down presently and you shall present me if you will be so very kind marie weber smiled and thanked him and declared that she should be very proud and the leader of the band went up into his place i wish he had not placed us here said lotta and why not because fritz is coming no but he is and why did you not tell me because i did not wish to be speaking of him of course you understand why i did not tell you i would rather it should seem that he came of his own account with carl ha ha carl stobel was the diamond cutter to whom marie weber was betrothed i should not have told you now only that i am disarranged by what herr crippel has done had we not better go or at least move our seats we can make any excuse afterwards no said lotta i will not seem to run away from him i have nothing to be ashamed of if i choose to keep company with fritz planken that should be nothing to herr crippel but you might have told him no i could not tell him and i am not sure fritz is coming either he said he would come with carl if he had time never mind let us be happy now if a bad time comes by and by we must make the best of it then the music began and suddenly as the first note of a fiddle was heard every voice in the great beer hall of the volksgarten became silent men sat smoking with their long beer glasses before them and women sat knitting with their long beer glasses also before them but not a word was spoken the waiters went about with silent feet but even orders for beer were not given and money was not received herr crippel did his best working with his wand as carefully and i may say as accurately as a leader in a fashionable opera house in london or paris but every now and then in the course of the piece he would place his fiddle to his shoulder and join in the performance there was hardly one there in the hall man or woman boy or girl who did not know from personal knowledge and judgment that herr crippel was doing his work very well excellent was it not said marie yes he is a musician is it not a pity he should be so bald said lotta he is not so very bald said marie i should not mind his being bald so much if he did not try to cover his old head with the side hairs if he would cut off those loose straggling locks and declare himself to be bald at once he would be ever so much better he would look to be fifty then he looks sixty now what matters his age he is forty five just for i know and he is a good man what has his goodness to do with it a great deal his old mother wants for nothing and he makes two hundred florins a month he has two shares in the summer theatre i know it bah what is all that when he will plaster his hair over his old bald head lotta i am ashamed of you but at this moment the further expression of maries anger was stopped by the entrance of the diamond cutter and as he was alone both the girls received him very pleasantly we must give lotta her due and declare that as things had gone she would much prefer now that fritz should stay away though fritz planken was as handsome a young fellow as there was in vienna and one who dressed with the best taste and danced so that no one could surpass him and could speak french and was confidential clerk at one of the largest hotels in vienna and was a young man acknowledged to be of much general importance and had moreover in plain language declared his love for lotta schmidt but lotta would not willingly give unnecessary pain to herr crippel and she was generously glad when carl stobel the diamond cutter came by himself then there was a second and third piece played and after that herr crippel came down according to promise and was presented to maries lover ladies said he i hope i have not gathered wool you have surpassed yourself said lotta at wool gathering said herr crippel at sending us out of this world into another said lotta ah go into no other world but this said herr crippel lest i should not be able to follow you and then he went away again to his post before another piece had been commenced lotta saw fritz planken enter the door he stood for a moment gazing round the hall with his cane in his hand and his hat on his head looking for the party which he intended to join lotta did not say a word nor would she turn her eyes towards him she would not recognise him if it were possible to avoid it but he soon saw her and came up to the table at which they were sitting when lotta was getting the third chair for maries lover herr crippel in his gallantry had brought a fourth and now fritz occupied the chair which the musician had placed there lotta as she perceived this was sorry that it should be so she could not even dare to look up to see what effect this new arrival would have upon the leader of the band the new comer was certainly a handsome young man such a one as inflicts unutterable agonies on the hearts of the herr crippels of the world his boots shone like mirrors and fitted his feet like gloves there was something in the make and set of his trousers which herr crippel looking at them as he could not help looking at them was quite unable to understand even twenty years ago herr crippels trousers as herr crippel very well knew had never looked like that and fritz planken wore a blue frock coat with silk lining to the breast which seemed to have come from some tailor among the gods and he had on primrose gloves and round his neck a bright pink satin handkerchief joined by a ring which gave a richness of colouring to the whole thing which nearly killed herr crippel because he could not but acknowledge that the colouring was good and then the hat and when the hat was taken off for a moment then the hair perfectly black and silky as a ravens wing just waving with one curl and when fritz put up his hand and ran his fingers through his locks their richness and plenty and beauty were conspicuous to all beholders herr crippel as he saw it involuntarily dashed his hand up to his own pate and scratched his straggling lanky hairs from off his head you are coming to sperls to morrow of course said fritz to lotta now sperls is a great establishment for dancing in the leopoldstadt which is always open of a sunday evening and which lotta schmidt was in the habit of attending with much regularity it was here she had become acquainted with fritz and certainly to dance with fritz was to dance indeed lotta too was a beautiful dancer to a viennese such as lotta schmidt dancing is a thing of serious importance it was a misfortune to her to have to dance with a bad dancer as it is to a great whist player among us to sit down with a bad partner oh what she had suffered more than once when herr crippel had induced her to stand up with him yes i shall go marie you will go i do not know said marie you will make her go carl will you not said lotta she promised me yesterday as i understood said carl of course we will all be there said fritz somewhat grandly and i will give a supper for four then the music began again and the eyes of all of them became fixed upon herr crippel it was unfortunate that they should have been placed so fully before him as it was impossible that he should avoid seeing them as he stood up with his violin to his shoulder his eyes were fixed on fritz planken and fritz plankens boots and coat and hat and hair and as he drew his bow over the strings he was thinking of his own boots and of his own hair fritz was sitting leaning forward in his chair so that he could look up into lottas face and he was playing with a little amber headed cane and every now and then he whispered a word herr crippel could hardly play a note in very truth he was wool gathering his hand became unsteady and every instrument was more or less astray your old friend is making a mess of it to night said fritz to lotta i hope he has not taken a glass too much of schnapps he never does anything of the kind said lotta angrily he never did such a thing in his life he is playing awfully bad said fritz i never heard him play better in my life than he has played to night said lotta his hand is tired he is getting old said fritz then lotta moved her chair and drew herself back and was determined that marie and carl should see that she was angry with her young lover in the meantime the piece of music had been finished and the audience had shown their sense of the performers inferiority by withdrawing those plaudits which they were so ready to give when they were pleased after this some other musician led for awhile and then herr crippel had to come forward to play a solo and on this occasion the violin was not to be his instrument he was a great favourite among the lovers of music in vienna not only because he was good at the fiddle and because with his bow in his hand he could keep a band of musicians together but also as a player on the zither it was not often now a days that he would take his zither to the music hall in the volksgarten for he would say that he had given up that instrument that he now played it only in private that it was not fit for a large hall as a single voice the scraping of a foot would destroy its music and herr crippel was a man who had his fancies and his fantasies and would not always yield to entreaty but occasionally he would send his zither down to the public hall and in the programme for this evening there had been put forth that herr crippels zither would be there and that herr crippel would perform and now the zither was brought forward and a chair was put for the zitherist and herr crippel stood for a moment behind his chair and bowed lotta glanced up at him and could see that he was very pale she could even see that the perspiration stood upon his brow she knew that he was trembling and that he would have given almost his zither itself to be quit of his promised performance for that night but she knew also that he would make the attempt what the zither said fritz he will break down as sure as he is a living man let us hope not said carl stobel i love to hear him play the zither better than anything said lotta it used to be very good said fritz but everybody says he has lost his touch when a man has the slightest feeling of nervousness he is done for the zither h sh let him have his chance at any rate said marie reader did you ever hear the zither when played as it is sometimes played in vienna it combines all the softest notes of the human voice it sings to you of love and then wails to you of disappointed love till it fills you with a melancholy from which there is no escaping from which you never wish to escape it speaks to you as no other instrument ever speaks and reveals to you with wonderful eloquence the sadness in which it delights it produces a luxury of anguish a fulness of the satisfaction of imaginary woe a realisation of the mysterious delights of romance which no words can ever thoroughly supply while the notes are living while the music is still in the air the ear comes to covet greedily every atom of tone which the instrument will produce so that the slightest extraneous sound becomes an offence the notes sink and sink so low and low with their soft sad wail of delicious woe that the listener dreads that something will be lost in the struggle of listening there seems to come some lethargy on his sense of hearing which he fears will shut out from his brain the last lowest sweetest strain the very pearl of the music for which he has been watching with all the intensity of prolonged desire and then the zither is silent and there remains a fond memory together with a deep regret herr crippel seated himself on his stool and looked once or twice round about upon the room almost with dismay then he struck his zither uncertainly weakly and commenced the prelude of his piece but lotta thought that she had never heard so sweet a sound when he paused after a few strokes there was a noise of applause in the room of applause intended to encourage by commemorating past triumphs the musician looked again away from his music to his audience and his eyes caught the eyes of the girl he loved and his gaze fell also upon the face of the handsome well dressed young adonis who was by her side he herr crippel the musician could never make himself look like that he could make no slightest approach to that outward triumph but then he could play the zither and fritz planken could only play with his cane he would do what he could he would play his best he had once almost resolved to get up and declare that he was too tired that evening to do justice to his instrument but there was an insolence of success about his rivals hat and trousers which spirited him on to the fight he struck his zither again and they who understood him and his zither knew that he was in earnest the old men who had listened to him for the last twenty years declared that he had never played as he played on that night at first he was somewhat bolder somewhat louder than was his wont as though he were resolved to go out of his accustomed track but after awhile he gave that up that was simply the effect of nervousness and was continued only while the timidity remained present with him but he soon forgot everything but his zither and his desire to do it justice the attention of all present soon became so close that you might have heard a pin fall even fritz sat perfectly still with his mouth open and forgot to play with his cane lottas eyes were quickly full of tears and before long they were rolling down her cheeks herr crippel though he did not know that he looked at her was aware that it was so then came upon them all there an ecstasy of delicious sadness as i have said before every ear was struggling that no softest sound might escape unheard and then at last the zither was silent and no one could have marked the moment when it had ceased to sing for a few moments there was perfect silence in the room and the musician still kept his seat with his face turned upon his instrument he knew well that he had succeeded that his triumph had been complete and every moment that the applause was suspended was an added jewel to his crown but it soon came the loud shouts of praise the ringing bravos the striking of glasses his own name repeated from all parts of the hall the clapping of hands the sweet sound of womens voices and the waving of white handkerchiefs herr crippel stood up bowed thrice wiped his face with a handkerchief and then sat down on a stool in the corner of the orchestra i dont know much about his being too old said carl stobel nor i either said lotta that is what i call music said marie weber he can play the zither certainly said fritz but as to the violin it is more doubtful he is excellent with both with both said lotta angrily soon after that the party got up to leave the hall and as they went out they encountered herr crippel you have gone beyond yourself to night said marie and we wish you joy oh no it was pretty good was it with the zither it depends mostly on the atmosphere whether it is hot or cold or wet or dry or on i knew not what it is an accident if one plays well good night to you good night lotta good night sir and he took off his hat and bowed bowed as it were expressly to fritz planken herr crippel said lotta one word with you and she dropped behind from fritz and returned to the musician herr crippel will you meet me at sperls to morrow night at sperls no i do not go to sperls any longer lotta you told me that maries friend was coming to night but you did not tell me of your own never mind what i told you or did not tell you herr crippel will you come to sperls to morrow no you would not dance with me and i should not care to see you dance with anyone else but i will dance with you and planken will be there yes fritz will be there he is always there i cannot help that no lotta i will not go to sperls i will tell you a little secret at forty five one is too old for sperls there are men there every sunday over fifty over sixty i am sure they are men different in their ways of life from me my dear no i will not go to sperls when will you come and see my mother lotta promised that she would go and see the frau crippel before long and then tripped off and joined her party stobel and marie had walked on while fritz remained a little behind for lotta did you ask him to come to sperls to morrow he said to be sure i did was that nice of you lotta why not nice nice or not i did it why should not i ask him if i please because i thought i was to have the pleasure of entertaining you that it was a little party of my own very well herr planken said lotta drawing herself a little away from him if a friend of mine is not welcome at your little party i certainly shall not join it myself but lotta does not everyone know what it is that crippel wishes of you there is no harm in his wishing my friends tell me that i am very foolish not to give him what he wishes but i still have the chance oh yes no doubt you still have the chance herr crippel is a very good man he is the best son in the world and he makes two hundred florins a month oh if that is to count of course it is to count why should it not count would the princess theresa have married the other day if the young prince had had no income to support her you can do as you please lotta yes i can do as i please certainly i suppose adela bruhl will be at sperls to morrow i should say so certainly i hardly ever knew her to miss her sunday evening nor i i too am fond of dancing very i delight in dancing but i am not a slave to sperls and then i do not care to dance with everyone adela bruhl dances very well said fritz that is as one may think she ought to for she begins at ten and goes on till two always if there is no one nice for dancing she puts up with some one that is not nice but all that is nothing to me nothing i should say lotta nothing in the world but this is something last sunday you danced three times with adela did i i did not count i counted it is my business to watch those things if you are to be ever anything to me fritz i will not pretend that i am indifferent i am not indifferent i care very much about it fritz if you dance to morrow with adela you will not dance with me again either then or ever and having uttered this threat she ran on and found marie who had just reached the door of the house in which they both lived fritz as he walked home by himself was in doubt as to the course which it would be his duty as a man to pursue in reference to the lady whom he loved he had distinctly heard that lady ask an old admirer of hers to go to sperls and dance with her and yet within ten minutes afterwards she had peremptorily commanded him not to dance with another girl now fritz planken had a very good opinion of himself as he was well entitled to have and was quite aware that other pretty girls besides lotta schmidt were within his reach he did not receive two hundred florins a month as did herr crippel but then he was five and twenty instead of five and forty and in the matter of money too he was doing pretty well he did love lotta schmidt it would not be easy for him to part with her but she too loved him as he told himself and she would hardly push matters to extremities at any rate he would not submit to a threat he would dance with adela bruhl at sperls he thought at least that when the time should come he would find it well to dance with her sperls dancing saloon in the tabor strasse is a great institution at vienna it is open always of a sunday evening and dancing there commences at ten and is continued till two or three oclock in the morning there are two large rooms in one of which the dancers dance and in the other the dancers and visitors who do not dance eat and drink and smoke continually but the most wonderful part of sperls establishment is this that there is nothing there to offend anyone girls dance and men smoke and there is eating and drinking and everybody is as well behaved as though there was a protecting phalanx of dowagers sitting round the walls of the saloon there are no dowagers though there may probably be a policeman somewhere about the place to a stranger it is very remarkable that there is so little of what we call flirting almost none of it it would seem that to the girls dancing is so much a matter of business that here at sperls they can think of nothing else to mind their steps and at the same time their dresses lest they should be trod upon to keep full pace with the music to make all the proper turns at every proper time and to have the foot fall on the floor at the exact instant all this is enough without further excitement you will see a girl dancing with a man as though the man were a chair or a stick or some necessary piece of furniture she condescends to use his services but as soon as the dance is over she sends him away she hardly speaks a word to him if a word she has come there to dance and not to talk unless indeed like marie weber and lotta schmidt she has a recognised lover there of her very own at about half past ten marie and lotta entered the saloon and paid their kreutzers and sat themselves down on seats in the further saloon from which through open archways they could see the dancers neither carl nor fritz had come as yet and the girls were quite content to wait it was to be presumed that they would be there before the men and they both understood that the real dancing was not commenced early in the evening it might be all very well for such as adela bruhl to dance with anyone who came at ten oclock but lotta schmidt would not care to amuse herself after that fashion as to marie she was to be married after another week and of course she would dance with no one but carl stobel look at her said lotta pointing with her foot to a fair girl very pretty but with hair somewhat untidy who at this moment was waltzing in the other room that lad is a waiter from the minden hotel i know him she would dance with anyone i suppose she likes dancing and there is no harm in the boy said marie no there is no harm and if she likes it i do not begrudge it her see what red hands she has she is of that complexion said marie yes she is of that complexion all over look at her face at any rate she might have better shoes on did you ever see anybody so untidy she is very pretty said marie yes she is pretty there is no doubt she is pretty she is not a native here her people are from munich do you know marie i think girls are always thought more of in other countries than in their own soon after this carl and fritz came in together and fritz as he passed across the end of the first saloon spoke a word or two to adela lotta saw this but determined that she would take no offence at so small a matter fritz need not have stopped to speak but his doing so might be all very well at any rate if she did quarrel with him she would quarrel on a plain intelligible ground within two minutes carl and marie were dancing and fritz had asked lotta to stand up i will wait a little said she i never like to begin much before eleven as you please said fritz and he sat down in the chair which marie had occupied then he played with his cane and as he did so his eyes followed the steps of adela bruhl she dances very well said lotta h m m yes fritz did not choose to bestow any strong praise on adelas dancing yes fritz she does dance well very well indeed and she is never tired if you ask me whether i like her style i cannot quite say that i do it is not what we do here not exactly she has lived in vienna since she was a child it is in the blood then i suppose look at her fair hair all blowing about she is not like one of us oh no she is not that she is very pretty i quite admit said lotta those soft gray eyes are delicious is it not a pity she has no eyebrows but she has eyebrows ah you have been closer than i and you have seen them i have never danced with her and i cannot see them of course they are there more or less after a while the dancing ceased and adela bruhl came up into the supper room passing the seats on which fritz and lotta were sitting are you not going to dance fritz she said with a smile as she passed them go go said lotta why do you not go she has invited you no she has not invited me she spoke to us both she did not speak to me for my name is not fritz i do not see how you can help going when she asked you so prettily i shall be in plenty of time presently will you dance now lotta they are going to begin a waltz and we will have a quadrille afterwards no herr planken i will not dance just now herr planken is it you want to quarrel with me then lotta i do not want to be one of two i will not be one of two adela bruhl is very pretty and i advise you to go to her i was told only yesterday her father can give her fifteen hundred florins of fortune for me i have no father but you may have a husband to morrow yes that is true and a good one oh such a good one what do you mean by that you go and dance with adela bruhl and you shall see what i mean fritz had some idea in his own mind more or less clearly developed that his fate as regarded lotta schmidt now lay in his own hands he undoubtedly desired to have lotta for his own he would have married her there and then at that moment had it been possible he had quite made up his mind that he preferred her much to adela bruhl though adela bruhl had fifteen hundred florins but he did not like to endure tyranny even from lotta and he did not know how to escape the tyranny otherwise than by dancing with adela he paused a moment swinging his cane endeavouring to think how he might best assert his manhood and yet not offend the girl he loved but he found that to assert his manhood was now his first duty well lotta he said since you are so cross with me i will ask adela to dance and in two minutes he was spinning round the room with adela bruhl in his arms certainly she dances very well said lotta smiling to marie who had now come back to her seat very well said marie who was out of breath and so does he beautifully said marie is it not a pity that i should have lost such a partner for ever lotta it is true look here marie there is my hand upon it i will never dance with him again never never never why was he so hard upon herr crippel last night was he hard upon herr crippel he said that herr crippel was too old to play the zither too old some people are too young to understand i shall go home i shall not stay to sup with you to night lotta you must stay for supper i will not sup at his table i have quarrelled with him it is all over fritz planken is as free as the air for me lotta do not say anything in a hurry at any rate do not do anything in a hurry i do not mean to do anything at all it is simply this i do not care very much for fritz after all i dont think i ever did it is all very well to wear your clothes nicely but if that is all what does it come to if he could play the zither now there are other things except playing the zither they say he is a good book keeper i dont like book keeping he has to be at his hotel from eight in the morning till eleven at night you know best i am not so sure of that i wish i did know best but i never saw such a girl as you are how you change it was only yesterday you scolded me because i did not wish to be the wife of your dear friend crippel herr crippel is a very good man you go away with your good man you have got a good man of your own he is standing there waiting for you like a gander on one leg he wants you to dance go away then marie did go away and lotta was left alone by herself she certainly had behaved badly to fritz and she was aware of it she excused herself to herself by remembering that she had never yet given fritz a promise she was her own mistress and had as yet a right to do what she pleased with herself he had asked her for her love and she had not told him that he should not have it that was all herr crippel had asked her a dozen times and she had at last told him definitely positively that there was no hope for him herr crippel of course would not ask her again so she told herself but if there was no such person as herr crippel in all the world she would have nothing more to do with fritz planken nothing more to do with him as a lover he had given her fair ground for a quarrel and she would take advantage of it then as she sat still while they were dancing she closed her eyes and thought of the zither and of the zitherist she remained alone for a long time the musicians in vienna will play a waltz for twenty minutes and the same dancers will continue to dance almost without a pause and then almost immediately afterwards there was a quadrille fritz who was resolved to put down tyranny stood up with adela for the quadrille also i am so glad said lotta to herself i will wait till this is over and then i will say good night to marie and will go home three or four men had asked her to dance but she had refused she would not dance to night at all she was inclined she thought to be a little serious and would go home at last fritz returned to her and bade her come to supper he was resolved to see how far his mode of casting off tyranny might be successful so he approached her with a smile and offered to take her to his table as though nothing had happened my friend she said your table is laid for four and the places will all be filled the table is laid for five said fritz it is one too many i shall sup with my friend herr crippel herr crippel is not here is he not ah me then i shall be alone and i must go to bed supperless thank you no herr planken and what will marie say i hope she will enjoy the nice dainties you will give her marie is all right maries fortune is made woe is me my fortune is to seek there is one thing certain it is not to be found here in this room then fritz turned on his heel and went away and as he went lotta saw the figure of a man as he made his way slowly and hesitatingly into the saloon from the outer passage he was dressed in a close frock coat and had on a hat of which she knew the shape as well as she did the make of her own gloves if he has not come after all she said to herself then she turned herself a little round and drew her chair somewhat into an archway so that herr crippel should not see her readily the other four had settled themselves at their table marie having said a word of reproach to lotta as she passed now on a sudden she got up from her seat and crossed to her friend herr crippel is here she said of course he is here said lotta but you did not expect him ask fritz if i did not say i would sup with herr crippel you ask him but i shall not all the same do not say a word i shall steal away when nobody is looking the musician came wandering up the room and had looked into every corner before he had even found the supper table at which the four were sitting and then he did not see lotta he took off his hat as he addressed marie and asked some questions as to the absent one she is waiting for you somewhere herr crippel said fritz as he filled adelas glass with wine for me said herr crippel as he looked round no she does not expect me and in the meantime lotta had left her seat and was hurrying away to the door there there said marie you will be too late if you do not run then herr crippel did run and caught lotta as she was taking her hat from the old woman who had the girls hats and shawls in charge near the door what herr crippel you at sperls when you told me expressly in so many words that you would not come that is not behaving well to me certainly what my coming is that behaving bad no but why did you say you would not come when i asked you you have come to meet some one who is it you lotta you and yet you refused me when i asked you well and now you are here what are you going to do you will not dance i will dance with you if you will put up with me no i will not dance i am too old i have given it up i shall come to sperls no more after this dancing is a folly lotta you are laughing at me now very well if you like you may have it so by this time he had brought her back into the room and was walking up and down the length of the saloon with her but it is no use our walking about here she said i was just going home and now if you please i will go not yet lotta yes now if you please but why are you not supping with them because it did not suit me you see there are four five is a foolish number for a supper party will you sup with me lotta she did not answer him at once lotta he said if you sup with me now you must sup with me always how shall it be always no i am very hungry now but i do not want supper always i cannot sup with you always herr crippel but you will to night yes to night then it shall be always and the musician marched up to a table and threw his hat down and ordered such a supper that lotta schmidt was frightened and when presently carl stobel and marie weber came up to their table for fritz planken did not come near them again that evening herr crippel bowed courteously to the diamond cutter and asked him when he was to be married marie says it shall be next sunday said carl and i will be married the sunday afterwards said herr crippel yes and there is my wife and he pointed across the table with both his hands to lotta schmidt herr crippel how can you say that said lotta is it not true my dear in fourteen days no certainly not it is out of the question but nevertheless what herr crippel said came true and on the next sunday but one he took lotta schmidt home to his house as his wife it was all because of the zither lotta said to her old mother in law if he had not played the zither that night i should not have been here now the adventures of fred pickering illustration text decoration the adventures of fred pickering there was something almost grand in the rash courage with which fred pickering married his young wife and something quite grand in her devotion in marrying him she had not a penny in the world and he when he married her had two hundred and fifty pounds and no profession she was the daughter of parents whom she had never seen and had been brought up by the kindness of an aunt who died when she was eighteen distant friends then told her that it was her duty to become a governess but fred pickering intervened and mary crofts became mary pickering when she was nineteen years old fred himself our hero was six years older and should have known better and have conducted his affairs with more wisdom his father had given him a good education and had articled him to an attorney at manchester while at manchester he had written three or four papers in different newspapers and had succeeded in obtaining admission for a poem in the free trader a manchester monthly magazine which was expected to do great things as the literary production of lancashire these successes joined no doubt to the natural bent of his disposition turned him against the law and when he was a little more than twenty five having then been four years in the office of the manchester attorney he told his father that he did not like the profession chosen for him and that he must give it up at that time he was engaged to marry mary crofts but of this fact he did not tell his father mr pickering who was a stern man one not given at any time to softnesses with his children when so informed by his son simply asked him what were his plans fred replied that he looked forward to a literary career that he hoped to make literature his profession his father assured him that he was a silly fool fred replied that on that subject he had an opinion of his own by which he intended to be guided old pickering then declared that in such circumstances he should withdraw all pecuniary assistance and young pickering upon this wrote an ungracious epistle in which he expressed himself quite ready to take upon himself the burden of his own maintenance there was one and only one further letter from his father in which he told his son that the allowance made to him would be henceforth stopped then the correspondence between fred and the ex governor as mary used to call him was brought to a close most unfortunately there died at this time an old maiden aunt who left four hundred pounds a piece to twenty nephews and nieces of whom fred pickering was one the possession of this sum of money strengthened him in his rebellion against his father had he had nothing on which to begin he might probably even yet have gone to the old house at home and have had something of a fatted calf killed for him in spite of the ungraciousness of his letter as it was he was reliant on the resources which fortune had sent to him thinking that they would suffice till he had made his way to a beginning of earning money he thought it all over for full half an hour and then came to a decision he would go to mary his mary to mary who was about to enter the family of a very vulgar tradesman as governess to six young children with a salary of twenty five pounds per annum and ask her to join him in throwing all prudence to the wind he did go to mary and mary at last consented to be as imprudent as himself and she consented without any of that confidence which animated him she consented simply because he asked her to do so knowing that she was doing a thing so rash that no father or mother would have permitted it fred she had said half laughing as she spoke i am afraid we shall starve if we do starving is bad said fred i quite admit that but there are worse things than starving for you to be a governess at mrs boullems is worse for me to write lawyers letters all full of lies is worse of course we may come to grief i dare say we shall come to grief perhaps we shall suffer awfully be very hungry and very cold i am quite willing to make the worst of it suppose that we die in the street even that the chance of that with the chance of success on the other side is better than mrs boullems it always seems to me that people are too much afraid of being starved something to eat and drink is comfortable said mary i dont say that it is essential if you will dare the consequences with me i will gladly dare them with you said fred with a whole rhapsody of love in his eyes mary had not been proof against this she had returned the rhapsody of his eyes with a glance of her own and then within six weeks of that time they were married there were some few things to be bought some little bills to be paid and then there was the fortnight of honeymooning among the lakes in june you shall have that though there were not another shot in the locker fred had said when his bride that was to be had urged upon him the prudence of settling down into a small lodging the very day after their marriage the fortnight of honeymooning among the lakes was thoroughly enjoyed almost without one fearful look into the future indeed fred as he would sit in the late evening on the side of a mountain looking down upon the lakes and watching the fleeting brightness of the clouds with his arm round his loving wifes waist and her head upon his shoulder would declare that he was glad that he had nothing on which to depend except his own intellect and his own industry to make the score off his own bat that should be a mans ambition and it is that which nature must have intended for a man she could never have meant that we should be bolstered up one by another from generation to generation you shall make the score off your own bat mary had said to him though her own heart might give way a little as she thought when alone of the danger of the future she was always brave before him so she enjoyed the fortnight of her honeymooning and when that was over set herself to her task with infinite courage they went up to london in a third class carriage and on their arrival there went at once to lodgings which had been taken for them by a friend in museum street museum street is not cheering by any special merits of its own but lodgings there were found to be cheap and it was near to the great library by means of which and the treasures there to be found young pickering meant to make himself a famous man he had had his literary successes at manchester as has been already stated but they had not been of a remunerative nature he had never yet been paid for what he had written he reaped however this reward that the sub editor of a manchester newspaper gave him a letter to a gentleman connected with a london periodical which might probably be of great service to him it is at any rate a comfort to a man to know that he can do something towards the commencement of the work that he has in hand that there is a step forward which he can take when fred and mary sat down to their tea and broiled ham on the first night the letter of introduction was a great comfort to them and much was said about it the letter was addressed to roderick billings esq office of the lady bird catherine street strand by ten oclock on the following morning fred pickering was at the office of the lady bird and there learned that mr billings never came to the office or almost never he was on the staff of the paper and the letter should be sent to him so fred pickering returned to his wife and as he was resolved that no time should be lost he began a critical reading of paradise lost with a notebook and pencil beside him on that very day they were four months in london during which they never saw mr billings or any one else connected with the publishing world and these four months were very trying to mrs pickering the study of milton did not go on with unremitting ardour fred was not exactly idle but he changed from one pursuit to another and did nothing worthy of note except a little account of his honeymooning tour in verse in this poem the early loves of a young married couple were handled with much delicacy and some pathos of expression so that mary thought that her husband would assuredly drive tennyson out of the field but no real good had come from the poem by the end of the four months and fred pickering had sometimes been very cross then he had insisted more than once or twice more than four or five times on going to the theatre and now at last his wife had felt compelled to say that she would not go there with him again they had not means she said for such pleasures he did not go without her but sometimes of an evening he was very cross the poem had been sent to mr billings with a letter and had not as yet been sent back three or four letters had been written to mr billings and one or two very short answers had been received mr billings had been out of town of course all the world is out of town in september said fred what fools we were to think of beginning just at this time of the year nevertheless he had urged plenty of reasons why the marriage should not be postponed till after june on the first of november however they found that they had still a hundred and eighty pounds left they looked their affairs in the face cheerfully and fred taking upon his own shoulders all the blame of their discomfiture up to the present moment swore that he would never be cross with his darling molly again after that he went out with a letter of introduction from mr billings to the sub editor of a penny newspaper he had never seen mr billings but mr billings thus passed him on to another literary personage mr billings in his final very short note communicated to fred his opinion that he would find work on the penny daily press easier got for months fred pickering hung about the office of the morning comet november went and december and january and he was still hanging about the office of the morning comet he did make his way to some acquaintance with certain persons on the staff of the comet who earned their bread if not absolutely by literature at least by some work cognate to literature and when he was asked to sup with one tom wood on a night in january he thought that he had really got his foot upon the threshold when he returned home that night or i should more properly say on the following morning his wife hoped that many more such preliminary suppers might not be necessary for his success at last he did get employment at the office of the morning comet he attended there six nights a week from ten at night till three in the morning and for this he received twenty shillings a week his work was almost altogether mechanical and after three nights disgusted him greatly but he stuck to it telling himself that as the day was still left to him for work he might put up with drudgery during the night that idea however of working day and night soon found itself to be a false one twelve oclock usually found him still in bed after his late breakfast he walked out with his wife and then well then he would either write a few verses or read a volume of an old novel i must learn shorthand writing he said to his wife one morning when he came home well dear i have no doubt you would learn it very quickly i dont know that i should have begun younger its a thousand pities that we are not taught anything useful when we are at school of what use is latin and greek to me i heard you say once that it would be of great use to you some day ah that was when i was dreaming of what will never come to pass when i was thinking of literature as a high vocation it had already come to him to make such acknowledgments as this i must think about mere bread now if i could report i might at any rate gain a living and there have been reporters who have risen high in the profession dickens was a reporter i must learn though i suppose it will cost me twenty pounds he paid his twenty pounds and did learn shorthand writing and while he was so doing he found he might have learned just as well by teaching himself out of a book during the period of his tuition in this art he quarrelled with his employers at the morning comet who as he declared treated him with an indignity which he could not bear they want me to fetch and carry and be a menial he said to his wife he thereupon threw up his employment at the comet office but now you will get an engagement as a reporter his wife said he hoped that he might get an engagement as a reporter but as he himself acknowledged the world was all to begin again he was at last employed and made his first appearance at a meeting of discontented tidewaiters who were anxious to petition parliament for some improvement in their position he worked very hard in his efforts to take down the words of the eloquent leading tidewaiter whereas he could see that two other reporters near him did not work at all and yet he failed he struggled at this work for a month and failed at last my hand is not made for it he said to his wife almost in an agony of despair it seems to me as though nothing would come within my reach my dear she said a man who can write the braes of birken the braes of birken was the name of his poem on the joys of honeymooning must not be ashamed of himself because he cannot acquire a small mechanical skill i am ashamed of myself all the same said fred early in april they looked their affairs in the face again and found that they had still in hand something just over a hundred pounds they had been in london nine months and when they had first come up they had expressed to each other their joint conviction that they could live very comfortably on forty shillings a week they had spent nearly double that over and beyond what he had earned and after all they had not lived comfortably they had a hundred pounds left on which they might exist for a year putting aside all idea of comfort and then and then would come that starving of which fred had once spoken so gallantly unless some employment could in the meantime be found for him and by the end of the year the starving would have to be done by three a development of events on which he had not seemed to calculate when he told his dearest mary that after all there were worse things in the world than starving but before the end of the month there came upon them a gleam of comfort which might be cherished and fostered till it should become a whole midday sun of nourishing heat his friend of the manchester free trader had become the editor of the salford reformer a new weekly paper which had been established with the view of satisfying certain literary and political wants which the public of salford had long experienced and among these wants was an adequate knowledge of what was going on in london fred pickering was asked whether he would write the london letter once a week at twenty shillings a week write it ay that he would there was a whole heaven of joy in the idea this was literary work this was the sort of thing that he could do with absolute delight to guide the public by his own wit and discernment as it were from behind a mask to be the motive power and yet unseen this had ever been his ambition for three days he was in an ecstasy and mary was ecstatic with him for the first time it was a joy to him that the baby was coming a pound a week earned would of itself prolong their means of support for two years and a pound a week so earned would surely bring other pounds i knew it was to be done he said in triumph to his wife if one only had the courage to make the attempt the morning of the fourth day somewhat damped his joy for there came a long letter of instruction from the salford editor in which there were hints of certain difficulties he was told in this letter that it would be well that he should belong to a london club such work as was now expected from him could hardly be done under favourable circumstances unless he did belong to a club but as everybody now a days does belong to a club you will soon get over that difficulty so said the editor and then the editor in his instructions greatly curtailed that liberty of the pen which fred specially wished to enjoy he had anticipated that in his london letter he might give free reins to his own political convictions which were of a very liberal nature and therefore suitable to the salford reformer and he had a theological bias of his own by the putting forward of which in strong language among the youth of salford he had intended to do much towards the clearing away of prejudice and the emancipation of truth but the editor told him that he should hardly touch politics at all in his london letter and never lay a finger on religion he was to tell the people of salford what was coming out at the different theatres how the prince and princess looked on horseback whether the thames embankment made proper progress and he was to keep his ears especially open for matters of social interest private or general his style was to be easy and colloquial and above all things he was to avoid being heavy didactic and profound then there was sent to him as a model a column and a half cut out from a certain well known newspaper in which the names of people were mentioned very freely if you can do that sort of thing said the editor we shall get on together like a house on fire it is a farrago of ill natured gossip he said as he chucked the fragment over to his wife but you are so clever fred said his wife you can do it without the ill nature i will do my best he said but as for telling them about this woman and that i cannot do it in the first place where am i to learn it all nevertheless the london letter to the salford reformer was not abandoned four or five such letters were written and four or five sovereigns were paid into his little exchequer in return for so much work alas after the four or five there came a kindly worded message from the editor to say that the articles did not suit nothing could be better than pickerings language and his ideas were manly and for the most part good but the salford reformer did not want that sort of thing the salford reformer felt that fred pickering was too good for the work required fred for twenty four hours was broken hearted after that he was able to resolve that he would take the thing up in the right spirit he wrote to the editor saying that he thought that the editor was right the london letter required was not exactly within the compass of his ability then he enclosed a copy of the braes of birken and expressed an opinion that perhaps that might suit a column in the salford reformer one of those columns which were furthest removed from the corner devoted to the london letter the editor replied that he would publish the braes of birken if pickering wished but that they never paid for poetry anything being better than silence pickering permitted the editor to publish the braes of birken in the gratuitous manner suggested at the end of june when they had just been twelve months in london fred was altogether idle as far as any employment was concerned there was no going to the theatre now and it had come to that with him in fear of his approaching privations that he would discuss within his own heart the expediency of taking this or that walk with reference to the effect it would have upon his shoes in those days he strove to work hard going on with his milton and his notebook and sitting for two or three hours a day over heavy volumes in the reading room at the museum when he first resolved upon doing this there had come a difficulty as to the entrance it was necessary that he should have permission to use the library and for a while he had not known how to obtain it then he had written a letter to a certain gentleman well known in the literary world an absolute stranger to him but of whom he had heard a word or two among his newspaper acquaintances and had asked this gentleman to give him or to get for him the permission needed the gentleman having made certain enquiry having sent for pickering and seen him had done as he was asked and fred was free of the library what sort of a man is mr wickham webb mary asked him when he returned from the club at which by mr webbs appointment the meeting had taken place according to my ideas he is the only gentleman whom i have met since i have been in london said fred who in these days was very bitter was he civil to you very civil he asked me what i was doing up in london and i told him he said that literature is the hardest profession in the world i told him that i thought it was but at the same time the most noble what did he say to that he said that the nobler the task it was always the more difficult and that as a rule it was not well that men should attempt work too difficult for their hands because of its nobility what did he mean by that fred i knew what he meant very well he meant to tell me that i had better go and measure ribbons behind a counter and i dont know but what he was right but yet you liked him why should i have disliked him for giving me good advice i liked him because his manner was kind and because he strove hard to say an unpleasant thing in the pleasantest words that he could use besides it did me good to speak to a gentleman once again throughout july not a shilling was earned nor was there any prospect of the earning of a shilling people were then still in town but in another fortnight london would have emptied itself of the rich and prosperous so much pickering had learned little as he was qualified to write the london letter for the salford reformer in the last autumn he had complained to his wife that circumstances had compelled him to begin at the wrong period of the year in the dull months when there was nobody in london who could help him now the dull months were coming round again and he was as far as ever from any help what was he to do you said that mr webb was very civil suggested his wife could you not write to him and ask him to help us he is a rich man and that would be begging said fred i would not ask him for money said mary but perhaps he can tell you how you can get employment the letter to mr webb was written with many throes and the destruction of much paper fred found it very difficult to choose words which should describe with sufficient force the extreme urgency of his position but which should have no appearance of absolute begging i hope you will understand he said in his last paragraph that what i want is simply work for which i may be paid and that i do not care how hard i work or how little i am paid so that i and my wife may live if i have taken an undue liberty in writing to you i can only beg you to pardon my ignorance this letter led to another interview between our hero and mr wickham webb mr webb sent his compliments and asked mr pickering to come and breakfast with him this kindness though it produced some immediate pleasure created fresh troubles mr wickham webb lived in a grand house near hyde park and poor fred was badly off for good clothes your coat does not look at all amiss his wife said to him comforting him and as for a hat why dont you buy a new one i shant breakfast in my hat said fred but look here and fred exhibited his shoes get a new pair said mary no said he ive sworn to have nothing new till ive earned the money mr webb wont expect to see me very bright i dare say when a man writes to beg for employment it must naturally be supposed that he will be rather seedy about his clothes his wife did the best she could for him and he went out to his breakfast mrs webb was not there mr webb explained that she had already left town there was no third person at the table and before his first lamb chop was eaten fred had told the pith of his story he had a little money left just enough to pay the doctor who must attend upon his wife and carry him through the winter and then he would be absolutely bare upon this mr webb asked as to his relatives my father has chosen to quarrel with me said fred i did not wish to be an attorney and therefore he has cast me out mr webb suggested that a reconciliation might be possible but when fred said at once that it was impossible he did not recur to the subject when the host had finished his own breakfast he got up from his chair and standing on the rug spoke such words of wisdom as were in him it should be explained that pickering in his letter to mr webb had enclosed a copy of the braes of birken another little poem in verse and two of the london letters which he had written for the salford reformer upon my word mr pickering i do not know how to help you i do not indeed i am sorry for that sir i have read what you sent me and am quite ready to acknowledge that there is enough both in the prose and verse to justify you in supposing it to be possible that you might hereafter live by literature as a profession but all who make literature a profession should begin with independent means that seems to be hard on the profession as well as on the beginner it is not the less true and is indeed true of most other professions as well if you had stuck to the law your father would have provided you with the means of living till your profession had become profitable is it not true that many hundreds in london live on literature said our hero many hundreds do so no doubt they are of two sorts and you can tell yourself whether you belong to either there are they who have learned to work in accordance with the directions of others the great bulk of what comes out to us almost hourly in the shape of newspapers is done by them some are very highly paid many are paid liberally and a great many are paid scantily there is that side of the profession and you say that you have tried it and do not like it then there are those who do their work independently who write either books or articles which find acceptance in magazines it is that which i would try if the opportunity were given me but you have to make your own opportunity said mr wickham webb it is the necessity of the position that it should be so what can i do for you you know the editors of magazines granted that i do can i ask a man to buy what he does not want because he is my friend you could get your friend to read what i write it ended in mr webb strongly advising fred pickering to go back to his father and in his writing two letters of introduction for him one to the editor of the international a weekly gazette of mixed literature and the other to messrs brook and boothby publishers in st jamess street mr webb though he gave the letters open to fred read them to him with the view of explaining to him how little and how much they meant i do not know that they can do you the slightest service said he but i give them to you because you ask me i strongly advise you to go back to your father but if you are still in town next spring come and see me again then the interview was over and fred returned to his wife glad to have the letters but still with a sense of bitterness against mr webb when one word of encouragement would have made him so happy might not mr webb have spoken it mr webb had thought that he had better not speak any such word and fred when he read the letters of introduction over to his wife found them to be very cold i dont think ill take them he said but he did take them of course on the very next day and saw mr boothby the publisher after waiting for half an hour in the shop he swore to himself that the time was an hour and a half and became sternly angry at being so treated it did not occur to him that mr boothby was obliged to attend to his own business and that he could not put his other visitors under the counter or into the cupboards in order to make way for mr pickering the consequence was that poor fred was seen at his worst and that the boothbyan heart was not much softened towards him there are so many men of this kind who want work said mr boothby and so very little work to give them it seems to me said pickering that the demand for the work is almost unlimited as he spoke he looked at a hole in his boot and tried to speak in a tone that should show that he was above his boots it may be so said boothby but if so the demands do not run in my way i will however keep mr webbs note by me and if i find i can do anything for you i will good morning then mr boothby got up from his chair and fred pickering understood that he was told to go away he was furious in his abuse of boothby as he described the interview to his wife that evening the editor of the international he could not get to see but he got a note from him the editor sent his compliments and would be glad to read the article to which mr w w had alluded as mr w w had alluded to no article fred saw that the editor was not inclined to take much trouble on his behalf nevertheless an article should be sent an article was written to which fred gave six weeks of hard work and which contained an elaborate criticism on the samson agonistes freds object was to prove that milton had felt himself to be a superior samson blind indeed in the flesh as samson was blind but not blind in the spirit as was samson when he crushed the philistines the poet had crushed his philistines with all his intellectual eyes about him then there was a good deal said about the philistines of those days as compared with the other philistines in all of which fred thought that he took much higher ground than certain other writers in magazines on the same subject the editor sent back his compliments and said that the international never admitted reviews of old books insensate idiot said fred tearing the note asunder and then tearing his own hair on both sides of his head and these are the men who make the world of letters idiot thick headed idiot i suppose he has not read it said mary then why hasnt he read it why doesnt he do the work for which he is paid if he has not read it he is a thief as well as an idiot poor fred had not thought much of his chance from the international when he first got the editors note but as he had worked at his samson he had become very fond of it and golden dreams had fallen on him and he had dared to whisper to himself words of wondrous praise which might be forthcoming and to tell himself of enquiries after the unknown author of the great article about the philistines as he had thought of this and as the dreams and the whispers had come to him he had rewritten his essay from the beginning making it grander bigger more eloquent than before he became very eloquent about the philistines and mixed with his eloquence some sarcasm which could not he thought be without effect even in dull brained heavy livered london yes he had dared to hope and then his essay such an essay as this was sent back to him with a notice that the international did not insert reviews of old books hideous brainless meaningless idiot fred in his fury tore his article into a hundred fragments and poor mary was employed during the whole of the next week in making another copy of it from the original blotted sheets which had luckily been preserved pearls before swine fred said to himself as he slowly made his way up to the library of the museum on the last day of that week that was in the end of october he had not then earned a single shilling for many months and the nearer prospect of that starvation of which he had once spoken so cheerily was becoming awfully frightful to him he had said that there were worse fates than to starve now as he looked at his wife and thought of the baby that was to be added to them and counted the waning heap of sovereigns he began to doubt whether there was in truth anything worse than to starve and now too idleness made his life more wretched to him than it had ever been he could not bring himself to work when it seemed to him that his work was to have no result literally none had you not better write to your father said mary he made no reply but went out and walked up and down museum street he had been much disgusted by the treatment he had received from mr boothby the publisher but in november he brought himself to write to mr boothby and ask him whether some employment could not be found you will perhaps remember mr wickham webbs letter wrote fred and the interview which i had with you last july his wife had wished him to speak more civilly and to refer to the pleasure of the interview but fred had declined to condescend so far there were still left to them some thirty pounds a fortnight afterwards when december had come he got a reply from mr boothby in which he was asked to call at a certain hour at the shop in st jamess street this he did and saw the great man again the great man asked him whether he could make an index to an historical work fred of course replied that he could do that that or anything else he could make the index or if need was write the historical work itself that no doubt was his feeling ten pounds would be paid for the index if it was approved fred was made to understand that payment was to depend altogether on approval of the work fred took away the sheets confided to him without any doubt as to the ultimate approval it would be odd indeed if he could not make an index that young man will never do any good said mr boothby to his foreman as fred took his departure he thinks he can do everything and i doubt very much whether he can do anything as it should be done fred worked very hard at the index and the baby was born to him as he was doing it a fortnight however finished the index and if he could earn money at the rate of ten pounds a fortnight he might still live so he took his index to st jamess street and left it for approval he was told by the foreman that if he would call again in a weeks time he should hear the result of course he called on that day week the work had not yet been examined and he must call again after three days he did call again and mr boothby told him that his index was utterly useless that in fact it was not an index at all you couldnt have looked at any other index i think said mr boothby of course you need not take it said fred but i believe it to be as good an index as was ever made mr boothby getting up from his chair declared that there was nothing more to be said the gentleman for whom the work had been done begged that mr pickering should receive five pounds for his labour which unfortunately had been thus thrown away and in saying this mr boothby tendered a five pound note to fred fred pushed the note away from him and left the room with a tear in his eye mr boothby saw the tear and ten pounds was sent to fred on the next day with the gentlemans compliments fred sent the ten pounds back there was still a shot in the locker and he could not as yet take money for work that he had not done by the end of january fred had retreated with his wife and child to the shelter of a single small bed room hitherto there had been a sitting room and a bed room but now there were but five pounds between him and that starvation which he had once almost coveted and every shilling must be strained to the utmost his wifes confinement had cost him much of his money and she was still ill things were going very badly with him and among all the things that were bad with him his own idleness was probably the worst when starvation was so near to him he could not seat himself in the museum library and read to any good purpose and indeed he had no purpose milton was nothing to him now as his lingering shillings became few and still fewer he could only sit brooding over his misfortunes and cursing his fate and every day as he sat eating his scraps of food over the morsel of fire in his wifes bed room she would implore him to pocket his pride and write to his father he would do something for us so that baby should not die mary said to him then he went into museum street and bethought himself whether it would not be a manly thing for him to cut his throat at any rate there would be much relief in such a proceeding one day as he was sitting over the fire while his wife still lay in bed the servant of the house brought up word that a gentleman wanted to see him a gentleman what gentleman the girl could not say who was the gentleman so fred went down to receive his visitor at the door of the house he met an old man of perhaps seventy years of age dressed in black who with much politeness asked him whether he was mr frederick pickering fred declared himself to be that unfortunate man and explained that he had no apartment in which to be seen my wife is in bed up stairs ill and there is not a room in the house to which i can ask you so the old gentleman and fred walked up museum street and had their conversation on the pavement i am mr burnaby for whose book you made an index said the old man mr burnaby was an author well known in those days and fred in the midst of his misfortunes felt that he was honoured by the visit i was sorry that my index did not suit you said fred it did not suit at all said mr burnaby indeed it was no index an index should comprise no more than words and figures your index conveyed opinions and almost criticism if you suffered inconvenience i regret it much said fred i was punished at any rate by my lost labour i do not wish you to be punished at all said mr burnaby and therefore i have come to you with the price in my hand i am quite sure that you worked hard to do your best then mr burnabys fingers went into his waistcoat pocket and returned with a crumpled note certainly not mr burnaby said fred i can take nothing that i have not earned now my dear young friend listen to me i know that you are poor i am very poor and i am rich that has nothing to do with it can you put me in the way of earning anything by literature i will accept any such kindness as that at your hand but nothing else i cannot i have no means of doing so you know so many authors and so many publishers though i knew all the authors and all the publishers what can i do excuse me if i say that you have not served the apprenticeship that is necessary and do all authors serve apprenticeships certainly not and it may be that you will rise to wealth and fame without apprenticeship but if so you must do it without help after that they walked silently together half the length of the street before fred spoke again you mean said he that a man must be either a genius or a journeyman yes mr pickering that or something like it is what i mean fred told mr burnaby his whole story walking up and down museum street even to that early assurance given to his young bride that there were worse things in the world than starvation and then mr burnaby asked him what were his present intentions i suppose we shall try it said pickering with a forced laugh try what said mr burnaby starvation said fred what with your baby with your wife and baby come you must take my ten pound note at any rate and while you are spending it write home to your father heaven and earth is a man to be ashamed to tell his father that he has been wrong when fred said that his father was a stern man and one whose heart would not be melted into softness at the tale of a babys sufferings mr burnaby went on to say that the attempt should at any rate be made there can be no doubt what duty requires of you mr pickering and upon my word i do not see what other step you can take you are not i suppose prepared to send your wife and child to the poor house then fred pickering burst into tears and mr burnaby left him at the corner of great russell street after cramming the ten pound note into his hand to send his wife and child to the poor house in all his misery that idea had never before presented itself to fred pickering he had thought of starvation or rather of some high toned extremity of destitution which might be borne with an admirable and perhaps sublime magnanimity but how was a man to bear with magnanimity a poor house jacket and the union mode of hair cutting it is not easy for a man with a wife and baby to starve in this country unless he be one to whom starvation has come very gradually fred saw it all now the police would come to him and take his wife and baby away into the workhouse and he would follow them it might be that this was worse than starvation but it lacked all that melodramatic grandeur to which he had looked forward almost with satisfaction well said mary to him when he returned to her bedside who was it has he told you of anything has he brought you anything to do he has given me that said fred throwing the bank note on to the bed out of charity i may as well go out into the streets and beg now all the pride has gone out of me then he sat over the fire crying and there he sat for hours fred said his wife to him if you do not write to your father to morrow i will write he went again to every person connected in the slightest degree with literature of whom he had the smallest knowledge to mr roderick billings to the teacher who had instructed him in shorthand writing to all those whom he had ever seen among the newspapers to the editor of the international and to mr boothby four different visits he made to mr boothby in spite of his previous anger but it was all to no purpose no one could find him employment for which he was suited he wrote to mr wickham webb and mr wickham webb sent him a five pound note his heart was i think more broken by his inability to refuse charity than by anything else that had occurred to him his wife had threatened to write to his father but she had not carried her threat into execution it is not by such means that a young wife overcomes her husband he had looked sternly at her when she had so spoken and she had known that she could not bring herself to do such a thing without his permission but when she fell ill wanting the means of nourishment for her child and in her illness begged of him to implore succour from his father for her baby when she should be gone then his pride gave way and he sat down and wrote his letter when he went to his ink bottle it was dry it was nearly two months since he had made any attempt at working in that profession to which he had intended to devote himself he wrote to his father drinking to the dregs the bitter cup of broken pride it always seems to me that the prodigal son who returned to his father after feeding with the swine suffered but little mortification in his repentant submission he does indeed own his unworthiness but the calf is killed so speedily that the pathos of the young mans position is lost in the hilarity of the festival had he been compelled to announce his coming by post had he been driven to beg permission to return and been forced to wait for a reply his punishment i think would have been more severe to fred pickering the punishment was very severe and indeed for him no fatted calf was killed at last he received without delay a very cold letter from his father in which he was told that his father would consider the matter in the meanwhile thirty shillings a week should be allowed him at the end of a fortnight he received a further letter in which he was informed that if he would return to manchester he would be taken in at the attorneys office which he had left he must not however hope to become himself an attorney he must look forward to be a paid attorneys clerk and in the meantime his father would continue to allow him thirty shillings a week in the present position of affairs said his father i do not feel that anything would be gained by our seeing each other the calf which was thus killed for poor fred pickering was certainly by no means a fatted calf of course he had to do as he was directed he took his wife and baby back to manchester and returned with sad eyes and weary feet to the old office which he had in former days not only hated but despised then he had been gallant and gay among the other young men thinking himself to be too good for the society of those around him now he was the lowest of the low if not the humblest of the humble he told his whole story by letters to mr burnaby and received some comfort from the kindness of that gentlemans replies i still mean he said in one of those letters to return some day to my old aspirations but i will endeavour first to learn my trade as a journeyman of literature illustration text decoration the two generals illustration text decoration the two generals christmas of is now three years past and the civil war which was then being commenced in america is still raging without any apparent sign of an enda the prophets of that time who prophesied the worst never foretold anything so black as this on that christmas day major anderson who then held the command of the forts in charleston harbour on the part of the united states government removed his men and stores from fort moultrie to fort sumter thinking that he might hold the one though not both against any attack from the people of charleston whose state that of south carolina had seceded five days previously that was in truth the beginning of the war though at that time mr lincoln was not yet president he became so on the th of march and on the th april following fort sumter was evacuated by major anderson on the part of the united states government under fire from the people of charleston so little bloody however was that affair that no one was killed in the assault though one poor fellow perished in the saluting fire with which the retreating officer was complimented as he retired with the so called honours of war during the three years that have since passed the combatants have better learned the use of their weapons of war no one can now laugh at them for their bloodless battles never have the shores of any stream been so bathed in blood as have the shores of those virginian rivers whose names have lately become familiar to us none of those old death doomed generals of europe whom we have learned to hate for the cold blooded energy of their trade tilly gustavus adolphus frederic or napoleon none of these ever left so many carcasses to the kites as have the johnsons jacksons and hookers of the american armies who come and go so fast that they are almost forgotten before the armies they have led have melted into clay a this story was first published in december of all the states of the old union virginia has probably suffered the most but kentucky has least deserved the suffering which has fallen to her lot in kentucky the war has raged hither and thither every town having been subject to inroads from either army but she would have been loyal to the union if she could nay on the whole she has been loyal she would have thrown off the plague chain of slavery if the prurient virtue of new england would have allowed her to do so by her own means but virtuous new england was too proud of her own virtue to be content that the work of abolition should thus pass from her hands kentucky when the war was beginning desired nothing but to go on in her own course she wished for no sudden change she grew no cotton she produced corn and meat and was a land flowing with milk and honey her slaves were not as the slaves of the southern states they were few in number tolerated for a time because their manumission was understood to be of all questions the most difficult rarely or never sold from the estates to which they belonged when the war broke out kentucky said that she would be neutral neutral and she lying on the front lines of the contest such neutrality was impossible to her impossible to any of her children near to the little state capital of frankfort there lived at that christmas time of an old man major reckenthorpe by name whose life had been marked by many circumstances which had made him well known throughout kentucky he had sat for nearly thirty years in the congress of the united states at washington representing his own state sometimes as senator and sometimes in the lower house though called a major he was by profession a lawyer and as such had lived successfully time had been when friends had thought it possible that he might fill the presidents chair but his name had been too much and too long in mens mouths for that who had heard of lincoln pierce or polk two years before they were named as candidates for the presidency but major reckenthorpe had been known and talked of in washington longer perhaps than any other living politician upon the whole he had been a good man serving his country as best he knew how and adhering honestly to his own political convictions he had been and now was a slave owner but had voted in the congress of his own state for the abolition of slavery in kentucky he had been a passionate man and had lived not without the stain of blood on his hands for duels had been familiar to him but he had lived in a time and in a country in which it had been hardly possible for a leading public man not to be familiar with a pistol he had been known as one whom no man could attack with impunity but he had also been known as one who would not willingly attack any one now at the time of which i am writing he was old almost on the shelf past his duellings and his strong short invectives on the floors of congress but he was a man whom no age could tame and still he was ever talking thinking and planning for the political well being of his state in person he was tall still upright stiff and almost ungainly in his gait with eager gray eyes that the waters of age could not dim with short thick grizzled hair which age had hardly thinned but which ever looked rough and uncombed with large hands which he stretched out with extended fingers when he spoke vehemently and of the major it may be said that he always spoke with vehemence but now he was slow in his steps and infirm on his legs he suffered from rheumatism sciatica and other maladies of the old which no energy of his own could repress in these days he was a stern unhappy all but broken hearted old man for he saw that the work of his life had been wasted and he had another grief which at this christmas of had already become terrible to him and which afterwards bowed him with sorrow to the ground he had two sons both of whom were then at home with him having come together under the family roof tree that they might discuss with their father the political position of their country and especially the position of kentucky south carolina had already seceded and other slave states were talking of secession what should kentucky do so the majors sons young men of eight and twenty and five and twenty met together at their fathers house they met and quarrelled deeply as their father had well known would be the case the eldest of these sons was at that time the owner of the slaves and land which his father had formerly possessed and farmed he was a southern gentleman living on the produce of slave labour and as such had learned to vindicate if not love that social system which has produced as its result the war which is still raging at this christmas of to him this matter of secession or non secession was of vital import he was prepared to declare that the wealth of the south was derived from its agriculture and that its agriculture could only be supported by its slaves he went further than this and declared also that no further league was possible between a southern gentleman and a puritan from new england his father he said was an old man and might be excused by reason of his age from any active part in the contest that was coming but for himself there could be but one duty that of supporting the new confederacy to which he would belong with all his strength and with whatever wealth was his own the second son had been educated at westpoint the great military school of the old united states and was now an officer in the national army not on that account need it be supposed that he would as a matter of course join himself to the northern side in the war to the side which as being in possession of the capital and the old government establishments might claim to possess a right to his military services a large proportion of the officers in the pay of the united states leagued themselves with secession and it is difficult to see why such an act would be more disgraceful in them than in others but with frank reckenthorpe such was not the case he declared that he would be loyal to the government which he served and in saying so seemed to imply that the want of such loyalty in any other person soldier or non soldier would be disgraceful as in his opinion it would have been disgraceful in himself i can understand your feeling said his brother who was known as tom reckenthorpe on the assumption that you think more of being a soldier than of being a a man but not otherwise even if i were no soldier i would not be a rebel said frank how a man can be a rebel for sticking to his own country i cannot understand said tom your own country said frank is it to be kentucky or south carolina and is it to be a republic or a monarchy or shall we hear of emperor davis you already belong to the greatest nation on the earth and you are preparing yourself to belong to the least that is if you should be successful luckily for yourself you have no chance of success at any rate i will do my best to fight for it nonsense tom said the old man who was sitting by it is no nonsense sir a man can fight without having been at westpoint whether he can do so after having his spirit drilled and drummed out of him there i dont know tom said the old man dont mind him father said the younger his appetite for fighting will soon be over even yet i doubt whether we shall ever see a regiment in arms sent from the southern states against the union do you said tom if you stick to your colours as you say you will your doubts will be soon set at rest and ill tell you what if your regiment is brought into the field i trust that i may find myself opposite to it you have chosen to forget that we are brothers and you shall find that i can forget it also tom said the father you should not say such words as that at any rate in my presence it is true sir said he a man who speaks as he speaks does not belong to kentucky and can be no brother of mine if i were to meet him face to face i would as soon shoot him as another sooner because he is a renegade you are very wicked very wicked said the old man rising from his chair very wicked and then leaning on his stick he left the room indeed what he says is true said a sweet soft voice from a sofa in the far corner of the room tom you are very wicked to speak to your brother thus would you take on yourself the part of cain he is more silly than wicked ada said the soldier he will have no chance of shooting me or of seeing me shot he may succeed in getting himself locked up as a rebel but i doubt whether hell ever go beyond that if i ever find myself opposite to you with a pistol in my grasp said the elder brother may my right hand but his voice was stopped and the imprecation remained unuttered the girl who had spoken rushed from her seat and put her hand before his mouth tom she said i will never speak to you again if you utter such an oath never and her eyes flashed fire at his and made him dumb ada forster called mrs reckenthorpe her aunt but the connexion between them was not so near as that of aunt and niece ada nevertheless lived with the reckenthorpes and had done so for the last two years she was an orphan and on the death of her father had followed her fathers sister in law from maine down to kentucky for mrs reckenthorpe had come from that farthest and most strait laced state of the union in which people bind themselves by law to drink neither beer wine nor spirits and all go to bed at nine oclock but ada forster was an heiress and therefore it was thought well by the elder reckenthorpes that she should marry one of their sons ada forster was also a beauty with slim tall form very pleasant to the eye with bright speaking eyes and glossy hair with ivory teeth of the whitest only to be seen now and then when a smile could be won from her and therefore such a match was thought desirable also by the younger reckenthorpes but unfortunately it had been thought desirable by each of them whereas the father and mother had intended ada for the soldier i have not space in this short story to tell how progress had been made in the troubles of this love affair so it was now that ada had consented to become the wife of the elder brother of tom reckenthorpe with his home among the slaves although she with all her new england feelings strong about her hated slavery and all its adjuncts but when has love stayed to be guided by any such consideration as that tom reckenthorpe was a handsome high spirited intelligent man so was his brother frank but tom reckenthorpe could be soft to a woman and in that i think had he found the means of his success frank reckenthorpe was never soft frank had gone angrily from home when some three months since ada had told him her determination his brother had been then absent and they had not met till this their christmas meeting now it had been understood between them by the intervention of their mother that they would say nothing to each other as to ada forster the elder had of course no cause for saying aught and frank was too proud to wish to speak on such a matter before his successful rival but frank had not given up the battle when ada had made her speech to him he had told her that he would not take it as conclusive the whole tenor of toms life he had said to her must be distasteful to you it is impossible that you should live as the wife of a slave owner in a few years there will be no slaves in kentucky she had answered wait till then he had answered and i also will wait and so he had left her resolving that he would bide his time he thought that the right still remained to him of seeking adas hand although she had told him that she loved his brother i know that such a marriage would make each of them miserable he said to himself over and over again and now that these terrible times had come upon them and that he was going one way with the union while his brother was going the other way with secession he felt more strongly than ever that he might still be successful the political predilections of american women are as strong as those of american men and frank reckenthorpe knew that all adas feelings were as strongly in favour of the union as his own had not she been born and bred in maine was she not ever keen for total abolition till even the old major with all his gallantry for womanhood and all his love for the young girl who had come to his house in his old age would be driven occasionally by stress of feeling to rebuke her frank reckenthorpe was patient hopeful and firm the time must come when ada would learn that she could not be a fit wife for his brother the time had he thought perhaps come already and so he spoke to her a word or two on the evening of that day on which she had laid her hand upon his brothers mouth ada he had said there are bad times coming to us good times i hope she had answered no one could expect that the thing could be done without some struggle when the struggle has passed we shall say that good times have come the thing of which she spoke was that little thing of which she was ever thinking the enfranchisement of four millions of slaves i fear that there will be bad times first of course i am thinking of you now bad or good they will not be worse to me than to others they would be very bad to you if this state were to secede and if you were to join your lot to my brothers in the first place all your fortune would be lost to him and to you i do not see that but of course i will caution him that it may be so if it alters his views i shall hold him free to act as he chooses but ada should it not alter yours what because of my money or because tom could not afford to marry a girl without a fortune i did not mean that he might decide that for himself but your marriage with him under such circumstances as those which he now contemplates would be as though you married a spaniard or a greek adventurer you would be without country without home without fortune and without standing ground in the world look you ada before you answer i frankly own that i tell you this because i want you to be my wife and not his never frank i shall never be your wife whether i marry him or no all i ask of you now is to pause this is no time for marrying or for giving in marriage there i agree with you but as my word is pledged to him i shall let him be my adviser in that late on that same night ada saw her betrothed and bade him adieu she bade him adieu with many tears for he came to tell her that he intended to leave frankfort very early on the following morning my staying here now is out of the question said he i am resolved to secede whatever the state may do my father is resolved against secession it is necessary therefore that we should part i have already left my father and mother and now i have come to say good bye to you and your brother tom i shall not see my brother again and is that well after such words as you have spoken to each other perhaps it may be that you will never see him again do you remember what you threatened i do remember what i threatened and did you mean it no of course i did not mean it you ada have heard me speak many angry words but i do not think that you have known me do many angry things never one tom never see him then before you go and tell him so no he is hard as iron and would take any such telling from me amiss he must go his way and i mine but though you differ as men tom you need not hate each other as brothers it will be better that we should not meet again the truth is ada that he always despises any one who does not think as he does if i offered him my hand he would take it but while doing so he would let me know that he thought me a fool then i should be angry and threaten him again and things would be worse you must not quarrel with me ada if i say that he has all the faults of a yankee and the virtues too sir while you have all the faults of a southern but tom as you are going from us i will not scold you i have too a word of business to say to you and whats the word of business dear said tom getting nearer to her as a lover should do and taking her hand in his it is this you and those who think like you are dividing yourselves from your country as to whether that be right or wrong i will say nothing now nor will i say anything as to your chance of success but i am told that those who go with the south will not be able to hold property in the north did frank tell you that never mind who told me tom and is that to make a difference between you and me that is just the question that i am asking you only you ask me with a reproach in your tone and i ask you with none in mine till we have mutually agreed to break our engagement you shall be my adviser if you think it better that it should be broken better for your own interest be man enough to say so but tom reckenthorpe either did not think so or else he was not man enough to speak his thoughts instead of doing so he took the girl in his arms and kissed her and swore that whether with fortune or no fortune she should be his and his only but still he had to go to go now within an hour or two of the very moment at which they were speaking they must part and before parting must make some mutual promise as to their future meeting marriage now as things stood at this christmas time could not be thought of even by tom reckenthorpe at last he promised that if he were then alive he would be with her again at the old family house at frankfort on the next coming christmas day so he went and as he let himself out of the old house ada with her eyes full of tears took herself up to her bed room during the year that followed the year the american war progressed only as a school for fighting the most memorable action was that of bulls run in which both sides ran away not from individual cowardice in either set of men but from that feeling of panic which is engendered by ignorance and inexperience men saw wagons rushing hither and thither and thought that all was lost after that the year was passed in drilling and in camp making in the making of soldiers of gunpowder and of cannons but of all the articles of war made in that year the article that seemed easiest of fabrication was a general officer generals were made with the greatest rapidity owing their promotion much more frequently to local interest than to military success such a state sent such and such regiments and therefore must be rewarded by having such and such generals nominated from among its citizens the wonder perhaps is that with armies so formed battles should have been fought so well before the end of both major reckenthorpes sons had become general officers that frank the soldier should have been so promoted was at such a period as this nothing strange though a young man he had been a soldier or learning the trade of a soldier for more than ten years and such service as that might well be counted for much in the sudden construction of an army intended to number seven hundred thousand troops and which at one time did contain all those soldiers frank too was a clever fellow who knew his business and there were many generals made in those days who understood less of their work than he did as much could not be said for toms quick military advancement but this could be said for them in the south that unless they did make their generals in this way they would hardly have any generals at all and general reckenthorpe as he so quickly became general tom as they used to call him in kentucky recommended himself specially to the confederate leaders by the warmth and eagerness with which he had come among them the name of the old man so well known throughout the union who had ever loved the south without hating the north would have been a tower of strength to them having him they would have thought that they might have carried the state of kentucky into open secession he was now worn out and old and could not be expected to take upon his shoulders the crushing burden of a new contest but his eldest son had come among them eagerly with his whole heart and so they made him a general the poor old man was in part proud of this and in part grieved i have a son a general in each army he said to a stranger who came to his house in those days but what strength is there in a fagot when it is separated of what use is a house that is divided against itself the boys would kill each other if they met it is very sad said the stranger sad said the old man it is as though the devil were let loose upon the earth and so he is so he is the family came to understand that general tom was with the confederate army which was confronting the federal army of the potomac and defending richmond whereas it was well known that frank was in kentucky with the army on the green river which was hoping to make its way into tennessee and which did so early in the following year it must be understood that kentucky though a slave state had never seceded and that therefore it was divided off from the southern states such as tennessee and that part of virginia which had seceded by a cordon of pickets so that there was no coming up from the confederate army to frankfort in kentucky there could at any rate be no easy or safe coming up for such a one as general tom seeing that being a soldier he would be regarded as a spy and certainly treated as a prisoner if found within the northern lines nevertheless general as he was he kept his engagement with ada and made his way into the gardens of his fathers house on the night of christmas eve and ada was the first who knew that he was there her ear first caught the sound of his footsteps and her hand raised for him the latch of the garden door oh tom it is not you but it is though ada my darling then there was a little pause in his speech did i not tell you that i should see you to day hush do you know who is here your brother came across to us from the green river yesterday the mischief he did then i shall never find my way back again if you knew what i have gone through for this ada immediately stepped out through the door and on to the snow standing close up against him as she whispered to him i dont think frank would betray you she said i dont think he would i doubt him doubt him hugely but i suppose i must trust him i got through the pickets close to cumberland gap and i left my horse at stoneleys half way between this and lexington i cannot go back to night now that i have come so far wait tom wait a minute and i will go in and tell your mother but you must be hungry shall i bring you food hungry enough but i will not eat my fathers victuals out here in the snow wait a moment dearest till i speak to my aunt then ada slipped back into the house and soon managed to get mrs reckenthorpe away from the room in which the major and his second son were sitting tom is here she said in the garden he had encountered all this danger to pay us a visit because it is christmas oh aunt what are we to do he says that frank would certainly give him up mrs reckenthorpe was nearly twenty years younger than her husband but even with this advantage on her side adas tidings were almost too much for her she however at last managed to consult the major and he resolved upon appealing to the generosity of his younger son by this time the confederate general was warming himself in the kitchen having declared that his brother might do as he pleased he would not skulk away from his fathers house in the night frank said the father as his younger son sat silently thinking of what had been told him it cannot be your duty to be false to your father in his own house it is not always easy sir for a man to see what is his duty i wish that either he or i had not come here but he is here and you his brother would not take advantage of his coming to his fathers house said the old man do you remember sir how he told me last year that if ever he met me on the field he would shoot me like a dog but frank you know that he is the last man in the world to carry out such a threat now he has come here with great danger and i have come with none but i do not see that that makes any difference he has put up with it all that he may see the girl he loves psha said frank rising up from his chair when a man has work to do he is a fool to give way to play the girl he loves does he not know that it is impossible that she should ever marry him father i ought to insist that he should leave this house as a prisoner i know that that would be my duty you would have sir to bear my curse i should not the less have done my duty but father independently of your threat i will neglect that duty i cannot bring myself to break your heart and my mothers but i will not see him good bye sir i will go up to the hotel and will leave the place before daybreak to morrow after some few further words frank reckenthorpe left the house without encountering his brother he also had not seen ada forster since that former christmas when they had all been together and he had now left his camp and come across from the army much more with the view of inducing her to acknowledge the hopelessness of her engagement with his brother than from any domestic idea of passing his christmas at home he was a man who would not have interfered with his brothers prospects as regarded either love or money if he had thought that in doing so he would in truth have injured his brother he was a hard man but one not wilfully unjust he had satisfied himself that a marriage between ada and his brother must if it were practicable be ruinous to both of them if this were so would not it be better for all parties that there should be another arrangement made north and south were as far divided now as the two poles all adas hopes and feelings were with the north could he allow her to be taken as a bride among perishing slaves and ruined whites but when the moment for his sudden departure came he knew that it would be better that he should go without seeing her his brother tom had made his way to her through cold and wet and hunger and through infinite perils of a kind sterner even than these her heart now would be full of softness towards him so frank reckenthorpe left the house without seeing anyone but his mother ada as the front door closed behind him was still standing close by her lover over the kitchen fire while the slaves of the family with whom master tom had always been the favourite were administering to his little comforts of course general tom was a hero in the house for the few days that he remained there and of course the step he had taken was the very one to strengthen for him the affection of the girl whom he had come to see north and south were even more bitterly divided now than they had been when the former parting had taken place there were fewer hopes of reconciliation more positive certainty of war to the knife and they who adhered strongly to either side and those who did not adhere strongly to either side were very few held their opinions now with more acrimony than they had then done the peculiar bitterness of civil war which adds personal hatred to national enmity had come upon the minds of the people and here in kentucky on the borders of the contest members of the same household were in many cases at war with each other ada forster and her aunt were passionately northern while the feelings of the old man had gradually turned themselves to that division in the nation to which he naturally belonged for months past the matter on which they were all thinking the subject which filled their minds morning noon and night was banished from their lips because it could not be discussed without the bitterness of hostility but nevertheless there was no word of bitterness between tom reckenthorpe and ada forster while these few short days lasted it was all love where is the woman whom one touch of romance will not soften though she be ever so impervious to argument tom could sit up stairs with his mother and his betrothed and tell them stories of the gallantry of the south of the sacrifices women were making and of the deeds men were doing and they would listen and smile and caress his hand and all for awhile would be pleasant while the old major did not dare to speak before them of his southern hopes but down in the parlour during the two or three long nights which general tom passed in frankfort open secession was discussed between the two men the old man now had given away altogether the yankees he said were too bitter for him i wish i had died first that is all he said i wish i had died first life is wretched now to a man who can do nothing his son tried to comfort him saying that secession would certainly be accomplished in twelve months and that every slave state would certainly be included in the southern confederacy but the major shook his head though he hated the political bitterness of the men whom he called puritans and yankees he knew their strength and acknowledged their power nothing good can come in my time he said not in my time not in my time in the middle of the fourth night general tom took his departure an old slave arrived with his horse a little before midnight and he started on his journey whatever turns up ada he said you will be true to me i will though you are a rebel all the same for that so was washington washington made a nation you are destroying one we are making another dear thats all but i wont talk secesh to you out here in the cold go in and be good to my father and remember this ada ill be here again next christmas eve if im alive so he went and made his journey back to his own camp in safety he slept at a friends house during the following day and on the next night again made his way through the northern lines back into virginia even at that time there was considerable danger in doing this although the frontier to be guarded was so extensive this arose chiefly from the paucity of roads and the impossibility of getting across the country where no roads existed but general tom got safely back to richmond and no doubt found that the tedium of his military life had been greatly relieved by his excursion then after that came a year of fighting and there has since come another year of fighting of such fighting that we hearing the accounts from day to day have hitherto failed to recognise its extent and import every now and then we have even spoke of the inaction of this side or of that as though the drawn battles which have lasted for days in which men have perished by tens of thousands could be renewed as might the old german battles in which an austrian general would be ever retreating with infinite skill and military efficacy for constancy for blood for hard determination to win at any cost of life or material history has known no such battles as these that the south have fought the best as regards skill no man can doubt as regards pluck and resolution there has not been a pins choice between them they have both fought as englishmen fight when they are equally in earnest as regards result it has been almost altogether in favour of the north because they have so vast a superiority in numbers and material general tom reckenthorpe remained during the year in virginia and was attached to that corps of general lees army which was commanded by stonewall jackson it was not probable therefore that he would be left without active employment during the whole year he was fighting assisting in the wonderful raids that were made by that man whose loss was worse to the confederates than the loss of vicksburg or of new orleans and general tom gained for himself mark name and glory but it was the glory of a soldier rather than of a general no one looked upon him as the future commander of an army but men said that if there was a rapid stroke to be stricken under orders from some more thoughtful head general tom was the hand to strike it thus he went on making wonderful rides by night appearing like a warrior ghost leading warrior ghosts in some quiet valley of the federals seizing supplies and cutting off cattle till his name came to be great in the state of kentucky and ada forster yankee though she was was proud of her rebel lover and frank reckenthorpe the other general made progress also though it was progress of a different kind men did not talk of him so much as they did of tom but the war office at washington knew that he was useful and used him he remained for a long time attached to the western army having been removed from kentucky to st louis in missouri and was there when his brother last heard of him i am fighting day and night he once said to one who was with him from his own state and as far as i can learn frank is writing day and night upon my word i think that i have the best of it it was but a couple of days after this the time then being about the latter end of september that tom reckenthorpe found himself on horseback at the head of three regiments of cavalry near the foot of one of those valleys which lead up into the blue mountain ridge of virginia he was about six miles in advance of jacksons army and had pushed forward with the view of intercepting certain federal supplies which he and others had hoped might be within his reach he had expected that there would be fighting but he had hardly expected so much fighting as came that day in his way he got no supplies indeed he got nothing but blows and though on that day the confederates would not admit that they had been worsted neither could they claim to have done more than hold their own but general toms fighting was on that day brought to an end it must be understood that there was no great battle fought on this occasion general reckenthorpe with about troopers had found himself suddenly compelled to attack about double that number of federal infantry he did so once and then a second time but on each occasion without breaking the lines to which he was opposed and towards the close of the day he found himself unhorsed but still unwounded with no weapon in his hand but his pistol immediately surrounded by about a dozen of his own men but so far in advance of the body of his troops as to make it almost impossible that he should find his way back to them as the smoke cleared away and he could look about him he saw that he was close to an uneven irregular line of federal soldiers but there was still a chance and he had turned for a rush with his pistol ready for use in his hand when he found himself confronted by a federal officer the pistol was already raised and his finger was on the trigger when he saw that the man before him was his brother your time is come said frank standing his ground very calmly he was quite unarmed and had been separated from his men and ridden over but hitherto had not been hurt frank said tom dropping his pistol arm is that you and you are not going to do it then said frank do what said tom whose calmness was altogether gone but he had forgotten that threat as soon as it had been uttered and did not even know to what his brother was alluding but tom reckenthorpe in his confusion at meeting his brother had lost whatever chance there remained to him of escaping he stood for a moment or two looking at frank and wondering at the coincidence which had brought them together before he turned to run then it was too late in the hurry and scurry of the affair all but two of his own men had left him and he saw that a rush of federal soldiers was coming up around him nevertheless he resolved to start for a run give me a chance frank he said and prepared to run but as he went or rather before he had left the ground on which he was standing before his brother a shot struck him and he was disabled in a minute he was as though he were stunned then he smiled faintly and slowly sunk upon the ground its all up frank he said and you are in at the death frank reckenthorpe was soon kneeling beside his brother amidst a crowd of his own men spurrell he said to a young officer who was close to him it is my own brother what general tom said spurrell not dangerously i hope by this time the wounded man had been able as it were to feel himself and to ascertain the amount of the damage done him its my right leg he said just on the knee if youll believe me frank i thought it was my heart at first i dont think much of the wound but i suppose you wont let me go of course they wouldnt let him go and indeed if they had been minded so to do he could not have gone the wound was not fatal as he had at first thought but neither was it a matter of little consequence as he afterwards asserted his fighting was over unless he could fight with a leg amputated between the knee and the hip before nightfall general tom found himself in his brothers quarters a prisoner on parole with his leg all but condemned by the surgeon the third day after that saw the leg amputated for three weeks the two brothers remained together and after that the elder was taken to washington or rather to alexandria on the other side of the potomac as a prisoner there to await his chance of exchange at first the intercourse between the two brothers was cold guarded and uncomfortable but after a while it became more kindly than it had been for many a day whether it were cold or kindly its nature we may be sure was such as the younger brother made it tom was ready enough to forget all personal animosity as soon as his brother would himself be willing to do so though he was willing enough also to quarrel to quarrel bitterly as ever if frank should give him occasion as to that threat of the pistol it had passed away from tom reckenthorpe as all his angry words passed from him it was clean forgotten it was not simply that he had not wished to kill his brother but that such a deed was impossible to him the threat had been like a curse that means nothing which is used by passion as its readiest weapon when passion is impotent but with frank reckenthorpe words meant what they were intended to mean the threat had rankled in his bosom from the time of its utterance to that moment when a strange coincidence had given the threatener the power of executing it the remembrance of it was then strong upon him and he had expected that his brother would have been as bad as his word but his brother had spared him and now slowly by degrees he began to remember that also what are your plans tom he said as he sat one day by his brothers bed before the removal of the prisoner to alexandria plans said tom how should a poor fellow like me have plans to eat bread and water in prison at alexandria i suppose theyll let you up to washington on your parole i should think of course i can say a word for you well then do say it id have done as much for you though i dont like your yankee politics never mind my politics now tom i never did mind them but at any rate you see i cant run away it should have been mentioned a little way back in this story that the poor old major had been gathered to his fathers during the past year as he had said himself it would be better for him that he should die he had lived to see the glory of his country and had gloried in it if further glory or even further gain were to come out of this terrible war as great gains to men and nations do come from contests which are very terrible while they last he at least would not live to see it so when he was left by his sons he turned his face to the wall and died there had of course been much said on this subject between the two brothers when they were together and frank had declared how special orders had been given to protect the house of the widow if the waves of the war in kentucky should surge up around frankfort land very near to frankfort had become debateable between the two armies and the question of flying from their house had more than once been mooted between the aunt and her niece but so far that evil day had been staved off and as yet frankfort the little capital of the state was northern territory i suppose you will get home said frank after musing awhile and look after my mother and ada if i can i shall of course what else can i do with one leg nothing in this war tom of course then there was another pause between them what will ada do said frank what will ada do stay at home with my mother ay yes but she will not remain always as ada forster do you mean to ask whether i shall marry her because of my one leg if she will have me i certainly shall and will she ought you to ask her if i found her seamed all over with small pox with her limbs broken blind disfigured by any misfortune which could have visited her i would take her as my wife all the same if she were penniless it would make no difference she shall judge for herself but i shall expect her to act by me as i would have acted by her then there was another pause look here frank continued general tom if you mean that i am to give her up as a reward to you for being sent home i will have nothing to do with the bargain i had intended no such bargain said frank gloomily very well then you can do as you please if ada will take me i shall marry her as soon as she will let me if my being sent home depends upon that you will know how to act now nevertheless he was sent home there was not another word spoken between the two brothers about ada forster whether frank thought that he might still have a chance through want of firmness on the part of the girl or whether he considered that in keeping his brother away from home he could at least do himself no good or whether again he resolved that he would act by his brother as a brother should act without reference to ada forster i will not attempt to say for a day or two after the above conversation he was somewhat sullen and did not talk freely with his brother after that he brightened up once more and before long the two parted on friendly terms general frank remained with his command and general tom was sent to the hospital at alexandria or to such hospitalities as he might be able to enjoy at washington in his mutilated state till that affair of his exchange had been arranged in spite of his brothers influence at head quarters this could not be done in a day nor could permission be obtained for him to go home to kentucky till such exchange had been effected in this way he was kept in terrible suspense for something over two months and mid winter was upon him before the joyful news arrived that he was free to go where he liked the officials in washington would have sent him back to richmond had he so pleased seeing that a federal general officer supposed to be of equal weight with himself had been sent back from some southern prison in his place but he declined any such favour declaring his intention of going home to kentucky he was simply warned that no pass south could after this be granted to him and then he went his way disturbed as was the state of the country nevertheless railways ran from washington to baltimore from baltimore to pittsburgh from pittsburgh to cincinnati and from cincinnati to frankfort so that general toms journey home though with but one leg was made much faster and with less difficulty than that last journey by which he reached the old family house and again he presented himself on christmas eve ada declared that he remained purposely at washington so that he might make good his last promise to the letter but i am inclined to think that he allowed no such romantic idea as that to detain him among the amenities of washington he arrived again after dark but on this occasion did not come knocking at the back door he had fought his fight had done his share of the battle and now had reason to be afraid of no one but again it was ada who opened the door for him oh tom oh my own one there never was a word of question between them as to whether that unseemly crutch and still unhealed wound was to make any difference between them general tom found before three hours were over that he lacked the courage to suggest that he might not be acceptable to her as a lover with one leg there are times in which girls throw off all their coyness and are as bold in their loves as men such a time was this with ada forster in the course of another month the elder general simply sent word to the younger that they intended to be married in may if the war did not prevent them and the younger general simply sent back word that his duties at head quarters would prevent his being present at the ceremony and they were married in may though the din of war was going on around them on every side and from that time to this the din of war is still going on and they are in the thick of it the carnage of their battles and the hatreds of their civil contests are terrible to us when we think of them but may it not be that the beneficent power of heaven which they acknowledge as we do is thus cleansing their land from that stain of slavery to abolish which no human power seemed to be sufficient illustration text decoration father giles of ballymoy illustration text decoration father giles of ballymoy it is nearly thirty years since i archibald green first entered the little town of ballymoy in the west of ireland and became acquainted with one of the honestest fellows and best christians whom it has ever been my good fortune to know for twenty years he and i were fast friends though he was much my elder as he has now been ten years beneath the sod i may tell the story of our first meeting ballymoy is a so called town or was in the days of which i am speaking lying close to the shores of lough corrib in the county of galway it is on the road to no place and as the end of a road has in itself nothing to attract a traveller the scenery of lough corrib is grand but the lake is very large and the fine scenery is on the side opposite to ballymoy and hardly to be reached or even seen from that place there is fishing but it is lake fishing the salmon fishing of lough corrib is far away from ballymoy where the little river runs away from the lake down to the town of galway there was then in ballymoy one single street of which the characteristic at first sight most striking to a stranger was its general appearance of being thoroughly wet through it was not simply that the rain water was generally running down its unguttered streets in muddy random rivulets hurrying towards the lake with true irish impetuosity but that each separate house looked as though the walls were reeking with wet and the alternated roofs of thatch and slate the slated houses being just double the height of those that were thatched assisted the eye and mind of the spectator in forming this opinion the lines were broken everywhere and at every break it seemed as though there was a free entrance for the waters of heaven the population of ballymoy was its second wonder there had been no famine then no rot among the potatoes and land around ballymoy had been let for nine ten and even eleven pounds an acre at all hours of the day and at nearly all hours of the night able bodied men were to be seen standing in the streets with knee breeches unbuttoned with stockings rolled down over their brogues and with swallow tailed frieze coats nor though thus idle did they seem to suffer any of the distress of poverty there were plenty of beggars no doubt in ballymoy but it never struck me that there was much distress in those days the earth gave forth its potatoes freely and neither man nor pig wanted more it was to be my destiny to stay a week at ballymoy on business as to the nature of which i need not trouble the present reader i was not at that time so well acquainted with the manners of the people of connaught as i became afterwards and i had certain misgivings as i was driven into the village on a jaunting car from tuam i had just come down from dublin and had been informed there that there were two hotels in ballymoy but that one of the hotels might perhaps be found deficient in some of those comforts which i as an englishman might require i was therefore to ask for the hotel kept by pat kirwan the other hotel was kept by larry kirwan so that it behoved me to be particular i had made the journey down from dublin in a night and a day travelling as we then did travel in ireland by canal boats and by bianconis long cars and i had dined at tuam and been driven over after dinner on an april evening and when i reached ballymoy i was tired to death and very cold pat kirwans hotel i said to the driver almost angrily mind you dont go to the other shure yer honour and why not to larrys youd be getting better enthertainment at larrys because of father giles i understood nothing about father giles and wished to understand nothing but i did understand that i was to go to pat kirwans hotel and thither i insisted on being taken it was dusk at this time and the wind was blowing down the street of ballymoy carrying before it wild gusts of rain in the west of ireland march weather comes in april and it comes with a violence of its own though not with the cruelty of the english east wind at this moment my neck was ricked by my futile endeavours to keep my head straight on the side car and the water had got under me upon the seat and the horse had come to a stand still half a dozen times in the last two minutes and my apron had been trailed in the mud and i was very unhappy for the last ten minutes i had been thinking evil of everything irish and especially of connaught i was driven up to a queerly shaped three cornered house that stood at the bottom of the street and which seemed to possess none of the outside appurtenances of an inn is this pat kirwans hotel said i faix and it is then yer honour said the driver and barring only that father giles but i had rung the bell and as the door was now opened by a barefooted girl i entered the little passage without hearing anything further about father giles could i have a bed room immediately with a fire in it not answering me directly the girl led me into a sitting room in which my nose was at once greeted by that peculiar perfume which is given out by the relics of hot whisky punch mixed with a great deal of sugar and there she left me where is pat kirwan himself said i coming to the door and blustering somewhat for let it be remembered i was very tired and it may be a fair question whether in the far west of ireland a little bluster may not sometimes be of service if you have not a room ready i will go to larry kirwans said i showing that i understood the bearings of the place its right away at the furder end then yer honour said the driver putting in his word and we comed by it ever so long since but shure yer honour wouldnt think of leaving this house for that this he said because pat kirwans wife was close behind him then mrs kirwan assured me that i could and should be accommodated the house to be sure was crowded but she had already made arrangements and had a bed ready as for a fire in my bed room she could not recommend that becase the wind blew so mortial sthrong down the chimney since the pot had blown off bad cess to it and that loon mick hackett wouldnt lend a hand to put it up again becase there were jobs going on at the big house bad luck to every joint of his body thin said mrs kirwan with great energy nevertheless she and mick hackett the mason were excellent friends i professed myself ready to go at once to the bed room without the fire and was led away up stairs i asked where i was to eat my breakfast and dine on the next day and was assured that i should have the room so strongly perfumed with whisky all to myself i had been rather cross before but on hearing this i became decidedly sulky it was not that i could not eat my breakfast in the chamber in question but that i saw before me seven days of absolute misery if i could have no other place of refuge for myself than a room in which as was too plain all ballymoy came to drink and smoke but there was no alternative at any rate for that night and the following morning and i therefore gulped down my anger without further spoken complaint and followed the barefooted maiden up stairs seeing my portmanteau carried up before me ireland is not very well known now to all englishmen but it is much better known than it was in those days on this my first visit into connaught i own that i was somewhat scared lest i should be made a victim to the wild lawlessness and general savagery of the people and i fancied as in the wet windy gloom of the night i could see the crowd of natives standing round the doors of the inn and just discern their naked legs and old battered hats that ballymoy was probably one of those places so far removed from civilisation and law as to be an unsafe residence for an english protestant i had undertaken the service on which i was employed with my eyes more or less open and was determined to go through with it but i confess that i was by this time alive to its dangers it was an early resolution with me that i would not allow my portmanteau to be out of my sight to that i would cling with that ever close to me would i live on that if needful would i die i therefore required that it should be carried up the narrow stairs before me and i saw it deposited safely in the bed room the stairs were very narrow and very steep ascending them was like climbing into a loft the whole house was built in a barbarous uncivilised manner and as fit to be an hotel as it was to be a church it was triangular and all corners the most uncomfortably arranged building i had ever seen from the top of the stairs i was called upon to turn abruptly into the room destined for me but there was a side step which i had not noticed under the glimmer of the small tallow candle and i stumbled headlong into the chamber uttering imprecations against pat kirwan ballymoy and all connaught i hope the reader will remember that i had travelled for thirty consecutive hours had passed sixteen in a small comfortless canal boat without the power of stretching my legs and that the wind had been at work upon me sideways for the last three hours i was terribly tired and i spoke very uncivilly to the young woman shure yer honour its as clane as clane and as dhry as dhry and has been slept in every night since the big storm said the girl good humouredly then she went on to tell me something more about father giles of which however i could catch nothing as she was bending over the bed folding down the bedclothes feel of em said she theys dhry as dhry i did feel them and the sheets were dry and clean and the bed though very small looked as if it would be comfortable so i somewhat softened my tone to her and bade her call me the next morning at eight shure yer honour and father giles will call yer hisself said the girl i begged that father giles might be instructed to do no such thing the girl however insisted that he would and then left me could it be that in this savage place it was considered to be the duty of the parish priest to go round with matins perhaps or some other abominable papist ceremony to the beds of all the strangers my mother who was a strict woman had warned me vehemently against the machinations of the irish priests and i in truth had been disposed to ridicule her could it be that there were such machinations was it possible that my trousers might be refused me till i had taken mass or that force would be put upon me in some other shape perhaps equally disagreeable regardless of that and other horrors or rather i should perhaps say determined to face manfully whatever horrors the night or morning might bring upon me i began to prepare for bed there was something pleasant in the romance of sleeping at pat kirwans house in ballymoy instead of in my own room in keppel street russell square so i chuckled inwardly at pat kirwans idea of an hotel and unpacked my things there was a little table covered with a clean cloth on which i espied a small comb i moved the comb carefully without touching it and brought the table up to my bedside i put out my brushes and clean linen for the morning said my prayers defying father giles and his machinations and jumped into bed the bed certainly was good and the sheets were very pleasant in five minutes i was fast asleep how long i had slept when i was awakened i never knew but it was at some hour in the dead of night when i was disturbed by footsteps in my room and on jumping up i saw a tall stout elderly man standing with his back towards me in the middle of the room brushing his clothes with the utmost care his coat was still on his back and his pantaloons on his legs but he was most assiduous in his attention to every part of his body which he could reach i sat upright gazing at him as i thought then for ten minutes we will say that i did so perhaps for forty seconds and of one thing i became perfectly certain namely that the clothes brush was my own whether according to irish hotel law a gentleman would be justified in entering a strangers room at midnight for the sake of brushing his clothes i could not say but i felt quite sure that in such a case he would be bound at least to use the hotel brush or his own there was a manifest trespass in regard to my property sir said i speaking very sharply with the idea of startling him what are you doing here in this chamber deed then and im sorry ive waked ye my boy said the stout gentleman will you have the goodness sir to tell me what you are doing here bedad then just at this moment its brushing my clothes i am it was badly they wanted it i dare say they did and you were doing it with my clothes brush and thats thrue too and if a man hasnt a clothes brush of his own what else can he do but use somebody elses i think its a great liberty sir said i and i think its a little one its only in the size of it we differ but i beg your pardon there is your brush i hope it will be none the worse then he put down the brush seated himself on one of the two chairs which the room contained and slowly proceeded to pull off his shoes looking me full in the face all the while what are you going to do sir said i getting a little further out from under the clothes and leaning over the table i am going to bed said the gentleman going to bed where here said the gentleman and he still went on untying the knot of his shoe string it had always been a theory with me in regard not only to my own country but to all others that civilisation displays itself never more clearly than when it ordains that every man shall have a bed for himself in older days englishmen of good position men supposed to be gentlemen would sleep together and think nothing of it as ladies i am told will still do and in outlandish regions up to this time the same practice prevails in parts of spain you will be told that one bed offers sufficient accommodation for two men and in spanish america the traveller is considered to be fastidious who thinks that one on each side of him is oppressive among the poorer classes with ourselves this grand touchstone of civilisation has not yet made itself felt for aught i know there might be no such touchstone in connaught at all there clearly seemed to be none such at ballymoy you cant go to bed here said i sitting bolt upright on the couch youll find you are wrong there my friend said the elderly gentleman but make yourself aisy i wont do you the least harm in life and i sleep as quiet as a mouse it was quite clear to me that time had come for action i certainly would not let this gentleman get into my bed i had been the first comer and was for the night at least the proprietor of this room whatever might be the custom of this country in these wild regions there could be no special law in the land justifying the landlord in such treatment of me as this you wont sleep here sir said i jumping out of the bed over the table on to the floor and confronting the stranger just as he had succeeded in divesting himself of his second shoe you wont sleep here to night and so you may as well go away with that i picked up his two shoes took them to the door and chucked them out i heard them go rattling down the stairs and i was glad that they made so much noise he would see that i was quite in earnest you must follow your shoes said i and the sooner the better i had not even yet seen the man very plainly and even now at this time i hardly did so though i went close up to him and put my hand upon his shoulder the light was very imperfect coming from one small farthing candle which was nearly burnt out in the socket and i myself was confused ill at ease and for the moment unobservant i knew that the man was older than myself but i had not recognised him as being old enough to demand or enjoy personal protection by reason of his age he was tall and big and burly as he appeared to me then hitherto till his shoes had been chucked away he had maintained imperturbable good humour when he heard the shoes clattering down stairs it seemed that he did not like it and he began to talk fast and in an angry voice i would not argue with him and i did not understand him but still keeping my hand on the collar of his coat i insisted that he should not sleep there go away out of that chamber he should but its my own he said shouting the words a dozen times its my own room its my own room so this was pat kirwan himself drunk probably or mad it may be your own said i but youve let it to me for to night and you shant sleep here so saying i backed him towards the door and in so doing i trod upon his unguarded toe bother you thin for a pig headed englishman said he youve kilt me entirely now so take your hands off my neck will ye before you have me throttled outright i was sorry to have trod on his toe but i stuck to him all the same i had him near the door now and i was determined to put him out into the passage his face was very round and very red and i thought that he must be drunk and since i had found out that it was pat kirwan the landlord i was more angry with the man than ever you shant sleep here so you might as well go i said as i backed him away towards the door this had not been closed since the shoes had been thrown out and with something of a struggle between the doorposts i got him out i remembered nothing whatever as to the suddenness of the stairs i had been fast asleep since i came up them and hardly even as yet knew exactly where i was so when i got him through the aperture of the door i gave him a push as was most natural i think for me to do down he went backwards down the stairs all in a heap and i could hear that in his fall he had stumbled against mrs kirwan who was coming up doubtless to ascertain the cause of all the trouble above her head a hope crossed my mind that the wife might be of assistance to her husband in this time of his trouble the man had fallen very heavily i knew and had fallen backwards and i remembered then how steep the stairs were heaven and earth suppose that he were killed or even seriously injured in his own house what in such case as that would my life be worth in that wild country then i began to regret that i had been so hot it might be that i had murdered a man on my first entrance into connaught for a moment or two i could not make up my mind what i would first do i was aware that both the landlady and the servant were occupied with the body of the ejected occupier of my chamber and i was aware also that i had nothing on but my night shirt i returned therefore within the door but could not bring myself to shut myself in and return to bed without making some enquiry as to the mans fate i put my head out therefore and did make enquiry i hope he is not much hurt by his fall i said ochone ochone murdher murdher spake father giles dear for the love of god such and many such exclamations i heard from the women at the bottom of the stairs i hope he is not much hurt i said again putting my head out from the doorway but he shouldnt have forced himself into my room his room the omadhaun the born idiot said the landlady faix maam and father giles is a dead man said the girl who was kneeling over the prostrate body in the passage below i heard her say father giles as plain as possible and then i became aware that the man whom i had thrust out was not the landlord but the priest of the parish my heart became sick within me as i thought of the troubles around me and i was sick also with fear lest the man who had fallen should be seriously hurt but why why why had he forced his way into my room how was it to be expected that i should have remembered that the stairs of the accursed house came flush up to the door of the chamber he shall be hanged if theres law in ireland said a voice down below and as far as i could see it might be that i should be hung when i heard that last voice i began to think that i had in truth killed a man and a cold sweat broke out all over me and i stood for awhile shivering where i was then i remembered that it behoved me as a man to go down among my enemies below and to see what had really happened to learn whom i had hurt let the consequences to myself be what they might so i quickly put on some of my clothes a pair of trousers a loose coat and a pair of slippers and i descended the stairs by this time they had taken the priest into the whisky perfumed chamber below and although the hour was late there were already six or seven persons with him among them was the real pat kirwan himself who had not been so particular about his costume as i had father giles for indeed it was father giles the priest of the parish had been placed in an old arm chair and his head was resting against mrs kirwans body i could tell from the moans which he emitted that there was still at any rate hope of life pat kirwan who did not quite understand what had happened and who was still half asleep and as i afterwards learned half tipsy was standing over him wagging his head the girl was also standing by with an old woman and two men who had made their way in through the kitchen have you sent for a doctor said i oh you born blagghuard said the woman you thief of the world that the like of you should ever have darkened my door you cant repent it more than i do mrs kirwan but hadnt you better send for the doctor faix and for the police too you may be shure of that young man to go and chuck him out of the room like that his own room too and he a priest and an ould man he that had given up the half of it though i axed him not to do so for a sthranger as nobody knowed nothing about the truth was coming out by degrees not only was the man i had put out father giles but he was also the proper occupier of the room at any rate somebody ought to have told me all this before they put me to sleep in the same bed with the priest i made my way round to the injured man and put my hand upon his shoulder thinking that perhaps i might be able to ascertain the extent of the injury but the angry woman together with the girl drove me away heaping on me terms of reproach and threatening me with the gallows at galway i was very anxious that a doctor should be brought as soon as possible and as it seemed that nothing was being done i offered to go and search for one but i was given to understand that i should not be allowed to leave the house until the police had come i had therefore to remain there for half an hour or nearly so till a sergeant with two other policemen really did come during this time i was in a most wretched frame of mind i knew no one at ballymoy or in the neighbourhood from the manner in which i was addressed and also threatened by mrs kirwan and by those who came in and out of the room i was aware that i should encounter the most intense hostility i had heard of irish murders and heard also of the love of the people for their priests and i really began to doubt whether my life might not be in danger during this time while i was thus waiting father giles himself recovered his consciousness he had been stunned by the fall but his mind came back to him though by no means all at once and while i was left in the room with him he hardly seemed to remember all the events of the past hour i was able to discover from what was said that he had been for some days past or as it afterwards turned out for the last month the tenant of the room and that when i arrived he had been drinking tea with mrs kirwan the only other public bed room in the hotel was occupied and he had with great kindness given the landlady permission to put the saxon stranger into his chamber all this came out by degrees and i could see how the idea of my base and cruel ingratitude rankled in the heart of mrs kirwan it was in vain that i expostulated and explained and submitted myself humbly to everything that was said around me but maam i said if i had only been told that it was the reverend gentlemans bed bed indeed to hear the blagghuard talk youd think it was axing father giles to sleep along with the likes of him we were and theres two beds in the room as dacent as any christian iver stretched in it was a new light to me and yet i had known over night before i undressed that there were two bedsteads in the room i had seen them and had quite forgotten the fact in my confusion when i was woken i had been very stupid certainly i felt that now but i had truly believed that that big man was going to get into my little bed it was terrible as i thought of it now the good natured priest for the sake of accommodating a stranger had consented to give up half of his room and had been repaid for his kindness by being perhaps murdered and yet though just then i hated myself cordially i could not quite bring myself to look at the matter as they looked at it there were excuses to be made if only i could get anyone to listen to them he was using my brush my clothes brush indeed he was i said not but what hed be welcome but it made me think he was an intruder and wasnt it too much honour for the likes of ye said one of the women with infinite scorn in the tone of her voice i did use the gentlemans clothes brush certainly said the priest they were the first collected words he had spoken and i felt very grateful to him for them it seemed to me that a man who could condescend to remember that he had used a clothes brush could not really be hurt to death even though he had been pushed down such very steep stairs as those belonging to pat kirwans hotel and im sure you were very welcome sir said i it wasnt that i minded the clothes brush it wasnt indeed only i thought indeed i did think that there was only one bed and they had put me into the room and had not said anything about anybody else and what was i to think when i woke up in the middle of the night faix and youll have enough to think of in galway gaol for thats where youre going to said one of the bystanders i can hardly explain the bitterness that was displayed against me no violence was absolutely shown to me but i could not move without eliciting a manifest determination that i was not to be allowed to stir out of the room red angry eyes were glowering at me and every word i spoke called down some expression of scorn and ill will i was beginning to feel glad that the police were coming thinking that i needed protection i was thoroughly ashamed of what i had done and yet i could not discover that i had been very wrong at any particular moment let any man ask himself the question what he would do if he supposed that a stout old gentleman had entered his room at an inn and insisted on getting into his bed it was not my fault that there had been no proper landing place at the top of the stairs two sub constables had been in the room for some time before the sergeant came and with the sergeant arrived also the doctor and another priest father columb he was called who as i afterwards learned was curate or coadjutor to father giles by this time there was quite a crowd in the house although it was past one oclock and it seemed that all ballymoy knew that its priest had been foully misused it was manifest to me that there was something in the roman catholic religion which made the priests very dear to the people for i doubt whether in any village in england had such an accident happened to the rector all the people would have roused themselves at midnight to wreak their vengeance on the assailant for vengeance they were now beginning to clamour and even before the sergeant of police had come the two sub constables were standing over me and i felt that they were protecting me from the people in order that they might give me up to the gallows i did not like the ballymoy doctor at all then or even at a later period of my visit to that town on his arrival he made his way up to the priest through the crowd and would not satisfy their affection or my anxiety by declaring at once that there was no danger instead of doing so he insisted on the terrible nature of the outrage and the brutality shown by the assailant and at every hard word he said mrs kirwan would urge him on thats thrue for you doctor deed and you may say that doctor two as good beds as ever christian stretched in deed and it was just father giless own room as you may say since the big storm fetched the roof off his riverences house below there thus gradually i was learning the whole history the roof had been blown off father giless own house and therefore he had gone to lodge at the inn he had been willing to share his lodging with a stranger and this had been his reward i hope doctor that the gentleman is not much hurt said i very meekly do you suppose a gentleman like that sir can be thrown down a long flight of stairs without being hurt said the doctor in an angry voice it is no thanks to you sir that his neck has not been sacrificed then there arose a hum of indignation and the two policemen standing over me bustled about a little coming very close to me as though they thought they should have something to do to protect me from being torn to pieces i bethought me that it was my special duty in such a crisis to show a spirit if it were only for the honour of my saxon blood among the celts so i spoke up again as loud as i could well speak no one in this room is more distressed at what has occurred than i am i am most anxious to know for the gentlemans sake whether he has been seriously hurt very seriously hurt indeed said the doctor very seriously hurt the vertebr may have been injured for aught i know at present arrah blazes man said a voice which i learned afterwards had belonged to an officer of the revenue corps of men which was then stationed at ballymoy a gentleman with whom i became afterwards familiarly acquainted tom macdermot was his name captain tom macdermot and he came from the county of leitrim arrah blazes man do ye think a gentlemans to fall sthrait headlong backwards down such a ladder as that and not find it inconvanient only that hes the priest and has had his own luck sorrow a neck belonging to him there would be this minute be aisy tom said father giles himself and i was delighted to hear him speak then there was a pause for a moment tell the gentleman i aint so bad at all said the priest and from that moment i felt an affection to him which never afterwards waned they got him up stairs back into the room from which he had been evicted and i was carried off to the police station where i positively spent the night what a night it was i had come direct from london sleeping on my road but once in dublin and now i found myself accommodated with a stretcher in the police barracks at ballymoy and the worst of it was that i had business to do at ballymoy which required that i should hold up my head and make much of myself the few words which had been spoken by the priest had comforted me and had enabled me to think again of my own position why was i locked up no magistrate had committed me it was really a question whether i had done anything illegal as that man whom father giles called tom had very properly explained if people will have ladders instead of staircases in their houses how is anybody to put an intruder out of the room without risk of breaking the intruders neck and as to the fact now an undoubted fact that father giles was no intruder the fault in that lay with the kirwans who had told me nothing of the truth the boards of the stretcher in the police station were very hard in spite of the blankets with which i had been furnished and as i lay there i began to remind myself that there certainly must be law in county galway so i called to the attendant policeman and asked him by whose authority i was locked up ah thin dont bother said the policeman shure and youve given throuble enough this night the dawn was at that moment breaking so i turned myself on the stretcher and resolved that i would put a bold face on it all when the day should come the first person i saw in the morning was captain tom who came into the room where i was lying followed by a little boy with my portmanteau the sub inspector of police who ruled over the men at ballymoy lived as i afterwards learned at oranmore so that i had not at this conjuncture the honour of seeing him captain tom assured me that he was an excellent fellow and rode to hounds like a bird as in those days i rode to hounds myself as nearly like a bird as i was able i was glad to have such an account of my head gaoler the sub constables seemed to do just what captain tom told them and there was no doubt a very good understanding between the police force and the revenue officer well now ill tell you what you must do mr green said the captain in the first place said i i must protest that im now locked up here illegally oh bother now dont make yourself unaisy thats all very well captain i beg your pardon sir but i didnt catch any name plainly except the christian name my name is macdermot tom macdermot they call me captain but thats neither here nor there i suppose captain macdermot the police here cannot lock up anybody they please without a warrant and where would you have been if they hadnt locked you up im blessed if they wouldnt have had you into the lough before this time there might be something in that and i therefore resolved to forgive the personal indignity which i had suffered if i could secure something like just treatment for the future captain tom had already told me that father giles was doing pretty well hes as sthrong as a horse you see or sorrow a doubt hed be a dead man this minute the back of his neck is as black as your hat with the bruises and its the same way with him all down his loins a man like that you know not just as young as he was once falls mortial heavy but hes as jolly as a four year old said captain tom and youre to go and ate your breakfast with him in his bed room so that you may see with your own eyes that there are two beds there i remembered it afterwards quite well said i deed and father giles got such a kick of laughter this morning when he came to understand that you thought he was going to get into bed alongside of you that he strained himself all over again and i thought hed have frightened the house yelling with the pain but anyway youve to go over and see him so now youd better get yourself dressed this announcement was certainly very pleasant against father giles of course i had no feeling of bitterness he had behaved well throughout and i was quite alive to the fact that the light of his countenance would afford me a better gis against the ill will of the people of ballymoy than anything the law would do for me so i dressed myself in the barrack room while captain tom waited without and then i sallied out under his guidance to make a second visit to pat kirwans hotel i was amused to see that the police though by no means subject to captain toms orders let me go without the least difficulty and that the boy was allowed to carry my portmanteau away with him oh its all right said captain tom when i alluded to this youre not down in the sheet you were only there for protection you know nevertheless i had been taken there by force and had been locked up by force if however they were disposed to forget all that so was i i did not return to the barracks again and when after that the policemen whom i had known met me in the street they always accosted me as though i were an old friend hoping my honour had found a better bed than when they last saw me they had not looked at me with any friendship in their eyes when they had stood over me in pat kirwans parlour this was my first view of ballymoy and of the hotel by daylight i now saw that mrs pat kirwan kept a grocery establishment and that the three cornered house which had so astonished me was very small had i seen it before i entered it i should hardly have dared to look there for a nights lodging as it was i stayed there for a fortnight and was by no means uncomfortable knots of men and women were now standing in groups round the door and indeed the lower end of the street was almost crowded theyre all here whispered captain tom because theyve heard how father giles has been murdered during the night by a terrible saxon and there isnt a man or woman among them who doesnt know that you are the man who did it but they know also i suppose said i that father giles is alive bedad yes they know that or i wouldnt be in your skin my boy but come along we mustnt keep the priest waiting for his breakfast i could see that they all looked at me and there were some of them especially among the women whose looks i did not even yet like they spoke among each other in gaelic and i could perceive that they were talking of me cant you understand then said captain tom speaking to them aloud just as he entered the house that father giles the lord be praised is as well as ever he was in his life shure it was only an accident an accident done on purpose captain tom said one person what is it to you how it was done mick healy if father giles is satisfied isnt that enough for the likes of you get out of that and let the gentleman pass then captain tom pushed mick away roughly and the others let us enter the house only they wouldnt do it unless somebody gave them the wink theyd pull you in pieces this moment for a dandy of punch they would indeed perhaps captain tom exaggerated the prevailing feeling thinking thereby to raise the value of his own service in protecting me but i was quite alive to the fact that i had done a most dangerous deed and had a most narrow escape i found father giles sitting up in his bed while mrs kirwan was rubbing his shoulder diligently with an embrocation of arnica the girl was standing by with a basin half full of the same and i could see that the priests neck and shoulders were as red as a raw beefsteak he winced grievously under the rubbing but he bore it like a man and here comes the hero said father giles now stop a minute or two mrs kirwan while we have a mouthful of breakfast for ill go bail that mr green is hungry after his nights rest i hope you got a better bed mr green than the one i found you in when i was unfortunate enough to waken you last night there it is all ready for you still said he and if you accept of it to night take my advice and dont let a trifle stand in the way of your dhraims i hope thin the gintleman will contrive to suit hisself elsewhere said mrs kirwan hell be very welcome to take up his quarters here if he likes said the priest and why not but bedad sir youd better be a little more careful the next time you see a stranger using your clothes brush they are not so strict here in their ideas of meum and tuum as they are perhaps in england and if you had broken my neck for so small an offence i dont know but what theyd have stretched your own we then had breakfast together father giles captain tom and i and a very good breakfast we had by degrees even mrs kirwan was induced to look favourably at me and before the day was over i found myself to be regarded as a friend in the establishment and as a friend i certainly was regarded by father giles then and for many a long day afterwards and many times when he has in years since that but years nevertheless which are now long back come over and visited me in my english home he has told the story of the manner in which we first became acquainted when you find a gentleman asleep he would say always ask his leave before you take a liberty with his clothes brush illustration text decoration malachis cove illustration text decoration malachis cove on the northern coast of cornwall between tintagel and bossiney down to the very margin of the sea there lived not long since an old man who got his living by saving seaweed from the waves and selling it for manure the cliffs there are bold and fine and the sea beats in upon them from the north with a grand violence i doubt whether it be not the finest morsel of cliff scenery in england though it is beaten by many portions of the west coast of ireland and perhaps also by spots in wales and scotland cliffs should be nearly precipitous they should be broken in their outlines and should barely admit here and there of an insecure passage from the summit of the sand at their feet the sea should come if not up to them at least very near to them and then above all things the water below them should be blue and not of that dead leaden colour which is so familiar to us in england at tintagel all these requisites are there except that bright blue colour which is so lovely but the cliffs themselves are bold and well broken and the margin of sand at high water is very narrow so narrow that at spring tides there is barely a footing there close upon this margin was the cottage or hovel of malachi trenglos the old man of whom i have spoken but malachi or old glos as he was commonly called by the people around him had not built his house absolutely upon the sand there was a fissure in the rock so great that at the top it formed a narrow ravine and so complete from the summit to the base that it afforded an opening for a steep and rugged track from the top of the rock to the bottom this fissure was so wide at the bottom that it had afforded space for trenglos to fix his habitation on a foundation of rock and here he had lived for many years it was told of him that in the early days of his trade he had always carried the weed in a basket on his back to the top but latterly he had been possessed of a donkey which had been trained to go up and down the steep track with a single pannier over his loins for the rocks would not admit of panniers hanging by his side and for this assistant he had built a shed adjoining his own and almost as large as that in which he himself resided but as years went on old glos procured other assistance than that of the donkey or as i should rather say providence supplied him with other help and indeed had it not been so the old man must have given up his cabin and his independence and gone into the workhouse at camelford for rheumatism had afflicted him old age had bowed him till he was nearly double and by degrees he became unable to attend the donkey on its upward passage to the world above or even to assist in rescuing the coveted weed from the waves at the time to which our story refers trenglos had not been up the cliff for twelve months and for the last six months he had done nothing towards the furtherance of his trade except to take the money and keep it if any of it was kept and occasionally to shake down a bundle of fodder for the donkey the real work of the business was done altogether by mahala trenglos his granddaughter mally trenglos was known to all the farmers round the coast and to all the small tradespeople in camelford she was a wild looking almost unearthly creature with wild flowing black uncombed hair small in stature with small hands and bright black eyes but people said that she was very strong and the children around declared that she worked day and night and knew nothing of fatigue as to her age there were many doubts some said she was ten and others five and twenty but the reader may be allowed to know that at this time she had in truth passed her twentieth birthday the old people spoke well of mally because she was so good to her grandfather and it was said of her that though she carried to him a little gin and tobacco almost daily she bought nothing for herself and as to the gin no one who looked at her would accuse her of meddling with that but she had no friends and but few acquaintances among people of her own age they said that she was fierce and ill natured that she had not a good word for anyone and that she was complete at all points a thorough little vixen the young men did not care for her for as regarded dress all days were alike with her she never made herself smart on sundays she was generally without stockings and seemed to care not at all to exercise any of those feminine attractions which might have been hers had she studied to attain them all days were the same to her in regard to dress and indeed till lately all days had i fear been the same to her in other respects old malachi had never been seen inside a place of worship since he had taken to live under the cliff but within the last two years mally had submitted herself to the teaching of the clergyman at tintagel and had appeared at church on sundays if not absolutely with punctuality at any rate so often that no one who knew the peculiarity of her residence was disposed to quarrel with her on that subject but she made no difference in her dress on these occasions she took her place on a low stone seat just inside the church door clothed as usual in her thick red serge petticoat and loose brown serge jacket such being the apparel which she had found to be best adapted for her hard and perilous work among the waters she had pleaded to the clergyman when he attacked her on the subject of church attendance with vigour that she had got no church going clothes he had explained to her that she would be received there without distinction to her clothing mally had taken him at his word and had gone with a courage which certainly deserved admiration though i doubt whether there was not mingled with it an obstinacy which was less admirable for people said that old glos was rich and that mally might have proper clothes if she chose to buy them mr polwarth the clergyman who as the old man could not come to him went down the rocks to the old man did make some hint on the matter in mallys absence but old glos who had been patient with him on other matters turned upon him so angrily when he made an allusion to money that mr polwarth found himself obliged to give that matter up and mally continued to sit upon the stone bench in her short serge petticoat with her long hair streaming down her face she did so far sacrifice to decency as on such occasions to tie up her back hair with an old shoestring so tied it would remain through the monday and tuesday but by wednesday afternoon mallys hair had generally managed to escape as to mallys indefatigable industry there could be no manner of doubt for the quantity of seaweed which she and the donkey amassed between them was very surprising old glos it was declared had never collected half what mally gathered together but then the article was becoming cheaper and it was necessary that the exertion should be greater so mally and the donkey toiled and toiled and the seaweed came up in heaps which surprised those who looked at her little hands and light form was there not some one who helped her at nights some fairy or demon or the like mally was so snappish in her answers to people that she had no right to be surprised if ill natured things were said of her no one ever heard mally trenglos complain of her work but about this time she was heard to make great and loud complaints of the treatment she received from some of her neighbours it was known that she went with her plaints to mr polwarth and when he could not help her or did not give her such instant help as she needed she went ah so foolishly to the office of a certain attorney at camelford who was not likely to prove himself a better friend than mr polwarth now the nature of her injury was as follows the place in which she collected her seaweed was a little cove the people had come to call it malachis cove from the name of the old man who lived there which was so formed that the margin of the sea therein could only be reached by the passage from the top down to trengloss hut the breadth of the cove when the sea was out might perhaps be two hundred yards and on each side the rocks ran out in such a way that both from north and south the domain of trenglos was guarded from intruders and this locality had been well chosen for its intended purpose there was a rush of the sea into the cove which carried there large drifting masses of seaweed leaving them among the rocks when the tide was out during the equinoctial winds of the spring and autumn the supply would never fail and even when the sea was calm the long soft salt bedewed trailing masses of the weed could be gathered there when they could not be found elsewhere for miles along the coast the task of getting the weed from the breakers was often difficult and dangerous so difficult that much of it was left to be carried away by the next incoming tide mally doubtless did not gather half the crop that was there at her feet what was taken by the returning waves she did not regret but when interlopers came upon her cove and gathered her wealth her grandfathers wealth beneath her eyes then her heart was broken it was this interloping this intrusion that drove poor mally to the camelford attorney but alas though the camelford attorney took mallys money he could do nothing for her and her heart was broken she had an idea in which no doubt her grandfather shared that the path to the cove was at any rate their property when she was told that the cove and sea running into the cove were not the freeholds of her grandfather she understood that the statement might be true but what then as to the use of the path who had made the path what it was had she not painfully wearily with exceeding toil carried up bits of rock with her own little hands that her grandfathers donkey might have footing for his feet had she not scraped together crumbs of earth along the face of the cliff that she might make easier to the animal the track of that rugged way and now when she saw big farmers lads coming down with other donkeys and indeed there was one who came with a pony no boy but a young man old enough to know better than rob a poor old man and a young girl she reviled the whole human race and swore that the camelford attorney was a fool any attempt to explain to her that there was still weed enough for her was worse than useless was it not all hers and his or at any rate was not the sole way to it his and hers and was not her trade stopped and impeded had she not been forced to back her laden donkey down twenty yards she said but it had in truth been five because farmer gunliffes son had been in the way with his thieving pony farmer gunliffe had wanted to buy her weed at his own price and because she had refused he had set on his thieving son to destroy her in this wicked way ill hamstring the beast the next time as hes down here said mally to old glos while the angry fire literally streamed from her eyes farmer gunliffes small homestead he held about fifty acres of land was close by the village of tintagel and not a mile from the cliff the sea wrack as they call it was pretty well the only manure within his reach and no doubt he thought it hard that he should be kept from using it by mally trenglos and her obstinacy theres heaps of other coves barty said mally to barty gunliffe the farmers son but none so nigh mally nor yet none that fills emselves as this place then he explained to her that he would not take the weed that came up close to hand he was bigger than she was and stronger and would get it from the outer rocks with which she never meddled then with scorn in her eye she swore that she could get it where he durst not venture and repeated her threat of hamstringing the pony barty laughed at her wrath jeered her because of her wild hair and called her a mermaid ill mermaid you she cried mermaid indeed i wouldnt be a man to come and rob a poor girl and an old cripple but youre no man barty gunliffe youre not half a man nevertheless bartholomew gunliffe was a very fine young fellow as far as the eye went he was about five feet eight inches high with strong arms and legs with light curly brown hair and blue eyes his father was but in a small way as a farmer but nevertheless barty gunliffe was well thought of among the girls around everybody liked barty excepting only mally trenglos and she hated him like poison barty when he was asked why so good natured a lad as he persecuted a poor girl and an old man threw himself upon the justice of the thing it wouldnt do at all according to his view that any single person should take upon himself to own that which god almighty sent as the common property of all he would do mally no harm and so he had told her but mally was a vixen a wicked little vixen and she must be taught to have a civil tongue in her head when once mally would speak him civil as he went for weed he would get his father to pay the old man some sort of toll for the use of the path speak him civil said mally never not while i have a tongue in my mouth and i fear old glos encouraged her rather than otherwise in her view of the matter but her grandfather did not encourage her to hamstring the pony hamstringing a pony would be a serious thing and old glos thought it might be very awkward for both of them if mally were put into prison he suggested therefore that all manner of impediments should be put in the way of the ponys feet surmising that the well trained donkey might be able to work in spite of them and barty gunliffe on his next descent did find the passage very awkward when he came near to malachis hut but he made his way down and poor mally saw the lumps of rock at which she had laboured so hard pushed on one side or rolled out of the way with a steady persistency of injury towards herself that almost drove her frantic well barty youre a nice boy said old glos sitting in the doorway of the hut as he watched the intruder i aint a doing no harm to none as doesnt harm me said barty the seas free to all malachi and the skys free to all but i mustnt get up on the top of your big barn to look at it said mally who was standing among the rocks with a long hook in her hand the long hook was the tool with which she worked in dragging the weed from the waves but you aint got no justice nor yet no sperrit or you wouldnt come here to vex an old man like he i didnt want to vex him nor yet to vex you mally you let me be for a while and well be friends yet friends exclaimed mally whod have the likes of you for a friend what are you moving them stones for them stones belongs to grandfather and in her wrath she made a movement as though she were going to fly at him let him be mally said the old man let him be hell get his punishment hell come to be drowned some day if he comes down here when the wind is in shore that he may be drowned then said mally in her anger if he was in that big hole there among the rocks and the sea running in at half tide i wouldnt lift a hand to help him out yes you would mally youd fish me up with your hook like a big stick of seaweed she turned from him with scorn as he said this and went into the hut it was time for her to get ready for her work and one of the great injuries done her lay in this that such a one as barty gunliffe should come and look at her during her toil among the breakers it was an afternoon in april and the hour was something after four oclock there had been a heavy wind from the north west all the morning with gusts of rain and the sea gulls had been in and out of the cove all the day which was a sure sign to mally that the incoming tide would cover the rocks with weed the quick waves were now returning with wonderful celerity over the low reefs and the time had come at which the treasure must be seized if it was to be garnered on that day by seven oclock it would be growing dark at nine it would be high water and before daylight the crop would be carried out again if not collected all this mally understood very well and some of this barty was beginning to understand also as mally came down with her bare feet bearing her long hook in her hand she saw bartys pony standing patiently on the sand and in her heart she longed to attack the brute barty at this moment with a common three pronged fork in his hand was standing down on a large rock gazing forth towards the waters he had declared that he would gather the weed only at places which were inaccessible to mally and he was looking out that he might settle where he would begin let un be let un be shouted the old man to mally as he saw her take a step towards the beast which she hated almost as much as she hated the man hearing her grandfathers voice through the wind she desisted from her purpose if any purpose she had had and went forth to her work as she passed down the cove and scrambled in among the rocks she saw barty still standing on his perch out beyond the white curling waves were cresting and breaking themselves with violence and the wind was howling among the caverns and abutments of the cliff every now and then there came a squall of rain and though there was sufficient light the heavens were black with clouds a scene more beautiful might hardly be found by those who love the glories of the coast the light for such objects was perfect nothing could exceed the grandeur of the colours the blue of the open sea the white of the breaking waves the yellow sands or the streaks of red and brown which gave such richness to the cliff but neither mally nor barty were thinking of such things as these indeed they were hardly thinking of their trade after its ordinary forms barty was meditating how he could best accomplish his purpose of working beyond the reach of mallys feminine powers and mally was resolving that wherever barty went she would go farther and in many respects mally had the advantage she knew every rock in the spot and was sure of those which gave a good foothold and sure also of those which did not and then her activity had been made perfect by practice for the purpose to which it was to be devoted barty no doubt was stronger than she and quite as active but barty could not jump among the waves from one stone to another as she could do nor was he as yet able to get aid in his work from the very force of the water as she could get it she had been hunting seaweed in that cove since she had been an urchin of six years old and she knew every hole and corner and every spot of vantage the waves were her friends and she could use them she could measure their strength and knew when and where it would cease mally was great down in the salt pools of her own cove great and very fearless as she watched barty make his way forward from rock to rock she told herself gleefully that he was going astray the curl of the wind as it blew into the cove would not carry the weed up to the northern buttresses of the cove and then there was the great hole just there the great hole of which she had spoken when she wished him evil and now she went to work hooking up the dishevelled hairs of the ocean and landing many a cargo on the extreme margin of the sand from whence she would be able in the evening to drag it back before the invading waters would return to reclaim the spoil and on his side also barty made his heap up against the northern buttresses of which i have spoken bartys heap became big and still bigger so that he knew let the pony work as he might he could not take it all up that evening but still it was not as large as mallys heap mallys hook was better than his fork and mallys skill was better than his strength and when he failed in some haul mally would jeer him with a wild weird laughter and shriek to him through the wind that he was not half a man at first he answered her with laughing words but before long as she boasted of her success and pointed to his failure he became angry and then he answered her no more he became angry with himself in that he missed so much of the plunder before him the broken sea was full of the long straggling growth which the waves had torn up from the bottom of the ocean but the masses were carried past him away from him nay once or twice over him and then mallys weird voice would sound in his ear jeering him the gloom among the rocks was now becoming thicker and thicker the tide was beating in with increased strength and the gusts of wind came with quicker and greater violence but still he worked on while mally worked he would work and he would work for some time after she was driven in he would not be beaten by a girl the great hole was now full of water but of water which seemed to be boiling as though in a pot and the pot was full of floating masses large treasures of seaweed which were thrown to and fro upon its surface but lying there so thick that one would seem almost able to rest upon it without sinking mally knew well how useless it was to attempt to rescue aught from the fury of that boiling caldron the hole went in under the rocks and the side of it towards the shore lay high slippery and steep the hole even at low water was never empty and mally believed that there was no bottom to it fish thrown in there could escape out to the ocean miles away so mally in her softer moods would tell the visitors to the cove she knew the hole well poulnadioul she was accustomed to call it which was supposed when translated to mean that this was the hole of the evil one never did mally attempt to make her own of weed which had found its way into that pot but barty gunliffe knew no better and she watched him as he endeavoured to steady himself on the treacherously slippery edge of the pool he fixed himself there and made a haul with some small success how he managed it she hardly knew but she stood still for a while watching him anxiously and then she saw him slip he slipped and recovered himself slipped again and again recovered himself barty you fool she screamed if you get yourself pitched in there youll never come out no more whether she simply wished to frighten him or whether her heart relented and she had thought of his danger with dismay who shall say she could not have told herself she hated him as much as ever but she could hardly have wished to see him drowned before her eyes you go on and dont mind me said he speaking in a hoarse angry tone mind you who minds you retorted the girl and then she again prepared herself for her work but as she went down over the rocks with her long hook balanced in her hands she suddenly heard a splash and turning quickly round saw the body of her enemy tumbling amidst the eddying waves in the pool the tide had now come up so far that every succeeding wave washed into it and over it from the side nearest to the sea and then ran down again back from the rocks as the rolling wave receded with a noise like the fall of a cataract and then when the surplus water had retreated for a moment the surface of the pool would be partly calm though the fretting bubbles would still boil up and down and there was ever a simmer on the surface as though in truth the caldron were heated but this time of comparative rest was but a moment for the succeeding breaker would come up almost as soon as the foam of the preceding one had gone and then again the waters would be dashed upon the rocks and the sides would echo with the roar of the angry wave instantly mally hurried across to the edge of the pool crouching down upon her hands and knees for security as she did so as a wave receded bartys head and face was carried round near to her and she could see that his forehead was covered with blood whether he were alive or dead she did not know she had seen nothing but his blood and the light coloured hair of his head lying amidst the foam then his body was drawn along by the suction of the retreating wave but the mass of water that escaped was not on this occasion large enough to carry the man out with it instantly mally was at work with her hook and getting it fixed into his coat dragged him towards the spot on which she was kneeling during the half minute of repose she got him so close that she could touch his shoulder straining herself down laying herself over the long bending handle of the hook she strove to grasp him with her right hand but she could not do it she could only touch him then came the next breaker forcing itself on with a roar looking to mally as though it must certainly knock her from her resting place and destroy them both but she had nothing for it but to kneel and hold by her hook what prayer passed through her mind at that moment for herself or for him or for that old man who was sitting unconsciously up at the cabin who can say the great wave came and rushed over her as she lay almost prostrate and when the water was gone from her eyes and the tumult of the foam and the violence of the roaring breaker had passed by her she found herself at her length upon the rock while his body had been lifted up free from her hook and was lying upon the slippery ledge half in the water and half out of it as she looked at him in that instant she could see that his eyes were open and that he was struggling with his hands hold by the hook barty she cried pushing the stick of it before him while she seized the collar of his coat in her hands had he been her brother her lover her father she could not have clung to him with more of the energy of despair he did contrive to hold by the stick which she had given him and when the succeeding wave had passed by he was still on the ledge in the next moment she was seated a yard or two above the hole in comparative safety while barty lay upon the rocks with his still bleeding head resting upon her lap what could she do now she could not carry him and in fifteen minutes the sea would be up where she was sitting he was quite insensible and very pale and the blood was coming slowly very slowly from the wound on his forehead ever so gently she put her hand upon his hair to move it back from his face and then she bent over his mouth to see if he breathed and as she looked at him she knew that he was beautiful what would she not give that he might live nothing now was so precious to her as his life as this life which she had so far rescued from the waters but what could she do her grandfather could scarcely get himself down over the rocks if indeed he could succeed in doing so much as that could she drag the wounded man backwards if it were only a few feet so that he might lie above the reach of the waves till further assistance could be procured she set herself to work and she moved him almost lifting him as she did so she wondered at her own strength but she was very strong at that moment slowly tenderly falling on the rocks herself so that he might fall on her she got him back to the margin of the sand to a spot which the waters would not reach for the next two hours here her grandfather met them having seen at last what had happened from the door dada she said he fell into the pool yonder and was battered against the rocks see there at his forehead mally im thinking that hes dead already said old glos peering down over the body no dada he is not dead but mayhap hes dying but ill go at once up to the farm mally said the old man look at his head theyll say we murdered him wholl say so wholl lie like that didnt i pull him out of the hole what matters that his fatherll say we killed him it was manifest to mally that whatever any one might say hereafter her present course was plain before her she must run up the path to gunliffes farm and get necessary assistance if the world were as bad as her grandfather said it would be so bad that she would not care to live longer in it but be that as it might there was no doubt as to what she must do now so away she went as fast as her naked feet could carry her up the cliff when at the top she looked round to see if any person might be within ken but she saw no one so she ran with all her speed along the headland of the corn field which led in the direction of old gunliffes house and as she drew near to the homestead she saw that bartys mother was leaning on the gate as she approached she attempted to call but her breath failed her for any purpose of loud speech so she ran on till she was able to grasp mrs gunliffe by the arm wheres himself she said holding her hand upon her beating heart that she might husband her breath who is it you mean said mrs gunliffe who participated in the family feud against trenglos and his granddaughter what does the girl clutch me for in that way hes dying then thats all who is dying is it old malachi if the old mans bad well send some one down it aint dada its barty wheres himself wheres the master but by this time mrs gunliffe was in an agony of despair and was calling out for assistance lustily happily gunliffe the father was at hand and with him a man from the neighbouring village will you not send for the doctor said mally oh man you should send for the doctor whether any orders were given for the doctor she did not know but in a very few minutes she was hurrying across the field again towards the path to the cove and gunliffe with the other man and his wife were following her as mally went along she recovered her voice for their step was not so quick as hers and that which to them was a hurried movement allowed her to get her breath again and as she went she tried to explain to the father what had happened saying but little however of her own doings in the matter the wife hung behind listening exclaiming every now and again that her boy was killed and then asking wild questions as to his being yet alive the father as he went said little he was known as a silent sober man well spoken of for diligence and general conduct but supposed to be stern and very hard when angered as they drew near to the top of the path the other man whispered something to him and then he turned round upon mally and stopped her if he has come by his death between you your blood shall be taken for his said he then the wife shrieked out that her child had been murdered and mally looking round into the faces of the three saw that her grandfathers words had come true they suspected her of having taken the life in saving which she had nearly lost her own she looked round at them with awe in her face and then without saying a word preceded them down the path what had she to answer when such a charge as that was made against her if they chose to say that she pushed him into the pool and hit him with her hook as he lay amidst the waters how could she show that it was not so poor mally knew little of the law of evidence and it seemed to her that she was in their hands but as she went down the steep track with a hurried step a step so quick that they could not keep up with her her heart was very full very full and very high she had striven for the mans life as though he had been her brother the blood was yet not dry on her own legs and arms where she had torn them in his service at one moment she had felt sure that she would die with him in that pool and now they said that she had murdered him it may be that he was not dead and what would he say if ever he should speak again then she thought of that moment when his eyes had opened and he had seemed to see her she had no fear for herself for her heart was very high but it was full also full of scorn disdain and wrath when she had reached the bottom she stood close to the door of the hut waiting for them so that they might precede her to the other group which was there in front of them at a little distance on the sand he is there and dada is with him go and look at him said mally the father and mother ran on stumbling over the stones but mally remained behind by the door of the hut barty gunliffe was lying on the sand where mally had left him and old malachi trenglos was standing over him resting himself with difficulty upon a stick not a move hes moved since she left him said he not a move i put his head on the old rug as you see and i tried un with a drop of gin but he wouldnt take it he wouldnt take it oh my boy my boy said the mother throwing herself beside her son upon the sand haud your tongue woman said the father kneeling down slowly by the lads head whimpering that way will do un no good then having gazed for a minute or two upon the pale face beneath him he looked up sternly into that of malachi trenglos the old man hardly knew how to bear this terrible inquisition he would come said malachi he brought it all upon hisself who was it struck him said the father sure he struck hisself as he fell among the breakers liar said the father looking up at the old man they have murdered him they have murdered him shrieked the mother haud your peace woman said the husband again they shall give us blood for blood mally leaning against the corner of the hovel heard it all but did not stir they might say what they liked they might make it out to be murder they might drag her and her grandfather to camelford gaol and then to bodmin and the gallows but they could not take from her the conscious feeling that was her own she had done her best to save him her very best and she had saved him she remembered her threat to him before they had gone down on the rocks together and her evil wish those words had been very wicked but since that she had risked her life to save his they might say what they pleased of her and do what they pleased she knew what she knew then the father raised his sons head and shoulders in his arms and called on the others to assist him in carrying barty towards the path they raised him between them carefully and tenderly and lifted their burden on towards the spot at which mally was standing she never moved but watched them at their work and the old man followed them hobbling after them with his crutch when they had reached the end of the hut she looked upon bartys face and saw that it was very pale there was no longer blood upon the forehead but the great gash was to be seen there plainly with its jagged cut and the skin livid and blue round the orifice his light brown hair was hanging back as she had made it to hang when she had gathered it with her hand after the big wave had passed over them ah how beautiful he was in mallys eyes with that pale face and the sad scar upon his brow she turned her face away that they might not see her tears but she did not move nor did she speak but now when they had passed the end of the hut shuffling along with their burden she heard a sound which stirred her she roused herself quickly from her leaning posture and stretched forth her head as though to listen then she moved to follow them yes they had stopped at the bottom of the path and had again laid the body on the rocks she heard that sound again as of a long long sigh and then regardless of any of them she ran to the wounded mans head he is not dead she said there he is not dead as she spoke bartys eyes opened and he looked about him barty my boy speak to me said the mother barty turned his face upon his mother smiled and then stared about him wildly how is it with thee lad said his father then barty turned his face again to the latter voice and as he did so his eyes fell upon mally mally he said mally it could have wanted nothing further to any of those present to teach them that according to bartys own view of the case mally had not been his enemy and in truth mally herself wanted no further triumph that word had vindicated her and she withdrew back to the hut dada she said barty is not dead and im thinking they wont say anything more about our hurting him old glos shook his head he was glad the lad hadnt met his death there he didnt want the young mans blood but he knew what folk would say the poorer he was the more sure the world would be to trample on him mally said what she could to comfort him being full of comfort herself she would have crept up to the farm if she dared to ask how barty was but her courage failed her when she thought of that so she went to work again dragging back the weed she had saved to the spot at which on the morrow she would load the donkey as she did this she saw bartys pony still standing patiently under the rock so she got a lock of fodder and threw it down before the beast it had become dark down in the cove but she was still dragging back the seaweed when she saw the glimmer of a lantern coming down the pathway it was a most unusual sight for lanterns were not common down in malachis cove down came the lantern rather slowly much more slowly than she was in the habit of descending and then through the gloom she saw the figure of a man standing at the bottom of the path she went up to him and saw that it was mr gunliffe the father is that mally said gunliffe yes it is mally and how is barty mr gunliffe you must come to un yourself now at once said the farmer he wont sleep a wink till hes seed you you must not say but youll come sure ill come if im wanted said mally gunliffe waited a moment thinking that mally might have to prepare herself but mally needed no preparation she was dripping with salt water from the weed which she had been dragging and her elfin locks were streaming wildly from her head but such as she was she was ready dadas in bed she said and i can go now if you please then gunliffe turned round and followed her up the path wondering at the life which this girl led so far away from all her sex it was now dark night and he had found her working at the very edge of the rolling waves by herself in the darkness while the only human being who might seem to be her protector had already gone to his bed when they were at the top of the cliff gunliffe took her by her hand and led her along she did not comprehend this but she made no attempt to take her hand from his something he said about falling on the cliffs but it was muttered so lowly that mally hardly understood him but in truth the man knew that she had saved his boys life and that he had injured her instead of thanking her he was now taking her to his heart and as words were wanting to him he was showing his love after this silent fashion he held her by the hand as though she were a child and mally tripped along at his side asking him no questions when they were at the farm yard gate he stopped there for a moment mally my girl he said hell not be content till he sees thee but thou must not stay long wi him lass doctor says hes weak like and wants sleep badly mally merely nodded her head and then they entered the house mally had never been within it before and looked about with wondering eyes at the furniture of the big kitchen did any idea of her future destiny flash upon her then i wonder but she did not pause here a moment but was led up to the bed room above stairs where barty was lying on his mothers bed is it mally herself said the voice of the weak youth its mally herself said the mother so now you can say what you please mally said he mally its along of you that im alive this moment ill not forget it on her said the father with his eyes turned away from her ill never forget it on her we hadnt a one but only him said the mother with her apron up to her face mally youll be friends with me now said barty to have been made lady of the manor of the cove for ever mally couldnt have spoken a word now it was not only that the words and presence of the people there cowed her and made her speechless but the big bed and the looking glass and the unheard of wonders of the chamber made her feel her own insignificance but she crept up to bartys side and put her hand upon his ill come and get the weed mally but it shall all be for you said barty indeed you wont then barty dear said the mother youll never go near the awsome place again what would we do if you were took from us he mustnt go near the hole if he does said mally speaking at last in a solemn voice and imparting the knowledge which she had kept to herself while barty was her enemy specially not if the winds any way from the norrard shed better go down now said the father barty kissed the hand which he held and mally looking at him as he did so thought that he was like an angel youll come and see us to morrow mally said he to this she made no answer but followed mrs gunliffe out of the room when they were down in the kitchen the mother had tea for her and thick milk and a hot cake all the delicacies which the farm could afford i dont know that mally cared much for the eating and drinking that night but she began to think that the gunliffes were good people very good people it was better thus at any rate than being accused of murder and carried off to camelford prison ill never forget it on her never the father had said those words stuck to her from that moment and seemed to sound in her ears all the night how glad she was that barty had come down to the cove oh yes how glad there was no question of his dying now and as for the blow on his forehead what harm was that to a lad like him but father shall go with you said mrs gunliffe when mally prepared to start for the cove by herself mally however would not hear of this she could find her way to the cove whether it was light or dark mally thou art my child now and i shall think of thee so said the mother as the girl went off by herself mally thought of this too as she walked home how could she become mrs gunliffes child ah how i need not i think tell the tale any further that mally did become mrs gunliffes child and how she became so the reader will understand and in process of time the big kitchen and all the wonders of the farmhouse were her own the people said that barty gunliffe had married a mermaid out of the sea but when it was said in mallys hearing i doubt whether she liked it and when barty himself would call her a mermaid she would frown at him and throw about her black hair and pretend to cuff him with her little hand old glos was brought up to the top of the cliff and lived his few remaining days under the roof of mr gunliffes house and as for the cove and the right of seaweed from that time forth all that has been supposed to attach itself to gunliffes farm and i do not know that any of the neighbours are prepared to dispute the right illustration text decoration the widows mite illustration text decoration the widows mite but im not a widow and i havent got two mites my dear you are a widow and you have got two mites ill tell both of you something that will astonish you ive made a calculation and i find that if everybody in england would give up their christmas dinner that is in scotland and ireland too they never have any in ireland bob hold your tongue till ive done charley they do have christmas dinners in ireland its pretty nearly the only day that they do and i dont count much upon them either but if everybody gave up his special christmas dinner and dined as he does on other days the saving would amount to two millions and a half charley whistled two millions and a half is a large sum of money said mrs granger the elder lady of the party those calculations never do any good said the younger lady who had declared herself not to be a widow those calculations do a great deal of good continued bob carrying on his argument with continued warmth they show us what a great national effort would do a little national effort i should call that said mrs granger but i should doubt the two millions and a half half a crown a head on thirty million people would do it you are to include all the beer wine and whisky but suppose you take off one fifth for the babies and young girls who dont drink thank you bob said the younger lady nora field by name and two more fifths for the poor who havent got the half crown a head said the elder lady and youd ruin the grocer and butcher said charley and never get your half crown after all said nora it need hardly be said that the subject under discussion was the best mode of abstracting from the pockets of the non suffering british public a sufficiency of money to sustain the suffering portion during the period of the cotton famine mr granger was the rector of plumstock a parish in cheshire sufficiently near to the manufacturing districts to give to every incident of life at that time a colouring taken from the distress of the neighbourhood which had not however itself ever depended on cotton for plumstock boasted that it was purely agricultural mr granger was the chairman of a branch relief committee which had its centre in liverpool and the subject of the destitution with the different modes by which it might be should be or should not be relieved were constantly under discussion in the rectory mr granger himself was a practical man somewhat hard in his manners but by no means hard in his heart who had in these times taken upon himself the business of alms begging on a large scale he declined to look at the matter in a political statistical or economical point of view and answered all questions as to rates rates in aid loans and the consolidated fund with a touch of sarcasm which showed the bent of his own mind ive no doubt youll have settled all that in the wisest possible way by the time that the war is over and the river full of cotton again father bob replied pointing across the cheshire flats to the mersey that river will never again be full of american cotton it will be all the same for the present purpose if it comes from india said the rector declining all present argument on the great american question to collect alms was his immediate work and he would do nothing else five pound notes sovereigns half crowns shillings and pence in search of these he was urgent we may almost say day and night begging with a pertinacity which was disagreeable but irresistible the man who gave him five sovereigns instantly became the mark for another petition when you have got your dinner you have not done with the butcher for ever he would say in answer to reproaches of course we must go on as long as this thing lasts then his friends and neighbours buttoned up their pockets but mr granger would extract coin from them even when buttoned the two young men who had taken part in the above argument were his sons the elder charles was at oxford but now in these christmas days for christmas was close at hand had come home bob the second son was in a merchants house in liverpool intending to become in the fulness of time a british merchant prince it had been hinted to him however more than once that if he would talk a little less and work a little harder the path to his princedom would be quicker found than if his present habits were maintained nora field was mrs grangers niece she was miss field and certainly not a widow in the literal sense of the word but she was about to become a bride a few weeks after christmas it is spoil from the amalekites mr granger had said when she had paid in some contribution from her slender private stores to his treasury spoil from the amalekites and therefore the more precious he had called nora fields two sovereigns spoil from the amalekites because she was about to marry an american frederic frew or frederic f frew as he delighted to hear himself called for he had been christened franklin as well as frederic and to an american it is always a point of honour that at any rate the initial of his second christian name should be remembered by all men was a pennsylvanian from philadelphia a strong democrat according to the politics of his own country hating the republicans as the tories used to hate the whigs among us before political feeling had become extinct speaking against lincoln the president and seward his minister and the fremonts and sumners and philipses and beechers of the republican party fine hard racy words of powerful condemnation such as used to be spoken against earl grey and his followers but nevertheless as steady for the war as lincoln or seward or any republican of them all as steady for the war and as keen in his bitterness against england his father had been a partner in a house of business of which the chief station had been in liverpool that house had now closed its transactions and young frew was living and intended to live an easy idle life on the moderate fortune which had been left to him but the circumstances of his family affairs had made it necessary for him to pass many months in liverpool and during that sojourn he had become engaged to nora field he had travelled much going everywhere with his eyes open as americans do he knew many things had read many books and was decided in his opinion on most subjects he was good looking too and well mannered was kindly hearted and capable of much generosity but he was hard keen in his intelligence but not broad in genius thin and meagre in his aspirations not looking to or even desirous of anything great but indulging a profound contempt for all that is very small he was a well instructed but by no means learned man who greatly despised those who were ignorant i fear that he hated england in his heart but he did not hate nora field and was about to make her his wife in three or four weeks from the present time when nora declared to her aunt that she was not a widow and that she possessed no two mites and when her aunt flatly contradicted her stating that she was a widow and did possess two mites they had not intended to be understood by each other literally it was an old dispute between them what the widow gave said nora she gave off her own poor back and therefore was very cold she gave it out of her own poor mouth and was very hungry afterwards in consequence i have given my two pounds but i shall not be cold or hungry i wish i was a widow with two mites only the question is whether i should not keep them for my own back after all and thus gain nothing by the move as to that replied her aunt i cannot speak but the widowhood and the two mites are there for us all if we choose to make use of them in these days said bob the widows with two mites should not be troubled at all we can do it all without them if we go to work properly if you had read your bible properly sir said mrs granger you would understand that the widows would not thank you for the exemption i dont want the widows to thank me i only want to live and allow others to live according to the existing circumstances of the world it was manifest from bobs tone that he regarded his mother as little better than an old fogey in january nora was to become mrs frederic f frew and be at once taken away to new worlds new politics and new loves and hatreds like a true honest hearted girl as she was she had already become half an american in spirit she was an old union american and as such was strong against the south and in return for her fervour in that matter her future husband consented to abstain from any present loud abuse of things english and generously allowed her to defend her own country when it was abused this was much as coming from an american let us hope that the same privilege may be accorded to her in her future home in philadelphia but in the meantime during these last weeks of her girlhood these cold cruel weeks of desperate want she strove vigorously to do what little might be in her power for the poor of the country she was leaving all this want had been occasioned by the wretched rebels of the south this was her theory and she was right in much of this whether the americans of the south are wretched or are rebels we will not say here but of this there can be no doubt that they created all the misery which we then endured but i have no way of making myself a widow she said again uncle robert would not let me give away the cloak he gave me the other day he would have to give you another said mrs granger exactly it is not so easy after all to be a widow with two mites nora field had no fortune of her own nor was her uncle in a position to give her any he was not a poor man but like many men who are not poor he had hardly a pound of his own in the shape of ready money to nora and to her cousins and to certain other first cousins of the same family had been left some eighteen months since by a grand aunt a hundred pounds a piece and with this hundred pounds nora was providing for herself her wedding trousseau a hundred pounds do not go far in such provision as some young married women who may read this will perhaps acknowledge but mr frederic f frew had been told all about it and he was contented miss field was fond of nice clothes and had been tempted more than once to wish that her great aunt had left them all two hundred pounds a piece instead of one if i were to cast in my wedding veil said nora that will be your husbands property said her aunt ah but before im married then why have it at all it is ordered you know couldnt you bedizen yourself with one made of false lace said her uncle frew would never find it out and that would be a most satisfactory spoiling of the amalekite he isnt an amalekite uncle robert or if he is im another just so and therefore false lace will be quite good enough for you molly mrs grangers name was molly ive promised to let them have the use of the great boiler in the back kitchen once a week and you are to furnish them with fuel oh dear said mrs granger upon whose active charity this loan of her own kitchen boiler made a strain that was almost too severe but she recovered herself in half a minute very well my dear but you wont expect any dinner on that day no i shall expect no dinner only some food in the rough you may boil that in the copper too if you like it you know my dear you dont like anything boiled as for that molly i dont suppose any of them like it theyd all prefer roast mutton the copper will be your two mites whispered the niece only i have not thrown them in of my own accord said mrs granger mr frew who was living in liverpool always came over to plumstock on friday evening and spent saturday and sunday with the rector and his family for him those saturdays were happy days for frederick f frew was a good lover he liked to be with nora to walk with her and to talk with her he liked to show her that he loved her and to make himself gracious and pleasant i am not so sure that his coming was equally agreeable to mr granger mr frew would talk about american politics praising the feeling and spirit of his countrymen in the north whereas mr granger when driven into the subject was constrained to make a battle for the south all his prejudices and what he would have called his judgment went with the south and he was not ashamed of his opinion but he disliked arguing with frederic f frew i fear it must be confessed that frederic f frew was too strong for him in such arguments why it should be so i cannot say but an american argues more closely on politics than does an englishman his convictions are not the truer on that account very often the less true as are the conclusions of a logician because he trusts to syllogisms which are often false instead of to the experience of his life and daily workings of his mind but though not more true in his political convictions than an englishman he is more unanswerable and therefore mr granger did not care to discuss the subject of the american war with frederic f frew it riles me frew said as he sat after dinner in the plumstock drawing room on the friday evening before christmas day to hear your folks talking of our elections they think the war will come to an end and the rebels of the south have their own way because the democrats have carried their ticket it will have that tendency said the parson not an inch any more than your carrying the reform bill or repealing the corn laws had a tendency to put down the throne its the same sort of argument your two parties were at daggers drawn about the reform bill but that did not cause you to split on all other matters but the throne wasnt in question said the parson nor is the war in question not in that way the most popular democrat in the states at this moment is mclellan and they say no one is so anxious to see the war ended whoever says so slanders him if you dont trust his deeds look at his words i believe in neither said the parson then put him aside as a nobody but you cant do that for he is the man whom the largest party in the northern states trusts most implicitly the fact is sir and frederic f frew gave the proper twang to the last letter of the last word you none of you here understand our politics you cant realise the blessing of a molly give me some tea said the rector in a loud voice when matters went as far as this he did not care by what means he stopped the voice of his future relative all i say is this continued frew you will find out your mistake if you trust to the democratic elections to put an end to the war and bring cotton back to liverpool and what is to put an end to the war asked nora victory and union said frederic f frew exhaustion said charley from oxford compromise said bobby from liverpool the lord almighty when he shall have done his work said the parson and in the meantime molly do you keep plenty of fire under the kitchen boiler that was clearly the business of the present hour for all in mr grangers part of the country we may say indeed for all on mr grangers side of the water it mattered little then in lancashire whether new york might have a democratic or a republican governor the old cotton had been burned the present crop could not be garnered the future crop the crop which never would be future could not get itself sown mr granger might be a slow politician but he was a practical man understanding the things immediately around him and they all were aware frederic f frew with the rest of them that he was right when he bade his wife keep the fire well hot beneath the kitchen boiler isnt it almost wicked to be married in such a time as this it was much later in the evening when nora still troubled in her mind about her widows mite whispered these words into her lovers ears if she were to give up her lover for twelve months would not that be a throwing in of something to the treasury from off her own back and out of her own mouth but then this matter of her marriage had been so fully settled that she feared to think of disturbing it he would never consent to such a postponement and then the offering to be of avail for her must be taken from her own back not from his and nora had an idea that in the making of such an offering as that suggested mr frederic f frew would conceive that he had contributed by far the greater part her uncle called him an amalekite and she doubted whether it would be just to spoil an amalekite after such a fashion as that nevertheless into his ears she whispered her little proposition wicked to get married said frederic not according to my idea of the christian religion oh but you know what i mean and she gave his arm a slight caressing pinch at this time her uncle had gone to his own room her cousins had gone to their studies by which i believe they intended to signify the proper smoking of a pipe of tobacco in the rectory kitchen and mrs granger seated in her easy chair had gone to her slumbers dreaming of the amount of fuel with which that kitchen boiler must be supplied i shall bring a breach of promise against you said frederic if you dont appear in church with bridal array on monday the th of january and pay the penalty into the war treasury that would be a spoiling of the amalekite then he got hold of the fingers which had pinched him of course i shant put it off unless you agree of course you wont but dear fred dont you think we ought no certainly not if i thought you were in earnest i would scold you i am in earnest quite you need not look in that way for you know very well how truly i love you you know i want to be your wife above all things do you and then he began to insinuate his arm round her waist but she got up and moved away not as in anger at his caress but as showing that the present moment was unfit for it i do she said above all things i love you so well that i could hardly bear to see you go away again without taking me with you i could hardly bear it but i could bear it could you then i couldnt im a weaker vessel than you and your strength must give way to my weakness i know ive no right to tax you if you really care about it frederic f frew made no answer to this in words but pursued her in her retreat from the sofa on which they had sat dont fred i am so much in earnest i wish i knew what i ought to do to throw in my two mites not throw me over certainly and break all the promises you have made for the last twelve months you cant be in earnest its out of the question you know oh i am in earnest i never heard of such a thing in my life what good would it do it wouldnt bring the cotton in it wouldnt feed the poor it wouldnt keep your aunts boiler hot no that it wouldnt said mrs granger starting up and coals are such a terrible price then she went to sleep again and ordered in large supplies in her dreams but i should have done as much as the widow did indeed i should fred oh dear to have to give you up but i only meant for a year as you are so very fond of me of course im fond of you should i let you do like that if i was not at the moment of her speaking he had again got his arm round her waist then im too charitable to allow you to postpone your happiness for a day well look at it in that way you wont understand me or rather you do understand me and pretend that you dont which is very wrong i always was very wicked then why dont you make yourself better do not you too wish to be a widow you ought to wish it i should like to have an opportunity of trying married life first i wont stay any longer with you sir because you are scoffing aunt im going to bed then she returned again across the room and whispered to her lover ill tell you what sir ill marry you on monday the th of january if youll take me just as i am now with a bonnet on and a shawl over my dress exactly as i walked out with you before dinner when i made the promise i never said anything about fine clothes you may come in an old red cloak if you like it very well now mind ive got your consent good night sir after all it will only be half a mite she had turned towards the door and had her hand upon the lock but she came back into the room close up to him it will not be a quarter of a mite she said how can it be anything if i get you then she kissed him and hurried away out of the room before he could again speak to her what what what said mrs granger waking up so nora has gone has she gone yes just this minute said frew who had turned his face to the fire so that the tear in his eyes might not be seen as he took himself off to his bed he swore to himself that nora field was a trump and that he had done well in securing for himself such a wife but it never occurred to him that she was in any way in earnest about her wedding dress she was a trump because she was so expressive in her love to himself and because her eyes shone so brightly when she spoke eagerly on any matter but as to her appearing at the altar in a red cloak or as was more probable in her own customary thick woollen shawl he never thought about it of course she would be married as other girls are married nor had nora thought of it till that moment in which she made the proposition to her lover as she had said before her veil was ordered and so was her white silk dress her bonnet also had been ordered with its bridal wreath and the other things assorting therewith a vast hole was to be made in her grand aunts legacy for the payment of all this finery but as mrs granger had said to her in so spending it she would best please her future husband he had enough of his own and would not care that she should provide herself with articles which he could afterwards give her at the expense of that little smartness at his wedding which an american likes at any rate as well as an englishman nora with an honesty which some ladies may not admire had asked her lover the question in the plainest language you will have to buy my things so much the sooner she had said id buy them all to morrow only youll not let me i should rather think not master fred then she had gone off with her aunt and ordered her wedding clothes but now as she prepared for bed after the conversation which has just been recorded she began to think in earnest whether it would not be well to dispense with white silk and orange wreaths while so many were dispensing with were forced to dispense with bread and fuel could she bedizen herself with finery from liverpool while her uncle was as she well knew refusing himself a set of new shirts which he wanted sorely in order that he might send to the fund at liverpool the money which they would cost him he was throwing in his two mites daily as was her aunt who toiled unceasingly at woollen shawls and woollen stockings so that she went on knitting even in her sleep but she nora since the earnestness of these bad days began had done little or nothing her needle indeed had been very busy but it had been busy in preparation for mr frederic f frews nuptials even bob and charley worked for the relief committee but she had done nothing nothing but given her two pounds she had offered four but her uncle with a self restraint never before or afterwards practised by him had chucked her back two saying that he would not be too hard even upon an amalekite as she thought of the word she asked herself whether it was not more incumbent on her than on any one else to do something in the way of self sacrifice she was now a briton but would shortly be an american should it be said of her that the distress of her own countrywomen the countrywomen whom she was leaving did not wring her heart it was not without a pang that she prepared to give up that nationality which all its owners rank as the first in the world and most of those who do not own it rank if not as the first then as the second now it seemed to her as though she were deserting her own family in its distress deserting her own ship in the time of its storm and she was going over to those from whom this distress and this storm had come was it not needful that she should do something that she should satisfy herself that she had been willing to suffer in the cause she would throw in her two mites if she did but know where to find them i could only do it in truth she said to herself as she rose from her prayers by throwing in him i have got one very great treasure but i have not got anything else that i care about after all it isnt so easy to be a widow with two mites then she sat down and thought about it as to postponing her marriage that she knew to be in truth quite out of the question even if she could bring herself to do it everybody about her would say that she was mad and mr frederic f frew might not impossibly destroy himself with one of those pretty revolvers which he sometimes brought out from liverpool for her to play with but was it not practicable for her to give up her wedding clothes there would be considerable difficulty even in this as to their having been ordered that might be overcome by the sacrifice of some portion of the price but then her aunt and even her uncle would oppose her her cousins would cover her with ridicule in the latter she might however achieve something of her widowhood and after all the loss would fall more upon f f frew than upon herself she really did not care for herself in what clothes she was married so that she was made his wife but as regarded him might it not be disagreeable to him to stand before the altar with a dowdy creature in an old gown and then there was one other consideration would it not seem that she was throwing in her two mites publicly before the eyes of all men as a pharisee might do it would there not be an ostentation in her widowhood but as she continued to reflect she cast this last thought behind her it might be so said of her but if such saying were untrue if the offering were made in a widows spirit and not in the spirit of a pharisee would it not be cowardly to regard what men might say such false accusation would make some part of the two mites ill go into liverpool about it on monday she said to herself as she finally tucked the clothes around her early in the following morning she was up and out of her room with a view of seeing her aunt before she came down to breakfast but the first person she met was her uncle he accosted her in one of the passages what nora this is early for you are you going to have a morning lovers walk with frederic franklin frederic franklin as you choose to call him uncle said nora never comes out of his room much before breakfast time and its raining hard such a lover as he is ought not to mind rain but i should mind it very much but uncle i want to speak to you very seriously i have been making up my mind about something theres nothing wrong is there my dear no theres nothing very wrong it is not exactly about anything being wrong i hardly know how to tell you what it is and then she paused and he could see by the light of the candle in his hand that she blushed hadnt you better speak to your aunt said mr granger thats what i meant to do when i got up said nora but as i have met you if you dont mind he assured her that he did not mind and putting his hand upon her shoulder caressingly promised her any assistance in his power im not afraid that you will ask anything i ought not to do for you then she revealed to him her scheme turning her face away from him as she spoke it will be so horrid she said to have a great box of finery coming home when you are all giving up everything for the poor people and if you dont think it would be wrong it cant be wrong said her uncle it may be a question whether it would be wise i mean wrong to him if it was to be any other clergyman i should be ashamed of it but as you are to marry us i dont think you need mind about the clergyman and of course i should tell the foster girls the foster girls yes they are to be my bridesmaids and i am nearly sure they have not bought anything new yet of course they would think it all very dowdy but i dont care a bit about that i should just tell them that we had all made up our minds that we couldnt afford wedding clothes that would be true wouldnt it but the question is about that wild american he isnt a wild american well then about that tamed american what will he say he said i might come in an old cloak you have told him then but i am afraid he thought i was only joking but uncle if youll help me i think i can bring him round i dare say you can to anything just at present i didnt at all mean that indeed im sure i couldnt bring him round to putting off the marriage no no no not to that to anything else i know you are laughing at me but i dont much mind being laughed at i should save very nearly fifteen pounds if not quite think of that and youd give it all to the soup kitchen id give it all to you for the distress then her uncle spoke to her somewhat gravely youre a good girl nora a dear good girl i think i understand your thoughts on this matter and i love you for them but i doubt whether there be any necessity for you to make this sacrifice a marriage should be a gala festival according to the means of the people married and the bridegroom has a right to expect that his bride shall come to him fairly arrayed and bright with wedding trappings i think we can do my pet without robbing you of your little braveries oh as for that of course you can do without me there was a little soreness in her tone not because she was feeling herself to be misunderstood but because she knew that she could not explain herself further she could not tell her uncle that the poor among the jews might have been relieved without the contribution of those two mites but that the widow would have lost all had she not so contributed she had hardly arranged her thoughts as to the double blessing of charity and certainly could not express them with reference to her own case but she felt the need of giving in this time of trouble something that she herself valued she was right when she had said that it was hard to be a widow how many among us when we give give from off our own backs and from out of our own mouths who can say that he has sacrificed a want of his own that he has abandoned a comfort that he has worn a threadbare coat when coats with their gloss on have been his customary wear that he has fared roughly on cold scraps whereas a well spread board has been his usual daily practice he who has done so has thrown in his two mites and for him will charity produce her double blessing nora thought that it was not well in her uncle to tell her that he could do without her wedding clothes of course he could do without them but she soon threw those words behind her and went back upon the words which had preceded them the bridegroom has a right to expect that the bride shall come to him fairly arrayed after all that must depend upon circumstances suppose the bride had no means of arraying herself fairly without getting into debt what would the bridegroom expect in that case if hell consent you will she said as she prepared to leave her uncle youll drive him to offer to pay for the thing himself i dare say he will and then hell drive me to refuse you may be quite sure of this uncle that whatever clothes i do wear he will never see the bill of them and then that conference was ended ive made that calculation again said bob at breakfast and i feel convinced that if an act of parliament could be passed restricting the consumption of food in christmas week the entire week mind to that of ordinary weeks we should get two millions of money and that those two millions would tide us over till the indian cotton comes in of course i mean by food butchers meat groceries spirits and wines only think that by one measure which would not entail any real disappointment on any one the whole thing would be done but the act of parliament wouldnt give us the money said his father of course i dont really mean an act of parliament that would be absurd but the people might give up their christmas dinners a great many will no doubt many of those most in earnest are pretty nearly giving up their daily dinners those who are indifferent will go on feasting the same as ever you cant make a sacrifice obligatory it would be no sacrifice if you did said nora still thinking of her wedding clothes i doubt whether sacrifices ever do any real good said frederick f frew oh fred said nora we have rather high authority as to the benefit of self denial said the parson a man who cant sacrifice himself must be selfish said bobby and we are all agreed to hate selfish people and what about the widows mite said mrs granger thats all very well and you may knock me down with the bible if you like as you might do also if i talked about pre adamite formations i believe every word of the bible but i do not believe that i understand it all thoroughly you might understand it better if you studied it more said the parson very likely i wont be so uncourteous as to say the same thing of my elders but now about these sacrifices you wouldnt wish to keep people in distress that you might benefit yourself by releasing them but the people in distress are there said nora they oughtnt to be there and as your self sacrifices after all are very insufficient to prevent distress there certainly seems to be a question open whether some other mode should not be tried give me the country in which the humanitarian principle is so exercised that no one shall be degraded by the receipt of charity it seems to me that you like poor people here in england that you may gratify yourselves by giving them not as much to eat as they want but just enough to keep their skins from falling off their bones charity may have its double blessing but it may also have its double curse not charity mr frew said mrs granger look at your lady bountifuls of course it depends on the heart continued the lady but charity if it be charity ill tell you what said frederic f frew interrupting her in philadelphia which in some matters is the best organised city i know im going down to the village said the parson jumping up who is to come with me and he escaped out of the room before frew had had an opportunity of saying a word further about philadelphia thats the way with your uncle always said he turning to nora almost in anger it certainly is the most conclusive argument i know that of running away mr granger meant it to be conclusive said the elder lady but the pity is that it never convinces mr granger probably had no desire of convincing ah well it does not signify said frew when a man has a pulpit of his own why should he trouble himself to argue in any place where counter arguments must be met and sustained nora was almost angry with her lover whom she regarded as stronger and more clever than any of her uncles family but tyrannical and sometimes overbearing in the use of his strength one by one her aunt and cousin left the room and she was left alone with him he had taken up a newspaper as a refuge in his wrath for in truth he did not like the manner in which his allusions to his own country were generally treated at the parsonage there are englishmen who think that every man differing with them is bound to bet with them on any point in dispute then you decline to back your opinion such men say when the bet is refused the feeling of an american is the same as to those who are unwilling to argue with him he considers that every intelligent being is bound to argue whenever matter of argument is offered to him nor can he understand that any subject may be too sacred for argument frederic f frew on the present occasion was as a dog from whose very mouth a bone had been taken he had given one or two loud open growls and now sat with his newspaper showing his teeth as far as the spirit of the thing went and it was in this humour that nora found herself called upon to attack him on the question of her own proposed charity she knew well that he could bark even at her if things went wrong with him but then he never bites she said to herself he had told her that she might come to her wedding in an old cloak if she pleased but she had understood that there was nothing serious in this permission now at this very moment it was incumbent on her to open his eyes to the reality of her intention fred she said are you reading that newspaper because you are angry with me i am reading the newspaper because i want to know what there is in it you know all that now just as well as it you had written it put it down sir and she put her hand on to the top of the sheet if we are to be married in three weeks time i expect that you will be a little attentive to me now youll read as many papers as you like after that no doubt upon my word nora i think your uncle is the most unfair man i ever met in my life perhaps he thinks the same of you and that will make it equal he cant think the same of me i defy him to think that im unfair theres nothing so unfair as hitting a blow and then running away when the time comes for receiving a counterblow its what your lord chatham did and he never ought to have been listened to in parliament again thats a long time ago said nora who probably felt that her lover should not talk to her about lord chatham just three weeks before their marriage i dont know that the time makes any difference ah but i have got something else that i want to speak about and fred you mustnt turn up your nose at what we are all doing here as to giving away things i mean i dont turn up my nose at it havent i been begging of every american in liverpool till im ashamed of myself i know you have been very good and now you must be more good still good to me specially i mean that isnt being good thats only being foolish what little ceremony had led to this last assertion i need not perhaps explain fred im an englishwoman to day but in a months time i shall be an american i hope so nora heart and soul yes that is what i mean whatever is my husbands country must be mine and you know how well i love your country do you not i never run away when you talk to me about philadelphia do i and you know how i admire all your institutions my institutions as they will be now i know youre going to ask some very great favour yes i am and i dont mean to be refused master fred im to be an american almost to morrow but as yet i am an englishwoman and i am bound to do what little i can before i leave my country dont you think so i dont quite understand well its about my wedding clothes it does seem stupid talking about them i know but i want you to let me do without them altogether now youve got the plain truth i want to give uncle robert the money for his soup kitchen and to be married just as i am now i do not care one straw what any other creature in the world may say about it so long as i do not displease you i think its nonsense nora oh fred dont say so i have set my heart upon it ill do anything for you afterwards indeed for the matter of that id do anything on earth for you whether you agree or whether you do not you know that but nora you wouldnt wish to make yourself appear foolish how much money will you save very nearly twenty pounds altogether let me give you twenty pounds so that you may leave it with your uncle by way of your two mites as you call it no no certainly not i might just as well send you the milliners bill might i not i dont see why you shouldnt do that ah but i do you wouldnt wish me to be guilty of the pretence of giving a thing away and then doing it out of your pocket i have no doubt that what you were saying about the evil of promiscuous charity is quite true and then as she flattered him with this wicked flattery she looked up with her bright eyes into his face but now as the things are we must be charitable or the people will die i feel almost like a rat leaving a falling house in going away at this time and if you would postpone it nora then i must be like a rat but i wont be a rat in a white silk gown come now say that you agree i never asked you for anything before everybody will think that youre mad and that im mad and that we are all mad together because i go to church in a merino dress well if that makes madness let us be mad oh fred do not refuse me the first thing ive asked you what difference will it make nobody will know it over in philadelphia then you are ashamed of it no not ashamed why should i be ashamed but one does not wish to have that sort of thing talked about by everybody and you are so strong minded nora that you do not care about finery yourself fred thats ill natured you know very well what my feelings are you are sharp enough to understand them without any further explanation i do like finery quite well enough as youll find out to your cost some day and if ever you scold me for extravagance i shall tell you about this its downright quixotism quixotism leads to nothing but this will lead to twenty pounds worth of soup and to something else too when he pressed her to explain what that something else was she declined to speak further on the subject she could not tell him that the satisfaction she desired was that of giving up something of having made a sacrifice of having thrown into the treasury her two mites two mites off her own back as she had said to her aunt and out of her own mouth he had taxed her with indifference to a womans usual delight in gay plumage and had taxed her most unjustly he ought to know she said to herself that i should not take all this trouble about it unless i did care for it but in truth he did understand her motive thoroughly and half approved them he approved the spirit of self abandonment but disapproved the false political economy by which according to his light that spirit was accompanied after all said he the widow would have done better to have invested her small capital in some useful trade oh fred but never mind now i have your consent and now ive only got to talk over my aunt so saying she left her lover to turn over in his mind the first principles of that large question of charity the giving of pence and halfpence of scraps of bread and sups of soup is after all but the charity of a barbarous half civilised race a dog would let another dog starve before he gave him a bone and would see his starved fellow dog die without a pang we have just got beyond that only beyond that as long as we dole out sups of soup but charity when it shall have made itself perfect will have destroyed this little trade of giving which makes the giver vain and the receiver humble the charity of the large hearted is that which opens to every man the profit of his own industry to every man and to every woman then having gratified himself with the enunciation of this fine theory he allowed his mind to run away to a smaller subject and began to think of his own wedding garments if nora insisted on carrying out this project of hers in what guise must he appear on the occasion he also had ordered new clothes its just the sort of thing that theyll make a story of in chestnut street chestnut street as we all know is the west end of philadelphia when the morning came of the twelfth of january the morning that was to make nora field a married woman she had carried her point but she was not allowed to feel that she had carried it triumphantly her uncle had not forbidden her scheme but had never encouraged it her lover had hardly spoken to her on the subject since the day on which she had explained to him her intention after all its a mere bagatelle he had said i am not going to marry your clothes one of her cousins bob had approved but he had coupled his approval with an intimation that something should be done to prevent any other woman from wearing bridal wreaths for the next three months charley had condemned her altogether pointing out that it was bad policy to feed the cotton spinners at the expense of the milliners but the strongest opposition had come from her aunt and the miss fosters mrs granger though her heart was in the battle which her husband was fighting could not endure to think that all the time honoured ceremonies of her life should be abandoned in spite of all that was going on around her she had insisted on having mince pies on the table on christmas day true there were not many of them and they were small and flavourless but the mince pies were there with whisky to burn with them instead of brandy if any of the party chose to go through the ceremony and to her the idea of a wedding without wedding clothes was very grievous it was she who had told nora that she was a widow with two mites or might make herself one if she chose to encounter self sacrifice but in so saying she had by no means anticipated such a widowhood as this i really think nora you might have one of those thinner silks and you might do without a wreath but you should have a veil indeed you should but nora was obstinate having overcome her future lord and quieted her uncle she was not at all prepared to yield to the mild remonstrances of her aunt the two miss fosters were very much shocked and for three days there was a disagreeable coolness between them and the plumstock family a friends bridal is always an occasion for a new dress and the miss fosters naturally felt that they were being robbed of their rights sensible girl said old foster when he heard of it when youre married if ever you are i hope youll do the same indeed we wont papa said the two miss fosters but the coolness gradually subsided and the two miss fosters consented to attend in their ordinary sunday bonnets it had been decided that they should be married early at eight oclock that they should then go to the parsonage for breakfast and that the married couple should start for london immediately afterwards they were to remain there for a week and then return to liverpool for one other remaining week before their final departure for america i should only have had them on for about an hour if id got them and then it would have been almost dark she said to her aunt perhaps it wont signify very much her aunt replied then when the morning came it seemed that the sacrifice had dwindled down to a very little thing the two miss fosters had come to the parsonage over night and as they sat up with the bride over a bed room fire had been good natured enough to declare that they thought it would be very good fun you wont have to get up in the cold to dress me said nora because i can do it all myself that will be one comfort oh we shouldnt have minded that and as it is of course well turn you out nice youll wear one of your other new dresses wont you oh i dont know just what im to travel in it isnt very old do you know after all im not sure that it isnt a great deal better i suppose it will be the same thing in the end said the younger miss foster of course it will said the elder and there wont be all that bother of changing my dress said nora frederic f frew came out to plumstock by an early train from liverpool bringing with him a countryman of his own as his friend on the occasion it had been explained to the friend that he was to come in his usual habiliments oh nonsense said the friend i guess ill see you turned off in a new waistcoat but frederic f frew had made it understood that an old waistcoat was imperative its something about the cotton you know theyre all beside themselves here as though there was never going to be a bit more in the country to eat thats england all over never mind do you come just as if you were going into your counting house brown cotton gloves with a hole in the thumbs will be the thing i should say there were candles on the table when they were all assembled in the parsonage drawing room previous to the marriage the two gentlemen were there first then came mrs granger who rather frightened mr frew by kissing him and telling him that she should always regard him as a son in law nora has always been like one of ourselves you know she said apologisingly and let me tell you master frew said the parson that youre a very lucky fellow to get her i say isnt it cold said bob coming in where are the girls here are the girls said miss foster heading the procession of three which now entered the room nora of course being the last then nora was kissed by everybody including the strange american gentleman who seemed to have made some mistake as to his privilege in the matter but it all passed off very well and i doubt if nora knew who kissed her it was very cold and they were all wrapped close in their brown shawls and greatcoats and the women looked very snug and comfortable in their ordinary winter bonnets come said the parson we mustnt wait for charley hell follow us to church so the uncle took his niece on his arm and the two americans took the two bridesmaids and bob took his mother and went along the beaten path over the snow to the church and as they got to the door charley rushed after them quite out of breath i havent even got a pair of gloves at all he whispered to his mother it doesnt matter nobodys to know said mrs granger nora by this time had forgotten the subject of her dress altogether and it may be doubted if even the misses foster were as keenly alive to it as they thought they would have been for myself i think they all looked more comfortable on that cold winter morning without the finery which would have been customary than they could have done with it it had seemed to them all beforehand that a marriage without veils and wreaths without white gloves and new gay dresses would be but a triste affair but the idea passed away altogether when the occasion came mr granger and his wife and the two lads clustered around nora as they made themselves ready for the ceremony uttering words of warm love and it seemed as though even the clerk and the servants took nothing amiss frederic f frew had met with a rebuff in the hall of the parsonage in being forbidden to take his own bride under his own arm but when the time for action came he bore no malice but went through his work manfully on the whole it was a pleasant wedding homely affectionate full of much loving greeting but not without many sobs on the part of the bride and of mrs granger and some slight suspicion of an eagerly removed tear in the parsons eye but this at any rate was certain that the wedding clothes were not missed when they all sat down to their breakfast in the parsonage dining room that little matter had come to be clean forgotten no one knew not even the misses foster that there was anything extraordinary in their garb indeed as to all gay apparel we may say that we only miss it by comparison it is very sad to be the wearer of the only frock coat in company to carry the one solitary black silk handkerchief at a dinner party but i do not know but that a dozen men so arrayed do not seem to be as well dressed as though they had obeyed the latest rules of fashion as to their garments one thing however had been made secure that sum of twenty pounds saved from the milliners had been duly paid over into mr grangers hands it has been all very nice said mrs granger still sobbing when nora went up stairs to tie on her bonnet before she started only you are going yes im going now aunt dear aunt but aunt i have failed in one thing absolutely failed failed in what my darling there has been no widows mite it is not easy to be a widow with two mites what you have given will be blessed to you and blessed to those who will receive it i hope it may but i almost feel that i have been wrong in thinking of it so much it has cost me nothing i tell you aunt that it is not easy to be a widow with two mites when mrs granger was alone with her husband after this the two miss fosters having returned to liverpool under the discreet protection of the two young grangers for they had positively refused to travel with no other companion than the strange american she told him all that nora had said and who can tell us he replied that it was not the same with the widow herself she threw in all that she had but who can say that she suffered aught in consequence it is my belief that all that is given in a right spirit comes back instantly in this world with interest i wish my coals would come back said mrs granger perhaps you have not given them in a right spirit my dear illustration text decoration the last austrian who left venice illustration text decoration the last austrian who left venice in the spring and early summer of the year last past the year the hatred felt by venetians towards the austrian soldiers who held their city in thraldom had reached its culminating point for years this hatred had been very strong how strong can hardly be understood by those who never recognise the fact that there had been so to say no mingling of the conquered and the conquerors no process of assimilation between the italian vassals and their german masters venice as a city was as purely italian as though its barracks were filled with no hungarian long legged soldiers and its cafs crowded with no white coated austrian officers and the regiments which held the town lived as completely after their own fashion as though they were quartered in pesth or prague or vienna with this exception that in venice they were enabled and indeed from circumstances were compelled to exercise a palpable ascendency which belonged to them nowhere else they were masters daily visible as such to the eye of every one who merely walked the narrow ways of the city or strolled through the open squares and as masters they were as separate as the gaoler is separate from the prisoner the austrian officers sat together in the chief theatre having the best part of it to themselves few among them spoke italian none of the common soldiers did so the venetians seldom spoke german and could hold no intercourse whatever with the croats hungarians and bohemians of whom the garrison was chiefly composed it could not be otherwise than that there should be intense hatred in a city so ruled but the hatred which had been intense for years had reached its boiling point in the may preceding the outbreak of the war whatever other nations might desire to do italy at any rate was at this time resolved to fight it was not that the king and the government were so resolved what was the purpose just then of the powers of the state if any purpose had then been definitely formed by them no one now knows history perhaps may some day tell us but the nation was determined to fight hitherto all had been done for the italians by outside allies and now the time had come in which italians would do something for themselves the people hated the french aid by which they had been allowed to live and burned with a desire to prove that they could do something great without aid there was an enormous army and that army should be utilised for the enfranchisement of venetia and to the great glory of italy the king and the ministers appreciated the fact that the fervour of the people was too strong to be repressed and were probably guided to such resolutions as they did make by that appreciation the feeling was as strong in venice as it was in florence or in milan but in venice only or rather in venetia only all outward signs of such feeling were repressible and were repressed all through lombardy and tuscany any young man who pleased might volunteer with garibaldi but to volunteer with garibaldi was not at first so easy for young men in verona or in venice the more complete was this repression the greater was this difficulty the stronger of course arose the hatred of the venetians for the austrian soldiery i have never heard that the austrians were cruel in what they did but they were determined and as long as they had any intention of holding the province it was necessary that they should be so during the past winter there had been living in venice a certain captain von vincke hubert von vincke an austrian officer of artillery who had spent the last four or five years among the fortifications of verona and who had come to venice originally on account of ill health some military employment had kept him in venice and he remained there till the outbreak of the war going backwards and forwards occasionally to verona but still having venice as his head quarters now captain von vincke had shown so much consideration for the country which he assisted in holding under subjection as to learn its language and to study its manners and had by these means found his way more or less into italian society he was a thorough soldier good looking perhaps eight and twenty or thirty years of age well educated ambitious very free from the common vice of thinking that the class of mankind to which he belonged was the only class in which it would be worth a mans while to live but nevertheless imbued with a strong feeling that austria ought to hold her own that an austrian army was indomitable and that the quadrilateral fortresses bound together as they were now bound by austrian strategy were impregnable so much captain von vincke thought and believed on the part of his country but in thinking and believing this he was still desirous that much should be done to relieve austrian italy from the grief of foreign rule that italy should think of succeeding in repelling austria from venice was to him an absurdity he had become intimate at the house of a widow lady who lived in the campo san luca one signora pep whose son had first become acquainted with captain von vincke at verona carlo pep was a young advocate living and earning his bread at venice but business had taken him for a time to verona and when leaving that city he had asked his austrian friend to come and see him in his mothers house both madame pep and her daughter nina carlos only sister had somewhat found fault with the young advocates rashness in thus seeking the close intimacy of home life with one whom whatever might be his own peculiar virtues they could not but recognise as an enemy of their country that would be all very fine if it were put into a book said the signora to her son who had been striving to show that an austrian if good in himself might be as worthy a friend as an italian but it is always well to live on the safe side of the wall it is not convenient that the sheep and the wolves should drink at the same stream this she said with all that caution which everywhere forms so marked a trait in the italian character who goes softly goes soundly half of the italian nature is told in that proverb though it is not the half which was becoming most apparent in the doings of the nation in these days and the signorina was quite of one mind with her mother carlo she said how is it that one never sees one of these austrians in the house of any friend why is it that i have never yet found myself in a room with one of them because men and women are generally so pig headed and unreasonable carlo had replied how am i for instance ever to learn what a german is at the core or a frenchman or an englishman if i refuse to speak to one it ended by captain von vincke being brought to the house in the campo san luca and there becoming as intimate with the signora and the signorina as he was with the advocate our story must be necessarily too short to permit us to see how the affair grew in all its soft and delicate growth but by the beginning of april nina pep had confessed her love to hubert von vincke and both the captain and nina had had a few words with the signora on the subject of their projected marriage carlo will never allow it the old lady had said trembling as she thought of the danger that was coming upon the family he should not have brought captain von vincke to the house unless he was prepared to regard such a thing as possible said nina proudly i think he is too good a fellow to object to anything that you will ask him said the captain holding by the hand the lady whom he hoped to call his mother in law throughout january and february captain von vincke had been an invalid in march he had been hardly more than convalescent and had then had time and all that opportunity which convalescence gives for the sweet business of love making during this time through march and in the first weeks of april carlo pep had been backwards and forwards to verona and had in truth had more business on hand than that which simply belonged to him as a lawyer those were the days in which the italians were beginning to prepare for the great attack which was to be made and in which correspondence was busily carried on between italy and venetia as to the enrolment of venetian volunteers it will be understood that no venetian was allowed to go into italy without an austrian passport and that at this time the austrians were becoming doubly strict in seeing that the order was not evaded of course it was evaded daily and twice in that april did young pep travel between verona and bologna in spite of all that austria could say to the contrary when at venice he and von vincke discussed very freely the position of the country nothing of course being said as to those journeys to bologna indeed of them no one in the campo san luca knew aught they were such journeys that a man says nothing of them to his mother or his sister or even to his wife unless he has as much confidence in her courage as he has in her love but of politics he would talk freely as would also the german and though each of them would speak of the cause as though they two were simply philosophical lookers on and were not and could not become actors and though each had in his mind a settled resolve to bear with the political opinion of the other yet it came to pass that they now and again were on the verge of quarrelling the fault i think was wholly with carlo pep whose enthusiasm of course was growing as those journeys to bologna were made successfully and who was beginning to feel assured that italy at last would certainly do something for herself but there had not come any open quarrel not as yet when nina in her lovers presence was arguing as to the impropriety of bringing captain von vincke to the house if captain von vincke was to be regarded as altogether unfit for matrimonial purposes at that moment carlo was absent at verona but was to return on the following morning it was decided at this conference between the two ladies and the lover that carlo should be told on his return of captain von vinckes intentions captain von vincke himself would tell him there is a certain hotel or coffee house or place of general public entertainment in venice kept by a german and called the hotel bauer probably from the name of the german who keeps it it stands near the church of st moses behind the grand piazza between that and the great canal in a narrow intricate throng of little streets and is approached by a close dark water way which robs it of any attempt at hotel grandeur nevertheless it is a large and commodious house at which good dinners may be eaten at prices somewhat lower than are compatible with the grandeur of the grand canal it used to be much affected by germans and had perhaps acquired among venetians a character of being attached to austrian interests there was not much in this or carlo pep would not have frequented the house even in company with his friend von vincke he did so frequent it and now on this occasion of his return home von vincke left word for him that he would breakfast at the hotel at eleven oclock pep by that time would have gone home after his journey and would have visited his office von vincke also would have done the greatest part of his days work each understood the habits of the other and they met at bauers for breakfast it was the end of april and carlo pep had returned to venice full of schemes for that revolution which he now regarded as imminent the alliance between italy and prussia was already discussed those italians who were most eager said that it was a thing done and no italian was more eager than carlo pep and it was believed at this time and more thoroughly believed in italy than elsewhere that austria and prussia would certainly go to war now if ever italy must do something for herself carlo pep was in this mood full of these things when he sat down to breakfast at bauers with his friend captain von vincke von vincke he said in three months time you will be out of venice shall i said the other and where shall i be in vienna as i hope or at berlin if you can get there but you will not be here or in the quadrilatere unless you are left behind as a prisoner the captain went on for awhile cutting his meat and drinking his wine before he made any reply to this and pep said more of the same kind expressing strongly his opinion that the empire of the austrians in venice was at an end then the captain wiped his moustaches carefully with his napkin and did speak carlo my friend he said you are rash to say all this why rash said carlo you and i understand each other just so my friend but we do not know how far that long eared waiter may understand either of us the waiter has heard nothing and i do not care if he did and beyond that continued the captain you make a difficulty for me what am i to say when you tell me these things that you should have one political opinion and i another is natural the question between us in an abstract point of view i can discuss with you willingly the possibility of venice contending with austria i could discuss if no such rebellion were imminent but when you tell me that it is imminent that it is already here i cannot discuss it it is imminent said carlo so be it said von vincke and then they finished their breakfast in silence all this was very unfortunate for our friend the captain who had come to bauers with the intention of speaking on quite another subject his friend pep had evidently taken what he had said in a bad spirit and was angry with him nevertheless as he had told nina and her mother that he would declare his purpose to carlo on this morning he must do it he was not a man to be frightened out of his purpose by his friends ill humour will you come into the piazza and smoke a cigar said von vincke feeling that he could begin upon the other subject better as soon as the scene should be changed why not let me have my cigar and coffee here said carlo because i have something to say which i can say better walking than sitting come along then they paid the bill and left the house and walked in silence through the narrow ways to the piazza von vincke said no word till he found himself in the broad passage leading into the great square then he put his hand through the others arm and told his tale at once carlo said he i love your sister and would have her for my wife will you consent by the body of bacchus what is this you say said the other drawing his arm away and looking up into the germans face simply that she has consented and your mother are you willing that i should be your brother this is madness said carlo pep on their part you mean yes and on yours were there nothing else to prevent it how could there be marriage between us when this war is coming i do not believe in the war that is i do not believe in war between us and italy no war can affect you here in venice if there is to be a war in which i shall be concerned im quite willing to wait till it be over you understand nothing about it said carlo after a pause nothing you are in the dark altogether how should it not be so when those who are over you never tell you anything no i will not consent it is a thing out of the question do you think that i am personally unfit to be your sisters husband not personally but politically and nationally you are not one of us and now at this moment any attempt at close union between an austrian and a venetian must be ruinous von vincke i am heartily sorry for this i blame the women and not you then carlo pep went home and there was a rough scene between him and his mother and a scene still rougher between him and his sister and in these interviews he told something though not the whole of the truth as to the engagements into which he had entered that he was to be the officer second in command in a regiment of venetian volunteers of those volunteers whom it was hoped that garibaldi would lead to victory in the coming war he did not tell them but he did make them understand that when the struggle came he would be away from venice and would take a part in it and how am i to do this he said if you here are joined hand and heart to an austrian a house divided against itself must fall let the reader understand that nina pep in spite of her love and of her lover was as good an italian as her brother and that their mother was equally firm in her political desires and national antipathies where would you have found the venetian man or woman who did not detest austrian rule and look forward to the good day coming when venice should be a city of italia the signora and nina had indeed some six months before this been much stronger in their hatred of all things german than had the son and brother it had been his liberal feeling his declaration that even a german might be good which had induced them to allow this austrian to come among them then the man and the soldier had been two and von vincke had himself shown tendencies so strongly at variance with those of his comrades that he had disarmed their fears he had read italian and condescended to speak it he knew the old history of their once great city and would listen to them when they talked of their old doges he loved their churches and their palaces and their pictures gradually he had come to love nina pep with all his heart and nina loved him too with all her heart but when her brother spoke to her and to her mother with more than his customary vehemence of what was due from them to their country of the debt which certainly should be paid by him of obligations to him from which they could not free themselves and told them also that by that time six months not an austrian would be found in venice they trembled and believed him and nina felt that her love would not run smooth you must be with us or against us said carlo why then did you bring him here nina replied am i to suppose that you cannot see a man without falling in love with him carlo that is unkind almost unbrotherly was he not your friend and were not you the first to tell us how good he is and he is good no man can be better he is an honest young man said the signora he is austrian to the backbone said carlo of course he is said nina what should he be and will you be austrian her brother asked not if i must be an enemy of italy nina said if an austrian may be a friend to italy then i will be an austrian i wish to be huberts wife of course i shall be an austrian if he is my husband then i trust that you may never be his wife said carlo by the middle of may carlo pep and captain von vincke had absolutely quarrelled they did not speak and von vincke had been ordered by the brother not to show himself at the house in the campo san luca every german in venice had now become more austrian than before and every venetian more italian even our friend the captain had come to believe in the war not only venice but italy was in earnest and captain von vincke foresaw or thought that he foresaw that a time of wretched misery was coming upon that devoted town he would never give up nina but perhaps it might be well that he should cease to press his suit till he might be enabled to do so with something of the clat of austrian success and now at last it became necessary that the two women should be told of carlos plans for carlo was going to leave venice till the war should be over and he could re enter the city as an italian should enter a city of his own oh my son my son said the mother why should it be you many must go mother why not i as well as another in other houses there are fathers and in other families more sons than one the time has come mother in which no woman should grudge either husband or son to the cause but the thing is settled i am already second colonel in a regiment which will serve with garibaldi you would not ask me to desert my colours there was nothing further to be said the signora threw herself on her sons neck and wept and both mother and sister felt that their carlo was already a second garibaldi when a man is a hero to women they will always obey him what could nina do at such a time but promise that she would not see hubert von vincke during his absence then there was a compact made between the brother and sister during three weeks past that is since the breakfast at bauers nina had seen hubert von vincke but once and had then seen him in the presence of her mother and brother he had come in one evening in the old way before the quarrel to take his coffee and had been received as heretofore as a friend nina sitting very silent during the evening but with a gracious silence and after that the mother had signified to the lover that he had better come no more for the present he therefore came no more i think it is the fact that love though no doubt it may run as strong with an italian or with an austrian as it does with us english is not allowed to run with so uncontrollable a stream young lovers and especially young women are more subject to control and are less inclined to imagine that all things should go as they would have them nina when she was made to understand that the war was come that her brother was leaving her and her mother and venice that he might fight for them that an austrian must for the time be regarded as an enemy in that house resolved with a slow melancholy firmness that she would accept the circumstances of her destiny if i fall said carlo you must then manage for yourself i would not wish to bind you after my death do not talk like that carlo nay my child but i must talk like that and it is at least well that we should understand each other i know that you will keep your promise to me yes said nina i will keep my promise till i come back or till i be dead you will not again see captain von vincke or till the cause be gained i will not see him carlo till you come back or till the cause be gained or till i be dead say it after me or till you be dead if i must say it but there was a clause in the contract that she was to see her lover once before her brother left them she had acknowledged the propriety of her brothers behests backed as they came to be at last by their mother but she declared through it all that she had done no wrong and that she would not be treated as though she were an offender she would see her lover and tell him what she pleased she would obey her brother but she would see her lover first indeed she would make no promise of obedience at all would promise disobedience instead unless she were allowed to see him she would herself write to him and bid him come this privilege was at last acceded to her and captain von vincke was summoned to the campo san luca the morning sitting room of the signora pep was up two pairs of stairs and the stairs were not paved as are the stairs of the palaces in venice but the room was large and lofty and seemed to be larger than its size from the very small amount of furniture which it contained the floor was of hard polished cement which looked like variegated marble and the amount of carpet upon it was about four yards long and was extended simply beneath the two chairs in which sat habitually the signora and her daughter there were two large mirrors and a large gold clock and a large table and a small table a small sofa and six chairs and that was all in england the room would have received ten times as much furniture or it would not have been furnished at all and there were in it no more than two small books belonging both to nina for the signora read but little in england in such a sitting room tables various tables would have been strewed with books but then perhaps nina peps eye required the comfort of no other volumes than those she was actually using nina was alone in the room when her lover came to her there had been a question whether her mother should or should not be present but nina had been imperative and she received him alone it is to bid you good bye hubert she said as she got up and touched his hand just touched his hand not for long my nina who can say for how long now that the war is upon us as far as i can see it will be for very long it is better that you should know it all for myself i think i fear that it will be for ever for ever why for ever because i cannot marry an enemy of italy i do not think that we can ever succeed you can never succeed then i can never be your wife it is so hubert i see that it must be so the loss is to me not to you no no no the loss is to me to me you have your profession you are a soldier i am nothing you are all in all to me i can be nothing i shall be nothing unless i am your wife think how i must long for that which you say is so impossible i do long for it i shall long for it oh hubert go and lose your cause let our men have their venice then come to me and your country shall be my country and your people my people as she said this she gently laid her hand upon his arm and the touch of her fingers thrilled through his whole frame he put out his arms as though to grasp her in his embrace no hubert no that must not be till venice is our own i wish it were he said but it will never be so you may make me a traitor in heart but that will not drive out fifty thousand troops from the fortresses i do not understand these things hubert and i have felt your countrys power to be so strong that i cannot now doubt it it is absurd to doubt it but yet they say that we shall succeed it is impossible even though prussia should be able to stand against us we should not leave venetia we shall never leave the fortresses then my love we may say farewell for ever i will not forget you i will never be false to you but we must part he stood there arguing with her and she argued with him but they always came round to the same point there was to be the war and she would not become the wife of her brothers enemy she had sworn she said and she would keep her word when his arguments became stronger than hers she threw herself back upon her plighted word i have said it and i must not depart from it i have told him that my love for you should be eternal and i tell you the same i told him that i would see you no more and i can only tell you so also he could ask her no questions as to the cause of her resolution because he could not make enquiries as to her brothers purpose he knew that carlo was at work for the venetian cause or at least he thought that he knew it but it was essential for his comfort that he should really know as little of this as might be possible that carlo pep was coming and going in the service of the cause he could not but surmise but should authenticated information reach him as to whither carlo went and how he came it might become his duty to put a stop to carlos comings and carlos goings on this matter therefore he said nothing but merely shook his head and smiled with a melancholy smile when she spoke of the future struggle and now hubert you must go i was determined that i would see you that i might tell you that i would be true to you what good will be such truth nay it is for you to say that i ask you for no pledge i shall love no other woman i would if i could i would if i could to morrow let us have our own and then come and love me or you need not come i will go to you though it be to the furthest end of galicia do not look like that at me you should be proud when i tell you that i love you no you shall not kiss me no man shall ever kiss me till venice is our own there i have sworn it should that time come and should a certain austrian gentleman care for italian kisses then he will know where to seek for them god bless you now and go she made her way to the door and opened it and there was nothing for him but that he must go he touched her hand once more as he went but there was no other word spoken between them mother she said when she found herself again with the signora my little dream of life is over it has been very short nay my child life is long for you yet there will be many dreams and much of reality i do not complain of carlo nina continued he is sacrificing much perhaps everything for venice and why should his sacrifice be greater than mine but i feel it to be severe very severe why did he bring him here if he felt thus june came that month of june that was to be so fatal to italian glory and so fraught with success for the italian cause and carlo pep was again away those who knew nothing of his doings knew only that he had gone to verona on matters of law those who were really acquainted with the circumstances of his present life were aware that he had made his way out of verona and that he was already with his volunteers near the lakes waiting for garibaldi who was then expected from caprera for some weeks to come for some months probably during the war perhaps the two women in the campo san luca would know nothing of the whereabouts or of the fate of him whom they loved he had gone to risk all for the cause and they too must be content to risk all in remaining desolate at home without the comfort of his presence and she also without the sweeter comfort of that other presence it is thus that women fight their battles in these days men by hundreds were making their way out of venice and by thousands out of the province of venetia and the austrians were endeavouring in vain to stop the emigration some few were caught and kept in prison and many austrian threats were uttered against those who should prove themselves to be insubordinate but it is difficult for a garrison to watch a whole people and very difficult indeed when there is a war on hand it at last became a fact that any man from the province could go and become a volunteer under garibaldi if he pleased and very many did go history will say that they were successful but their success certainly was not glorious it was in the month of june that all the battles of that short war were fought nothing will ever be said or sung in story to the honour of the volunteers who served in that campaign with garibaldi amidst the mountains of the southern tyrol but nowhere probably during the war was there so much continued fighting or an equal amount endured of the hardships of military life the task they had before them of driving the austrians from the fortresses amidst their own mountains was an impossible one impossible even had garibaldi been supplied with ordinary military equipments but ridiculously impossible for him in all the nakedness in which he was sent nothing was done to enable him to succeed that he should be successful was neither intended nor desired he was in fact then as he has been always since the days in which he gave naples to italy simply a stumbling block in the way of the king of the kings ministers and of the kings generals there is that garibaldi again with volunteers flocking to him by thousands what shall we do to rid ourselves of garibaldi and his volunteers how shall we dispose of them that has been the feeling of those in power in italy and not unnaturally their feeling with regard to garibaldi a man so honest so brave so patriotic so popular and so impracticable cannot but have been a trouble to them and here he was with twenty five thousand volunteers all armed after a fashion all supplied at least with a red shirt what should be done with garibaldi and his army so they sent him away up into the mountains where his game of play might at any rate detain him for some weeks and in the meantime everything might get itself arranged by the benevolent and omnipotent interference of the emperor things did get themselves arranged while garibaldi was up among the mountains kicking with unarmed toes against austrian pricks with sad detriment to his feet things did get themselves arranged very much to the advantage of venetia but not exactly by the interference of the emperor the facts of the war became known more slowly in venice than they did in florence in paris or in london that the battle of custozza had been fought and lost by the italian troops was known and then it was known that the battle of lissa also had been fought and lost by italian ships but it was not known till the autumn was near at hand that venetia had in fact been surrendered there were rumours but men in venice doubted these rumours and women who knew that their husbands had been beaten could not believe that success was to be the result of such calamities there were weeks in which came no news from carlo pep to the women in the campo san luca and then came simply tidings that he had been wounded i shall see my son never again said the widow in her ecstasy of misery and nina was able to talk to her mother only of carlo of hubert von vincke she spoke not then a word but she repeated to herself over and over again the last promise she had given him she had sent him away from her and now she knew nothing of his whereabouts that he would be fighting she presumed she had heard that most of the soldiers from venice had gone to the fortresses he too might be wounded might be dead if alive at the end of the war he would hardly return to her after what had passed between them but if he did not come back no lover should ever take a kiss from her lips then there was the long truce and a letter from carlo reached venice his wound had been slight but he had been very hungry he wrote in great anger abusing not the austrians but the italians there had been treachery and the italian general in chief had been the head of the traitors the king was a traitor the emperor was a traitor all concerned were traitors but yet venetia was to be surrendered to italy i think that the two ladies in the campo san luca never really believed that this would be so until they received that angry letter from carlo when i may get home i cannot tell he said i hardly care to return and i shall remain with the general as long as he may wish to have anyone remaining with him but you may be sure that i shall never go soldiering again venetia may perhaps prosper and become a part of italy but there will be no glory for us italy has been allowed to do nothing for herself the mother and sister endeavoured to feel some sympathy for the young soldier who spoke so sadly of his own career but they could hardly be unhappy because his fighting was over and the cause was won the cause was won gradually there came to be no doubt about that it was now september and as yet it had not come to pass that shop windows were filled with wonderful portraits of victor emmanuel and garibaldi cheek by jowl they being the two men who at that moment were perhaps in all italy the most antagonistic to each other nor were there as yet fifty different new journals cried day and night under the arcades of the grand piazza all advocating the cause of italy one and indivisible as there came to be a month afterwards but still it was known that austria was to cede venetia and that venice would henceforth be a city of italy this was known and it was also known in the campo san luca that carlo pep though very hungry up among the mountains was still safe then nina thought that the time had come in which it would become her to speak of her lover mother she said i must know something of hubert but how nina how will you learn will you not wait till carlo comes back no she said i cannot wait longer i have kept my promise venice is no longer austrian and i will seek him i have kept my word to carlo and now i will keep my word to hubert but how to seek him the widow urged by her daughter went out and asked at barrack doors but new regiments had come and gone and everything was in confusion it was supposed that any officer of artillery who had been in venice and had left it during the war must be in one of the four fortresses mother she said i shall go to verona and to verona she went all alone in search of her lover at that time the austrians still maintained a sort of rule in the province and there were still current orders against private travelling orders that passports should be investigated orders that the communication with the four fortresses should be specially guarded but there was an intense desire on the part of the austrians themselves that the orders should be regarded as little as possible they had to go and the more quietly they went the better why should they care now who passed hither and thither it must be confessed on their behalf that in their surrender of venetia they gave as little trouble as it was possible in them to cause the chief obstruction to ninas journey she experienced in the campo san luca itself but in spite of her mother in spite of the not yet defunct austrian mandates she did make her way to verona as i was true in giving him up she said to herself so will i be true in clinging to him even in verona her task was not easy but she did at last find all that she sought captain von vincke had been in command of a battery at custozza and was now lying wounded in an austrian hospital nina contrived to see an old gray haired surgeon before she saw hubert himself captain von vincke had been terribly mauled so the surgeon told her his left arm had been amputated and and and it seemed as though wounds had been showered on him the surgeon did not think that his patient would die but he did think that he must be left in verona when the austrians were marched out of the fortress can he not be taken to venice said nina pep at last she found herself by her lovers bedside but with her there were two hospital attendants both of them worn out austrian soldiers and there was also there the gray haired surgeon how was she to tell her love all that she had in her heart before such witnesses the surgeon was the first to speak here is your friend captain he said but as he spoke in german nina did not understand him is it really you nina said her lover i could hardly believe that you should be in verona of course it is i who could have so much business to be in verona as i have of course i am here but but what has brought you here nina if you do not know i cannot tell you and carlo carlo is still with the general but he is well and the signora she also is well well but not easy in mind while i am here and when do you return nay i cannot tell you that it may be to day it may be to morrow it depends not on myself at all he spoke not a word of love to her then nor she to him unless there was love in such greeting as has been here repeated indeed it was not till after that first interview that he fully understood that she had made her journey to verona solely in quest of him the words between them for the first day or two were very tame as though neither had full confidence in the other and she had taken her place as nurse by his side as a sister might have done by a brother and was established in her work nay had nearly completed her work before there came to be any full understanding between them more than once she had told herself that she would go back to venice and let there be an end of it the great work of the war she said to herself has so filled his mind that the idleness of his days in venice and all that he did then are forgotten if so my presence here is surely a sore burden to him and i will go but she could not now leave him without a word of farewell hubert she said for she had called him hubert when she first came to his bedside as though she had been his sister i think i must return now to venice my mother will be lonely without me at that moment it appeared almost miraculous to her that she should be sitting there by his bedside that she should have loved him that she should have had the courage to leave her home and seek him after the war that she should have found him and that she should now be about to leave him almost without a word between them she must be very lonely said the wounded man and you i think are stronger than you were for me i am strong enough i have lost my arm and i shall carry this gaping scar athwart my face to the grave as my cross of honour won in the italian war but otherwise i shall soon be well it is a fair cross of honour yes they cannot rob us of our wounds when our service is over and so you will go signorina yes i will go why should i remain here i will go and carlo will return and i will tend upon him carlo also was wounded but you have told me that he is well again nevertheless he will value the comfort of a womans care after his sufferings may i say farewell to you now my friend and she put her hand down upon the bed so that he might reach it she had been with him for days and there had been no word of love it had seemed as though he had understood nothing of what she had done in coming to him that he had failed altogether in feeling that she had come as a wife goes to a husband she had made a mistake in this journey and must now rectify her error with as much of dignity as might be left to her he took her hand in his and held it for a moment before he answered her nina he said why did you come hither why did i come why are you here in verona while your mother is alone in venice i had business here a matter of some moment it is finished now and i shall return was it other business than to sit at my bedside she paused a moment before she answered him yes she said it was other business than that and you have succeeded no i have failed he still held her hand and she though she was thus fencing with him answering him with equivoques felt that at last there was coming from him some word which would at least leave her no longer in doubt and i too have i failed he said when i left venice i told myself heartily that i had failed you told yourself then said she that venetia never would be ceded you know that i would not triumph over you now that your cause has been lost we italians have not much cause for triumphing you will admit always that the fortresses have not been taken from us said the sore hearted soldier certainly we shall admit that and my own fortress the stronghold that i thought i had made altogether mine is that too lost for ever to the poor german you speak in riddles captain von vincke she said she had now taken back her hand but she was sitting quietly by his bedside and made no sign of leaving him nina he said nina my own nina in losing a single share of venice one soldiers share of the province shall i have gained all the world for myself nina tell me truly what brought you to verona she knelt slowly down by his bedside and again taking his one hand in hers pressed it first to her lips and then to her bosom it was an unmaidenly purpose she said i came to find the man i loved but you said you had failed and i now say that i have succeeded do you not know that success in great matters always trembles in the balance before it turns the beam thinking fearing all but knowing that failure has weighed down the scale but now now i am sure that venice has been won it was three months after this and half of december had passed away and all venetia had in truth been ceded and victor emmanuel had made his entry in to venice and exit out of it with as little of real triumph as ever attended a kings progress through a new province and the austrian army had moved itself off very quietly and the city had become as thoroughly italian as florence itself and was in a way to be equally discontented when a party of four two ladies and two gentlemen sat down to breakfast in the htel bauer the ladies were the signora pep and her daughter and the men were carlo pep and his brother in law hubert von vincke it was but a poor fte this family breakfast at an obscure inn but it was intended as a gala feast to mark the last day of ninas italian life to morrow very early in the morning she was to leave venice for trieste so early that it would be necessary that she should be on board this very night my child said the signora do not say so you will never cease to be italian surely hubert she may still call herself venetian mother she said i love a losing cause i will be austrian now i told him that he could not have both if he kept his venice he could not have me but as he has lost his province he shall have his wife entirely i told him that it was fated that he should lose venetia said carlo but he would never believe me because i knew how true were our soldiers said hubert and could not understand how false were our statesmen see how he regrets it said nina what he has lost and what he has won will together break his heart for him nina he said i learned this morning in the city that i shall be the last austrian soldier to leave venice and i hold that of all who have entered it and all who have left it i am the most successful and the most triumphant illustration text decoration miss ophelia gledd illustration text decoration miss ophelia gledd who can say what is a lady my intelligent and well bred reader of either sex will at once declare that he and she knows very well who is a lady so i hope do i but the present question goes further than that what is it and whence does it come education does not give it nor intelligence nor birth not even the highest the thing which in its presence or absence is so well known and understood may be wanting to the most polished manners to the sweetest disposition to the truest heart there are thousands among us who know it at a glance and recognise its presence from the sound of a dozen words but there is not one among us who can tell us what it is miss ophelia gledd was a young lady of boston massachusetts and i should be glad to know whether in the estimation of my countrymen and countrywomen she is to be esteemed a lady an englishman even of the best class is often at a loss to judge of the ladyship of a foreigner unless he has really lived in foreign cities and foreign society but i do not know that he is ever so much puzzled in this matter by any nationality as he is by the american american women speak his own language read his own literature and in many respects think his own thoughts but there have crept into american society so many little social ways at variance with our social ways there have been wasted thither so many social atoms which there fit into their places but which with us would clog the wheels that the words and habits and social carriage of an american woman of the best class too often offend the taste of an englishman as do quite as strongly those of the englishwoman offend the american there are those who declare that there are no american ladies but these are people who would probably declare the same of the french and the italians if the languages of france and italy were as familiar to their ears as is the language of the states they mean that american women do not grow up to be english ladies not bethinking themselves that such a growth was hardly to be expected now i will tell my story and ask my readers to answer this question was miss ophelia gledd a lady when i knew her she was at any rate great in the society of boston massachusetts in which city she had been as well known for the last four or five years as the yellow dome of the state house she was as pure and perfect a specimen of a yankee girl as ever it was my fortune to know standing about five feet eight she seemed to be very tall because she always carried herself at her full height she was thin too and rather narrower at the shoulders than the strictest rules of symmetry would have made her her waist was very slight so much so that to the eye it would seem that some unjust and injurious force had created its slender compass but i have fair ground for stating my belief that no such force had been employed but yet though she was slight and thin and even narrow there was a vivacity and quickness about all her movements and an easiness in her mode of moving which made it impossible to deny to her the merit of a pleasing figure no man would i think at first sight declare her to be pretty and certainly no woman would do so and yet i have seldom known a face in the close presence of which it was more gratifying to sit and talk and listen her brown hair was always brushed close off from her forehead her brow was high and her face narrow and thin but that face was ever bright with motion and her clear deep gray eyes full of life and light were always ready for some combat or some enterprise her nose and mouth were the best features in her face and her teeth were perfect miracles of perfection but her lips were too thin for feminine beauty and indeed such personal charms as she had were not the charms which men love most sweet changing colour soft full flowing lines of grace and womanly gentleness in every movement ophelia gledd had none of these she was hard and sharp in shape of a good brown steady colour hard and sharp also in her gait with no full flowing lines with no softness but she was bright as burnished steel and yet she was the belle of boston i do not know that any man of boston or any stranger knowing boston would have ever declared that she was the prettiest girl in the city but this was certain almost to all that she received more of that admiration which is generally given to beauty than did any other lady there and that the upper social world of boston had become so used to her appearance such as it was that no one ever seemed to question the fact of her being a beauty she had been passed as a beauty by examiners whose certificate in that matter was held to be good and had received high rank as a beauty in the drawing rooms at boston the fact was never questioned now unless by some passing stranger who would be told in flat terms that he was wrong yes sir youll find youre wrong youll find you aire if youll bide here awhile i did bide there awhile and did find that i was wrong before i left i was prepared to allow that miss ophelia gledd was a beauty and moreover which was more singular all the women allowed it ophelia gledd though the belle of boston was not hated by the other belles the female feeling with regard to her was i think this that the time had arrived in which she should choose her husband and settle down so as to leave room for others less attractive than herself when i knew her she was very fond of mens society but i doubt if anyone could fairly say that miss gledd ever flirted in the proper sense of the word she certainly never flirted interesting conversations with interesting young men at which none but themselves were present she had by the dozen it was as common for her to walk up and down beacon street the parade of boston with young jones or smith or more probably with young mr optimus m opie or young mr hannibal h hoskins as it is for our young joneses and young smiths and young hoskinses to saunter out together that is the way of the country and no one took wider advantage of the ways of her own country than did miss ophelia gledd she told young men also when to call upon her if she liked them and in seeking or in avoiding their society did very much as she pleased but these practices are right or wrong not in accordance with a fixed rule of morality prevailing over all the earth such a rule for instance as that which orders men not to steal but they are right or wrong according to the usages of the country in which they are practised in boston it is right that miss ophelia gledd should walk up beacon street with hannibal hoskins the morning after she has met him at a ball and that she should invite him to call upon her at twelve oclock on the following day she had certainly a nasal twang in speaking before my intercourse with her was over her voice had become pleasant in my ears and it may be that that nasal twang which had at first been so detestable to me had recommended itself to my sense of hearing at different periods of my life i have learned to love an irish brogue and a northern burr be that as it may i must acknowledge that miss ophelia gledd spoke with a certain nasal twang but then such is the manner of speech at boston and she only did that which the joneses and smiths the opies and hoskinses were doing around her ophelia gledds mother was for a living being the nearest thing to a nonentity that i ever met whether within her own house in chesnut street she exerted herself in her domestic duties and held authority over her maidens i cannot say but neither in her dining parlour nor in her drawing room did she hold any authority indeed throughout the house ophelia was paramount and it seemed as though her mother could not venture on a hint in opposition to her daughters behests mrs gledd never went out but her daughter frequented all balls dinners and assemblies which she chose to honour to all these she went alone and had done since she was eighteen years of age she went also to lectures to meetings of wise men for which the western athens is much noted to political debates and wherever her enterprising heart and enquiring head chose to carry her but her mother never went anywhere and it always seemed to me that mrs gledds intercourse with her domestics must have been nearer closer and almost dearer to her than any that she could have with her daughter mr gledd had been a merchant all his life when ophelia gledd first came before the boston world he had been a rich merchant and as she was an only child she had opened her campaign with all the advantages which attach to an heiress but now in these days mr gledd was known to be a merchant without riches he still kept the same house and lived apparently as he had always lived but the world knew that he had been a broken merchant and was now again struggling that miss gledd felt the disadvantage of this no one can i suppose doubt but she never showed that she felt it she spoke openly of her fathers poverty as of a thing that was known and of her own where she had been exigeant before she was exigeant now those she disliked when rich she disliked now that she was poor where she had been patronising before she patronised now where she had loved she still loved in former days she had a carriage and now she had none where she had worn silk she now wore cotton in her gloves her laces her little belongings there was all the difference which money makes or the want of money but in her manner there was none nor was there any difference in the manner of others to her the loss of wealth seemed to entail on miss gledd no other discomfort than the actual want of those things which hard money buys to go in a coach might have been a luxury to her and that she had lost but she had lost none of her ascendency none of her position none of her sovereignty i remember well where when and how i first met miss gledd at that time her fathers fortune was probably already gone but if so she did not then know that it was gone it was in winter towards the end of winter when the passion for sleighing became ecstatic i expect all my readers to know that sleighing is the grand winter amusement of boston and indeed it is not bad fun there is the fashionable course for sleighing the brighton road and along that you drive seated among furs with a young lady beside you if you can get one to trust you your horse or horses carry little bells which add to the charms the motion is rapid and pleasant and which is the great thing you see and are seen by everybody of course it is expedient that the frost should be sound and perfect so that the sleigh should run over a dry smooth surface but as the season draws to an end and when sleighing intimacies have become close and warm the horses are made to travel through slush and wet and the scene becomes one of peril and discomfort though one also of excitement and not unfrequently of love sleighing was fairly over at the time of which i now speak so that the brighton road was deserted in its slush and sloppiness nevertheless there was a possibility of sleighing and as i was a stranger newly arrived a young friend of mine took me or rather allowed me to take him out so that the glory of the charioteer might be mine i guess were not alone said he after we had passed the bridge out of the town theres young hoskins with pheely gledd just ahead of us that was the first i had ever heard of ophelia and then as i pushed along after her instigated by a foolish britons ambition to pass the yankee whip i did hear a good deal about her and in addition to what has already been told i then heard that this mr hannibal hoskins to pass whom on the road was now my only earthly desire was miss gledds professed admirer in point of fact that it was known to all boston that he had offered his hand to her more than once already she has accepted him now at any rate said i looking at their close contiguity on the sleigh before me but my friend explained to me that such was by no means probable that miss gledd had twenty hangers on of the same description with any one of whom she might be seen sleighing walking or dancing but that no argument as to any further purpose on her part was to be deduced from any such practice our girls said my friend dont go about tied to their mothers aprons as girls do in the old country our free institutions c c i confessed my blunder and acknowledged that a wide and perhaps salutary latitude was allowed to the feminine creation on his side of the atlantic but do what i would i couldnt pass hannibal hoskins whether he guessed that i was an ambitious englishman or whether he had a general dislike to be passed on the road i dont know but he raised his whip to his horses and went away from us suddenly and very quickly through the slush the snow was half gone and hard ridges of it remained across the road so that his sleigh was bumped about most uncomfortably i soon saw that his horses were running away and that hannibal hoskins was in a fix he was standing up pulling at them with all his strength and weight and the carriage was yawing about and across the road in a manner that made us fear it would go to pieces miss ophelia gledd however kept her seat and there was no shrieking in about five minutes they were well planted into a ditch and we were alongside of them you fixed that pretty straight hoskins said my friend darn them for horses said hoskins as he wiped the perspiration from his brow and looked down upon the fiercest of the quadrupeds sprawling up to his withers in the snow then he turned to miss gledd who was endeavouring to unroll herself from her furs oh miss gledd i am so sorry what am i to say youd better say that the horses ran away i think said miss gledd then she stepped carefully out on to a buffalo robe and moved across from that quite dry footed on to our sleigh as my friend and hoskins were very intimate and could as i thought get on very well by themselves with the dbris in the ditch i offered to drive miss gledd back to town she looked at me with eyes which gave me as i thought no peculiar thanks and then remarked that she had come out with mr hoskins and that she would go back with him oh dont mind me said hoskins who was at that time up to his middle in snow ah but i do mind you said ophelia dont you think we could go back and send some people to help these gentlemen it was the coolest proposition that i had ever heard but in two minutes miss gledd was putting it into execution hannibal hoskins was driving her back in the sleigh which i had hired and i was left with my friend to extricate those other two brutes from the ditch thats so like pheely gledd said my friend she always has her own way then it was that i questioned miss gledds beauty and was told that before long i should find myself to be wrong i had almost acknowledged myself to be wrong before that night was over i was at a tea party that same evening at which miss gledd was present it was called a tea party though i saw no tea i did however see a large hot supper and a very large assortment of long necked bottles i was standing rather listlessly near the door being short of acquaintance when a young yankee dandy with a very stiff neck informed me that miss gledd wanted to speak to me having given me this intimation he took himself off with an air of disgust among the long necked bottles mr green she said i had just been introduced to her as she was being whisked away by hoskins in my sleigh mr green i believe i owe you an apology when i took your sleigh from you i didnt know you were a britisher i didnt indeed i was a little nettled and endeavoured to explain to her that an englishman would be just as ready to give up his carriage to a lady as any american oh dear yes of course she said i didnt mean that and now ive put my foot into it worse than ever i thought you were at home here and knew our ways and if so you wouldnt mind being left with a broken sleigh i told her that i didnt mind it that what i had minded was the being robbed of the privilege of driving her home which i had thought to be justly mine yes said she and i was to leave my friend in the ditch thats what i never do you didnt suffer any disgrace by remaining there till the men came i didnt remain there till any men came i got it out and drove it home what a wonderful man but then youre english however you can understand that if i had left my driver he would have been disgraced if ever i go out anywhere with you mr green ill come home with you at any rate it shant be my fault if i dont after that i couldnt be angry with her and so we became great friends shortly afterwards the crash came but miss gledd seemed to disregard the crash altogether and held her own in boston as far as i could see there were just as many men desirous of marrying her as ever and among the number hannibal h hoskins was certainly no defaulter my acquaintance with boston had become intimate but after awhile i went away for twelve months and when i returned miss gledd was still miss gledd and what of hoskins i said to my friend the same friend who had been with me in the sleighing expedition hes just on the old tack i believe he proposes once a year regularly but they say now that shes going to marry an englishman it was not long before i had an opportunity of renewing my friendship with miss gledd for our acquaintance had latterly amounted to a friendship and of seeing the englishman with her as it happened he also was a friend of my own an old friend and the last man in the world whom i should have picked out as a husband for ophelia he was a literary man of some mark fifteen years her senior very sedate in his habits not much given to love making and possessed of a small fortune sufficient for his own wants but not sufficient to enable him to marry with what he would consider comfort such was mr pryor and i was given to understand that mr pryor was a suppliant at the feet of ophelia he was a suppliant too with so much hope that hannibal hoskins and the other suitors were up in arms against him i saw them together at some evening assembly and on the next morning i chanced to be in miss gledds drawing room on my entrance there were others there but the first moment that we were alone she turned round sharp upon me with a question you know your countryman mr pryor what sort of a man is he but you know him also i answered if the rumours in boston are true he is already a favourite in chesnut street well then for once in a way the rumours in boston are true for he is a favourite but that is no reason you shouldnt tell me what sort of a man he is youve known him these ten years pretty nearly twenty i said i had known him ten or twelve ah said she you want to make him out to be older than he is i knew his age to day and does he know yours he may if he wishes it everybody in boston knows it including yourself now tell me what sort of man is mr pryor he is a man highly esteemed in his own country so much i knew before and he is highly esteemed here also but i hardly understand what high estimation means in your country it is much the same thing in all countries as i take it said i there you are absolutely wrong here in the states if a man be highly esteemed it amounts almost to everything such estimation will carry him everywhere and will carry his wife everywhere too so as to give her a chance of making standing ground for herself but mr pryor has not got a wife dont be stupid of course he hasnt got a wife and of course you know what i mean but i did not know what she meant i knew that she was meditating whether or no it would be good for her to become mrs pryor and that she was endeavouring to get from me some information which might assist her in coming to a decision on that matter but i did not understand the exact gist and point of her enquiry you have so many prejudices of which we know nothing she continued now dont put your back up and fight for that blessed old country of yours as though i were attacking it it is a blessed old country said i patriotically quite so very blessed and very old and very nice too im sure but you must admit that you have prejudices you are very much the better perhaps for having them i often wish that we had a few then she stopped her tongue and asked no further question about mr pryor but it seemed to me that she wanted me to go on with the conversation i hate discussing the relative merits of the two countries said i and i especially hate to discuss them with you you always begin as though you meant to be fair and end by an amount of unfairness that that which would be insolent if i were not a woman and which is pert as i am one that is what you mean something like it and yet i love your country so dearly that i would sooner live there than in any other land in the world if only i thought that i could be accepted you english people she continued are certainly wanting in intelligence or you would read in the anxiety of all we say about england how much we all think of you what will england say of us what will england think of us what will england do in this or that matter as it concerns us that is our first thought as to every matter that is of importance to us we abuse you and admire you you abuse us and despise us that is the difference so you wont tell me anything about mr pryor well i shant ask you again i never again ask a favour that has been refused then she turned away to some old gentleman that was talking to her mother and the conversation was at an end i must confess that as i walked away from chesnut street into beacon street and across the common my anxiety was more keen with regard to mr pryor than as concerned miss gledd he was an englishman and an old friend and being also a man not much younger than myself he was one regarding whom i might perhaps form some correct judgment as to what would and what would not suit him would he do well in taking ophelia gledd home to england with him as his wife would she be accepted there as she herself had phrased it accepted in such fashion as to make him contented she was intelligent so intelligent that few women whom she would meet in her proposed new country could beat her there she was pleasant good humoured true as i believed but would she be accepted in london there was a freedom and easiness about her a readiness to say anything that came into her mind an absence of all reticence which would go very hard with her in london but i never had heard her say anything that she should not have said perhaps after all we have got our prejudices in england when next i met pryor i spoke to him about miss gledd the long and the short of it is i said that people say that you are going to marry her what sort of people they were backing you against hannibal hoskins the other night at the club and it seemed clear that you were the favourite the vulgarity of these people surpasses anything that i ever dreamed of said pryor that is of some of them its all very well for you to talk but could such a bet as that be proposed in the open room of any club in london the clubs in london are too big but i dare say it might down in the country it would be just the thing for little pedlington but boston is not little pedlington boston assumes to be the athens of the states i shall go home by the first boat next month he had said nothing to me about miss gledd but it was clear that if he went home by the first boat next month he would go home without a wife and as i certainly thought that the suggested marriage was undesirable i said nothing to persuade him to remain at boston it was again sleighing time and some few days after my meeting with pryor i was out upon the brighton road in the thick of the crowd presently i saw the hat and back of hannibal hoskins and by his side was ophelia gledd now it must be understood that hannibal hoskins though he was in many respects most unlike an english gentleman was neither a fool nor a bad fellow a fool he certainly was not he had read much he could speak glibly as is the case with all americans he was scientific classical and poetical probably not to any great depth and he knew how to earn a large income with the full approbation of his fellow citizens i had always hated him since the day on which he had driven miss gledd home but i had generally attributed my hatred to the manner in which he wore his hat on one side i confess i had often felt amazed that miss gledd should have so far encouraged him i think i may at any rate declare that he would not have been accepted in london not accepted for much and yet hannibal hoskins was not a bad fellow his true devotion to ophelia gledd proved that miss gledd said i speaking to her from my sleigh do you remember your calamity there is the very ditch not a hundred yards ahead of you and here is the very knight that took me home in your sleigh said she laughing hoskins sat bolt upright and took off his hat why he took off his hat i dont know unless that thereby he got an opportunity of putting it on again a little more on one side mr hoskins would not have the goodness to upset you again i suppose said i no sir said hoskins and he raised the reins and squared up his elbows meaning to lock like a knowing charioteer i guess well go back eh miss gledd i guess we will said she but mr green dont you remember that i once told you if youd take me out id be sure to come home with you you never tried me and i take it bad of you so encouraged i made an engagement with her and in two or three days time from that i had her beside me in my sleigh on the same road by this time i had quite become a convert to the general opinion and was ready to confess in any presence that miss gledd was a beauty as i started with her out of the city warmly enveloped in buffalo furs i could not but think how nice it would be to drive on and on so that nobody should ever catch us there was a sense of companionship about her in which no woman that i have ever known excelled her she had a way of adapting herself to the friend of the moment which was beyond anything winning her voice was decidedly very pleasant and as to that nasal twang i am not sure that i was ever right about it i wasnt in love with her myself and didnt want to fall in love with her but i felt that i should have liked to cross the rocky mountains with her over to the pacific and to have come home round by california peru and the pampas and for such a journey i should not at all have desired to hamper the party with the society either of hannibal hoskins or of mr pryor i hope you feel that youre having your revenge said she but i dont mean to upset you i almost wish you would so as to make it even and my poor friend mr hoskins would feel himself so satisfied he says you englishmen are conceited about your driving no doubt he thinks we are conceited about everything so you are and so you should be poor hannibal he is wild with despair because because what oh never mind he is an excellent fellow but i know you hate him indeed i dont yes you do and so does mr pryor but he is so good you cant either understand or appreciate the kind of goodness which our young men have because he pulls his hat about and cant wear his gloves without looking stiff you wont remember that out of his hard earnings he gives his mother and sisters everything that they want i didnt know anything of his mother and sisters no of course you didnt but you know a great deal about his hat and gloves you are too hard and polished and well mannered in england to know anything about anybodys mother or sisters or indeed to know anything about anybodys anything it is nothing to you whether a man be moral or affectionate or industrious or good tempered as long as he can wear his hat properly and speak as though nothing on the earth or over the earth or under the earth could ever move him that is sufficient and yet i thought you were so fond of england so i am i too like nay love that ease of manner which you all possess and which i cannot reach then there was silence between us for perhaps half a mile and yet i was driving slow as i did not wish to bring our journey to an end i had fully made up my mind that it would be in every way better for my friend pryor that he should give up all thoughts of this western aspasia and yet i was anxious to talk to her about him as though such a marriage were still on the cards it had seemed that lately she had thrown herself much into an intimacy with myself and that she was anxious to speak openly to me if i would only allow it but she had already declared on a former occasion that she would ask me no further question about mr pryor at last i plucked up courage and put to her a direct proposition about the future tenor of her life after all that you have said about mr hoskins i suppose i may expect to hear that you have at last accepted him i could not have asked such a question of any english girl that i ever knew not even of my own sister in these plain terms and yet she took it not only without anger but even without surprise and she answered it as though i had asked her the most ordinary question in the world i wish i had she said that is i think i wish i had it is certainly what i ought to do then why do you not do it ah why do i not why do we not all do just what we ought to do but why am i to be cross questioned by you you would not answer me a question when i asked you the other day you tell me that you wish you had accepted mr hoskins why do you not do so said i continuing my cross examination because i have a vain ambition a foolish ambition a silly moth like ambition by which if i indulge it i shall only burn my wings because i am such an utter ass that i would fain make myself an englishwoman i dont see that you need burn your wings yes should i go there i shall find myself to be nobody whereas here i am in good repute here i could make my husband a man of mark by dint of my own power there i doubt whether even his esteem would so shield and cover me as to make me endurable do you think that i do not know the difference that i am not aware of what makes social excellence there and yet though i know it all and covet it i despise it social distinction with us is given on sounder terms than it is with you and is more frequently the deserved reward of merit tell me if i go to london they will ask who was my grandfather indeed no they will not ask even of your father unless you speak of him no their manners are too good but they will speak of their fathers and how shall i talk with them not but what my grandfather was a good man and you are not to suppose that i am ashamed of him because he stood in a store and sold leather with his own hands or rather i am ashamed of it i should tell my husbands old friends and my new acquaintances that it was so because i am not a coward and yet as i told them i should be ashamed his brother is what you call a baronet just so and what would the baronets wife say to me with all my sharp boston notions cant you see her looking at me over the length of the drawing room and cant you fancy how pert i should be and what snappish words i should say to the she baronet upon the whole dont you think i should do better with mr hoskins again i sat silent for some time she had now asked me a question to which i was bound to give her a true answer an answer that should be true as to herself without reference to pryor she was sitting back in the sleigh tamed as it were by her own thoughts and she had looked at me as though she had really wanted counsel if i am to answer you in truth i said you are to answer me in truth then said i i can only bid you take him of the two whom you love that is if it be the case that you love either love she said and if it be the case i continued that you love neither then leave them both as they are i am not then to think of the mans happiness certainly not by marrying him without affection ah i but i may regret him with affection and for which of them do you feel affection i asked and as i asked we were already within the streets of boston she again remained silent almost till i had placed her at her own door then she looked at me with eyes full not only of meaning but of love also with that in her eyes for which i had not hitherto given her credit you know the two men she said and do you ask me that when these words were spoken she jumped from the sleigh and hurried up the steps to her fathers door in very truth the hat and gloves of hannibal hoskins had influenced her as they had influenced me and they had done so although she knew how devoted he was as a son and a brother for a full month after that i had no further conversation with miss gledd or with mr pryor on the subject at this time i was living in habits of daily intimacy with pryor but as he did not speak to me about ophelia i did not often mention her name to him i was aware that he was often with her or at any rate often in her company but i did not believe that he had any daily habit of going to the house as he would have done had he been her accepted suitor and indeed i believed him to be a man who would be very persevering in offering his love but who if persistently refused would not probably tender it again he still talked of returning to england though he had fixed no day i myself purposed doing so early in may and used such influence as i had in endeavouring to keep him at boston till that time miss gledd also i constantly saw indeed one could not live in the society of boston without seeing her almost daily and i was aware that mr hoskins was frequently with her but as regarded her this betokened nothing as i have before endeavoured to explain she never deserted a friend and had no idea of being reserved in her manners with a man because it was reported that such man was her lover she would be very gracious to hannibal in mr pryors presence and yet it was evident at any rate to me that in doing so she had no thought of grieving her english admirer i was one day seated in my room at the hotel when a servant brought me up a card misther hoskins hes a waiting below and wants to see yer honour very partickler said the raw irishman mr hoskins had never done me the honour of calling on me before nor had i ever become intimate with him even at the club but nevertheless as he had come to me of course i was willing to see him and so he was shown up into my room when he entered his hat was i suppose in his hand but it looked as though it had been on one side of his head the moment before and as though it would be on one side again the moment he left me i beg your pardon mr green said he perhaps i ought not to intrude upon you here no intrusion at all wont you take a chair and put your hat down he did take a chair but he wouldnt put his hat down i confess that i had been actuated by a foolish desire to see it placed for a few minutes in a properly perpendicular position ive just come ill tell you why ive come there are some things mr green in which a man doesnt like to be interfered with i could not but agree with this but in doing so i expressed a hope that mr hoskins had not been interfered with to any very disagreeable extent well i scorn to say that the boston dandy said waall but if this story were written by any englishman less conscientious than myself that latter form of letters is the one which he would adopt in his endeavour to convey the sound as uttered by mr hoskins well i dont quite know about that now mr green im not a quarrelsome man i dont go about with six shooters in my pocket and i dont want to fight nohow if i can help it in answer to this i was obliged to tell him that i sincerely hoped that he would not have to fight but that if fighting became necessary to him i trusted that his fighting propensities would not be directed against any friend of mine we dont do much in that way on our side of the water said i i am well aware of that said he i dont want any one to teach me what are usages of genteel life in england i was there the whole fall two years ago as regards myself said i i dont think much good was ever done by duelling that depends sir on how things eventuate but mr green satisfaction of that description is not what i desiderate on the present occasion i wish to know whether mr pryor is or is not engaged to marry miss ophelia gledd if he is mr hoskins i dont know it but sir you are his friend this i admitted but again assured mr hoskins that i knew nothing of any such engagement he pleaded also that i was her friend as well as his this too i admitted but again declared that from neither side had i been made aware of the fact of any such engagement then mr green said he may i ask you for your own private opinion upon the whole i was inclined to think that he might not and so i told him in what most courteous words i could find for the occasion his bust at first grew very long and stiff and his hat became more and still more sloped as he held it i began to fear that though he might not have a six shooter in his pocket he had nevertheless some kind of pistol in his thoughts at last he started up on his feet and confronted me as i thought with a look of great anger but his words when they came were no longer angry mr green said he if you knew all that ive done to get that girl my heart was instantly softened to him for aught that i know said i you may have her this moment for asking no said he no his voice was very melancholy and as he spoke he looked into his sloping hat no ive just come from chesnut street and i think shes rather more turned against me than ever he was a tall man good looking after a fashion dark with thick black shiny hair and huge bold moustachios i myself do not like his style of appearance but he certainly had a manly bearing and in the society of boston generally he was regarded as a stout fellow well able to hold his own as a man by no means soft or green or feminine and yet now in the presence of me a stranger to him he was almost crying about his lady love in england no man tells another that he has been rejected but then in england so few men tell to others anything of their real feeling as ophelia had said to me we are hard and polished and nobody knows anything about anybodys anything what could i say to him i did say something i went so far as to assure him that i had heard miss gledd speak of him in the highest language and at last perhaps i hinted though i dont think i did quite hint it that if pryor were out of the way hoskins might find the lady more kind he soon became quite confidential as though i were his bosom friend he perceived i think that i was not anxious that pryor should carry off the prize and he wished me to teach pryor that the prize was not such a prize as would suit him shes the very girl for boston he said in his energy but i put it to you mr green she hasnt the gait of going that would suit london whether her gait of going would or would not suit our metropolis i did not undertake to say in the presence of mr hoskins but i did at last say that i would speak to pryor so that the field might be left open for others if he had no intention of running for the cup himself i could not but be taken and indeed charmed by the honest strength of affection which hannibal hoskins felt for the object of his adoration he had come into my room determined to display himself as a man of will of courage and of fashion but he had broken down in all that under his extreme desire to obtain assistance in getting the one thing which he wanted when he parted with me he shook hands almost boisterously while he offered me most exuberant thanks and yet i had not suggested that i could do anything for him i did think that ophelia gledd would accept his offer as soon as pryor was gone but i had not told him that i thought so about two days afterwards i had a very long and a very serious conversation with pryor and at that time i do not think that he had made up his mind as to what he intended to do he was the very opposite to hoskins in all his ways and all his moods there was not only no swagger with him but a propriety and quiescence of demeanour the very opposite to swagger in conversation his most violent opposition was conveyed by a smile he displayed no other energy than what might be shown in the slight curl of his upper lip if he reproved you he did it by silence there could be no greater contrast than that between him and hoskins and there could be no doubt which man would recommend himself most to our english world by his gait and demeanour but i think there may be a doubt as to which was the best man and a doubt also as to which would make the best husband that my friend was not then engaged to miss gledd i did learn but i learned nothing further except this that he would take his departure with me the first week in may unless anything special occurred to keep him in boston it was some time early in april that i got a note from miss gledd asking me to call on her come at once she said as i want your advice above all things and she signed herself yours in all truth o g i had had many notes from her but none written in this strain and therefore feeling that there was some circumstance to justify such instant notice i got up and went to her then at ten oclock in the morning she jumped up to meet me giving me both her hands oh mr green she said to me im so glad you have come to me it is all over what is over said i my chance of escape from the she baronet i gave in last night pray tell me that i was right yet i want you to tell me the truth and yet above all things you must not tell me that i have been wrong then you have accepted mr pryor i could not help it she said the temptation was too much for me i love the very cut of his coat the turn of his lip the tone of his voice the very sound which he makes as he closes the door behind him is too much for me i believe that i ought to have let him go but i could not do it and what will mr hoskins do i wrote to him immediately and told him everything of course i had johns leave for doing so this calling of my sedate friend by the name of john was to my feeling a most wonderful breaking down of all proprieties i told him the exact truth this morning i got an answer from him saying that he should visit russia i am so sorry because of his mother and sisters and when is it to be oh at once immediately so john says when we resolve on doing these things here on taking the plunge we never stand shilly shallying on the brink as your girls do in england and that is one reason why i have sent for you you must promise to go over with us do you know i am half afraid of him much more afraid of him than i am of you they were to be married very early in may and of course i promised to put off my return for a week or two to suit them and then for the she baronet she said and for all the terrible grandeur of london when i endeavoured to explain to her that she would encounter no great grandeur she very quickly corrected me it is not grandeur of that sort but the grandeur of coldness that i mean i fear that i shall not do for them but mr green i must tell you one thing i have not cut off from myself all means of retreat why what do you mean you have resolved to marry him yes i have promised to do so but i did not promise till he had said that if i could not be made to suit his people in old england he would return here with me and teach himself to suit my people in new england the task will be very much easier they were married in boston not without some considerable splendour of ceremony as far as the splendour of boston went she was so unusual a favourite that everyone wished to be at her wedding and she had no idea of giving herself airs and denying her friends a favour she was married with much clat and as far as i could judge seemed to enjoy the marriage herself now comes the question will she or will she not be received in london as a lady as such a lady as my friend pryor might have been expected to take for his wife the journey to panama illustration text decoration the journey to panama there is perhaps no form of life in which men and women of the present day frequently find themselves for a time existing so unlike their customary conventional life as that experienced on board the large ocean steamers on the voyages so made separate friendships are formed and separate enmities are endured certain lines of temporary politics are originated by the energetic and intrigues generally innocent in their conclusions are carried on with the keenest spirit by those to whom excitement is necessary whereas the idle and torpid sink into insignificance and general contempt as it is their lot to do on board ship as in other places but the enjoyments and activity of such a life do not display themselves till the third or fourth day of the voyage the men and women at first regard each with distrust and illconcealed dislike they by no means anticipate the strong feelings which are to arise and look forward to ten fifteen or twenty days of gloom or sea sickness sea sickness disappears as a general condition on the evening of the second day and the gloom about noon on the fourth then the men begin to think that the women are not so ugly vulgar and insipid and the women drop their monosyllables discontinue the close adherence to their own niches which they first observed and become affable perhaps even beyond their wont on shore and alliances spring up among the men themselves on their first entrance to this new world they generally regard each other with marked aversion each thinking that those nearest to him are low fellows or perhaps worse but by the fourth day if not sooner every man has his two or three intimate friends with whom he talks and smokes and to whom he communicates those peculiar politics and perhaps intrigues of his own voyage the female friendships are slower in their growth for the suspicion of women is perhaps stronger than that of men but when grown they also are stronger and exhibit themselves sometimes in instances of feminine affection but the most remarkable alliances are those made between gentlemen and ladies this is a matter of course on board ship quite as much as on shore and it is of such an alliance that the present tale purports to tell the story such friendships though they may be very dear can seldom be very lasting though they may be full of sweet romance for people become very romantic among the discomforts of a sea voyage such romance is generally short lived and delusive and occasionally is dangerous there are several of these great ocean routes of which by the common consent as it seems of the world england is the centre there is the great eastern line running from southampton across the bay of biscay and up the mediterranean it crosses the isthmus of suez and branches away to australia to india to ceylon and to china there is the great american line traversing the atlantic to new york and boston with the regularity of clockwork the voyage here is so much a matter of everyday routine that romance has become scarce upon the route there are one or two other north american lines perhaps open to the same objection then there is the line of packets to the african coast very romantic as i am given to understand and there is the great west indian route to which the present little history is attached great not on account of our poor west indian islands which cannot at the present moment make anything great but because it spreads itself out from thence to mexico and cuba to guiana and the republics of grenada and venezuela to central america the isthmus of panama and from thence to california vancouvers island peru and chili it may be imagined how various are the tribes which leave the shores of great britain by this route there are frenchmen for the french sugar islands as a rule not very romantic there are old spaniards spaniards of spain seeking to renew their fortunes amidst the ruins of their former empire and new spaniards spaniards that is of the american republics who speak spanish but are unlike the don both in manners and physiognomy men and women with a touch perhaps of indian blood very keen after dollars and not much given to the graces of life there are dutchmen too and danes going out to their own islands there are citizens of the stars and stripes who find their way everywhere and alas perhaps now also citizens of the new southern flag with the palmetto leaf and there are englishmen of every shade and class and englishwomen also it is constantly the case that women are doomed to make the long voyage alone some are going out to join their husbands some to find a husband some few peradventure to leave a husband girls who have been educated at home in england return to their distant homes across the atlantic and others follow their relatives who have gone before them as pioneers into a strange land it must not be supposed that these females absolutely embark in solitude putting their feet upon the deck without the aid of any friendly arm they are generally consigned to some prudent elder and appear as they first show themselves on the ship to belong to a party but as often as not their real loneliness shows itself after awhile the prudent elder is not perhaps congenial and by the evening of the fourth day a new friendship is created not a long time since such a friendship was formed under the circumstances which i am now about to tell a young man not very young for he had turned his thirtieth year but still a young man left southampton by one of the large west indian steam boats purposing to pass over the isthmus of panama and thence up to california and vancouvers island it would be too long to tell the cause which led to these distant voyagings suffice to say it was not the accursed hunger after gold auri sacra fames which so took him nor had he any purpose of permanently settling himself in those distant colonies of great britain he was at the time a widower and perhaps his home was bitter to him without the young wife whom he had early lost as he stepped on board he was accompanied by a gentleman some fifteen years his senior who was to be the companion of his sleeping apartment as far as st thomas the two had been introduced to each other and therefore appeared as friends on board the serrapiqui but their acquaintance had commenced in southampton and my hero ralph forrest by name was alone in the world as he stood looking over the side of the ship at the retreating shores of hampshire i say old fellow wed better see about our places said his new friend slapping him on his back mr matthew morris was an old traveller and knew how to become intimate with his temporary allies at a very short notice a long course of travelling had knocked all bashfulness out of him and when he had a mind to do so he could make any man his brother in half an hour and any woman his sister in ten minutes places what places said forrest a pretty fellow you are to go to california if you dont look sharper than that youll get little to drink and nothing to eat till you come back again dont you know the ships as full as ever she can hold forrest acknowledged that she was full there are places at table for about a hundred and we have a hundred and thirty on board as a matter of course those who dont look sharp will have to scramble however ive put cards on the plates and taken the seats we had better go down and see that none of these spanish fellows oust us so forrest descended after his friend and found that the long tables were already nearly full of expectant dinner eaters when he took his place a future neighbour informed him not in the most gracious voice that he was encroaching on a ladys seat and when he immediately attempted to leave that which he held mr matthew morris forbade him to do so thus a little contest arose which however happily was brought to a close without bloodshed the lady was not present at the moment and the grumpy gentleman agreed to secure for himself a vacant seat on the other side for the first three days the lady did not show herself the grumpy gentleman who as forrest afterwards understood was the owner of stores in bridgetown barbadoes had other ladies with him also first came forth his daughter creeping down to dinner on the second day declaring that she would be unable to eat a morsel and prophesying that she would be forced to retire in five minutes on this occasion however she agreeably surprised herself and her friends then came the grumpy gentlemans wife and the grumpy gentlemans wifes brother on whose constitution the sea seemed to have an effect quite as violent as on that of the ladies and lastly at breakfast on the fourth day appeared miss viner and took her place as mr forrests neighbour at his right hand he had seen her before on deck as she lay on one of the benches vainly endeavouring to make herself comfortable and had remarked to his companion that she was very unattractive and almost ugly dear young ladies it is thus that men always speak of you when they first see you on board ship she was disconsolate sick at heart and ill at ease in body also she did not like the sea she did not in the least like the grumpy gentleman in whose hands she was placed she did not especially like the grumpy gentlemans wife and she altogether hated the grumpy gentlemans daughter who was the partner of her berth that young lady had been very sick and very selfish and miss viner had been very sick also and perhaps equally selfish they might have been angels and yet have hated each other under such circumstances it was no wonder that mr forrest thought her ugly as she twisted herself about on the broad bench vainly striving to be comfortable shell brighten up wonderfully before were in the tropics said mr morris and you wont find her so bad then its she that is to sit next you heaven forbid said forrest but nevertheless he was very civil to her when she did come down on the fourth morning on board the west indian packets the world goes down to its meals in crossing between liverpool and the states the world goes up to them miss viner was by no means a very young lady she also was nearly thirty in guessing her age on board the ship the ladies said that she was thirty six but the ladies were wrong she was an irish woman and when seen on shore in her natural state and with all her wits about her was by no means without attraction she was bright eyed with a clear dark skin and good teeth her hair was of a dark brown and glossy and there was a touch of feeling and also of humour about her mouth which would have saved her from mr forrests ill considered criticism had he first met her under more favourable circumstances youll see a good deal of her mr morris said to him as they began to prepare themselves for luncheon by a cigar immediately after breakfast shes going across the isthmus and down to peru how on earth do you know i pretty well know where theyre all going by this time old grumpy told me so he has her in tow as far as st thomas but knows nothing about her he gives her up there to the captain youll have a chance of making yourself very agreeable as you run across with her to the spanish main mr forrest replied that he did not suppose he should know her much better than he did now but he made no further remark as to her ugliness she had spoken a word or two to him at table and he had seen that her eyes were bright and had found that her tone was sweet i also am going to panama he said to her on the morning of the fifth day the weather at that time was very fine and the october sun as it shone on them while hour by hour they made more towards the south was pleasant and genial the big ship lay almost without motion on the bosom of the atlantic as she was driven through the waters at the rate of twelve miles per hour all was as pleasant now as things can be on board a ship and forrest had forgotten that miss viner had seemed so ugly to him when he first saw her at this moment as he spoke to her they were running through the azores and he had been assisting her with his field glass to look for orange groves on their sloping shores orange groves they had not succeeded in seeing but their failure had not disturbed their peace i also am going to panama are you indeed said she then i shall not feel so terribly alone and disconsolate i have been looking forward with such fear to that journey on from st thomas you shall not be disconsolate if i can help it he said i am not much of a traveller myself but what i can do i will oh thank you it is a pity mr morris is not going on with you hes at home everywhere and knows the way across the isthmus as well as he does down regent street your friend you mean my friend if you call him so and indeed i hope he is for i like him but i dont know more of him than i do of you i also am as much alone as you are perhaps more so but she said a man never suffers in being alone oh does he not dont think me uncivil miss viner if i say that you may be mistaken in that you feel your own shoe when it pinches but do not realise the tight boot of your neighbour perhaps not said she and then there was a pause during which she pretended to look again for the orange groves but there are worse things mr forrest than being alone in the world it is often a womans lot to wish that she were let alone then she left him and retreated to the side of the grumpy gentlemans wife feeling perhaps that it might be prudent to discontinue a conversation which seeing that mr forrest was quite a stranger to her was becoming particular youre getting on famously my dear said the lady from barbadoes pretty well thank you maam said miss viner mr forrest seems to be making himself quite agreeable i tell amelia amelia was the young lady to whom in their joint cabin miss viner could not reconcile herself i tell amelia that she is wrong not to receive attentions from gentlemen on board ship if it is not carried too far and she put great emphasis on the too far i see no harm in it nor i either said miss viner but then amelia is so particular the best way is to take such things as they come said miss viner perhaps meaning that such things never did come in the way of amelia if a lady knows what she is about she need not fear a gentlemans attentions thats just what i tell amelia but then my dear she has not had so much experience as you and i such being the amenities which passed between miss viner and the prudent lady who had her in charge it was not wonderful that the former should feel ill at ease with her own party as the family of the grumpy barbadian was generally considered to be by those on board youre getting along like a house on fire with miss viner said matthew morris to his young friend not much fire i can assure you said forrest she aint so ugly as you thought her ugly no shes not ugly i dont think i ever said she was but she is nothing particular as regards beauty no she wont be lovely for the next three days to come i dare say by the time you reach panama shell be all that is perfect in woman i know how these things go those sort of things dont go at all quickly with me said forrest gravely miss viner is a very interesting young woman and as it seems that her route and mine will be together for some time it is well that we should be civil to each other and the more so seeing that the people she is with are not congenial to her no they are not there is no young man with them i generally observe that on board ship no one is congenial to unmarried ladies except unmarried men it is a recognised nautical rule uncommon hot isnt it we are beginning to feel the tropical air i shall go and cool myself with a cigar in the fiddle the fiddle is a certain part of the ship devoted to smoking and thither mr morris betook himself forrest however did not accompany him but going forward into the bow of the vessel threw himself along upon the sail and meditated on the loneliness of his life on board the serrapiqui the upper tier of cabins opened on to a long gallery which ran round that part of the ship immediately over the saloon so that from thence a pleasant inspection could be made of the viands as they were being placed on the tables the custom on board these ships is for two bells to ring preparatory to dinner at an interval of half an hour at the sound of the first ladies would go to their cabins to adjust their toilets but as dressing for dinner is not carried to an extreme at sea these operations are generally over before the second bell and the lady passengers would generally assemble in the balcony for some fifteen minutes before dinner at first they would stand here alone but by degrees they were joined by some of the more enterprising of the men and so at last a kind of little drawing room was formed the cabins of miss viners party opened to one side of this gallery and that of mr morris and forrest on the other hitherto forrest had been contented to remain on his own side occasionally throwing a word across to the ladies on the other but on this day he boldly went over as soon as he had washed his hands and took his place between amelia and miss viner we are dreadfully crowded here maam said amelia yes my dear we are said her mother but what can one do theres plenty of room in the ladies cabin said miss viner now if there be one place on board a ship more distasteful to ladies than another it is the ladies cabin mr forrest stood his ground but it may be doubted whether he would have done so had he fully understood all that amelia had intended then the last bell rang mr grumpy gave his arm to miss grumpy the brother in law gave his arm to amelia and forrest did the same to miss viner she hesitated for a moment and then took it and by so doing transferred herself mentally and bodily from the charge of the prudent and married mr grumpy to that of the perhaps imprudent and certainly unmarried mr forrest she was wrong a kind hearted motherly old lady from jamaica who had seen it all knew that she was wrong and wished that she could tell her so but there are things of this sort which kind hearted old ladies cannot find it in their hearts to say after all it was only for the voyage perhaps miss viner was imprudent but who in peru would be the wiser perhaps indeed it was the world that was wrong and not miss viner honi soit qui mal y pense she said to herself as she took his arm and leaning on it felt that she was no longer so lonely as she had been on that day she allowed him to give her a glass of wine out of his decanter hadnt you better take mine miss viner asked mr grumpy in a loud voice but before he could be answered the deed had been done dont go too fast old fellow morris said to our hero that night as they were walking the deck together before they turned in one gets into a hobble in such matters before one knows where one is i dont think i have anything particular to fear said forrest i dare say not only keep your eyes open such haridans as mrs grumpy allow any latitude to their tongues out in these diggings youll find that unpleasant tidings will be put on board the ship going down to panama and everybodys eye will be upon you so warned mr forrest did put himself on his guard and the next day and a half his intimacy with miss viner progressed but little these were probably the dullest hours that he had on the whole voyage miss viner saw this and drew back on the afternoon of that second day she walked a turn or two on deck with the weak brother in law and when mr forrest came near her she applied herself to her book she meant no harm but if she were not afraid of what people might say why should he be so so she turned her shoulder towards him at dinner and would not drink of his cup have some of mine miss viner said mr grumpy very loudly but on that day miss viner drank no wine the sun sets quickly as one draws near to the tropics and the day was already gone and the dusk had come on when mr forrest walked out upon the deck that evening a little after six but the night was beautiful and mild and there was a hum of many voices from the benches he was already uncomfortable and sore with a sense of being deserted there was but one person on board the ship that he liked and why should he avoid her and be avoided he soon perceived where she was standing the grumpy family had a bench to themselves and she was opposite to it on her feet leaning against the side of the vessel will you walk this evening miss viner he asked i think not she answered then i shall persevere in asking till you are sure it will do you good for i have not seen you walking all day have you not then i will take a turn oh mr forrest if you knew what it was to have to live with such people as those and then out of that on that evening there grew up between them something like the confidence of real friendship things were told such as none but friends do tell to one another and warm answering words were spoken such as the sympathy of friendship produces alas they were both foolish for friendship and sympathy should have deeper roots she told him all her story she was going out to peru to be married to a man who was nearly twenty years her senior it was a long engagement of ten years standing when first made it was made as being contingent on certain circumstances an option of escaping from it had then been given to her but now there was no longer an option he was rich and she was penniless he had even paid her passage money and her outfit she had not at last given way and taken these irrevocable steps till her only means of support in england had been taken from her she had lived the last two years with a relative who was now dead and he also is my cousin a distant cousin you understand that and do you love him love him what as you loved her whom you have lost as she loved you when she clung to you before she went no certainly not i shall never know anything of that love and is he good he is a hard man men become hard when they deal in money as he has done he was home five years since and i swore to myself that i would not marry him but his letters to me are kind forrest sat silent for a minute or two for they were up in the bow again seated on the sail that was bound round the bowsprit and then he answered her a woman should never marry a man unless she loves him ah says she of course you will condemn me that is the way in which women are always treated they have no choice given them and are then scolded for choosing wrongly but you might have refused him no i could not i cannot make you understand the whole how it first came about that the marriage was proposed and agreed to by me under certain conditions those conditions have come about and i am now bound to him i have taken his money and have no escape it is easy to say that a woman should not marry without love as easy as it is to say that a man should not starve but there are men who starve starve although they work hard i did not mean to judge you miss viner but i judge myself and condemn myself so often where should i be in half an hour from this if i were to throw myself forward into the sea i often long to do it dont you feel tempted sometimes to put an end to it all the waters look cool and sweet but i own i am afraid of the bourne beyond so am i and that fear will keep me from it we are bound to bear our burden of sorrow mine i know is heavy enough yours mr forrest have you not all the pleasures of memory to fall back on and every hope for the future what can i remember or what can i hope but however it is near eight oclock and they have all been at tea this hour past what will my cerberus say to me i do not mind the male mouth if only the two feminine mouths could be stopped then she rose and went back to the stern of the vessel but as she slid into a seat she saw that mrs grumpy was standing over her from thence to st thomas the voyage went on in the customary manner the sun became very powerful and the passengers in the lower part of the ship complained loudly of having their port holes closed the spaniards sat gambling in the cabin all day and the ladies prepared for the general move which was to be made at st thomas the alliance between forrest and miss viner went on much the same as ever and mrs grumpy said very ill natured things on one occasion she ventured to lecture miss viner but that lady knew how to take her own part and mrs grumpy did not get the best of it the dangerous alliance i have said went on the same as ever but it must not be supposed that either person in any way committed aught that was wrong they sat together and talked together each now knowing the others circumstances but had it not been for the prudish caution of some of the ladies there would have been nothing amiss as it was there was not much amiss few of the passengers really cared whether or no miss viner had found an admirer those who were going down to panama were mostly spaniards and as the great separation became nearer people had somewhat else of which to think and then the separation came they rode into that pretty harbour of st thomas early in the morning and were ignorant the most of them that they were lying in the very worst centre of yellow fever among all those plague spotted islands st thomas is very pretty as seen from the ships and when that has been said all has been said that can be said in its favour there was a busy bustling time of it then one vessel after another was brought up alongside of the big ship that had come from england and each took its separate freight of passengers and luggage first started the boat that ran down the leeward islands to demerara taking with her mr grumpy and all his family good bye miss viner said mrs grumpy i hope youll get quite safely to the end of your voyage but do take care im sure i hope everything will be right said amelia as she absolutely kissed her enemy it is astonishing how well young women can hate each other and yet kiss at parting as to everything being right said miss viner that is too much to hope but i do not know that anything is going especially wrong good bye sir and then she put out her hand to mr grumpy he was at the moment leaving the ship laden with umbrellas sticks and coats and was forced to put them down in order to free his hand well good bye he said i hope youll do till you meet your friends at the isthmus i hope i shall sir she replied and so they parted then the jamaica packet started i dare say we shall never see each other again said morris as he shook his friends hand heartily one never does dont interfere with the rights of that gentleman in peru or he might run a knife into you i feel no inclination to injure him on that point thats well and now good bye and thus they also were parted on the following morning the branch ship was despatched to mexico and then on the afternoon of the third day that for colon as we englishmen call the town on this side of the isthmus of panama into that vessel miss viner and mr forrest moved themselves and their effects and now that the three headed cerberus was gone she had no longer hesitated in allowing him to do for her all those little things which it is well that men should do for women when they are travelling a woman without assistance under such circumstances is very forlorn very apt to go to the wall very ill able to assert her rights as to accommodation and i think that few can blame miss viner for putting herself and her belongings under the care of the only person who was disposed to be kind to her late in the evening the vessel steamed out of st thomas harbour and as she went ralph forrest and emily viner were standing together at the stern of the boat looking at the retreating lights of the danish town if there be a place on the earths surface odious to me it is that little danish isle to which so many of our young seamen are sent to die there being no good cause whatever for such sending but the question is one which cannot well be argued here i have five more days of self and liberty left me said miss viner that is my lifes allowance for heavens sake do not say words that are so horrible but am i to lie for heavens sake and say words that are false or shall i be silent for heavens sake and say nothing during these last hours that are allowed to me for speaking it is so to you i can say that it is so and why should you begrudge me the speech i would begrudge you nothing that i could do for you no you should not now that my incubus has gone to barbadoes let me be free for a day or two what chance is there i wonder that the ships machinery should all go wrong and that we should be tossed about in the seas here for the next six months i suppose it would be very wicked to wish it we should all be starved thats all what with a cow on board and a dozen live sheep and thousands of cocks and hens but we are to touch at santa martha and cartagena what would happen to me if i were to run away at santa martha i suppose i should be bound to run with you oh of course and therefore as i would not wish to destroy you i wont do it but it would not hurt you much to be shipwrecked and wait for the next packet miss viner he said after a pause and in the meantime he had drawn nearer to her too near to her considering all things in the name of all that is good and true and womanly go back to england with your feelings if i may judge of them by words which are spoken half in jest mr forrest there is no jest with your feelings a poorhouse in england would be better than a palace in peru an english workhouse would be better but an english poorhouse is not open to me you do not know what it is to have friends no not friends but people belonging to you just so near as to make your respectability a matter of interest to them but not so near that they should care for your happiness emily viner married to mr gorloch in peru is put out of the way respectably she will cause no further trouble but her name may be mentioned in family circles without annoyance the fact is mr forrest that there are people who have no business to live at all i would go back to england he added after another pause when you talk to me with such bitterness of five more days of living liberty you scare my very soul return miss viner and brave the worst he is to meet you at panama remain on this side of the isthmus and send him word that you must return i will be the bearer of the message and shall i walk back to england said miss viner i had not quite forgotten all that he replied very gently there are moments when a man may venture to propose that which under ordinary circumstances would be a liberty money in a small moderate way is not greatly an object to me as a return for my valiant defence of you against your west indian cerberus you shall allow me to arrange that with the agent at colon i do so love plain english mr forrest you are proposing i think to give me something about fifty guineas well call it so if you will said he if you will have plain english that is what i mean so that by my journey out here i should rob and deceive the man i do know and also rob the man i dont know i am afraid of that bourne beyond the waters of which we spoke but i would rather face that than act as you suggest of the feelings between him and you i can of course be no judge no no you cannot but what a beast i am not to thank you i do thank you that which it would be mean in me to take it is noble very noble in you to offer it is a pleasure to me i cannot tell why but it is a pleasure to me to have had the offer but think of me as a sister and you will feel that it would not be accepted could not be accepted i mean even if i could bring myself to betray that other man thus they ran across the carribbean sea renewing very often such conversations as that just given they touched at santa martha and cartagena on the coast of the spanish main and at both places he went with her on shore he found that she was fairly well educated and anxious to see and to learn all that might be seen and learned in the course of her travels on the last day as they neared the isthmus she became more tranquil and quiet in the expression of her feelings than before and spoke with less of gloom than she had done after all ought i not to love him she said he is coming all the way up from callao merely to meet me what man would go from london to moscow to pick up a wife i would and thence round the world to moscow again if she were the wife i wanted yes but a wife who has never said that she loved you it is purely a matter of convenience well i have locked my big box and i shall give the key to him before it is ever again unlocked he has a right to it for he has paid for nearly all that it holds you look at things from such a mundane point of view a woman should or she will always be getting into difficulty mind i shall introduce you to him and tell him all that you have done for me how you braved cerberus and the rest of it i shall certainly be glad to meet him but i shall not tell him of your offer not yet at least if he be good and gentle with me i shall tell him that too after a time i am very bad at keeping secrets as no doubt you have perceived we go across the isthmus at once do we not so the captain says look and she handed him back his own field glass i can see the men on the wooden platform yes and i can see the smoke of an engine and then in little more than an hour from that time the ship had swung round on her anchor colon or aspinwall as it should be called is a place in itself as detestable as st thomas it is not so odious to an englishman for it is not used by englishmen more than is necessary we have no great dpt of traffic there which we might with advantage move elsewhere taken however on its own merits aspinwall is not a detestable place luckily however travellers across the isthmus to the pacific are never doomed to remain there long if they arrive early in the day the railway thence to panama takes them on at once if it be not so they remain on board ship till the next morning of course it will be understood that the transit line chiefly affects americans as it is the highroad from new york to california in less than an hour from their landing their baggage had been examined by the custom house officers of new grenada and they were on the railway cars crossing the isthmus the officials in those out of the way places always seem like apes imitating the doings of men the officers at aspinwall open and look at the trunks just as monkeys might do having clearly no idea of any duty to be performed nor any conception that goods of this or that class should not be allowed to pass it is the thing in europe to examine luggage going into a new country and why should not they be as good as europeans i wonder whether he will be at the station she said when the three hours of the journey had nearly passed forrest could perceive that her voice trembled as she spoke and that she was becoming nervous if he has already reached panama he will be there as far as i could learn the arrival up from peru had not been telegraphed then i have another day perhaps two we cannot say how many i wish he were there nothing is so intolerable as suspense and the box must be opened again when they reached the station at panama they found that the vessel from the south american coast was in the roads but that the passengers were not yet on shore forrest therefore took miss viner down to the hotel and there remained with her sitting next to her in the common drawing room of the house when she had come back from her own bed room it would be necessary that they should remain there four or five days and forrest had been quick in securing a room for her he had assisted in taking up her luggage had helped her in placing her big box and had thus been recognised by the crowd in the hotel as her friend then came the tidings that the passengers were landing and he became nervous as she was i will go down and meet him said he and tell him that you are here i shall soon find him by his name and so he went out everybody knows the scrambling manner in which passengers arrive at an hotel out of a big ship first came two or three energetic heated men who by dint of screeching and bullying have gotten themselves first disposed they always get the worst rooms at the inns the housekeepers having a notion that the richest people those with the most luggage must be more tardy in their movements four or five of this nature passed by forrest in the hall but he was not tempted to ask questions of them one from his age might have been mr gorloch but he instantly declared himself to be count sapparello then came an elderly man alone with a small bag in his hand he was one of those who pride themselves on going from pole to pole without encumbrance and who will be behoved to no one for the carriage of their luggage to him as he was alone in the street forrest addressed himself gorloch said he gorloch are you a friend of his a friend of mine is so said forrest ah indeed yes said the other and then he hesitated sir he then said mr gorloch died at callao just seven days before the ship sailed you had better see mr cox and then the elderly man passed in with his little bag mr gorloch was dead dead said forrest to himself as he leaned back against the wall of the hotel still standing on the street pavement she has come out here and now he is gone and then a thousand thoughts crowded on him who should tell her and how would she bear it would it in truth be a relief to her to find that that liberty for which she had sighed had come to her or now that the testing of her feelings had come to her would she regret the loss of home and wealth and such position as life in peru would give her and above all would this sudden death of one who was to have been so near to her strike her to the heart but what was he to do how was he now to show his friendship he was returning slowly in at the hotel door where crowds of men and women were now thronging when he was addressed by a middle aged good looking gentleman who asked him whether his name was forrest i am told said the gentleman when forrest had answered him that you are a friend of miss viners have you heard the sad tidings from callao it then appeared that this gentleman had been a stranger to mr gorloch but had undertaken to bring a letter up to miss viner this letter was handed to mr forrest and he found himself burdened with the task of breaking the news to his poor friend whatever he did do he must do at once for all those who had come up by the pacific steamer knew the story and it was incumbent on him that miss viner should not hear the tidings in a sudden manner and from a strangers mouth he went up into the drawing room and found miss viner seated there in the midst of a crew of women he went up to her and taking her hand asked her in a whisper whether she would come out with him for a moment where is he said she i know that something is the matter what is it there is such a crowd here step out for a moment and he led her away to her own room where is he said she what is the matter he has sent to say that he no longer wants me tell me am i free from him miss viner you are free though she had asked the question herself she was astounded by the answer but nevertheless no idea of the truth had yet come upon her it is so she said well what else has he written he has bought me as he would a beast of burden and has i suppose a right to treat me as he pleases i have a letter but dear miss viner well tell me all out at once tell me everything you are free miss viner but you will be cut to the heart when you learn the meaning of your freedom he has lost everything in trade he is ruined miss viner he is dead she stood staring at him for a moment or two as though she could not realise the information which he gave her then gradually she retreated to the bed and sat upon it dead mr forrest she said he did not answer her but handed her the letter which she took and read as though it were mechanically the letter was from mr gorlochs partner and told her everything which it was necessary that she should know shall i leave you now he said when he saw that she had finished reading it leave me yes no but you had better leave me and let me think about it alas me that i should have so spoken of him but you have said nothing unkind yes much that was unkind but spoken words cannot be recalled let me be alone how but come to me soon there is no one else here that i can speak to he went out and finding that the hotel dinner was ready he went in and dined then he strolled into the town among the hot narrow dilapidated streets and then after two hours absence returned to miss viners room when he knocked she came and opened the door and he found that the floor was strewed with clothes i am preparing you see for my return the vessel starts back for st thomas the day after to morrow you are quite right to go to go at once oh miss viner emily now at least you must let me help you he had been thinking of her most during those last two hours and her voice had become pleasant to his ears and her eyes very bright to his sight you shall help me she said are you not helping me when at such a time you come to speak to me and you will let me think that i have a right to act as your protector my protector i do know that i want such aid as that during the days that we are here together you shall be my friend you shall not return alone my journeys are nothing to me emily i will return with you to england then she rose up from her seat and spoke to him not for the world she said putting out of question the folly of your forgetting your own objects do you think it possible that i should go with you now that he is dead to you i have spoken of him harshly and now that it is my duty to mourn for him could i do so heartily if you were with me while he lived it seemed to me that in those last days i had a right to speak my thoughts plainly you and i were to part and meet no more and i regarded us both as people apart who for a while might drop the common usages of the world it is so no longer instead of going with you farther i must ask you to forget that we were ever together emily i shall never forget you let your tongue forget me i have given you no cause to speak good of me and you will be too kind to speak evil after that she explained to him all that the letter had contained the arrangements for her journey had all been made money also had been sent to her and mr gorloch in his will had provided for her not liberally seeing that he was rich but still sufficiently and so they parted at panama she would not allow him even to cross the isthmus with her but pressed his hand warmly as he left her at the station god bless you he said and may god bless you my friend she answered thus alone she took her departure for england and he went on his way to california the end printed by w h smith and son strand london
