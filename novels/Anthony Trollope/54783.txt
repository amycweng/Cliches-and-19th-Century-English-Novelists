illustration mary gresley we have known many prettier girls than mary gresley and many handsomer women but we never knew girl or woman gifted with a face which in supplication was more suasive in grief more sad in mirth more merry it was a face that compelled sympathy and it did so with the conviction on the mind of the sympathiser that the girl was altogether unconscious of her own power in her intercourse with us there was alas much more of sorrow than of mirth and we may truly say that in her sufferings we suffered but still there came to us from our intercourse with her much of delight mingled with the sorrow and that delight arose partly no doubt from her womans charms from the bright eye the beseeching mouth the soft little hand and the feminine grace of her unpretending garments but chiefly we think from the extreme humanity of the girl she had little indeed none of that which the world calls society but yet she was pre eminently social her troubles were very heavy but she was making ever an unconscious effort to throw them aside and to be jocund in spite of their weight she would even laugh at them and at herself as bearing them she was a little fair haired creature with broad brow and small nose and dimpled chin with no brightness of complexion no luxuriance of hair no swelling glory of bust and shoulders but with a pair of eyes which as they looked at you would be gemmed always either with a tear or with some spark of laughter and with a mouth in the corners of which was ever lurking some little spark of humour unless when some unspoken prayer seemed to be hanging on her lips of womans vanity she had absolutely none of her corporeal self as having charms to rivet mans love she thought no more than does a dog it was a fault with her that she lacked that quality of womanhood to be loved was to her all the world unconscious desire for the admiration of men was as strong in her as in other women and her instinct taught her as such instincts do teach all women that such love and admiration was to be the fruit of what feminine gifts she possessed but the gifts on which she depended depending on them without thinking on the matter were her softness her trust her womans weakness and that power of supplicating by her eye without putting her petition into words which was absolutely irresistible where is the man of fifty who in the course of his life has not learned to love some woman simply because it has come in his way to help her and to be good to her in her struggles and if added to that source of affection there be brightness some spark of humour social gifts and a strong flavour of that which we have ventured to call humanity such love may become almost a passion without the addition of much real beauty but in thus talking of love we must guard ourselves somewhat from miscomprehension in love with mary gresley after the common sense of the word we never were nor would it have become us to be so had such a state of being unfortunately befallen us we certainly should be silent on the subject we were married and old she was very young and engaged to be married always talking to us of her engagement as a thing fixed as the stars she looked upon us no doubt after she had ceased to regard us simply in our editorial capacity as a subsidiary old uncle whom providence had supplied to her in order that if it were possible the troubles of her life might be somewhat eased by assistance to her from that special quarter we regarded her first almost as a child and then as a young woman to whom we owed that sort of protecting care which a graybeard should ever be ready to give to the weakness of feminine adolescence nevertheless we were in love with her and we think such a state of love to be a wholesome and natural condition we might indeed have loved her grandmother but the love would have been very different had circumstances brought us into connection with her grandmother we hope we should have done our duty and had that old lady been our friend we should we trust have done it with alacrity but in our intercourse with mary gresley there was more than that she charmed us we learned to love the hue of that dark gray stuff frock which she seemed always to wear when she would sit in the low arm chair opposite to us looking up into our eyes as we spoke to her words which must often have stabbed her little heart we were wont to caress her with that inward undemonstrative embrace that one spirit is able to confer upon another we thought of her constantly perplexing our mind for her succour we forgave all her faults we exaggerated her virtues we exerted ourselves for her with a zeal that was perhaps fatuous though we attempted sometimes to look black at her telling her that our time was too precious to be wasted in conversation with her she soon learned to know how welcome she was to us her glove which by the bye was never tattered though she was very poor was an object of regard to us her grandmothers gloves would have been as unacceptable to us as any other morsel of old kid or cotton our heart bled for her now the heart may suffer much for the sorrows of a male friend but it may hardly for such be said to bleed we loved her in short as we should not have loved her but that she was young and gentle and could smile and above all but that she looked at us with those bright beseeching tear laden eyes sterne in his latter days when very near his end wrote passionate love letters to various women and has been called hard names by thackeray not for writing them but because he thus showed himself to be incapable of that sincerity which should have bound him to one love we do not ourselves much admire the sentimentalism of sterne finding the expression of it to be mawkish and thinking that too often he misses the pathos for which he strives from a want of appreciation on his own part of that which is really vigorous in language and touching in sentiment but we think that thackeray has been somewhat wrong in throwing that blame on sternes heart which should have been attributed to his taste the love which he declared when he was old and sick and dying a worn out wreck of a man disgusts us not because it was felt or not felt but because it was told and told as though the teller meant to offer more than that warmth of sympathy which womans strength and womans weakness combined will ever produce in the hearts of certain men this is a sympathy with which neither age nor crutches nor matrimony nor position of any sort need consider itself to be incompatible it is unreasoning and perhaps irrational it gives to outward form and grace that which only inward merit can deserve it is very dangerous because unless watched it leads to words which express that which is not intended but though it may be controlled it cannot be killed he who is of his nature open to such impression will feel it while breath remains to him it was that which destroyed the character and happiness of swift and which made sterne contemptible we do not doubt that such unreasoning sympathy exacted by feminine attraction was always strong in johnsons heart but johnson was strong all over and could guard himself equally from misconduct and from ridicule such sympathy with women such incapability of withstanding the feminine magnet was very strong with goethe who could guard himself from ridicule but not from misconduct to us the child of whom we are speaking for she was so then was ever a child but she bore in her hand the power of that magnet and we admit that the needle within our bosom was swayed by it her story such as we have to tell it was as follows mary gresley at the time when we first knew her was eighteen years old and was the daughter of a medical practitioner who had lived and died in a small town in one of the northern counties for facility in telling our story we will call that town cornboro dr gresley as he seemed to have been called though without proper claim to the title had been a diligent man and fairly successful except in this that he died before he had been able to provide for those whom he left behind him the widow still had her own modest fortune amounting to some eighty pounds a year and that with the furniture of her house was her whole wealth when she found herself thus left with the weight of the world upon her shoulders there was one other daughter older than mary whom we never saw but who was always mentioned as poor fanny there had been no sons and the family consisted of the mother and the two girls mary had been only fifteen when her father died and up to that time had been regarded quite as a child by all who had known her mrs gresley in the hour of her need did as widows do in such cases she sought advice from her clergyman and neighbours and was counselled to take a lodger into her house no lodger could be found so fitting as the curate and when mary was seventeen years old she and the curate were engaged to be married the curate paid thirty pounds a year for his lodgings and on this with their own little income the widow and her two daughters had managed to live the engagement was known to them all as soon as it had been known to mary the love making indeed had gone on beneath the eyes of the mother there had been not only no deceit no privacy no separate interests but as far as we ever knew no question as to prudence in the making of the engagement the two young people had been brought together had loved each other as was so natural and had become engaged as a matter of course it was an event as easy to be foretold or at least as easy to be believed as the pairing of two birds from what we heard of this curate the rev arthur donne for we never saw him we fancy that he was a simple pious commonplace young man imbued with a strong idea that in being made a priest he had been invested with a nobility and with some special capacity beyond that of other men slight in body weak in health but honest true and warm hearted then the engagement having been completed there arose the question of matrimony the salary of the curate was a hundred a year the whole income of the vicar an old man was after payment made to his curate two hundred a year could the curate in such circumstances afford to take to himself a penniless wife of seventeen mrs gresley was willing that the marriage should take place and that they should all do as best they might on their joint income the vicars wife who seems to have been a strong minded sage though somewhat hard woman took mary aside and told her that such a thing must not be there would come she said children and destitution and ruin she knew perhaps more than mary knew when mary told us her story sitting opposite to us in the low arm chair it was the advice of the vicars wife that the engagement should be broken off but that if the breaking off of the engagement were impossible there should be an indefinite period of waiting such engagements cannot be broken off young hearts will not consent to be thus torn asunder the vicars wife was too strong for them to get themselves married in her teeth and the period of indefinite waiting was commenced and now for a moment we will go further back among marys youthful days child as she seemed to be she had in very early years taken a pen in her hand the reader need hardly be told that had not such been the case there would not have arisen any cause for friendship between her and us we are telling an editors tale and it was in our editorial capacity that mary first came to us well in her earliest attempts in her very young days she wrote heaven knows what poetry first no doubt then god help her a tragedy after that when the curate influence first commenced tales for the conversion of the ungodly and at last before her engagement was a fact having tried her wing at fiction in the form of those false little dialogues between tom the saint and bob the sinner she had completed a novel in one volume she was then seventeen was engaged to be married and had completed her novel passing her in the street you would almost have taken her for a child to whom you might give an orange hitherto her work had come from ambition or from a feeling of restless piety inspired by the curate now there arose in her young mind the question whether such talent as she possessed might not be turned to account for ways and means and used to shorten perhaps absolutely to annihilate that uncertain period of waiting the first novel was seen by a man of letters in her neighbourhood who pronounced it to be very clever not indeed fit as yet for publication faulty in grammar faulty even in spelling how i loved the tear that shone in her eye as she confessed this delinquency faulty of course in construction and faulty in character but still clever the man of letters had told her that she must begin again unfortunate man of letters in having thrust upon him so terrible a task in such circumstances what is the candid honest soft hearted man of letters to do go girl and mend your stockings learn to make a pie if you work hard it may be that some day your intellect will suffice to you to read a book and understand it for the writing of a book that shall either interest or instruct a brother human being many gifts are required have you just reason to believe that they have been given to you that is what the candid honest man of letters says who is not soft hearted and in ninety nine cases out of a hundred it will probably be the truth the soft hearted man of letters remembers that this special case submitted to him may be the hundredth and unless the blotted manuscript is conclusive against such possibility he reconciles it to his conscience to tune his counsel to that hope who can say that he is wrong unless such evidence be conclusive who can venture to declare that this aspirant may not be the one who shall succeed who in such emergency does not remember the day in which he also was one of the hundred of whom the ninety and nine must fail and will not remember also the many convictions on his own mind that he certainly would not be the one appointed the man of letters in the neighbourhood of cornboro to whom poor marys manuscript was shown was not sufficiently hard hearted to make any strong attempt to deter her he made no reference to the easy stockings or the wholesome pie pointed out the manifest faults which he saw and added we do not doubt with much more energy than he threw into his words of censure his comfortable assurance that there was great promise in the work mary gresley that evening burned the manuscript and began another with the dictionary close at her elbow then during her work there occurred two circumstances which brought upon her and indeed upon the household to which she belonged intense sorrow and greatly increased trouble the first of these applied more especially to herself the rev arthur donne did not approve of novels of other novels than those dialogues between tom and bob of the falsehood of which he was unconscious and expressed a desire that the writing of them should be abandoned how far the lover went in his attempt to enforce obedience we of course could not know but he pronounced the edict and the edict though not obeyed created tribulation then there came forth another edict which had to be obeyed an edict from the probable successor of the late dr gresley ordering the poor curate to seek employment in some clime more congenial to his state of health than that in which he was then living he was told that his throat and lungs and general apparatus for living and preaching were not strong enough for those hyperborean regions and that he must seek a southern climate he did do so and before i became acquainted with mary had transferred his services to a small town in dorsetshire the engagement of course was to be as valid as ever though matrimony must be postponed more indefinitely even than heretofore but if mary could write novels and sell them then how glorious would it be to follow her lover into dorsetshire the rev arthur donne went and the curate who came in his place was a married man wanting a house and not lodgings so mary gresley persevered with her second novel and completed it before she was eighteen the literary friend in the neighbourhood to the chance of whose acquaintance i was indebted for my subsequent friendship with mary gresley found this work to be a great improvement on the first he was an elderly man who had been engaged nearly all his life in the conduct of a scientific and agricultural periodical and was the last man whom i should have taken as a sound critic on works of fiction but with spelling grammatical construction and the composition of sentences he was acquainted and he assured mary that her progress had been great should she burn that second story she asked him she would if he so recommended and begin another the next day such was not his advice i have a friend in london said he who has to do with such things and you shall go to him i will give you a letter he gave her the fatal letter and she came to us she came up to town with her novel but not only with her novel for she brought her mother with her so great was her eloquence so excellent her suasive power either with her tongue or by that look of supplication in her face that she induced her mother to abandon her home in cornboro and trust herself to london lodgings the house was let furnished to the new curate and when i first heard of the gresleys they were living on the second floor in a small street near to the euston square station poor fanny as she was called was left in some humble home at cornboro and mary travelled up to try her fortune in the great city when we came to know her well we expressed our doubts as to the wisdom of such a step yes the vicars wife had been strong against the move mary confessed as much that lady had spoken most forcible words had uttered terrible predictions had told sundry truths but mary had prevailed and the journey was made and the lodgings were taken we can now come to the day on which we first saw her she did not write but came direct to us with her manuscript in her hand a young woman sir wants to see you said the clerk in that tone to which we were so well accustomed and which indicated the dislike which he had learned from us to the reception of unknown visitors young woman what young woman well sir she is a very young woman quite a girl like i suppose she has got a name who sent her i cannot see any young woman without knowing why what does she want got a manuscript in her hand sir ive no doubt she has and a ton of manuscripts in drawers and cupboards tell her to write i wont see any woman young or old without knowing who she is the man retired and soon returned with an envelope belonging to the office on which was written miss mary gresley late of cornboro he also brought me a note from the man of letters down in yorkshire of what sort is she i asked looking at the introduction she aint amiss as to looks said the clerk and shes modest like now certainly it is the fact that all female literary aspirants are not modest like we read our friends letter through while poor mary was standing at the counter below how eagerly should we have run to greet her to save her from the gaze of the public to welcome her at least with a chair and the warmth of our editorial fire had we guessed then what were her qualities it was not long before she knew the way up to our sanctum without any clerk to show her and not long before we knew well the sound of that low but not timid knock at our door made always with the handle of the parasol with which her advent was heralded we will confess that there was always music to our ears in that light tap from the little round wooden knob the man of letters in yorkshire whom we had known well for many years had been never known to us with intimacy we had bought with him and sold with him had talked with him and perhaps walked with him but he was not one with whom we had eaten or drunk or prayed a dull well instructed honest man he was fond of his money and as we had thought as unlikely as any man to be waked to enthusiasm by the ambitious dreams of a young girl but mary had been potent even over him and he had written to me saying that miss gresley was a young lady of exceeding promise in respect of whom he had a strong presentiment that she would rise if not to eminence at least to a good position as a writer but she is very young he added having read this letter we at last desired our clerk to send the lady up we remember her step as she came to the door timid enough then hesitating but yet with an assumed lightness as though she was determined to show us that she was not ashamed of what she was doing she had on her head a light straw hat such as then was very unusual in london and is not now we believe commonly worn in the streets of the metropolis by ladies who believe themselves to know what they are about but it was a hat worn upon her head and not a straw plate done up with ribbons and reaching down the incline of the forehead as far as the top of the nose and she was dressed in a gray stuff frock with a little black band round her waist as far as our memory goes we never saw her in any other dress or with other hat or bonnet on her head and what can we do for you miss gresley we said standing up and holding the literary gentlemans letter in our hand we had almost said my dear seeing her youth and remembering our own age we were afterwards glad that we had not so addressed her though it came before long that we did call her my dear in quite another spirit she recoiled a little from the tone of our voice but recovered herself at once mr thinks that you can do something for me i have written a novel and i have brought it to you you are very young are you not to have written a novel i am young she said but perhaps older than you think i am eighteen then for the first time there came into her eye that gleam of a merry humour which never was allowed to dwell there long but which was so alluring when it showed itself that is a ripe age we said laughing and then we bade her seat herself at once we began to pour forth that long and dull and ugly lesson which is so common to our life in which we tried to explain to our unwilling pupil that of all respectable professions for young women literature is the most uncertain the most heart breaking and the most dangerous you hear of the few who are remunerated we said but you hear nothing of the thousands that fail it is so noble she replied but so hopeless there are those who succeed yes indeed even in a lottery one must gain the prize but they who trust to lotteries break their hearts but literature is not a lottery if i am fit i shall succeed mr thinks i may succeed many more words of wisdom we spoke to her and well do we remember her reply when we had run all our line off the reel and had completed our sermon i shall go on all the same she said i shall try and try again and again her power over us to a certain extent was soon established of course we promised to read the ms and turned it over no doubt with an anxious countenance to see of what kind was the writing there is a feminine scrawl of a nature so terrible that the task of reading it becomes worse than the treadmill i know i can write well though i am not quite sure about the spelling said mary as she observed the glance of our eyes she spoke truly the writing was good though the erasures and alterations were very numerous and then the story was intended to fill only one volume i will copy it for you if you wish it said mary though there are so many scratchings out it has been copied once we would not for worlds have given her such labour and then we promised to read the tale we forget how it was brought about but she told us at that interview that her mother had obtained leave from the pastrycook round the corner to sit there waiting till mary should rejoin her i thought it would be trouble enough for you to have one of us here she said with her little laugh when i asked her why she had not brought her mother on with her i own that i felt that she had been wise and when i told her that if she would call on me again that day week i would then have read at any rate so much of her work as would enable me to give her my opinion i did not invite her to bring her mother with her i knew that i could talk more freely to the girl without the mothers presence even when you are past fifty and intend only to preach a sermon you do not wish to have a mother present when she was gone we took up the roll of paper and examined it we looked at the division into chapters at the various mottoes the poor child had chosen pronounced to ourselves the name of the story it was simply the name of the heroine an easy going unaffected well chosen name and read the last page of it on such occasions the reader of the work begins his task almost with a conviction that the labour which he is about to undertake will be utterly thrown away he feels all but sure that the matter will be bad that it will be better for all parties writer intended readers and intended publisher that the written words should not be conveyed into type that it will be his duty after some fashion to convey that unwelcome opinion to the writer and that the writer will go away incredulous and accusing mentally the mentor of the moment of all manner of literary sins among which ignorance jealousy and falsehood will in the poor authors imagination be most prominent and yet when the writer was asking for that opinion declaring his especial desire that the opinion should be candid protesting that his present wish is to have some gauge of his own capability and that he has come to you believing you to be above others able to give him that gauge while his petition to you was being made he was in every respect sincere he had come desirous to measure himself and had believed that you could measure him when coming he did not think that you would declare him to be an apollo he had told himself no doubt how probable it was that you would point out to him that he was a dwarf you find him to be an ordinary man measuring perhaps five feet seven and unable to reach the standard of the particular regiment in which he is ambitious of serving you tell him so in what civillest words you know and you are at once convicted in his mind of jealousy ignorance and falsehood and yet he is perhaps a most excellent fellow and capable of performing the best of service only in some other regiment as we looked at miss gresleys manuscript tumbling it through our hands we expected even from her some such result she had gained two things from us already by her outward and inward gifts such as they were first that we would read her story and secondly that we would read it quickly but she had not as yet gained from us any belief that by reading it we could serve it we did read it the most of it before we left our editorial chair on that afternoon so that we lost altogether the daily walk so essential to our editorial health and were put to the expense of a cab on our return home and we incurred some minimum of domestic discomfort from the fact that we did not reach our own door till twenty minutes after our appointed dinner hour i have this moment come from the office as hard as a cab could bring me we said in answer to the mildest of reproaches explaining nothing as to the nature of the cause which had kept us so long at our work we must not allow our readers to suppose that the intensity of our application had arisen from the overwhelming interest of the story it was not that the story entranced us but that our feeling for the writer grew as we read the story it was simple unaffected and almost painfully unsensational it contained as i came to perceive afterwards little more than a recital of what her imagination told her might too probably be the result of her own engagement it was the story of two young people who became engaged and could not be married after a course of years the man with many true arguments asked to be absolved the woman yields with an expressed conviction that her lover is right settles herself down for maiden life then breaks her heart and dies the character of the man was utterly untrue to nature that of the woman was true but commonplace other interest or other character there was none the dialogues between the lovers were many and tedious and hardly a word was spoken between them which two lovers really would have uttered it was clearly not a work as to which i could tell my little friend that she might depend upon it for fame or fortune when i had finished it i was obliged to tell myself that i could not advise her even to publish it but yet i could not say that she had mistaken her own powers or applied herself to a profession beyond her reach there were a grace and delicacy in her work which were charming occasionally she escaped from the trammels of grammar but only so far that it would be a pleasure to point out to her her errors there was not a word that a young lady should not have written and there were throughout the whole evident signs of honest work we had six days to think it over between our completion of the task and her second visit she came exactly at the hour appointed and seated herself at once in the arm chair before us as soon as the young man had closed the door behind him there had been no great occasion for nervousness at her first visit and she had then by an evident effort overcome the diffidence incidental to a meeting with a stranger but now she did not attempt to conceal her anxiety well she said leaning forward and looking up into our face with her two hands folded together even though truth standing full panoplied at our elbow had positively demanded it we could not have told her then to mend her stockings and bake her pies and desert the calling that she had chosen she was simply irresistible and would we fear have constrained us into falsehood had the question been between falsehood and absolute reprobation of her work to have spoken hard heart breaking words to her would have been like striking a child when it comes to kiss you we fear that we were not absolutely true at first and that by that absence of truth we made subsequent pain more painful well she said looking up into our face have you read it we told her that we had read every word of it and it is no good we fear that we began by telling her that it certainly was good after a fashion very good considering her youth and necessary inexperience very good indeed as we said this she shook her head and sent out a spark or two from her eyes intimating her conviction that excuses or quasi praise founded on her youth would avail her nothing would anybody buy it from me she asked no we did not think that any publisher would pay her money for it would they print it for me without costing me anything then we told her the truth as nearly as we could she lacked experience and if as she had declared to us before she was determined to persevere she must try again and must learn more of that lesson of the worlds ways which was so necessary to those who attempted to teach that lesson to others but i shall try again at once she said we shook our head endeavouring to shake it kindly currer bell was only a young girl when she succeeded she added the injury which currer bell did after this fashion was almost equal to that perpetrated by jack sheppard and yet currer bell was not very young when she wrote she remained with us then for above an hour for more than two probably though the time was not specially marked by us and before her visit was brought to a close she had told us of her engagement with the curate indeed we believe that the greater part of her little history as hitherto narrated was made known to us on that occasion we asked after her mother early in the interview and learned that she was not on this occasion kept waiting at the pastrycooks shop mary had come alone making use of some friendly omnibus of which she had learned the route when she told us that she and her mother had come up to london solely with the view of forwarding her views in her intended profession we ventured to ask whether it would not be wiser for them to return to cornboro seeing how improbable it was that she would have matter fit for the press within any short period then she explained that they had calculated that they would be able to live in london for twelve months if they spent nothing except on absolute necessaries the poor girl seemed to keep back nothing from us we have clothes that will carry us through and we shall be very careful i came in an omnibus but i shall walk if you will let me come again then she asked me for advice how was she to set about further work with the best chance of turning it to account it had been altogether the fault of that retired literary gentleman down in the north who had obtained what standing he had in the world of letters by writing about guano and the cattle plague divested of all responsibility and fearing no further trouble to himself he had ventured to tell this girl that her work was full of promise promise means probability and in this case there was nothing beyond a remote chance that she and her mother should have left their little household gods and come up to london on such a chance was a thing terrible to the mind but we felt before these two hours were over that we could not throw her off now we had become old friends and there had been that between us which gave her a positive claim upon our time she had sat in our arm chair leaning forward with her elbows on her knees and her hands stretched out till we caught by the charm of her unstudied intimacy had wheeled round our chair and had placed ourselves as nearly as the circumstances would admit in the same position the magnetism had already begun to act upon us we soon found ourselves taking it for granted that she was to remain in london and begin another book it was impossible to resist her before the interview was over we who had been conversant with all these matters before she was born we who had latterly come to regard our own editorial fault as being chiefly that of personal harshness we who had repulsed aspirant novelists by the score we had consented to be a party to the creation if not to the actual writing of this new book it was to be done after this fashion she was to fabricate a plot and to bring it to us written on two sides of a sheet of letter paper on the reverse sides we were to criticise this plot and prepare emendations then she was to make out skeletons of the men and women who were afterwards to be clothed with flesh and made alive with blood and covered with cuticles after that she was to arrange her proportions and at last before she began to write the story she was to describe in detail such part of it as was to be told in each chapter on every advancing wavelet of the work we were to give her our written remarks all this we promised to do because of the quiver in her lip and the alternate tear and sparkle in her eye now that i have found a friend i feel sure that i can do it she said as she held our hand tightly before she left us in about a month during which she had twice written to us and twice been answered she came with her plot it was the old story with some additions and some change there was matrimony instead of death at the end and an old aunt was brought in for the purpose of relenting and producing an income we added a few details feeling as we did so that we were the very worst of botchers we doubt now whether the old sad simple story was not the better of the two then after another lengthened interview we sent our pupil back to create her skeletons when she came with the skeletons we were dear friends and learned to call her mary then it was that she first sat at our editorial table and wrote a love letter to the curate it was then mid winter wanting but a few days to christmas and arthur as she called him did not like the cold weather he does not say so she said but i fear he is ill dont you think there are some people with whom everything is unfortunate she wrote her letter and had recovered her spirits before she took her leave we then proposed to her to bring her mother to dine with us on christmas day we had made a clean breast of it at home in regard to our heart flutterings and had been met with a suggestion that some kindness might with propriety be shown to the old lady as well as to the young one we had felt grateful to the old lady for not coming to our office with her daughter and had at once assented when we made the suggestion to mary there came first a blush over all her face and then there followed the well known smile before the blush was gone youll all be dressed fine she said we protested that not a garment would be changed by any of the family after the decent church going in the morning just as i am she asked just as you are we said looking at the dear gray frock adding some mocking assertion that no possible combination of millinery could improve her and mamma will be just the same then we will come she said we told her an absolute falsehood as to some necessity which would take us in a cab to euston square on the afternoon of that christmas day so that we could call and bring them both to our house without trouble or expense you shant do anything of the kind she said however we swore to our falsehood perceiving as we did so that she did not believe a word of it but in the matter of the cab we had our own way we found the mother to be what we had expected a weak ladylike lachrymose old lady endowed with a profound admiration for her daughter and so bashful that she could not at all enjoy her plum pudding we think that mary did enjoy hers thoroughly she made a little speech to the mistress of the house praising ourselves with warm words and tearful eyes and immediately won the heart of a new friend she allied herself warmly to our daughters put up with the schoolboy pleasantries of our sons and before the evening was over was dressed up as a ghost for the amusement of some neighbouring children who were brought in to play snapdragon mrs gresley as she drank her tea and crumbled her bit of cake seated on a distant sofa was not so happy partly because she remembered her old gown and partly because our wife was a stranger to her mary had forgotten both circumstances before the dinner was half over she was the sweetest ghost that ever was seen how pleasant would be our ideas of departed spirits if such ghosts would visit us frequently they repeated their visits to us not unfrequently during the twelve months but as the whole interest attaching to our intercourse had reference to circumstances which took place in that editorial room of ours it will not be necessary to refer further to the hours very pleasant to ourselves which she spent with us in our domestic life she was ever made welcome when she came and was known by us as a dear well bred modest clever little girl the novel went on that catalogue of the skeletons gave us more trouble than all the rest and many were the tears which she shed over it and sad were the misgivings by which she was afflicted though never vanquished how was it to be expected that a girl of eighteen should portray characters such as she had never known in her intercourse with the curate all the intellect had been on her side she had loved him because it was requisite to her to love some one and now as she had loved him she was as true as steel to him but there had been almost nothing for her to learn from him the plan of the novel went on and as it did so we became more and more despondent as to its success and through it all we knew how contrary it was to our own judgment to expect even to dream of anything but failure though we went on working with her finding it to be quite impossible to resist her entreaties we did tell her from day to day that even presuming she were entitled to hope for ultimate success she must go through an apprenticeship of ten years before she could reach it then she would sit silent repressing her tears and searching for arguments with which to support her cause working hard is apprenticeship she said to us once yes mary but the work will be more useful and the apprenticeship more wholesome if you will take them for what they are worth i shall be dead in ten years she said if you thought so you would not intend to marry mr donne but even were it certain that such would be your fate how can that alter the state of things the world would know nothing of that and if it did would the world buy your book out of pity i want no one to pity me she said but i want you to help me so we went on helping her at the end of four months she had not put pen to paper on the absolute body of her projected novel and yet she had worked daily at it arranging its future construction during the next month when we were in the middle of march a gleam of real success came to her we had told her frankly that we would publish nothing of hers in the periodical which we were ourselves conducting she had become too dear to us for us not to feel that were we to do so we should be doing it rather for her sake than for that of our readers but we did procure for her the publication of two short stories elsewhere for these she received twelve guineas and it seemed to her that she had found an el dorado of literary wealth i shall never forget her ecstasy when she knew that her work would be printed or her renewed triumph when the first humble cheque was given into her hands there are those who will think that such a triumph as connected with literature must be sordid for ourselves we are ready to acknowledge that money payment for work done is the best and most honest test of success we are sure that it is so felt by young barristers and young doctors and we do not see why rejoicing on such realisation of long cherished hope should be more vile with the literary aspirant than with them what do you think ill do first with it she said we thought she meant to send something to her lover and we told her so ill buy mamma a bonnet to go to church in i didnt tell you before but she hasnt been these three sundays because she hasnt one fit to be seen i changed the cheque for her and she went off and bought the bonnet though i was successful for her in regard to the two stories i could not go beyond that we could have filled pages of periodicals with her writing had we been willing that she should work without remuneration she herself was anxious for such work thinking that it would lead to something better but we opposed it and indeed would not permit it believing that work so done can be serviceable to none but those who accept it that pages may be filled without cost during the whole winter while she was thus working she was in a state of alarm about her lover her hope was ever that when warm weather came he would again be well and strong we know nothing sadder than such hope founded on such source for does not the winter follow the summer and then again comes the killing spring at this time she used to read us passages from his letters in which he seemed to speak of little but his own health in her literary ambition he never seemed to have taken part since she had declared her intention of writing profane novels as regarded him his sole merit to us seemed to be in his truth to her he told her that in his opinion they two were as much joined together as though the service of the church had bound them but even in saying that he spoke ever of himself and not of her well may came dangerous doubtful deceitful may and he was worse then for the first time the dread word consumption passed her lips it had already passed ours mentally a score of times we asked her what she herself would wish to do would she desire to go down to dorsetshire and see him she thought awhile and said that she would wait a little longer the novel went on and at length in june she was writing the actual words on which as she thought so much depended she had really brought the story into some shape in the arrangement of her chapters and sometimes even i began to hope there were moments in which with her hope was almost certainty towards the end of june mr donne declared himself to be better he was to have a holiday in august and then he intended to run up to london and see his betrothed he still gave details which were distressing to us of his own symptoms but it was manifest that he himself was not desponding and she was governed in her trust or in her despair altogether by him but when august came the period of his visit was postponed the heat had made him weak and he was to come in september early in august we ourselves went away for our annual recreation not that we shoot grouse or that we have any strong opinion that august and september are the best months in the year for holiday making but that everybody does go in august we ourselves are not specially fond of august in many places to which one goes a touring mosquitoes bite in that month the heat too prevents one from walking the inns are all full and the railways crowded april and may are twice pleasanter months in which to see the world and the country but fashion is everything and no man or woman will stay in town in august for whom there exists any practicability of leaving it we went on the th just as though we had a moor and one of the last things we did before our departure was to read and revise the last written chapter of marys story about the end of september we returned and up to that time the lover had not come to london immediately on our return we wrote to mary and the next morning she was with us she had seated herself on her usual chair before she spoke and we had taken her hand asked after herself and her mother then with something of mirth in our tone we demanded the work which she had done since our departure he is dying she replied she did not weep as she spoke it was not on such occasions as this that the tears filled her eyes but there was in her face a look of fixed and settled misery which convinced us that she at least did not doubt the truth of her own assertion we muttered something as to our hope that she was mistaken the doctor there has written to tell mamma that it is so here is his letter the doctors letter was a good letter written with more of assurance than doctors can generally allow themselves to express i fear that i am justified in telling you said the doctor that it can only be a question of weeks we got up and took her hand there was not a word to be uttered i must go to him she said after a pause well yes it will be better but we have no money it must be explained now that offers of slight very slight pecuniary aid had been made by us both to mary and to her mother on more than one occasion these had been refused with adamantine firmness but always with something of mirth or at least of humour attached to the refusal the mother would simply refer to the daughter and mary would declare that they could manage to see the twelvemonth through and go back to cornboro without becoming absolute beggars she would allude to their joint wardrobe and would confess that there would not have been a pair of boots between them but for that twelve guineas and indeed she seemed to have stretched that modest incoming so as to cover a legion of purchases and of these things she was never ashamed to speak we think there must have been at least two gray frocks because the frock was always clean and never absolutely shabby our girls at home declared that they had seen three of her frock as it happened she never spoke to us but the new boots and the new gloves and ever so many things that i cant tell you about which we really couldnt have gone without all came out of the twelve guineas that she had taken not only with delight but with triumph but pecuniary assistance from ourselves she had always refused it would be a gift she would say have it as you like but people dont give other people money dont they thats all you know about the world yes to beggars we hope we neednt come to that it was thus that she always answered us but always with something of laughter in her eye as though their poverty was a joke now when the demand upon her was for that which did not concern her personal comfort which referred to a matter felt by her to be vitally important she declared without a minutes hesitation that she had not money for the journey of course you can have money we said i suppose you will go at once oh yes at once that is in a day or two after he shall have received my letter why should i wait we sat down to write a cheque and she seeing what we were doing asked how much it was to be no half that will do she said mamma will not go we have talked it over and decided it yes i know all about that i am going to see my lover my dying lover and i have to beg for the money to take me to him of course i am a young girl but in such a condition am i to stand upon the ceremony of being taken care of a housemaid wouldnt want to be taken care of at eighteen we did exactly as she bade us and then attempted to comfort her while the young man went to get money for the cheque what consolation was possible it was simply necessary to admit with frankness that sorrow had come from which there could be no present release yes she said time will cure it in a way one dies in time and then of course it is all cured one hears of this kind of thing often she said afterwards still leaning forward in her chair still with something of the old expression in her eyes something almost of humour in spite of her grief but it is the girl who dies when it is the girl there isnt after all so much harm done a man goes about the world and can shake it off and then there are plenty of girls we could not tell her how infinitely more important to our thinking was her life than that of him whom she was going to see now for the last time but there did spring up within our mind a feeling greatly opposed to that conviction which formerly we had endeavoured to impress upon herself that she was destined to make for herself a successful career she went and remained by her lovers bed side for three weeks she wrote constantly to her mother and once or twice to ourselves she never again allowed herself to entertain a gleam of hope and she spoke of her sorrow as a thing accomplished in her last interview with us she had hardly alluded to her novel and in her letters she never mentioned it but she did say one word which made us guess what was coming you will find me greatly changed in one thing she said so much changed that i need never have troubled you the day for her return to london was twice postponed but at last she was brought to leave him stern necessity was too strong for her let her pinch herself as she might she must live down in dorsetshire and could not live on his means which were as narrow as her own she left him and on the day after her arrival in london she walked across from euston square to our office yes she said it is all over i shall never see him again on this side of heavens gates we do not know that we ever saw a tear in her eyes produced by her own sorrow she was possessed of some wonderful strength which seemed to suffice for the bearing of any burden then she paused and we could only sit silent with our eyes fixed upon the rug i have made him a promise she said at last of course we asked her what was the promise though at the moment we thought that we knew i will make no more attempt at novel writing such a promise should not have been asked or given we said vehemently it should have been asked because he thought it right she answered and of course it was given must he not know better than i do is he not one of gods ordained priests in all the world is there one so bound to obey him as i there was nothing to be said for it at such a moment as that there is no enthusiasm equal to that produced by a death bed parting i grieve greatly she said that you should have had so much vain labour with a poor girl who can never profit by it i dont believe the labour will have been vain we answered having altogether changed those views of ours as to the futility of the pursuit which she had adopted i have destroyed it all she said what burned the novel every scrap of it i told him that i would do so and that he should know that i had done it every page was burned after i got home last night and then i wrote to him before i went to bed do you mean that you think it wicked that people should write novels we asked he thinks it to be a misapplication of gods gifts and that has been enough for me he shall judge for me but i will not judge for others and what does it matter i do not want to write a novel now they remained in london till the end of the year for which the married curate had taken their house and then they returned to cornboro we saw them frequently while they were still in town and despatched them by the train to the north just when the winter was beginning at that time the young clergyman was still living down in dorsetshire but he was lying in his grave when christmas came mary never saw him again nor did she attend his funeral she wrote to us frequently then as she did for years afterwards i should have liked to have stood at his grave she said but it was a luxury of sorrow that i wished to enjoy and they who cannot earn luxuries should not have them they were going to manage it for me here but i knew i was right to refuse it right indeed as far as we knew her she never moved a single point from what was right all these things happened many years ago mary gresley on her return to cornboro apprenticed herself as it were to the married curate there and called herself i think a female scripture reader i know that she spent her days in working hard for the religious aid of the poor around her from time to time we endeavoured to instigate her to literary work and she answered our letters by sending us wonderful little dialogues between tom the saint and bob the sinner we are in no humour to criticise them now but we can assert that though that mode of religious teaching is most distasteful to us the literary merit shown even in such works as these was very manifest and there came to be apparent in them a gleam of humour which would sometimes make us think that she was sitting opposite to us and looking at us and that she was tom the saint and that we were bob the sinner we said what we could to turn her from her chosen path throwing into our letters all the eloquence and all the thought of which we were masters but our eloquence and our thought were equally in vain at last when eight years had passed over her head after the death of mr donne she married a missionary who was going out to some forlorn country on the confines of african colonisation and there she died we saw her on board the ship in which she sailed and before we parted there had come that tear into her eyes the old look of supplication on her lips and the gleam of mirth across her face we kissed her once for the first and only time as we bade god bless her the turkish bath illustration the turkish bath it was in the month of august the world had gone to the moors and the rhine but we were still kept in town by the exigencies of our position we had been worked hard during the preceding year and were not quite as well as our best friends might have wished us and we resolved upon taking a turkish bath this little story records the experience of one individual man but our readers we hope will without a grudge allow us the use of the editorial we we doubt whether the story could be told at all in any other form we resolved upon taking a turkish bath and at about three oclock in the day we strutted from the outer to the inner room of the establishment in that light costume and with that air of arab dignity which are peculiar to the place as everybody has not taken a turkish bath in jermyn street we will give the shortest possible description of the position we had entered of course in the usual way leaving our hat and our boots and our valuables among the numerous respectable assistants who throng the approaches and as we had entered we had observed a stout middle aged gentleman on the other side of the street clad in vestments somewhat the worse for wear and to our eyes particularly noticeable by reason of the tattered condition of his gloves a well to do man may have no gloves or may simply carry in his hands those which appertain to him rather as a thing of custom than for any use for which he requires them but a tattered glove worn on the hand is to our eyes the surest sign of a futile attempt at outer respectability it is melancholy to us beyond expression our brother editors we do not doubt are acquainted with the tattered glove and have known the sadness which it produces if there be an editor whose heart has not been softened by the feminine tattered glove that editor is not our brother in this instance the tattered glove was worn by a man and though the usual indication of poor circumstances was conveyed there was nevertheless something jaunty in the gentlemans step which preserved him from the desecration of pity we barely saw him but still were thinking of him as we passed into the building with the oriental letters on it and took off our boots and pulled out our watch and purse we were of course accommodated with two checked towels and having in vain attempted to show that we were to the manner born by fastening the larger of them satisfactorily round our own otherwise naked person had obtained the assistance of one of those very skilful eastern boys who glide about the place and create envy by their familiarity with its mysteries with an absence of all bashfulness which soon grows upon one we had divested ourselves of our ordinary trappings beneath the gaze of five or six young men lying on surrounding sofas among whom we recognised young walker of the treasury and hereby testify on his behalf that he looks almost as fine a fellow without his clothes as he does with them and had strutted through the doorway into the bath room trailing our second towel behind us having observed the matter closely in the course of perhaps half a dozen visits we are prepared to recommend that mode of entry to our young friends as being at the same time easy and oriental there are those who wear the second towel as a shawl thereby no doubt achieving a certain decency of garb but this is done to the utter loss of all dignity and a feminine appearance is produced such as is sometimes that of a lady of fifty looking after her maid servants at seven oclock in the morning and intending to dress again before breakfast and some there are who carry it under the arm simply as a towel but these are they who from english perversity wilfully rob the institution of that picturesque orientalism which should be its greatest charm a few are able to wear the article as a turban and that no doubt should be done by all who are competent to achieve the position we have observed that men who can do so enter the bath room with an air and are received there with a respect which no other arrangement of the towel will produce we have tried this but as the turban gets over our eyes and then falls altogether off our brow we have abandoned it in regard to personal deportment depending partly on the step somewhat on the eye but chiefly on the costume it must be acknowledged that the attempt and not the deed confounds us it is not every man who can carry a blue towel as a turban and look like an arab in the streets of cairo as he walks slowly down the room in jermyn street with his arms crossed on his naked breast the attempt and not the deed does confound one shockingly we therefore recommend that the second towel should be trailed the effect is good and there is no difficulty in the trailing which may not be overcome we had trailed our way into the bath room and had slowly walked to one of those arm chairs in which it is our custom on such occasions to seat ourselves and to await sudation there are marble couches and if a man be able to lie on stone for half an hour without a movement beyond that of clapping his hands or a sound beyond a hollow voiced demand for water the effect is not bad but he loses everything if he tosses himself uneasily on his hard couch and we acknowledge that our own elbows are always in the way of our own comfort and that our bones become sore we think that the marble sofas must be intended for the younger turks if a man can stretch himself on stone without suffering for the best part of an hour or more bravely perhaps without appearing to suffer let him remember that all is not done even then very much will depend on the manner in which he claps his hands and the hollowness of the voice in which he calls for water there should we think be two blows of the palms one is very weak and proclaims its own futility even to dull london ears it seems at once to want the eastern tone we have heard three given effectively but we think that it requires much practice and even when it is perfect the result is that of western impatience rather than of eastern gravity no word should be pronounced beyond that one word water the effect should be as though the whole mind were so devoted to the sudorific process as to admit of no extraneous idea there should seem to be almost an agony in the effort as though the man enduring it conscious that with success he would come forth a god was aware that being as yet but mortal he may perish in the attempt two claps of the hand and a call for water and that repeated with an interval of ten minutes are all the external signs of life that the young turkish bather may allow to himself while he is stretched upon his marble couch we had taken a chair well aware that nothing god like could be thus achieved and contented to obtain the larger amount of human comfort the chairs are placed two and two and a custom has grown up of which we scarcely think that the origin has been eastern in accordance with which friends occupying these chairs will spend their time in conversation the true devotee to the turkish bath will we think never speak at all but when the speaking is low in tone just something between a whisper and an articulate sound the slight murmuring hum produced is not disagreeable we cannot quite make up our mind whether this use of the human voice be or be not oriental but we think that it adds to the mystery and upon the whole it gratifies let it be understood however that harsh resonant clearly expressed speech is damnable the man who talks aloud to his friend about the trivial affairs of life is selfish ignorant unpoetical and english in the very worst sense of the word who but an ass proud of his own capacity for braying would venture to dispel the illusions of a score of bathers by observing aloud that the house sat till three oclock that morning but though friends may talk in low voices a man without a friend will hardly fall into conversation at the turkish bath it is said that our countrymen are unapt to speak to each other without introduction and this inaptitude is certainly not decreased by the fact that two men meet each other with nothing on but a towel a piece finding yourself next to a man in such a garb you hardly know where to begin and then there lies upon you the weight of that necessity of maintaining a certain dignity of deportment which has undoubtedly grown upon you since you succeeded in freeing yourself from your socks and trousers for ourselves we have to admit that the difficulty is much increased by the fact that we are short sighted and are obligated by the sudorific processes and by the shampooing and washing that are to come to leave our spectacles behind us the delicious wonder of the place is no doubt increased to us but our incapability of discerning aught of those around us in that low gloomy light is complete jones from friday street or even walker from the treasury is the same to us as one of those asiatic slaves who administer to our comfort and flit about the place with admirable decorum and self respect on this occasion we had barely seated ourselves when another bather with slow majestic step came to the other chair and with a manner admirably adapted to the place stretching out his naked legs and throwing back his naked shoulders seated himself beside us we are much given to speculations on the characters and probable circumstances of those with whom we are brought in contact our editorial duties require that it should be so how should we cater for the public did we not observe the public in all its moods we thought that we could see at once that this was no ordinary man and we may as well aver here at the beginning of our story that subsequent circumstances proved our first conceptions to be correct the absolute features of the gentleman we did not indeed see plainly the gloom of the place and our own deficiency of sight forbade it but we could discern the thorough man of the world the traveller who had seen many climes the cosmopolitan to whom east and west were alike in every motion that he made we confess that we were anxious for conversation and that we struggled within ourselves for an apt subject thinking how we might begin but the apt subject did not occur to us and we should have passed that half hour of repose in silence had not our companion been more ready than ourselves sir said he turning round in his seat with a peculiar and captivating grace i shall not i hope offend or transgress any rule of politeness by speaking to a stranger there was ease and dignity in his manner and at the same time some slight touch of humour which was very charming i thought that i detected just a hint of an irish accent in his tone but if so the dear brogue of his country which is always delightful to me had been so nearly banished by intercourse with other tongues as to leave the matter still a suspicion a suspicion or rather a hope by no means we answered turning round on our left shoulder but missing the grace with which he had made his movement there is nothing said he to my mind so absurd as that two men should be seated together for an hour without venturing to open their mouths because they do not know each other and what matter does it make whether a man has his breeches on or is without them my hope had now become an assurance as he named the article of clothing which peculiarly denotes a man he gave a picturesque emphasis to the word which was certainly hibernian who does not know the dear sound and as a chance companion for a few idle minutes is there any one so likely to prove himself agreeable as a well informed travelled irishman and yet said we men do depend much on their outward paraphernalia indeed and they do said our friend and why because they can trust their tailors when they cant trust themselves give me the man who can make a speech without any of the accessories of the pulpit who can preach what sermon there is in him without a pulpit his words were energetic but his voice was just suited to the place had he spoken aloud so that others might have heard him we should have left our chair and have retreated to one of the inner and hotter rooms at the moment his words were perfectly audible but he spoke in a fitting whisper it is a part of my creed he continued that we should never lose even a quarter of an hour what a strange mass of human beings one finds in this city of london a mighty maze but not without a plan we replied bedad and its hard enough to find the plan said he it struck me that after that he rose into a somewhat higher flight of speech as though he had remembered and was desirous of dropping his country it is the customary and perhaps the only fault of an irishman whether it be there or not we can expatiate free as the poet says how unintelligible is london new york or constantinople one can understand or even paris one knows what the world is doing in these cities and what men desire what men desire is nearly the same in all cities we remarked and not without truth as we think is it money you mane he said again relapsing yes money no doubt is the grand desideratum the to prepon the to kalon the to pan plato and pope were evidently at his fingers ends we did not conclude from this slight evidence that he was thoroughly imbued with the works either of the poet or the philosopher but we hold that for the ordinary purposes of conversation a superficial knowledge of many things goes further than an intimacy with one or two money continued he is everything no doubt rem rem rem si possis recte si non you know the rest i dont complain of that i like money myself i know its value ive had it and im not ashamed to say it sir ive been without it our sympathies are completely with you in reference to the latter position we said remembering with a humility that we hope is natural to us that we were not always editors what i complain of is said our new friend still whispering as he passed his hand over his arms and legs to learn whether the temperature of the room was producing its proper effect that if a man here in london have a diamond or a pair of boots or any special skill at his command he cannot take his article to the proper mart and obtain for it the proper price can he do that in constantinople we enquired much better and more accurately than he can in london and so he can in paris we did not believe this but as we were thinking after what fashion we would express our doubts he branched off so quickly to a matter of supply and demand with which we were specially interested that we lost the opportunity of arguing the general question a man of letters he said a capable and an instructed man of letters can always get a market for his wares in paris a capable and instructed man of letters will do so in london we said as soon as he has proved his claims he must prove them in paris before they can be allowed yes he must prove them by the bye will you have a cheroot so saying he stretched out his hand and took from the marble slab beside him two cheroots which he had placed there he then proceeded to explain that he did not bring in his case because of the heat but that he was always muni that was his phrase with a couple in the hope that he might meet an acquaintance with whom to share them i accepted his offer and when we had walked round the chamber to a light provided for the purpose we reseated ourselves his manner of moving about the place was so good that i felt it to be a pity that he should ever have a rag on more than he wore at present his tobacco i must own did not appear to me to be of the first class but then i am not in the habit of smoking cheroots and am no judge of the merits of the weed as grown in the east yes a man in paris must prove his capability but then how easily he can do it if the fact to be proved be there and how certain is the mart if he have the thing to sell we immediately denied that in this respect there was any difference between the two capitals pointing out what we believe to be a fact that in one capital as in the other there exists and must ever exist extreme difficulty in proving the possession of an art so difficult to define as capability of writing for the press nothing but success can prove it we said as we slapped our thigh with an energy altogether unbecoming our position as a turkish bather a man may have a talent then and he cannot use it till he have used it he may possess a diamond and cannot sell it till he have sold it what is a man to do who wishes to engage himself in any of the multifarious duties of the english press how is he to begin in new york i can tell such a one where to go at once let him show in conversation that he is an educated man and they will give him a trial on the staff of any news paper they will let him run his venture for the pages of any magazine he may write his fingers off here and not an editor of them all will read a word that he writes here he touched us and we were indignant when he spoke of the magazines we knew that he was wrong with newspapers we said we imagine it to be impossible that contributions from the outside world should be looked at but papers sent to the magazines at any rate to some of them are read i believe said he that a little farce is kept up they keep a boy to look at a line or two and then return the manuscript the pages are filled by the old stock writers who are sure of the market let them send what they will padding mongers who work eight hours a day and hardly know what they write about we again loudly expressed our opinion that he was wrong and that there did exist magazines the managers of which were sedulously anxious to obtain the assistance of what he called literary capacity wherever they could find it sitting there at the turkish bath with nothing but a towel round us we could not declare ourselves to a perfect stranger and we think that as a rule editors should be impalpable but we did express our opinion very strongly and you believe said he with something of scorn in his voice that if a man who had been writing english for the press in other countries in new york say or in doblin a man of undoubted capacity mind you were to make the attempt here in london he would get a hearing certainly he would said we and would any editor see him unless he came with an introduction from some special friend we paused a moment before we answered this because the question was to us one having a very special meaning let an editor do his duty with ever so pure a conscience let him spend all his days and half his nights reading manuscripts and holding the balance fairly between the public and those who wish to feed the public let his industry be never so unwearied and his impartiality never so unflinching still he will if possible avoid the pain of personally repelling those to whom he is obliged to give an unfavourable answer but we at the turkish bath were quite unknown to the outer world and might hazard an opinion as any stranger might have done and we have seen very many such visitors as those to whom our friend alluded and may perhaps see many more yes said we an editor might or might not see such a gentleman but if pressed no doubt he would an english editor would be quite as likely to do so as a french editor this we declared with energy having felt ourselves to be ruffled by the assertion that these things are managed better in paris or in new york than in london then mr would you give me an interview if i call with a little manuscript which i have to morrow morning said my irish friend addressing us with a beseeching tone and calling us by the very name by which we are known among our neighbours and tradesmen we felt that everything was changed between us and that the man had plunged a dagger into us yes he had plunged a dagger into us had we had our clothes on had we felt ourselves to possess at the moment our usual form of life we think that we could have rebuked him as it was we could only rise from our chair throw away the fag end of the filthy cheroot which he had given us and clap our hands half a dozen times for the asiatic to come and shampoo us but the irishman was at our elbow you will let me see you to morrow he said my name is molloy michael molloy i have not a card about me because my things are outside there a card would do no good at all we said again clapping our hands for the shampooer i may call then said mr michael molloy certainly yes you can call if you please then having thus ungraciously acceded to the request made to us we sat down on the marble bench and submitted ourselves to the black attendant during the whole of the following operation while the man was pummelling our breast and poking our ribs and pinching our toes while he was washing us down afterwards and reducing us gradually from the warm water to the cold we were thinking of mr michael molloy and the manner in which he had entrapped us into a confidential conversation the scoundrel must have plotted it from the very first must have followed us into the bath and taken his seat beside us with a deliberately premeditated scheme he was too just the man whom we should not have chosen to see with a worthless magazine article in his hand we think that we can be efficacious by letter but we often feel ourselves to be weak when brought face to face with our enemies at that moment our anger was hot against mr molloy and yet we were conscious of a something of pride which mingled with our feelings it was clear to us that mr molloy was no ordinary person and it did in some degree gratify our feelings that such a one should have taken so much trouble to encounter us we had found him to be a well informed pleasant gentleman and the fact that he was called molloy and desired to write for the magazine over which we presided could not really be taken as detracting from his merits there had doubtless been a fraud committed on us a palpable fraud the man had extracted assurances from us by a false pretence that he did not know us but then the idea on his part that anything could be gained by his doing so was in itself a compliment to us that such a man should take so much trouble to approach us one who could quote horace and talk about the to kalon was an acknowledgment of our power as we returned to the outer chamber we looked round to see mr molloy in his usual garments but he was not as yet there we waited while we smoked one of our own cigars but he came not he had so far gained his aim and as we presumed preferred to run the risk of too long a course of hot air to risking his object by seeing us again on that afternoon at last we left the building and are bound to confess that our mind dwelt much on mr michael molloy during the remainder of that evening it might be that after all we should gain much by the singular mode of introduction which the man had adopted he was certainly clever and if he could write as well as he could talk his services might be of value punctually at the hour named he was announced and we did not now for one moment think of declining the interview mr molloy had so far succeeded in his stratagem that we could not now resort to the certainly not unusual practice of declaring ourselves to be too closely engaged to see any one and of sending him word that he should confide to writing whatever he might have to say to us it had too occurred to us that as mr molloy had paid his three shillings and sixpence for the turkish bath he would not prove to be one of that class of visitors whose appeals to tender hearted editors are so peculiarly painful i am willing to work day and night for my wife and children and if you will use this short paper in your next number it will save us from starvation for a month yes sir from starvation who is to resist such an appeal as that or to resent it but the editor knows that he is bound in honesty to resist it altogether so to steel himself against it that it shall have no effect upon him at least as regards the magazine which is in his hands and yet if the short thing be only decently written if it be not absurdly bad what harm will its publication do to anyone if the waste let us call it waste of half a dozen pages will save a family from hunger for a month will they not be well wasted but yet again such tenderness is absolutely incompatible with common honesty and equally so with common prudence we think that our readers will see the difficulty and understand how an editor may wish to avoid those interviews with tattered gloves but my friend mr michael molloy had had three and sixpence to spend on a turkish bath had had money wherewith to buy certainly the very vilest of cigars we thought of all this as mr michael molloy was ushered into our room the first thing we saw was the tattered glove and then we immediately recognised the stout middle aged gentleman whom we had seen on the other side of jermyn street as we entered the bathing establishment it had never before occurred to us that the two persons were the same not though the impression made by the poverty stricken appearance of the man in the street had remained distinct upon our mind the features of the gentleman we had hardly even yet seen at all nevertheless we had known and distinctly recognised his outward gait and mien both with and without his clothes one tattered glove he now wore and the other he carried in his gloved hand as we saw this we were aware at once that all our preconception had been wrong that that too common appeal would be made and that we must resist it as best we might there was still a certain jauntiness in his air as he addressed us i hope thin said he as we shook hands with him yell not take amiss the little ruse by which we caught ye it was a ruse then mr molloy divil a doubt o that mr editor but you were coming to the turkish bath independently of our visit there sorrow a bath idve cum to at all only i saw you go into the place id just three and ninepence in my pocket and says i to myself mick me boy its a good investment there was three and sixpence for them savages to rub me down and threepence for the two cheroots from the little shop round the corner i wish theyd been better for your sake it had been a plant from beginning to end and the to kalon and the half dozen words from horace had all been parts of mr molloys little game and how well he had played it the outward trappings of the man as we now saw them were poor and mean and he was mean looking too because of his trappings but there had been nothing mean about him as he strutted along with a blue checked towel round his body how well the fellow had understood it all and had known his own capacity and now that you are here mr molloy what can we do for you we said with as pleasant a smile as we were able to assume of course we knew what was to follow out came the roll of paper of which we had already seen the end projecting from his breast pocket and we were assured that we should find the contents of it exactly the thing for our magazine there is no longer any diffidence in such matters no reticence in preferring claims and singing ones own praises all that has gone by since competitive examination has become the order of the day no man no woman no girl no boy hesitates now to declare his or her own excellence and capability its just a short thing on social manners said mr molloy and if yell be so good as to cast yer eye over it i think yell find ive hit the nail on the head the five oclock tay table is what ive called it oh the five oclock tea table dont ye like the name about social manners is it just a rap on the knuckles for some of em sharp short and decisive i dont doubt but what yell like it to declare as though by instinct that that was not the kind of thing we wanted was as much a matter of course as it is for a man buying a horse to say that he does not like the brutes legs or that he falls away in his quarters and mr molloy treated our objection just as does the horse dealer those of his customers he assured us with a smile with a smile behind which we could see the craving eagerness of his heart that his little article was just the thing for us our immediate answer was of course ready if he would leave the paper with us we would look at it and return it if it did not seem to suit us there is a half promise about this reply which too often produces a false satisfaction in the breast of a beginner with such a one it is the second interview which is to be dreaded but my friend mr molloy was not new to the work and was aware that if possible he should make further use of the occasion which he had earned for himself at so considerable a cost yell read it will ye he said oh certainly well read it certainly and yell use it if ye can as to that mr molloy we can say nothing weve got to look solely to the interest of the periodical and sure what can ye do better for the periodical than print a paper like that which there is not a lady at the west end of the town wont be certain to read at any rate well look at it mr molloy said we standing up from our chair but still he hesitated in his going and did not go im a married man mr he said we simply bowed our head at the announcement i wish you could see mrs molloy he added we murmured something as to the pleasure it would give us to make the acquaintance of so estimable a lady there isnt a betther woman than herself this side of heaven though i say it that oughtnt said he and weve three young ones we knew the argument that was coming knew it so well and yet were so unable to accept it as any argument sit down one moment mr he continued till i tell you a short story we pleaded our engagements averring that they were peculiarly heavy at that moment sure and we know what that manes said mr molloy its just walk out of this as quick as you came in its that what it manes and yet as he spoke there was a twinkle of humour in his eye that was almost irresistible and we ourselves we could not forbear to smile when we smiled we knew that we were lost come now mr editor when you think how much it cost me to get the inthroduction youll listen to me for five minutes any way we will listen to you we said resuming our chair remembering as we did so the three and sixpence the two cigars the to kalon the line from pope and the half line from horace the man had taken much trouble with the view of placing himself where he now was when we had been all but naked together i had taken him to be the superior of the two and what were we that we should refuse him an interview simply because he had wares to sell which we should only be too willing to buy at his price if they were fit for our use then he told his tale as for paris constantinople and new york he frankly admitted that he knew nothing of those capitals when we reminded him with some ill nature as we thought afterwards that he had assumed an intimacy with the current literature of the three cities he told us that such remarks were just the sparkling gims of conversation in which a man shouldnt expect to find rale diamonds of doblin he knew every street every lane every newspaper every editor but the poverty dependence and general poorness of a provincial press had crushed him and he had boldly resolved to try a fight in the methropolis of litherature he referred us to the managers of the boyne bouncer the clontarf chronicle the donnybrook debater and the echoes of erin assuring us that we should find him to be as well esteemed as known in the offices of those widely circulated publications his reading he told us was unbounded and the pen was as ready to his hand as is the plough to the hand of the husbandman did we not think it a noble ambition in him thus to throw himself into the great areanay as he called it and try his fortune in the methropolis of litherature he paused for a reply and we were driven to acknowledge that whatever might be said of our friends prudence his courage was undoubted ive got it here said he ive got it all here and he touched his right breast with the fingers of his left hand which still wore the tattered glove he had succeeded in moving us mr molloy we said well read your paper and well then do the best we can for you we must tell you fairly that we hardly like your subject but if the writing be good you can try your hand at something else sure theres nothing under the sun i wont write about at your bidding if we can be of service to you mr molloy we will then the editor broke down and the man spoke to the man i need not tell you mr molloy that the heart of one man of letters always warms to another it was because i knew ye was of that sort that i followed ye in yonder he said with a tear in his eye the butter boat of benevolence was in our hand and we proceeded to pour out its contents freely it is a vessel which an editor should lock up carefully and should he lose the key he will not be the worse for the loss we need not repeat here all the pretty things that we said to him explaining to him from a full heart with how much agony we were often compelled to resist the entreaties of literary suppliants declaring to him how we had longed to publish tons of manuscript simply in order that we might give pleasure to those who brought them to us we told him how accessible we were to a womans tear to a mans struggle to a girls face and assured him of the daily wounds which were inflicted on ourselves by the impossibility of reconciling our duties with our sympathies bedad thin said mr molloy grasping our hand youll find none of that difficulty wid me if youll sympathise like a man ill work for you like a horse we assured him that we would really thinking it probable that he might do some useful work for the magazine and then we again stood up waiting for his departure now ill tell ye a plain truth said he and ye may do just as ye plaise about it there isnt an ounce of tay or a pound of mait along with mrs molloy this moment and whats more there isnt a shilling between us to buy it i never begged in my life not yet but if you can advance me a sovereign on that manuscript it will save me from taking the coat on my back to a pawnbrokers shop for whatever itll fetch there we paused a moment as we thought of it all and then we handed him the coin for which he asked us if the manuscript should be worthless the loss would be our own we would not grudge a slice from the wholesome home made loaf after we had used the butter boat of benevolence it dont become me said mr molloy to thank you for such a thrifle as a loan of twenty shillings but ill never forget the feeling that has made you listen to me and that too after i had been rather down on you at thim baths we gave him a kindly nod of the head and then he took his departure yell see me again anyways he said and we promised that we would we were anxious enough about the manuscript but we could not examine it at that moment when our office work was done we walked home with the roll in our pocket speculating as we went on the probable character of mr molloy we still believed in him still believed in him in spite of the manner in which he had descended in his language and had fallen into a natural flow of words which alone would not have given much promise of him as a man of letters but a human being in regard to his power of production is the reverse of a rope he is as strong as his strongest part and remembering the effect which molloys words had had upon us at the turkish bath we still thought that there must be something in him if so how pleasant would it be to us to place such a man on his legs modestly on his legs so that he might earn for his wife and bairns that meat and tea which he had told us that they were now lacking an editor is always striving to place some one modestly on his legs in literature on his or her striving and alas so often failing here had come a man in regard to whom as i walked home with his manuscript in my pocket i did feel rather sanguine of all the rubbish that i ever read in my life that paper on the five oclock tea table was i think the worst it was not only vulgar foolish unconnected and meaningless but it was also ungrammatical and unintelligible even in regard to the wording of it the very spelling was defective the paper was one with which no editor sub editor or reader would have found it necessary to go beyond the first ten lines before he would have known that to print it would have been quite out of the question we went through with it because of our interest in the man but as it was in the beginning so it was to the end a farrago of wretched nonsense so bad that no one without experience in such matters would believe it possible that even the writer should desire the publication of it it seemed to us to be impossible that mr molloy should ever have written a word for those hibernian periodicals which he had named to us he had got our sovereign and with that as far as we were concerned there must be an end of mr molloy we doubted even whether he would come for his own manuscript but he came he came exactly at the hour appointed and when we looked at his face we felt convinced that he did not doubt his own success there was an air of expectant triumph about him which dismayed us it was clear enough that he was confident that he should take away with him the full price of his article after deducting the sovereign which he had borrowed you like it thin he said before we had been able to compose our features to a proper form for the necessary announcement mr molloy we said it will not do you must believe us that it will not do not do no indeed we need not explain further but but you had really better turn your hand to some other occupation some other occupa ation he exclaimed opening wide his eyes and holding up both his hands indeed we think so mr molloy and youve read it every word of it on our honour and you wont have it well no mr molloy certainly we cannot take it ye reject my article on the five oclock tay table looking into his face as he spoke we could not but be certain that its rejection was to him as astonishing as would have been its acceptance to the readers of the magazine he put his hand up to his head and stood wondering i suppose yed better choose your own subject for yourself he said as though by this great surrender on his own part he was getting rid of all the difficulty on ours mr molloy we began we may as well be candid with you ill tell you what it is said he ive taken such a liking to you theres nothing i wont do to plaise ye ill just put it in my pocket and begin another for ye as soon as the children have had their bit of dinner at last we did succeed or thought that we succeeded in making him understand that we regarded the case as being altogether hopeless and were convinced that it was beyond his powers to serve us and im to be turned off like that he said bursting into open tears as he threw himself into a chair and hid his face upon the table ah wirra wirra whatll i do at all sure and didnt i think it was fixed as firm between us as the nelson monument when ye handselled me with the money didnt i think it was as good as done and done i begged him not to regard the money assuring him that he was welcome to the sovereign theres my wifell be brought to bed any day he went on to say and not a haporth of anything ready for it deed thin and the worlds hard the worlds very hard and this was he who had talked to me about constantinople and new york at the baths and had made me believe that he was a well informed well to do man of the world even now we did not suspect that he was lying to us why he should be such as he seemed to be was a mystery but even yet we believed in him after a fashion that he was sorely disappointed and broken hearted because of his wife was so evident to us that we offered him another sovereign regarding it as the proper price of that butter boat of benevolence which we had permitted ourselves to use but he repudiated our offer ive never begged said he and for myself id sooner starve and mary jane would sooner starve than i should beg it will be best for us both to put an end to ourselves and to have done with it this was very melancholy and as he lay with his head upon the table we did not see how we were to induce him to leave us youd better take the sovereign just for the present we said niver said he looking up for a moment niver and still he continued to sob about this period of the interview which before it was ended was a very long interview we ourselves made a suggestion the imprudence of which we afterwards acknowledged to ourselves we offered to go to his lodgings and see his wife and children though the man could not write a good magazine article yet he might be a very fitting object for our own personal kindness and the more we saw of the man the more we liked him in spite of his incapacity the place is so poor he said objecting to our offer after what had passed between us we felt that that could be no reason against our visit and we began for a moment to fear that he was deceiving us not yet he cried not quite yet i will try once again once again you will let me see you once more and you will take the other sovereign we said trying him he should have had the other sovereign if he would have taken it but we confess that had he done so then we should have regarded him as an impostor but he did not take it and left us in utter ignorance as to his true character after an interval of three days he came again and there was exactly the same appearance he wore the same tattered gloves he had not pawned his coat there was the same hat shabby when observed closely but still carrying a decent appearance when not minutely examined in his face there was no sign of want and at moments there was a cheeriness about him which was almost refreshing ive got a something this time that i think ye must like unless youre harder to plaise than rhadhamanthus so saying he tendered me another roll of paper which i at once opened intending to read the first page of it the essay was entitled the church of england a question for the people it was handed to me as having been written within the last three days and from its bulk might have afforded fair work for a fortnight to a writer accustomed to treat of subjects of such weight as we had expected the first page was unintelligible absurd and farcical we began to be angry with ourselves for having placed ourselves in such a connection with a man so utterly unable to do that which he pretended to do i think ive hit it off now said he watching our face as we were reading the reader need not be troubled with a minute narrative of the circumstances as they occurred during the remainder of the interview what had happened before was repeated very closely he wondered he remonstrated he complained and he wept he talked of his wife and family and talked as though up to this last moment he had felt confident of success judging from his face as he entered the room we did not doubt but that he had been confident his subsequent despair was unbounded and we then renewed our offer to call on his wife after some hesitation he gave us an address in hoxton begging us to come after seven in the evening if it were possible he again declined the offer of money and left us understanding that we would visit his wife on the following evening you are quite sure about the manuscript he said as he left us we replied that we were quite sure on the following day we dined early at our club and walked in the evening to the address which mr molloy had given us in hoxton it was a fine evening in august and our walk made us very warm the street named was a decent little street decent as far as cleanliness and newness could make it but there was a melancholy sameness about it and an apparent absence of object which would have been very depressing to our own spirits it led nowhither and had been erected solely with the view of accommodating decent people with small incomes we at once priced the houses in our mind at ten and sixpence a week and believed them to be inhabited by pianoforte tuners coach builders firemen and public office messengers there was no squalor about the place but it was melancholy light coloured and depressive we made our way to no and finding the door open entered the passage come in cried the voice of our friend and in the little front parlour we found him seated with a child on each knee while a winning little girl of about twelve was sitting in a corner of the room mending her stockings the room itself and the appearance of all around us were the very opposite of what we had expected everything no doubt was plain was in a certain sense poor but nothing was poverty stricken the children were decently clothed and apparently were well fed mr molloy himself when he saw me had that twinkle of humour in his eye which i had before observed and seemed to be afflicted at the moment with none of that extreme agony which he had exhibited more than once in our presence please sir mother aint in from the hospital not yet said the little girl rising up from her chair but its past seven and she wont be long this announcement created some surprise we had indeed heard that of mrs molloy which might make it very expedient that she should seek the accommodation of an hospital but we could not understand that in such circumstances she should be able to come home regularly at seven oclock in the evening then there was a twinkle in our friend molloys eye which almost made us think for the moment that we had been made the subject of some hitherto unintelligible hoax and yet there had been the man at the baths in jermyn street and the two manuscripts had been in our hands and the man had wept as no man weeps for a joke you would come you know said mr molloy who had now put down the two bairns and had risen from his seat to greet us we are glad to see you so comfortable we replied father is quite comfortable sir said the little girl we looked into mr molloys face and saw nothing but the twinkle in the eye we had certainly been done by the most elaborate hoax that had ever been perpetrated we did not regret the sovereign so much as those outpourings from the butter boat of benevolence of which we felt that we had been cheated heres mother said the girl running to the door mr molloy stood grinning in the middle of the room with the youngest child again in his arms he did not seem to be in the least ashamed of what he had done and even at that moment conveyed to us more of liking for his affection for the little boy than of anger for the abominable prank that he had played us that he had lied throughout was evident as soon as we saw mrs molloy whatever ailment might have made it necessary that she should visit the hospital it was not one which could interfere at all with her power of going and returning she was a strong hearty looking woman of about forty with that mixture in her face of practical kindness with severity in details which we often see in strong minded women who are forced to take upon themselves the management and government of those around them she courtesied and took off her bonnet and shawl and put a bottle into a cupboard as she addressed us mick said as you was coming sir and im sure we is glad to see you only sorry for the trouble sir we were so completely in the dark that we hardly knew how to be civil to her hardly knew whether we ought to be civil to her or not we dont quite understand why weve been brought here we said endeavouring to maintain at any rate a tone of good humour he was still embracing the little boy but there had now come a gleam of fun across his whole countenance and he seemed to be almost shaking his sides with laughter your husband represented himself as being in distress we said gravely we were restrained by a certain delicacy from informing the woman of the kind of distress to which mr molloy had especially alluded most falsely lord love you sir said the woman just step in here then she led us into a little back room in which there was a bedstead and an old writing desk or escritoire covered with papers her story was soon told her husband was a madman mad we said preparing for escape from what might be to us most serious peril he wouldnt hurt a mouse said mrs molloy as for the children hes that good to them there aint a young woman in all london thatd be better at handling em then we heard her story in which it appeared to us that downright affection for the man was the predominant characteristic she herself was as she told us head day nurse at saint patricks hospital going there every morning at eight and remaining till six or seven for these services she received thirty shillings a week and her board and she spoke of herself and her husband as being altogether removed from pecuniary distress indeed while the money part of the question was being discussed she opened a little drawer in the desk and handed us back our sovereign almost without an observation molloy himself had come of decent people on this point she insisted very often and gave us to understand that he was at this moment in receipt of a pension of a hundred a year from his family he had been well educated she said having been at trinity college dublin till he had been forced to leave his university for some slight but repeated irregularity early in life he had proclaimed his passion for the press and when he and she were married absolutely was earning a living in dublin by some use of the scissors and paste pot the whole tenor of his career i could not learn though mrs molloy would have told us everything had time allowed even during the years of his sanity in dublin he had only been half sane treating all the world around him with the effusions of his terribly fertile pen hell write all night if ill let him have a candle said mrs molloy we asked her why she did let him have a candle and made some enquiry as to the family expenditure in paper the paper she said was given to him from the office of a newspaper which she would not name and which molloy visited regularly every day there aint a man in all london works harder said mrs molloy he is mad i dont say nothing against it but there is some of it so beautiful i wonder they dont print it this was the only word she spoke with which we could not agree ah sir said she you havent seen his poetry we were obliged to tell her that seeing poetry was the bane of our existence there was an easy absence of sham about this woman and an acceptance of life as it had come to her which delighted us she complained of nothing and was only anxious to explain the little eccentricities of her husband when we alluded to some of his marvellously untrue assertions she stopped us at once he do lie she said certainly he do how he makes them all out is wonderful but he wouldnt hurt a fly it was evident to us that she not only loved her husband but admired him she showed us heaps of manuscript with which the old drawers were crammed and yet that paper on the church of england had been new work done expressly for us when the story had been told we went back to him and he received us with a smile good bye molloy we said good bye to you sir he replied shaking hands with us we looked at him closely and could hardly believe that it was the man who had sat by us at the turkish bath he never troubled us again or came to our office but we have often called on him and have found that others of our class do the same we have even helped to supply him with the paper which he continues to use we presume for the benefit of other editors illustration josephine de montmorenci illustration josephine de montmorenci the little story which we are about to relate refers to circumstances which occurred some years ago and we desire therefore that all readers may avoid the fault of connecting the personages of the tale either the editor who suffered so much and who behaved we think so well or the ladies with whom he was concerned with any editor or with any ladies known to such readers either personally or by name for though the story as told is a true story we who tell it have used such craft in the telling that we defy the most astute to fix the time or to recognise the characters it will be sufficient if the curious will accept it as a fact that at some date since magazines became common in the land a certain editor sitting in his office came upon the perusal of the following letter addressed to him by name king charles street st may dear sir i think that literature needs no introduction and judging of you by the character which you have made for yourself in its paths i do not doubt but you will feel as i do i shall therefore write to you without reserve i am a lady not possessing that modesty which should make me hold a low opinion of my own talents and equally free from that feeling of self belittlement which induces so many to speak humbly while they think proudly of their own acquirements though i am still young i have written much for the press and i believe i may boast that i have sometimes done so successfully hitherto i have kept back my name but i hope soon to be allowed to see it on the title page of a book which shall not shame me my object in troubling you is to announce the fact agreeable enough to myself that i have just completed a novel in three volumes and to suggest to you that it should make its first appearance to the world in the pages of the magazine under your control i will frankly tell you that i am not myself fond of this mode of publication but messrs x y z of paternoster row with whom you are doubtless acquainted have assured me that such will be the better course in these matters one is still terribly subject to the tyranny of the publishers who surely of all cormorants are the most greedy and of all tyrants are the most arrogant though i have never seen you i know you too well to suspect for a moment that my words will ever be repeated to my respectable friends in the row shall i wait upon you with my ms or will you call for it or perhaps it may be better that i should send it to you young ladies should not run about even after editors and it might be so probable that i should not find you at home messrs x y and z have read the ms or more probably the young man whom they keep for the purpose has done so and the nod of approval has been vouchsafed perhaps this may suffice but if a second examination be needful the work is at your service yours faithfully and in hopes of friendly relations josephine de montmorenci i am english though my unfortunate name will sound french in your ears for facility in the telling of our story we will call this especial editor mr brown mr browns first feeling on reading the letter was decidedly averse to the writer but such is always the feeling of editors to would be contributors though contributions are the very food on which an editor must live but mr brown was an unmarried man who loved the rustle of feminine apparel who delighted in the brightness of a womans eye when it would be bright for him and was not indifferent to the touch of a womans hand as editors go or went then he knew his business and was not wont to deluge his pages with weak feminine ware in return for smiles and flattering speeches as editors have done before now but still he liked an adventure and was perhaps afflicted by some slight flaw of judgment in consequence of which the words of pretty women found with him something of preponderating favour who is there that will think evil of him because it was so he read the letter a second time and did not send that curt heart rending answer which is so common to editors the editors compliments and thanks but his stock of novels is at present so great that he cannot hope to find room for the work which has been so kindly suggested of king charles street brown could not remember that he had ever heard and he looked it out at once in the directory there was a king charles street in camden town at no of which street it was stated that a mr puffle resided but this told him nothing josephine de montmorenci might reside with mrs puffle in camden town and yet write a good novel or be a very pretty girl and there was a something in the tone of the letter which made him think that the writer was no ordinary person she wrote with confidence she asked no favour and then she declared that messrs x y z with whom mr brown was intimate had read and approved her novel before he answered the note he would call in the row and ask a question or two he did call and saw mr z mr z remembered well that the ms had been in their house he rather thought that x who was out of town had seen miss montmorenci perhaps on more than one occasion the novel had been read and well mr z would not quite say approved but it had been thought that there was a good deal in it i think i remember x telling me that she was an uncommon pretty young woman said z and there is some mystery about her i didnt see her myself but i am sure there was a mystery mr brown made up his mind that he would at any rate see the ms he felt disposed to go at once to camden town but still had fears that in doing so he might seem to make himself too common there are so many things of which an editor is required to think it is almost essential that they who are ambitious of serving under him should believe that he is enveloped in mss from morning to night that he cannot call an hour his own that he is always bringing out that periodical of his in a frenzy of mental exertion that he is to be approached only with difficulty and that a call from him is a visit from a god mr brown was a jupiter willing enough on occasions to go a little out of his way after some literary leda or even on behalf of a danae desirous of a price for her compositions but he was obliged to acknowledge to himself that the occasion had not as yet arisen so he wrote to the young lady as follows office of the olympus magazine th may the editor presents his compliments to miss de montmorenci and will be very happy to see her ms perhaps she will send it to the above address the editor has seen mr z of paternoster row who speaks highly of the work a novel however may be very clever and yet hardly suit a magazine should it be accepted by the olympus some time must elapse before it appears the editor would be very happy to see miss de montmorenci if it would suit her to call any friday between the hours of two and three when the note was written mr brown felt that it was cold but then it behoves an editor to be cold a gushing editor would ruin any publication within six months young women are very nice pretty young women are especially nice and of all pretty young women clever young women who write novels are perhaps as nice as any but to an editor they are dangerous mr brown was at this time about forty and had had his experiences the letter was cold but he was afraid to make it warmer it was sent and when he received the following answer it may fairly be said that his editorial hair stood on end dear mr brown i hate you and your compliments that sort of communication means nothing and i wont send you my ms unless you are more in earnest about it i know the way in which rolls of paper are shoved into pigeon holes and left there till they are musty while the writers hearts are being broken my heart may be broken some day but not in that way i wont come to you between two and three on friday it sounds a great deal too like a doctors appointment and i dont think much of you if you are only at your work one hour in the week indeed i wont go to you at all if an interview is necessary you can come here but i dont know that it will be necessary old x is a fool and knows nothing about it my own approval is to me very much more than his i dont suppose hed know the inside of a book if he saw it i have given the very best that is in me to my work and i know that it is good even should you say that it is not i shall not believe you but i dont think you will say so because i believe you to be in truth a clever fellow in spite of your compliments and your two and three oclock on a friday if you want to see my ms say so with some earnestness and it shall be conveyed to you and please to say how much i shall be paid for it for i am as poor as job and name a date i wont be put off with your some time must elapse it shall see the light or at least a part of it within six months that is my intention and dont talk nonsense to me about clever novels not suiting magazines unless you mean that as an excuse for publishing so many stupid ones as you do you will see that i am frank but i really do mean what i say i want it to come out in the olympus and if we can i shall be so happy to come to terms with you yours as i find you josephine de montmorenci thursday king charles street this was an epistle to startle an editor as coming from a young lady but yet there was something in it that seemed to imply strength before answering it mr brown did a thing which he must be presumed to have done as man and not as editor he walked off to king charles street in camden town and looked at the house it was a nice little street very quiet quite genteel completely made up with what we vaguely call gentlemens houses with two windows to each drawing room and with a balcony to some of them the prettiest balcony in the street belonging to no near the park and equally removed from poverty and splendour brown walked down the street on the opposite side towards the park and looked up at the house he intended to walk at once homewards across the park to his own little home in st johns wood road but when he had passed half a street away from the puffle residence he turned to have another look and retraced his steps as he passed the door it was opened and there appeared upon the steps one of the prettiest little women he had ever seen in his life she was dressed for walking with that jaunty broad open bonnet which women then wore and seemed as some women do seem to be an amalgam of softness prettiness archness fun and tenderness and she carried a tiny blue parasol she was fair gray eyed dimpled all alive and dressed so nicely and yet simply that mr brown was carried away for the moment by a feeling that he would like to publish her novel let it be what it might and he heard her speak charles she said you shant smoke our editor could of course only pass on and had not an opportunity of even seeing charles at the corner of the street he turned round and saw them walking the other way josephine was leaning on charless arm she had however distinctly avowed herself to be a young lady in other words an unmarried woman there was no doubt a mystery and mr brown felt it to be incumbent on him to fathom it his next letter was as follows my dear miss de montmorenci i am sorry that you should hate me and my compliments i had intended to be as civil and as nice as possible i am quite in earnest and you had better send the ms as to all the questions you ask i cannot answer them to any purpose till i have read the story which i will promise to do without subjecting it to the pigeon holes if you do not like friday you shall come on monday or tuesday or wednesday or thursday or saturday or even on sunday if you wish it and at any hour only let it be fixed yours faithfully jonathan brown friday in the course of the next week the novel came with another short note to which was attached no ordinary beginning or ending i send my treasure and remember i will have it back in a week if you do not intend to keep it i have not left in the world and i owe my milliner ever so much and money at the stables where i get a horse and i am determined to go to dieppe in july all must come out of my novel so do be a good man if you are i will see you herein she declared plainly her own conviction that she had so far moved the editor by her correspondence for she knew nothing of course of that ramble of his through king charles street as to have raised in his bosom a desire to see her indeed she made no secret of such conviction do as i wish she said plainly and i will gratify you by a personal interview but the interview was not to be granted till the novel had been accepted and the terms fixed such terms too as it would be very improbable that any editor could accord not so black as hes painted that was the name of the novel which it now became the duty of mr brown to read when he got it home he found that the writing was much worse than that of the letters it was small and crowded and carried through without those technical demarcations which are so comfortable to printers and so essential to readers the erasures were numerous and bits of the story were written as it were here and there it was a manuscript to which mr brown would not have given a second glance had there not been an adventure behind it the very sending of such a manuscript to any editor would have been an impertinence if it were sent by any but a pretty woman mr brown however toiled over it and did read it read it or at least enough of it to make him know what it was the verdict which mr z had given was quite true no one could have called the story stupid no mentor experienced in such matters would have ventured on such evidence to tell the aspirant that she had mistaken her walk in life and had better sit at home and darn her stockings out of those heaps of ambitious manuscripts which are daily subjected to professional readers such verdicts may safely be given in regard to four fifths either that the aspirant should darn her stockings or that he should prune his fruit trees it is equally so with the works of one sex as with those of the other the necessity of saying so is very painful and the actual stocking or the fruit tree itself is not often named the cowardly professional reader indeed unable to endure those thorns in the flesh of which poor thackeray spoke so feelingly when hard pressed for definite answers generally lies he has been asked to be candid but he cannot bring himself to undertake a duty so onerous so odious and one as to which he sees so little reason that he personally should perform it but in regard to these aspirations to which have been given so much labour which have produced so many hopes offsprings which are so dear to the poor parents the decision at least is easy and there are others in regard to which a hopeful reader finds no difficulty as to which he feels assured that he is about to produce to the world the fruit of some new found genius but there are doubtful cases which worry the poor judge till he knows not how to trust his own judgment at this page he says yes certainly at the next he shakes his head as he sits alone amidst his papers then he is dead against the aspirant again there is improvement and he asks himself where is he to find anything that is better as our editor read josephines novel he had learned to call her josephine in that silent speech in which most of us indulge and which is so necessary to an editor he was divided between yes and no throughout the whole story once or twice he found himself wiping his eyes and then it was all yes with him then he found the pages ran with a cruel heaviness which seemed to demand decisive editorial severity a whole novel too is so great a piece of business there would be such difficulty were he to accept it how much must he cut out how many of his own hours must he devote to the repairing of mutilated sentences and the remodelling of indistinct scenes in regard to a small piece an editor when moved that way can afford to be good natured he can give to it the hour or so of his own work which it may require and if after all it be nothing or as will happen sometimes much worse than nothing the evil is of short duration in admitting such a thing he has done an injury but the injury is small it passes in the crowd and is forgotten the best homer that ever edited must sometimes nod but a whole novel a piece of work that would last him perhaps for twelve months no editor can afford to nod for so long a period but then this tale this novel of not so black as hes painted this story of a human devil for whose crimes no doubt some byronic apology was made with great elaboration by the sensational josephine was not exactly bad our editor had wept over it some tender hearted medora who on behalf of her hyena in love had gone through miseries enough to kill half a regiment of heroines had dimmed the judges eyes with tears what stronger proof of excellence can an editor have but then there were those long pages of metaphysical twaddle sure to elicit scorn and neglect from old and young they at any rate must be cut out but in the cutting of them out a very mincemeat would be made of the story and yet josephine de montmorenci with her impudent little letters had already made herself so attractive what was our editor to do he knew well the difficulty that would be before him should he once dare to accept and then undertake to alter she would be as a tigress to him as a tigress fighting for her young that work of altering is so ungracious so precarious so incapable of success in its performance the long winded far fetched high stilted unintelligible sentence which you elide with so much confidence in your judgment has been the very apple of your authors eye in it she has intended to convey to the world the fruits of her best meditation for the last twelve months thinking much over many things in her solitude she has at last invented a truth and there it lies that wise men may adopt it and candid women admire it is the hope the solace and at last almost the certainty of her existence she repeats the words to herself and finds that they will form a choice quotation to be used in coming books it is for the sake of that one newly invented truth so she tells herself though not quite truly that she desires publication you come and with a dash of your pen you annihilate the precious gem is it in human nature that you should be forgiven mr brown had had his experiences and understood all this well nevertheless he loved dearly to please a pretty woman and it must be acknowledged that the letters of josephine were such as to make him sure that there might be an adventure if he chose to risk the pages of his magazine the novel had taken him four long evenings to read and at the end of the fourth he sat thinking of it for an hour fortune either favoured him or the reverse as the reader may choose to regard the question in this that there was room for the story in his periodical if he chose to take it he wanted a novel but then he did not want feminine metaphysics he sat thinking of it wondering in his mind how that little smiling soft creature with the gray eyes and the dimples and the pretty walking dress could have written those interminable pages as to the questionable criminality of crime whether a card sharper might not be a hero whether a murderer might not sacrifice his all even the secret of his murder for the woman he loved whether devil might not be saint and saint devil at the end of the hour he got up from his chair stretched himself with his hands in his trousers pockets and said aloud though alone that hed be d if he would it was an act of great self denial a triumph of principle over passion but though he had thus decided he was not minded to throw over altogether either josephine or her novel he might still perhaps do something for her if he could find her amenable to reason thinking kindly of her very anxious to know her personally and still desirous of seeing the adventure to the end he wrote the following note to her that evening cross bank st johns wood saturday night my dear miss de montmorenci i knew how it would be i cannot give you an answer about your novel without seeing you it so often happens that the answer cant be yes or no you said something very cruel about dear old x but after all he was quite right in his verdict about the book there is a great deal in it but it evidently was not written to suit the pages of a magazine will you come to me or shall i come to you or shall i send the ms back and so let there be an end of it you must decide if you direct that the latter course be taken i will obey but i shall do so with most sincere regret both on account of your undoubted aptitude for literary work and because i am very anxious to become acquainted with my fair correspondent you see i can be as frank as you are yourself yours most faithfully jonathan brown my advice to you would be to give up the idea of publishing this tale in parts and to make terms with x y and z in endeavouring to do which i shall be most happy to be of service to you this note he posted on the following day and when he returned home on the next night from his club he found three replies from the divine but irritable and energetic josephine we will give them according to their chronology no monday morning let me have my ms back and pray without any delay j de m no monday oclock how can you have been so ill natured and after keeping it twelve days his answer had been written within a week of the receipt of the parcel at his office and he had acted with a rapidity which nothing but some tender passion would have instigated what you say about being clever and yet not fit for a magazine is rubbish i know it is rubbish i do not wish to see you why should i see a man who will do nothing to oblige me if x y z choose to buy it at once they shall have it but i mean to be paid for it and i think you have behaved very ill to me josephine no monday evening my dear mr brown can you wonder that i should have lost my temper and almost my head i have written twice before to day and hardly know what i said i cannot understand you editing people you are just like women you will and you wont i am so unhappy i had allowed myself to feel almost certain that you would take it and have told that cross man at the stables he should have his money of course i cant make you publish it but how you can put in such yards of stupid stuff all about nothing on earth and then send back a novel which you say yourself is very clever is what i cant understand i suppose it all goes by favour and the people who write are your uncles and aunts and grandmothers and lady loves i cant make you do it and therefore i suppose i must take your advice about those old hugger muggers in paternoster row but there are ever so many things you must arrange i must have the money at once and i wont put up with just a few pounds i have been at work upon that novel for more than two years and i know that it is good i hate to be grumbled at and complained of and spoken to as if a publisher were doing me the greatest favour in the world when he is just going to pick my brains to make money of them i did see old x or old z or old y and the snuffy old fellow told me that if i worked hard i might do something some day i have worked harder than ever he did sitting there and squeezing brains and sucking the juice out of them like an old ghoul i suppose i had better see you because of money and all that ill come or else send some one at about two on wednesday i cant put it off till friday and i must be home by three you might as well go to x y z in the meantime and let me know what they say j de m there was an unparalleled impudence in all this which affronted amazed and yet in part delighted our editor josephine evidently regarded him as her humble slave who had already received such favours as entitled her to demand from him any service which she might require of him you might as well go to x y z and let me know what they say and then that direct accusation against him that all went by favour with him i think you have behaved very ill to me why had he not gone out of his way very much out of his way indeed to do her a service was he not taking on her behalf an immense trouble for which he looked for no remuneration unless remuneration should come in that adventure of which she had but a dim foreboding all this was unparalleled impudence but then impudence from pretty women is only sauciness and such sauciness is attractive none but a very pretty woman who openly trusted in her prettiness would dare to write such letters and the girl whom he had seen on the door step was very pretty as to his going to x y z before he had seen her that was out of the question that very respectable firm in the row would certainly not give money for a novel without considerable caution without much talking and a regular understanding and bargain as a matter of course they would take time to consider x y and z were not in a hurry to make money to pay a milliner or to satisfy a stable keeper and would have but little sympathy for such troubles all which it would be mr browns unpleasant duty to explain to josephine de montmorenci but though this would be unpleasant still there might be pleasure he could foresee that there would be a storm with much pouting some violent complaint and perhaps a deluge of tears but it would be for him to dry the tears and allay the storm the young lady could do him no harm and must at last be driven to admit that his kindness was disinterested he waited therefore for the wednesday and was careful to be at the office of his magazine at two oclock in the ordinary way of his business the office would not have seen him on that day but the matter had now been present in his mind so long and had been so much considered had assumed so large a proportion in his thoughts that he regarded not at all this extra trouble with an air of indifference he told the lad who waited upon him as half clerk and half errand boy that he expected a lady and then he sat down as though to compose himself to his work but no work was done letters were not even opened his mind was full of josephine de montmorenci if all the truth is to be told it must be acknowledged that he did not even wear the clothes that were common to him when he sat in his editorial chair he had prepared himself somewhat and a new pair of gloves was in his hat it might be that circumstances would require him to accompany josephine at least a part of the way back to camden town at half past two the lady was announced miss de montmorenci and our editor with palpitating heart rose to welcome the very figure the very same pretty walking dress the same little blue parasol which he had seen upon the steps of the house in king charles street he could swear to the figure and to the very step although he could not as yet see the veiled face and this was a joy to him for though he had not allowed himself to doubt much he had doubted a little whether that graceful houri might or might not be his josephine now she was there present to him in his own castle at his mercy as it were so that he might dry her tears and bid her hope or tell her that there was no hope so that she might still weep on just as he pleased it was not one of those cases in which want of bread and utter poverty are to be discussed a horsekeepers bill and a visit to dieppe were the melodramatic incidents of the tragedy if tragedy it must be mr brown had in his time dealt with cases in which a starving mother or a dying father was the motive to which appeal was made at worst there could be no more than a rose water catastrophe and it might be that triumph and gratitude and smiles would come he rose from his chair and giving his hand gracefully to his visitor led her to a seat i am very glad to see you here miss de montmorenci he said then the veil was raised and there was the pretty face half blushing half smiling wearing over all a mingled look of fun and fear we are so much obliged to you mr brown for all the trouble you have taken she said dont mention it it comes in the way of my business to take such trouble the annoyance is in this that i can so seldom do what is wanted it is so good of you to do anything an editor is of course bound to think first of the periodical which he produces this announcement mr brown made no doubt with some little air of assumed personal dignity the fact was one which no heaven born editor ever forgets of course sir and no doubt there are hundreds who want to get their things taken a good many there are certainly and everything cant be published said the sagacious beauty no indeed very much comes into our hands which cannot be published replied the experienced editor but this novel of yours perhaps may be published you think so indeed i do i cannot say what x y and z may say to it im afraid they will not do more than offer half profits and that doesnt mean any money paid at once asked the lady plaintively im afraid not ah if that could be managed i havent seen the publishers and of course i can say nothing myself you see im so busy myself with my uncles and aunts and grandmothers and lady loves ah that was very naughty mr brown and then you know i have so many yards of stupid stuff to arrange oh mr brown you should forget all that so i will i could not resist the temptation of telling you of it again because you are so much mistaken in your accusation and now about your novel it isnt mine you know not yours not my own mr brown then whose is it mr brown as he asked this question felt that he had a right to be offended are you not josephine de montmorenci me an author oh no mr brown said the pretty little woman and our editor almost thought that he could see a smile on her lips as she spoke then who are you asked mr brown i am her sister or rather her sister in law my name is mrs puffle how could mrs puffle be the sister in law of miss de montmorenci some such thought as this passed through the editors mind but it was not followed out to any conclusion relationships are complex things and as we all know give rise to most intricate questions in the half moment that was allowed to him mr brown reflected that mrs puffle might be the sister in law of a miss de montmorenci or at least half sister in law it was even possible that mrs puffle young as she looked might have been previously married to a de montmorenci of all that however he would not now stop to unravel the details but endeavoured as he went on to take some comfort from the fact that puffle was no doubt charles josephine might perhaps have no charles and then it became evident to him that the little fair smiling dimpled thing before him could hardly have written not so black as hes painted with all its metaphysics josephine must be made of sterner stuff and after all for an adventure little dimples and a blue parasol are hardly appropriate there should be more of stature than mrs puffle possessed with dark hair and piercing eyes the colour of the dress should be black with perhaps yellow trimmings and the hand should not be of pearly whiteness as mrs puffles no doubt was though the well fitting little glove gave no absolute information on this subject for such an adventure the appropriate colour of the skin would be we will not say sallow exactly but running a little that way the beauty should be just toned by sadness and the blood as it comes and goes should show itself not in blushes but in the mellow changing lines of the brunette all this mr brown understood very well oh you are mrs puffle said brown after a short but perhaps insufficient pause you are charles puffles wife do you know charles asked the lady putting up both her little hands we dont want him to hear anything about this you havent told him ive told him nothing as yet said mr brown pray dont its a secret of course hell know it some day oh mr brown you wont betray us how very odd that you should know charles does he smoke as much as ever mrs puffle how very odd that he never should have mentioned it is it at his office that you see him well no not at his office how is it that he manages to get away on an afternoon as he does its very seldom only two or three times in a month when he really has a headache from sitting at his work dear me how odd i thought he told me everything and he never mentioned your name you neednt mention mine mrs puffle and the secret shall be kept but you havent told me about the smoking is he as inveterate as ever of course he smokes they all smoke i suppose then he used always to be doing it before he married i dont think men ever tell the real truth about things though girls always tell everything and now about your sisters novel asked mr brown who felt that he had mystified the little woman sufficiently about her husband well yes she does want to get some money so badly and it is clever isnt it i dont think i ever read anything cleverer isnt it enough to take your breath away when orlando defends himself before the lords this referred to a very high flown passage which mr brown had determined to cut out when he was thinking of printing the story for the pages of the olympus and she will be so broken hearted i hope you are not angry with her because she wrote in that way not in the least i liked her letters she wrote what she really thought that is so good of you i told her that i was sure you were good natured because you answered so civilly it was a kind of experiment of hers you know oh an experiment it is so hard to get at people isnt it if shed just written dear sir i send you a manuscript you never would have looked at it would you we read everything mrs puffle but the turn for all the things comes so slowly doesnt it so polly thought polly what did polly think i mean josephine we call her polly just as a nickname she was so anxious to get you to read it at once and now what must we do mr brown sat silent awhile thinking why did they call josephine de montmorenci polly but there was the fact of the ms let the name of the author be what it might on one thing he was determined he would take no steps till he had himself seen the lady who wrote the novel youll go to the gentlemen in paternoster row immediately wont you asked mrs puffle with a pretty little beseeching look which it was very hard to resist i think i must ask to see the authoress first said mr brown wont i do asked mrs puffle josephine is so particular i mean she dislikes so very much to talk about her own writings and her own works mr brown thought of the tenor of the letters which he had received and found that he could not reconcile with it this character which was given to him of miss de montmorenci she has an idea continued mrs puffle that genius should not show itself publicly of course she does not say that herself and she does not think herself to be a genius though i think it and she is a genius there are things in not so black as hes painted which nobody but polly could have written nevertheless mr brown was firm he explained that he could not possibly treat with messrs x y and z if any treating should become possible without direct authority from the principal he must have from miss de montmorencis mouth what might be the arrangements to which she would accede if this could not be done he must wash his hands of the affair he did not doubt he said but that miss de montmorenci might do quite as well with the publishers by herself as she could with any aid from him perhaps it would be better that she should see mr x herself but if he brown was to be honoured by any delegated authority he must see the author in saying this he implied that he had not the slightest desire to interfere further and that he had no wish to press himself on the lady mrs puffle with just a tear and then a smile and then a little coaxing twist of her lips assured him that their only hope was in him she would carry his message to josephine and he should have a further letter from that lady and you wont tell charles that i have been here said mrs puffle as she took her leave certainly not i wont say a word of it it is so odd that you should have known him dont let him smoke too much mrs puffle i dont intend ive brought him down to one cigar and a pipe a day unless he smokes at the office they all do that nearly the whole day what at the post office thats why i mention it i dont think theyre allowed at any of the other offices but they do what they please there i shall keep the ms till i hear from josephine herself then mrs puffle took her leave with many thanks and a grateful pressure from her pretty little hand two days after this there came the promised letter from josephine dear mr brown i cannot understand why you should not go to x y and z without seeing me i hardly ever see anybody but of course you must come if you will i got my sister to go because she is so gentle and nice that i thought she could persuade anybody to do anything she says that you know mr puffle quite well which seems to be so very odd he doesnt know that i ever write a word and i didnt think he had an acquaintance in the world whom i dont know the name of youre quite wrong about one thing they never smoke at the post office and they wouldnt be let to do it if you choose to come you must i shall be at home any time on friday morning that is after half past nine when charles goes away yours truly j de m we began to talk about editors after dinner just for fun and charles said that he didnt know that he had ever seen one of course we didnt say anything about the olympus but i dont know why he should be so mysterious then there was a second postscript written down in a corner of the sheet of paper i know youll be sorry you came our editor was now quite determined that he would see the adventure to an end he had at first thought that josephine was keeping herself in the background merely that she might enhance the favour of a personal meeting when that favour should be accorded a pretty woman believing herself to be a genius and thinking that good things should ever be made scarce might not improbably fall into such a foible but now he was convinced that she would prefer to keep herself unseen if her doing so might be made compatible with her great object mr brown was not a man to intrude himself unnecessarily upon any woman unwilling to receive him but in this case it was so he thought his duty to persevere so he wrote a pretty little note to miss josephine saying that he would be with her at eleven oclock on the day named precisely at eleven oclock he knocked at the door of the house in king charles street which was almost instantaneously opened for him by the fair hands of mrs puffle herself h sh said mrs puffle we dont want the servants to know anything about it mr brown who cared nothing for the servants of the puffle establishment and who was becoming perhaps a little weary of the unravelled mystery of the affair simply bowed and followed the lady into the parlour my sister is up stairs said mrs puffle and we will go to her immediately then she paused as though she were still struggling with some difficulty i am so sorry to say that polly is not well but she means to see you mrs puffle added as she saw that the editor over whom they had so far prevailed made some sign as though he was about to retreat she never is very well said mrs puffle and her work does tell upon her so much do you know mr brown i think the mind sometimes eats up the body that is when it is called upon for such great efforts they were now upon the stairs and mr brown followed the little lady into her drawing room there almost hidden in the depths of a low arm chair sat a little wizened woman not old indeed when mr brown came to know her better he found that she had as yet only counted five and twenty summers but with that look of mingled youth and age which is so painful to the beholder who has not seen it the face in which the eye and the brow are young and bright but the mouth and the chin are old and haggard see such a one when she sleeps when the brightness of the eye is hidden and all the countenance is full of pain and decay and then the difference will be known to you between youth with that health which is generally given to it and youth accompanied by premature decrepitude this is my sister in law said mrs puffle introducing the two correspondents to each other the editor looked at the little woman who made some half attempt to rise and thought that he could see in the brightness of the eye some symptoms of the sauciness which had appeared so very plainly in her letters and there was a smile too about the mouth though the lips were thin and the chin poor which seemed to indicate that the owner of them did in some sort enjoy this unravelling of her riddle as though she were saying to herself what do you think now of the beautiful young woman who has made you write so many letters and read so long a manuscript and come all the way at this hour of the morning to camden town mr brown shook hands with her and muttered something to the effect that he was sorry not to see her in better health no said josephine de montmorenci i am not very well i never am i told you that you had better put up with seeing my sister we say no more than the truth of mr brown in declaring that he was now more ready than ever to do whatever might be in his power to forward the views of this young authoress if he was interested before when he believed her to be beautiful he was doubly interested for her now when he knew her to be a cripple for he had seen when she made that faint attempt to rise that her spine was twisted and that when she stood up her head sank between her shoulders i am very glad to make your acquaintance he said seating himself near her i should never have been satisfied without doing so it is so very good of you to come said mrs puffle of course it is good of him said josephine especially after the way we wrote to him the truth is mr brown we were at our wits end to catch you this was an aspect of the affair which our editor certainly did not like an attempt to deceive anybody else might have been pardonable but deceit practised against himself was odious to him nevertheless he did forgive it the poor little creature before him had worked hard and had done her best to teach her to be less metaphysical in her writings and more straightforward in her own practices should be his care there is something to a man inexpressibly sweet in the power of protecting the weak and no one had ever seemed to be weaker than josephine miss de montmorenci he said we will let bygones be bygones and will say nothing about the letters it is no doubt the fact that you did write the novel yourself every word of it said mrs puffle energetically oh yes i wrote it said josephine and you wish to have it published indeed i do and you wish to get money for it that is the truest of all said josephine oughtnt one to be paid when one has worked so very hard said mrs puffle certainly one ought to be paid if it can be proved that ones work is worth buying replied the sage mentor of literature but isnt it worth buying demanded mrs puffle i must say that i think that publishers do buy some that are worse observed josephine mr brown with words of wisdom explained to them as well as he was able the real facts of the case it might be that that manuscript over which the poor invalid had laboured for so many painful hours would prove to be an invaluable treasure of art destined to give delight to thousands of readers and to be when printed a source of large profits to publishers booksellers and author or again it might be that with all its undoubted merits and that there were such merits mr brown was eager in acknowledging the novel would fail to make any way with the public a publisher so said mr brown will hardly venture to pay you a sum of money down when the risk of failure is so great but polly has written ever so many things before said mrs puffle that counts for nothing said miss de montmorenci they were short pieces and appeared without a name were you paid for them asked mr brown i have never been paid a halfpenny for anything yet isnt that cruel said mrs puffle to work and work and work and never get the wages which ought to be paid for it perhaps there may be a good time coming said our editor let us see whether we can get messrs x y and z to publish this at their own expense and with your name attached to it then miss de montmorenci i suppose we had better tell him all said josephine oh yes tell everything i am sure he wont be angry he is so good natured said mrs puffle mr brown looked first at one and then at the other feeling himself to be rather uncomfortable what was there that remained to be told he was good natured but he did not like being told of that virtue the name you have heard is not my name said the lady who had written the novel oh indeed i have heard mrs puffle call you polly my name is maryanne it is a very good name said mr brown so good that i cannot quite understand why you should go out of your way to assume another it is maryanne puffle oh puffle said mr brown and a very good name too said mrs puffle i havent a word to say against it said mr brown i wish i could say quite as much as to that other name josephine de montmorenci but maryanne puffle would be quite unendurable on a title page said the owner of the unfortunate appellation i dont see it said mr brown doggedly ever so many have done the same said mrs puffle theres boz calling yourself boz isnt like calling yourself josephine de montmorenci said the editor who could forgive the loss of beauty but not the assumed grandeur of the name and currer bell and jacob omnium and barry cornwall said poor polly puffle pleading hard for her falsehood and michael angelo titmarsh that was quite the same sort of thing said mrs puffle our editor tried to explain to them that the sin of which he now complained did not consist in the intention foolish as that had been of putting such a name as josephine de montmorenci on the title page but in having corresponded with him with him who had been so willing to be a friend under a false name i really think you ought to have told me sooner he said if we had known you had been a friend of charless we would have told you at once said the young wife i never had the pleasure of speaking to mr puffle in my life said mr brown mrs puffle opened her little mouth and held up both her little hands polly puffle stared at her sister in law and what is more continued mr brown i never said that i had had that pleasure you didnt tell me that charles smoked at the post office exclaimed mrs puffle which he swears that he never does and that he would be dismissed at once if he attempted it mr brown was driven to a smile i declare i dont understand you mr brown it was his little roland for our little oliver said miss puffle mr brown felt that his roland had been very small whereas the oliver by which he had been taken in was not small at all but he was forced to accept the bargain what is a man against a woman in such a matter what can he be against two women both young of whom one was pretty and the other an invalid of course he gave way and of course he undertook the mission to x y and z we have not ourselves read not so black as hes painted but we can say that it came out in due course under the hands of those enterprising publishers and that it made what many of the reviews called quite a success illustration the panjandrum illustration the panjandrum part i hope we hardly feel certain that we are justified in giving the following little story to the public as an editors tale because at the time to which it refers and during the circumstances with which it deals no editorial power was in fact within our grasp as the reader will perceive the ambition and the hopes and something of a promise of the privileges were there but the absolute chair was not mounted for us the great we was not in truth ours to use and indeed the interval between the thing we then so cordially desired and the thing as it has since come to exist was one of so many years that there can be no right on our part to connect the two periods we shall therefore tell our story as might any ordinary individual in the first person singular and speak of such sparks of editorship as did fly up around us as having created but a dim coruscation and as having been quite insufficient to justify the delicious plural it is now just thirty years ago since we determined to establish the panjandrum magazine the we here spoken of is not an editorial we but a small set of human beings who shall be personally introduced to the reader the name was intended to be delightfully meaningless but we all thought that it was euphonious graphic also and sententious even though it conveyed no definite idea that question of a name had occupied us a good deal and had almost split us into parties i for i will now speak of myself as i i had wished to call it by the name of a very respectable young publisher who was then commencing business and by whom we intended that the trade part of our enterprise should be undertaken colburns was an old affair in those days and i doubt whether bentleys was not already in existence blackwoods and frasers were at the top of the tree and as i think the metropolitan was the only magazine then in much vogue not called by the name of this or that enterprising publisher but some of our colleagues would not hear of this and were ambitious of a title that should describe our future energies and excellences i think we should have been called the pandrastic but that the one lady who joined our party absolutely declined the name at one moment we had almost carried panurge the mans magazine was thought of not as opposed to womanhood but as intended to trump the gentlemans but a hint was given to us that we might seem to imply that our periodical was not adapted for the perusal of females we meant the word man in the great generic sense but the somewhat obtuse outside world would not have so taken it the h b p was for a time in the ascendant and was favoured by the lady who drew for us a most delightful little circle containing the letters illustrated what would now be called a monogram only that the letters were legible the fact that nobody would comprehend that h b p intended to express the general opinion of the shareholders that honesty is the best policy was felt to be a recommendation rather than otherwise i think it was the enterprising young publisher who objected to the initials not i am sure from any aversion to the spirit of the legend many other names were tried and i shall never forget the look which went round our circle when one young and gallant but too indiscreet reformer suggested that were it not for offence whence offence should not come the purge was the very name for us from all which it will be understood that it was our purpose to put right many things that were wrong the matter held us in discussion for some months and then we agreed to call the great future lever of the age the panjandrum when a new magazine is about to be established in these days the first question raised will probably be one of capital a very considerable sum of money running far into four figures if not going beyond it has to be mentioned and made familiar to the ambitious promoters of the enterprise it was not so with us nor was it the case that our young friend the publisher agreed to find the money leaving it to us to find the wit i think we selected our young friend chiefly because at that time he had no great business to speak of and could devote his time to the interests of the panjandrum as for ourselves we were all poor and in the way of capital a set of human beings more absurdly inefficient for any purposes of trade could not have been brought together we found that for a sum of money which we hoped that we might scrape together among us we could procure paper and print for a couple of thousand copies of our first number and after that we were to obtain credit for the second number by the reputation of the first literary advertising such as is now common to us was then unknown the cost of sticking up the panjandrum at railway stations and on the tops of the omnibuses certainly would not be incurred of railway stations there were but few in the country and even omnibuses were in their infancy a few modest announcements in the weekly periodicals of the day were thought to be sufficient and indeed there pervaded us all an assurance that the coming of the panjandrum would be known to all men even before it had come i doubt whether our desire was not concealment rather than publicity we measured the importance of the panjandrum by its significance to ourselves and by the amount of heart which we intended to throw into it ladies and gentlemen who get up magazines in the present day are wiser it is not heart that is wanted but very big letters on very big boards and plenty of them we were all heart it must be admitted now that we did not bestow upon the matter of literary excellence quite so much attention as that branch of the subject deserves we were to write and edit our magazine and have it published not because we were good at writing or editing but because we had ideas which we wished to promulgate or it might be the case with some of us that we only thought that we had ideas but there was certainly present to us all a great wish to do some good that and a not altogether unwholesome appetite for a reputation which should not be personal were our great motives i do not think that we dreamed of making fortunes though no doubt there might be present to the mind of each of us an idea that an opening to the profession of literature might be obtained through the pages of the panjandrum in that matter of reputation we were quite agreed that fame was to be sought not for ourselves nor for this or that name but for the panjandrum no man or woman was to declare himself to be the author of this or that article nor indeed was any man or woman to declare himself to be connected with a magazine the only name to be known to a curious public was that of the young publisher all intercourse between the writers and the printers was to be through him if contributions should come from the outside world as come they would they were to be addressed to the editor of the panjandrum at the publishers establishment it was within the scope of our plan to use any such contribution that might please us altogether but the contents of the magazine were as a rule to come from ourselves a magazine then as now was expected to extend itself through something over a hundred and twenty pages but we had no fear as to our capacity for producing the required amount we feared rather that we might jostle each other in our requirements for space we were six and young as i was then i was to be the editor but to the functions of the editor was to be attached very little editorial responsibility what should and what should not appear in each monthly number was to be settled in conclave upon one point however we were fully agreed that no personal jealousy should ever arise among us so as to cause quarrel or even embarrassment as i had already written some few slight papers for the press it was considered probable that i might be able to correct proofs and do the fitting and dovetailing my editing was not to go beyond that if by reason of parity of numbers in voting there should arise a difficulty the lady was to have a double vote anything more noble more chivalrous more trusting or i may add more philanthropic than our scheme never was invented and for the persons i will say that they were noble chivalrous trusting and philanthropic only they were so young place aux dames we will speak of the lady first more especially as our meetings were held at her house i fear that i may at the very outset of our enterprise turn the hearts of my readers against her by saying that mrs st quinten was separated from her husband i must however beg them to believe that this separation had been occasioned by no moral fault or odious misconduct on her part i will confess that i did at that time believe that mr st quinten was an ogre and that i have since learned to think that he simply laboured under a strong and perhaps monomaniacal objection to literary pursuits as mrs st quinten was devoted to them harmony was impossible and the marriage was unfortunate she was young being perhaps about thirty but i think that she was the eldest amongst us she was good looking with an ample brow and bright eyes and large clever mouth but no woman living was ever further removed from any propensity to flirtation there resided with her a certain miss collins an elderly silent lady who was present at all our meetings and who was considered to be pledged to secrecy once a week we met and drank tea at mrs st quintens house it may be as well to explain that mrs st quinten really had an available income which was a condition of life unlike that of her colleagues unless as regarded one who was a fellow of an oxford college she could certainly afford to give us tea and muffins once a week but in spite of our general impecuniosity the expense of commencing the magazine was to be borne equally by us all i can assure the reader with reference to more than one of the members that they occasionally dined on bread and cheese abstaining from meat and pudding with the view of collecting the sum necessary for the great day the idea had originated i think between mrs st quinten and churchill smith churchill smith was a man with whom i must own i never felt that perfect sympathy which bound me to the others perhaps among us all he was the most gifted such at least was the opinion of mrs st quinten and perhaps of himself he was a cousin of the ladys and had made himself particularly objectionable to the husband by instigating his relative to write philosophical essays it was his own speciality to be an unbeliever and a german scholar and we gave him credit for being so deep in both arts that no man could go deeper it had however been decided among us very early in our arrangements and so decided not without great chance of absolute disruption that his infidelity was not to bias the magazine he was to take the line of deep thinking german poetry and unintelligible speculation generally he used to talk of comte whose name i had never heard till it fell from his lips and was prepared to prove that coleridge was very shallow he was generally dirty unshorn and as i thought disagreeable he called mrs st quinten lydia because of his cousinship and no one knew how or where he lived i believe him to have been a most unselfish abstemious man one able to control all appetites of the flesh i think that i have since heard that he perished in a russian prison my dearest friend among the number was patrick regan a young irish barrister who intended to shine at the english bar i think the world would have used him better had his name been john tomkins the history of his career shows very plainly that the undoubted brilliance of his intellect and his irrepressible personal humour and good humour have been always unfairly weighted by those irish names what attorney with any serious matter in hand would willingly go to a barrister who called himself pat regan and then too there always remained with him just a hint of a brogue and his nose was flat in the middle i do not believe that all the irishmen with flattened noses have had the bone of the feature broken by a crushing blow in a street row and yet they certainly look as though that peculiar appearance had been the result of a fight with sticks pat has told me a score of times that he was born so and i believe him he had a most happy knack of writing verses which i used to think quite equal to mr barhams and he could rival the droll latinity of father prout who was coming out at that time with his dulcis julia callage and the like pats father was an attorney at cork but not prospering i think for poor pat was always short of money he had however paid the fees and was entitled to appear in wig and gown wherever common law barristers do congregate he is attorney general at one of the turtle islands this moment with a salary of a year i hear from him occasionally and the other day he sent me captain crosbie is my name done into endecasyllabics i doubt however whether he ever made a penny by writing for the press i cannot say that pat was our strongest prop he sometimes laughed at lydia and then i was brought into disgrace as having introduced him to the company jack hallam the next i will name was also intended for the bar but i think never was called of all the men i have encountered in life he was certainly the most impecunious now he is a millionaire he was one as to whom all who knew him friends and foes alike were decided that under no circumstances would he ever work or by any possibility earn a penny since then he has applied himself to various branches of commerce first at new york and then at san francisco he has laboured for twenty four years almost without a holiday and has shown a capability for sustaining toil which few men have equalled he had been introduced to our set by walter watt of whom i will speak just now and certainly when i remember the brightness of his wit and the flow of his words and his energy when he was earnest i am bound to acknowledge that in searching for sheer intellect for what i may call power we did not do wrong to enrol jack hallam he had various crude ideas in his head of what he would do for us having a leaning always to the side of bitter mirth i think he fancied that satire might be his forte as it is they say that no man living has a quicker eye to the erection of a block of buildings in a coming city he made a fortune at chicago and is said to have erected omaha out of his own pocket i am told that he pays income tax in the united states on nearly a million dollars per annum i wonder whether he would lend me five pounds if i asked him i never knew a man so free as jack at borrowing half a crown or a clean pocket handkerchief walter watt was a fellow of i believe has fellows who do not take orders it must have had one such in those days for nothing could have induced our friend walter watt to go into the church how it came to pass that the dons of a college at oxford should have made a fellow of so wild a creature was always a mystery to us i have since been told that at the reward could hardly be refused to a man who had gone out a first in classics and had got the newdegate such had been the career of young watt and though i say that he was wild his moral conduct was not bad he simply objected on principle to all authority and was of opinion that the goods of the world should be in common i must say of him that in regard to one individual his practice went even beyond his preaching for jack hallam certainly consumed more of the fellowship than did walter watt himself jack was dark and swarthy walter was a fair little man with long hair falling on the sides of his face and cut away over his forehead as one sees it sometimes cut in a picture he had round blue eyes a well formed nose and handsome mouth and chin he was very far gone in his ideas of reform and was quite in earnest in his hope that by means of the panjandrum something might be done to stay the general wickedness or rather ugliness of the world at that time carlyle was becoming prominent as a thinker and writer among us and watt was never tired of talking to us of the hero of sartor resartus he was an excellent and most unselfish man whose chief fault was an inclination for the making of speeches which he had picked up at an oxford debating society he now lies buried at kensal green i thought to myself when i saw another literary friend laid there some eight years since that the place had become very quickly populated since i and regan had seen poor watt placed in his last home almost amidst a desert of myself i need only say that at that time i was very young very green and very ardent as a politician the whigs were still in office but we who were young then and warm in our political convictions thought that the whigs were doing nothing for us it must be remembered that things and ideas have advanced so quickly during the last thirty years that the conservatism of goes infinitely further in the cause of general reform than did the radicalism of i was regarded as a democrat because i was loud against the corn laws and was accused of infidelity when i spoke against the irish church endowments i take some pride to myself that i should have seen these evils to be evils even thirty years ago but to household suffrage i doubt whether even my spirit had ascended if i remember rightly i was great upon annual parliaments but i know that i was discriminative and did not accept all the points of the seven starred charter i had an idea in those days i can confess it now after thirty years that i might be able to indite short political essays which should be terse argumentative and convincing and at the same time full of wit and frolic i never quite succeeded in pleasing even myself in any such composition at this time i did a little humble work for the but was quite resolved to fly at higher game than that as i began with the lady so i must end with her i had seen and read sheaves of her ms and must express my conviction at this day when all illusions are gone that she wrote with wonderful ease and with some grace a hard critic might perhaps say that it was slip slop but still it was generally readable i believe that in the recesses of her privacy and under the dark and secret guidance of churchill smith she did give way to german poetry and abstruse thought i heard once that there was a paper of hers on the essence of existence in which she answered that great question as to personal entity or as she put it what is it to be the paper never appeared before the committee though i remember the question to have been once suggested for discussion pat regan answered it at once a drop of something short said he i thought then that everything was at an end her translation into a rhymed verse of a play of schillers did come before us and nobody could have behaved better than she did when she was told that it hardly suited our project what we expected from mrs st quinten in the way of literary performance i cannot say that we ourselves had exactly realised but we knew that she was always ready for work she gave us tea and muffins and bore with us when we were loud and devoted her time to our purposes and believed in us she had exquisite tact in saving us from wordy quarrelling and was never angry herself except when pat regan was too hard upon her what became of her i never knew when the days of the panjandrum were at an end she vanished from our sight i always hoped that mr st quinten reconciled himself to literature and took her back to his bosom while we were only determining that the thing should be all went smoothly with us columns or the open page made a little difficulty but the lady settled it for us in favour of the double column it is a style of page which certainly has a wiser look about it than the other and then it has the advantage of being clearly distinguished from the ordinary empty book of the day the word padding as belonging to literature was then unknown but the idea existed and perhaps the thing we were quite resolved that there should be no padding in the panjandrum i think our most ecstatic enthusiastic and accordant moments were those in which we resolved that it should be all good all better than anything else all best we were to struggle after excellence with an energy that should know no relaxing and the excellence was not to be that which might produce for us the greatest number of half crowns but of the sort which would increase truth in the world and would teach men to labour hard and bear their burdens nobly and become gods upon earth i think our chief feeling was one of impatience in having to wait to find to what heaven death would usher us who unfortunately had to be human before we could put on divinity we wanted heaven at once and were not deterred though jack hallam would borrow ninepence and pat regan make his paltry little jokes we had worked hard for six months before we began to think of writing or even of apportioning to each contributor what should be written for the first number i shall never forget the delight there was in having the young publisher in to tea and in putting him through his figures and in feeling that it became us for the moment to condescend to matters of trade we felt him to be an inferior being but still it was much for us to have progressed so far towards reality as to have a real publisher come to wait upon us it was at that time clearly understood that i was to be the editor and i felt myself justified in taking some little lead in arranging matters with our energetic young friend a remark that i made one evening was very mild simply some suggestion as to the necessity of having a more than ordinarily well educated set of printers but i was snubbed infinitely by churchill smith mr x said he can probably tell us more about printing than we can tell him i felt so hurt that i was almost tempted to leave the room at once i knew very well that if i seceded pat regan would go with me and that the whole thing must fall to the ground mrs st quinten however threw instant oil upon the waters churchill said she let us live and learn mr x no doubt knows why should we not share his knowledge i smothered my feelings in the public cause but i was conscious of a wish that mr smith might fall among the philistines of cursitor street and so of necessity be absent from our meetings there was an idea among us that he crept out of his hiding place and came to our conferences by by ways which was confirmed when our hostess proposed that our evening should be changed from thursday the day first appointed to sunday we all acceded willingly led away somewhat i fear by an idea that it was the proper thing for advanced spirits such as ours to go to work on that day which by ancient law is appointed for rest mrs st quinten would always open our meeting with a little speech gentlemen and partners in this enterprise she would say the tea is made and the muffins are ready our hearts are bound together in the work we are all in earnest in the good cause of political reform and social regeneration let the spirit of harmony prevail among us mr hallam perhaps youll take the cover off to see jack hallam eat muffins was i will say a caution if the use of the slang phrase may be allowed to me for the occasion it was presumed among us that on these days he had not dined indeed i doubt whether he often did dine supper being his favourite meal i have supped with him more than once at his invitation when to be without coin in my own pocket was no disgrace and have wondered at the equanimity with which the vendors of shell fish have borne my friends intimation that he must owe them the little amount due for our evening entertainment on these occasions his friend watt was never with him for walters ideas as to the common use of property were theoretical jack dashed at once into the more manly course of practice when he came to mrs st quintens one evening in my best nay why dally with the truth in my only pair of black dress trousers which i had lent him ten days before on the occasion as i then believed of a real dinner party i almost denounced him before his colleagues i think i should have done so had i not felt that he would in some fashion have so turned the tables on me that i should have been the sufferer there are men with whom one comes by the worst in any contest let justice on ones own side be ever so strong and ever so manifest but this is digression after the little speech jack would begin upon the muffins and churchill smith always seated at his cousins left hand would hang his head upon his hand wearing a look of mingled thought and sorrow on his brow he never would eat muffins we fancied that he fed himself with penny hunches of bread as he walked along the streets as a man he was wild unsociable untamable but as a philosopher he had certainly put himself beyond most of those wants to which jack hallam and others among us were still subject lydia he once said when pressed hard to partake of the good things provided man cannot live by muffins alone no nor by tea and muffins that by which he can live is hard to find i doubt we have not found it yet this to me seemed to be rank apostasy infidelity to the cause which he was bound to trust as long as he kept his place in that society how shall you do anything in the world achieve any success unless you yourself believe in yourself and if there be a partnership either in mind or matter your partner must be the same to you as yourself confidence is so essential to the establishment of a magazine i felt then at least that the panjandrum could have no chance without it and i rebuked mr churchill smith we know what you mean by that said i because we dont talk german metaphysics you think we aint worth our salt so much worth it said he that i trust heartily you may find enough to save you even yet i was about to boil over with wrath but walter watt was on his legs making a speech about the salt of the earth before i had my words ready churchill smith would put up with walter when he would endure words from no one else i used to think him mean enough to respect the oxford fellowship but i have since fancied that he believed that he had discovered a congenial spirit in those days i certainly did despise watts fellowship but in later life i have come to believe that men who get rewards have generally earned them watt on this occasion made a speech to which in my passion i hardly attended but i well remember how when i was about to rise in my wrath mrs st quinten put her hand on my arm and calmed me if you said she to whom we most trust for orderly guidance are to be the first to throw down the torch of discord what will become of us i havent thrown down any torch said i neither take one up said she pouring out my tea for me as she spoke as for myself said regan i like metaphysics and i like them german is there anything so stupid and pig headed as that insular feeling which makes us think nothing to be good that is not home grown all the same said jack who ever eat a good muffin out of london mr hallam mary jane is bringing up some more said our hostess she was an open handed woman and the supply of these delicacies never ran low as long as the panjandrum was a possibility it was i think on this evening that we decided finally for columns and for a dark gray wrapper with a portrait of the panjandrum in the centre a fancy portrait it must necessarily be but we knew that we could trust for that to the fertile pencil of mrs st quinten i had come prepared with a specimen cover as to which i had in truth consulted an artistic friend and had taken with it no inconsiderable labour i am sure looking back over the long interval of years at my feelings on that occasion i am sure i say that i bore well the alterations and changes which were made in that design until at last nothing remained of it but what matters a wrapper surely of any printed and published work it is by the interior that you should judge it it is not that old conjurors head that has given its success to blackwood nor yet those four agricultural boys that have made the cornhill what it is we had now decided on columns on the cover and the colour we had settled on the number of pages and had thumbed four or five specimens of paper submitted to us by our worthy publisher in that matter we had taken his advice and chosen the cheapest but still we liked the thumbing of the paper it was business paper was paper then and bore a high duty i do not think that the system of illustration had commenced in those days though a series of portraits was being published by one distinguished contemporary we readily determined that we would attempt nothing of that kind there then arose a question as to the insertion of a novel novels were not then as now held to be absolutely essential for the success of a magazine there were at that time magazines with novels and magazines without them the discreet young publisher suggested to us that we were not able to pay for such a story as would do us any credit i myself who was greedy for work with bated breath offered to make an attempt it was received with but faint thanks and walter watt rising on his legs with eyes full of fire and arms extended denounced novels in the general it was not for such purpose that he was about to devote to the production of the panjandrum any erudition that he might have acquired and all the intellect that god had given him let those who wanted novels go for them to the writer who dealt with fiction in the open market as for him he at any rate would search for truth we reminded him of bluminea tell your novel in three pages said he and tell it as that is told and i will not object to it we were enabled however to decide that there should be no novel in the panjandrum a see sartor resartus then at length came the meeting at which we were to begin our real work and divide our tasks among us hitherto mr x had usually joined us but a hint had been given to him that on this and a few following meetings we would not trespass on his time it was quite understood that he as publisher was to have nothing to do with the preparation or arrangement of the matter to be published we were i think a little proud of keeping him at a distance when we came to the discussion of that actual essence of our combined intellects which was to be issued to the world under the grotesque name which we had selected that mind and matter should be kept separated was impressed very strongly upon all of us now we were mind and mr x was matter he was matter at any rate in reference to this special work and therefore when we had arrived at that vital point we told him i had been commissioned to do so that we did not require his attendance just at present i am bound to say that mr x behaved well to the end but i do not think that he ever warmed to the panjandrum after that i fancy that he owns two or three periodicals now and hires his editors quite as easily as he does his butlers and with less regard to their characters i spent a nervous day in anticipation of that meeting pat regan was with me all day and threatened dissolution there isnt a fellow in the world said he that i love better than walter watt and id go to jamaica to serve him when the time came which it did oh so soon he was asked to go no further than kensal green but and then pat paused youre ready to quarrel with him said i simply because he wont laugh at your jokes theres a good deal in that said regan and when two men are in a boat together each ought to laugh at the others jokes but the question isnt as to our laughing if we cant make the public laugh sometimes we may as well shut up shop walter is so intensely serious that nothing less austere than lay sermons will suit his conscience let him preach his sermon and do you crack your jokes surely we cant be dull when we have you and jack hallam jackll never write a line said regan he only comes for the muffins then think of churchill smith and the sort of stuff hell expect to force down our readers throats smith is sour but never tedious said i indeed i expected great things from smith and so i told my friend lydia will write said pat we used to call her lydia behind her back and so will churchill smith and watt i do not doubt that they have quires written already but no one will read a word of it jack and you and i will intend to write but we shall never do anything this i felt to be most unjust because as i have said before i was already engaged upon the press my work was not remunerative but it was regularly done i am afraid of nothing said i but distrust you can move a mountain if you will only believe that you can move it just so but in order to avoid the confusion consequent on general motion among the mountains i and other men have been created without that sort of faith it was always so with my poor friend and consequently he is now attorney general at a turtle island had he believed as i did he and jack i still think that the panjandrum might have been a great success dont you look so glum he went on to say ill stick to it and do my best i did put lord bateman into rhymed latin verse for you last night then he repeated to me various stanzas of which i still remember one tuam duxi verum est filiam sed merum est si virgo mihi data fuit virgo tibi redditur venit in ephippio mihi et concipio satis est si triga pro reditu conceditur this cheered me a little for i thought that pat was good at these things and i was especially anxious to take the wind out of the sails of fraser and father prout bring it with you said i to him giving him great praise it will raise our spirits to know that we have something ready he did bring it but lydia required to have it all translated to her word by word it went off heavily and was at last objected to by the lady for the first and last time during our debates miss collins ventured to give an opinion on the literary question under discussion she agreed she said with her friend in thinking that mr regans latin poem should not be used the translation was certainly as good as the ballad and i was angry miss collins at any rate need not have interfered at last the evening came and we sat round the table after the tea cups had been removed each anxious for his allotted task pat had been so far right in his views as to the diligence of three of our colleagues that they came furnished with piles of manuscript walter watt who was afflicted with no false shame boldly placed before him on the table a heap of blotted paper churchhill smith held in his hand a roll but he did not in fact unroll it during the evening he was a man very fond of his own ideas of his own modes of thinking and manner of life but not prone to put himself forward i do not mind owning that i disliked him but he had a power of self abnegation which was to say the least of it respectable as i entered the room my eyes fell on a mass of dishevelled sheets of paper which lay on the sofa behind the chair on which mrs st quinten always sat and i knew that these were her contributions pat regan as i have said produced his unfortunate translation and promised with the greatest good humour to do another when he was told that his last performance did not quite suit mrs st quintens views jack had nothing ready nor indeed was anything ready ever expected from him i however had my own ideas as to what jack might do for us for myself i confess that i had in my pocket from two to three hundred lines of what i conceived would be a very suitable introduction in verse for the first number it was my duty i thought as editor to provide the magazine with a few initiatory words i did not however produce the rhymes on that evening having learned to feel that any strong expression of self on the part of one member at that board was not gratifying to the others i did take some pains in composing those lines and thought at the time that i had been not unhappy in mixing the useful with the sweet how many hours shall i say that i devoted to them alas alas it matters not now those words which i did love well never met any eye but my own though i had them then by heart they were never sounded in any ear it was not personal glory that i desired they were written that the first number of the panjandrum might appear becomingly before the public and the first number of the panjandrum never appeared i looked at them the other day thinking whether it might be too late for them to serve another turn i will never look at them again but from the first starting of the conception of the panjandrum i had had a great idea and that idea was discussed at length on the evening of which i am speaking we must have something that should be sparkling clever instructive amusing philosophical remarkable and new all at the same time that such a thing might be achieved in literature i felt convinced and it must be the work of three or four together it should be something that should force itself into notice and compel attention it should deal with the greatest questions of humanity and deal with them wisely but still should deal with them in a sportive spirit philosophy and humour might i was sure be combined social science might be taught with witty words and abstract politics made as agreeable as a novel there had been the corn law rhymes and the noctes it was however essentially necessary that we should be new and therefore i endeavoured vainly endeavoured to get those old things out of my head frasers people had done a great stroke of business by calling their editor mr yorke if i could get our people to call me mr lancaster something might come of it but yet it was so needful that we should be new the idea had been seething in my brain so constantly that i had hardly eat or slept free from it for the last six weeks if i could roll churchill smith and jack hallam into one throw in a dash of walter watts fine political eagerness make use of regans ready poetical facility and then control it all by my own literary experience the thing would be done but it is so hard to blend the elements i had spoken often of it to pat and he had assented ill do anything into rhyme he used to say if thats what you mean it was not quite what i meant one cannot always convey ones meaning to another and this difficulty is so infinitely increased when one is not quite clear in ones own mind and then pat who was the kindest fellow in the world and who bore with the utmost patience a restless energy which must often have troubled him sorely had not really his heart in it as i had if churchill smith will send me ever so much of his stuff ill put it into latin or english verse just as you please and i cant say more than that it was a great offer to make but it did not exactly reach the point at which i was aiming i had spoken to smith about it also i knew that if we were to achieve success we must do so in a great measure by the force of his intellectual energy i was not seeking pleasure but success and was willing therefore to endure the probable discourtesy or at least want of cordiality which i might encounter from the man i must acknowledge that he listened to me with a rapt attention attention so rapt is more sometimes than one desires could he have helped me with a word or two now and again i should have felt myself to be more comfortable with him i am inclined to think that two men get on better together in discussing a subject when they each speak a little at random it creates a confidence and enables a man to go on to the end churchill smith heard me without a word and then remarked that he had been too slow quite to catch my idea would i explain it again i did explain it again though no doubt i was flustered and blundered certainly said churchill smith if we can all be witty and all wise and all witty and wise at the same time and altogether it will be very fine but then you see im never witty and seldom wise the man was so uncongenial that there was no getting anything from him i did not dare to suggest to him that he should submit the prose exposition of his ideas to the metrical talent of our friend regan as soon as we were assembled i rose upon my legs saying that i proposed to make a few preliminary observations it certainly was the case that at this moment mrs st quinten was rinsing the teapot and mary jane had not yet brought in the muffins we all know that when men meet together for special dinners the speeches are not commenced till the meal is over and i would have kept my seat till jack had done his worst with the delicacies had it not been our practice to discuss our business with our plates and cups and saucers still before us you cant drink your tea on your legs said jack hallam i have no such intention said i what i have to lay before you will not take a minute a suggestion however came from another quarter that i should not be so formal and mrs st quinten touching my sleeve whispered to me a precaution against speech making i sat down and remarked in a manner that i felt to be ludicrously inefficient that i had been going to propose that the magazine should be opened by a short introductory paper as the reader knows i had the introduction then in my pocket let us dash into the middle of our work at once said walter watt no one reads introductions said regan my own friend pat regan i own i dont think an introduction would do us any particular service said lydia turning to me with that smile which was so often used to keep us in good humour i can safely assert that it was never vainly used on me i did not even bring the verses out of my pocket and thus i escaped at least the tortures of that criticism to which i should have been subjected had i been allowed to read them to the company so be it said i let us then dash into the middle of our work at once it is only necessary to have a point settled then we can progress after that i was silent for awhile thinking it well to keep myself in the background but no one seemed to be ready for speech walter watt fingered his manuscript uneasily and mrs st quinten made some remark not distinctly audible as to the sheets on the sofa but i must get rid of the tray first she said churchill smith sat perfectly still with his roll in his pocket mrs st quinten and gentlemen i said i am happy to tell you that i have had a contribution handed to me which will go far to grace our first number our friend regan has done lord bateman into latin verse with a latinity and a rhythm so excellent that it will go far to make us at any rate equal to anything else in that line then i produced the translated ballad and the little episode took place which i have already described mrs st quinten insisted on understanding in detail and it was rejected then upon my word i dont know what you are to get said i latin translations are not indispensable said walter watt no doubt we can live without them said pat with a fine good humour he bore the disgrace of having his first contribution rejected with admirable patience there was nothing he could not bear to this day he bears being attorney general at the turtle islands something must be done perhaps said i turning to the lady mrs st quinten will begin by giving us her ideas as to our first number she will tell us what she intends to do for us herself she was still embarrassed by the tea things and i acknowledge that i was led to appeal to her at that moment because it was so if i could succeed in extracting ideas they would be of infinitely more use to us than the reading of manuscript to get the thing licked into shape must be our first object as i had on this evening walked up to the sombre street leading into the new road in which mrs st quinten lived i had declared to myself a dozen times that to get the thing licked into shape was the great desideratum in my own imaginings i had licked it into some shape i had suggested to myself my own little introductory poem as a commencement and pat regans latin ballad as a pretty finish to the first number then there should be some thirty pages of dialogue or trialogue or hexalogue if necessary between the different members of our board each giving under an assumed name his view of what a perfect magazine should be this i intended to be the beginning of a conversational element which should be maintained in all subsequent numbers and which would enable us in that light and airy fashion which becomes a magazine to discuss all subjects of politics philosophy manners literature social science and even religion if necessary without inflicting on our readers the dulness of a long unbroken essay i was very strong about these conversations and saw my way to a great success if i could only get my friends to act in concert with me very much depended on the names to be chosen and i had my doubts whether watt and churchill smith would consent to this slightly theatrical arrangement mrs st quinten had already given in her adhesion but was doubting whether she would call herself charlotte partly after charlotte corday and partly after the lady who cut bread and butter or mrs freeman that name having as she observed been used before as a nom de plume or sophronie after madame de svign who was pleased so to call herself among the learned ladies of madame de rambouillets bower i was altogether in favour of mrs freeman which has the merit of simplicity but that was a minor point jack hallam had chosen his appellation somewhere in the lowlands he had seen over a small shop door the name of john neverapenny and john neverapenny he would be i turned it over on my tongue a score of times and thought that perhaps it might do pat wanted to call himself the oblazes but was at last persuaded to adopt the quieter name of tipperary in which county his family had been established since ireland was settled i think he said for myself i was indifferent they might give me what title they pleased i had had my own notion but that had been rejected they might call me jones or walker if they thought proper but i was very much wedded to the idea and i still think that had it been stoutly carried out the results would have been happy i was the first to acknowledge that the plan was not new there had been the noctes and some imitations even of the noctes but then what is new the noctes themselves had been imitations from older works if socrates and hippias had not conversed neither probably would mr north and his friends you might as well tell me said i addressing my colleagues that we must invent a new language find new forms of expression print our ideas in an unknown type and impress them on some strange paper let our thoughts be new said i and then let us select for their manifestation the most convenient form with which experience provides us but they didnt see it mrs st quinten liked the romance of being sophronie and to jack and pat there was some fun in the nicknames but in the real thing for which i was striving they had no actual faith if i could only lick them into shape i had said to myself at the last moment as i was knocking at mrs st quintens door mrs st quinten was nearer to my way of thinking in this respect than the others and therefore i appealed to her while the tea things were still before her thinking that i might obtain from her a suggestion in favour of the conversations the introductory poem and the latin ballad were gone for spilt milk what wise man weeps my verses had not even left my pocket not one there knew that they had been written and i was determined that not one should know but my conversations might still live ah if i could only blend the elements sophronie said i taking courage and speaking with a voice from which all sense of shame and fear of failure were intended to be banished sophronie will tell us what she intends to do for us herself i looked into my friends face and saw that she liked it but she turned to her cousin churchill smith as though for approval and met none we had better be in earnest said churchill smith without moving a muscle in his face or giving the slightest return to the glance which had fallen upon him from his cousin no one can be more thoroughly in earnest than myself i replied let us have no calling of names said churchill smith it is inappropriate and especially so when a lady is concerned it has been done scores of times i rejoined and that too in the very highest phases of civilisation and among the most discreet of matrons it seems to me to be twaddle said walter watt to my taste its abominably vulgar said churchill smith it has answered very well in other magazines said i thats just the reason we should avoid it said walter watt i think the thing has been about worn out said pat regan i was now thrown upon my mettle rising again upon my legs for the tea things had now been removed i poured out my convictions my hopes my fears my ambitions if we were thus to disagree on every point how should we ever blend the elements if we could not forbear with one another how could we hope to act together upon the age as one great force if there was no agreement between us how could we have the strength of union then i adverted with all the eloquence of which i was master to the great objects to be attained by these imaginary conversations that we may work together each using his own words that is my desire i said and i pointed out to them how willing i was to be the least among them in this contest to content myself with simply acting as chorus and pointing to the lessons of wisdom which would fall from out of their mouths i must say that they listened to me on this occasion with great patience churchill smith sat there with his great hollow eyes fixed upon me and it seemed to me as he looked that even he was being persuaded i threw myself into my words and implored them to allow me on this occasion to put them on the road to success when i had finished speaking i looked around and for a moment i thought they were convinced there was just a whispered word between our sophronie and her cousin and then she turned to me and spoke i was still standing and i bent down over her to catch the sentence she should pronounce give it up she said and i gave it up with what a pang this was done few of my readers can probably understand it had been my dream from my youth upwards i was still young no doubt and looking back now i can see how insignificant were the aspirations which were then in question but there is no period in a mans life in which it does not seem to him that his ambition is then at that moment culminating for him till the time comes in which he begins to own to himself that his life is not fit for ambition i had believed that i might be the means of doing something and of doing it in this way very vague indeed had been my notions most crude my ideas i can see that now what it was that my interlocutors were to say to each other i had never clearly known but i had felt that in this way each might speak his own speech without confusion and with delight to the reader the elements i had thought might be so blent then there came that little whisper between churchill smith and our sophronie and i found that i had failed give it up said she oh of course i said as i sat down only just settle what you mean to do for some few minutes i hardly heard what matters were being discussed among them and indeed during the remainder of the evening i took no real share in the conversation i was too deeply wounded even to listen i was resolute at first to abandon the whole affair i had already managed to scrape together the sum of money which had been named as the share necessary for each of us to contribute towards the production of the first number and that should be altogether at their disposal as for editing a periodical in the management of which i was not allowed to have the slightest voice that was manifestly out of the question nor could i contribute when every contribution which i suggested was rejected before it was seen my money i could give them and that no doubt would be welcome with these gloomy thoughts my mind was so full that i actually did not hear the words with which walter watt and churchill smith were discussing the papers proposed for the first number there was nothing read that evening no doubt it was visible to them all that i was as it were a blighted spirit among them they could not but know how hard i had worked how high had been my hopes how keen was my disappointment and they felt for me even churchill smith as he shook hands with me at the door spoke a word of encouragement do not expect to do things too quickly said he i dont expect to do anything said i we may do something even yet said he if we can be humble and patient and persevering we may do something though it be ever so little i was humble enough certainly and knew that i had persevered as for patience well i would endeavour even to be patient but prior to that mrs st quinten had explained to me the programme which had now been settled between the party we were not to meet again till that day fortnight and then each of us was to come provided with matter that would fill twenty one printed pages of the magazine this with the title page would comprise the whole first number we might all do as we liked with our own pages each within his allotted space filling the whole with one essay or dividing it into two or three short papers in this way there might be scope for pat regans verse or for any little badinage in which jack hallam might wish to express himself and in order to facilitate our work and for the sake of general accommodation a page or two might be lent or borrowed whatever anybody writes then i asked must be admitted mrs st quinten explained to me that this had not been their decision the whole matter produced was of course to be read each contributors paper by the contributor himself and it was to be printed and inserted in the first number if any three would vote for its insertion on this occasion the author of course would have no vote the votes were to be handed in written on slips of paper so that there might be no priority in voting so that no one should be required to express himself before or after his neighbour it was very complex but i made no objection as i walked home alone for i had no spirits to join regan and jack hallam who went in search of supper at the haymarket i turned over smiths words in my mind and resolved that i would be humble patient and persevering so that something might be done though it were as he said ever so little i would struggle still though everything was to be managed in a manner adverse to my own ideas and wishes i would still struggle i would still hope that the panjandrum might become a great fact in the literature of my country illustration illustration part ii despair a fortnight had been given to us to prepare our matter and during that fortnight i saw none of my colleagues i purposely kept myself apart from them in order that i might thus give a fairer chance to the scheme which had been adopted others might borrow or lend their pages but i would do the work allotted to me and would attend the next meeting as anxious for the establishment and maintenance of the panjandrum as i had been when i had hoped that the great consideration which i had given personally to the matter might have been allowed to have some weight and gradually as i devoted the first day of my fortnight to thinking of my work i taught myself to hope again and to look forward to a time when by the sheer weight of my own industry and persistency i might acquire that influence with my companions of which i had dreamed of becoming the master after all could i blame them for not trusting me when as yet i had given them no ground for such confidence what had i done that they should be willing to put their thoughts their aspirations their very brains and inner selves under my control but something might be done which would force them to regard me as their leader so i worked hard at my twenty one pages and during the fortnight spoke no word of the panjandrum to any human being but my work did not get itself done without very great mental distress the choice of a subject had been left free to each contributor for myself i would almost have preferred that some one should have dictated to me the matter to which i should devote myself how would it be with our first number if each of us were to write a political essay of exactly twenty one pages or a poem of that length in blank verse or a humorous narrative good heavens how were we to expect success with the public if there were no agreement between ourselves as to the nature of our contributions no editorial power in existence for our mutual support i went down and saw mr x and found him to be almost indifferent as to the magazine you see sir said he the matter isnt in my hands if i can give any assistance i shall be very happy but it seems to me that you want some one with experience i could have put them right if theyd have let me i replied he was very civil but it was quite clear to me that mr xs interest in the matter was over since the day of his banishment from mrs st quintens tea table what do you think is a good sort of subject i asked him as it were cursorily with a view you know to the eye of the public just at the present moment he declined to suggest any subject and i was thrown back among the depths of my own feelings and convictions now could we have blended our elements together and discussed all this in really amicable council each would have corrected what there might have been of rawness in the other and in the freedom of conversation our wits would have grown from the warmth of mutual encouragement such at least was my belief then since that i have learned to look at the business with eyes less enthusiastic let a man have learned the trick of the pen let him not smoke too many cigars overnight and let him get into his chair within half an hour after breakfast and i can tell you almost to a line how much of a magazine article he will produce in three hours it does not much matter what the matter be only this that if his task be that of reviewing he may be expected to supply a double quantity three days three out of the fourteen passed by and i could think of no fitting subject on which to begin the task i had appointed myself of teaching the british public politics at the moment were rather dull and no very great question was agitating the minds of men lord melbourne was prime minister and had in the course of the session been subjected to the usual party attacks we intended to go a great deal further than lord melbourne in advocating liberal measures and were disposed to regard him and his colleagues as antiquated fogies in statecraft but nevertheless as against sir robert peel we should have given him the benefit of our defence i did not however feel any special call to write up lord melbourne lord john was just then our pet minister but even on his behalf i did not find myself capable of filling twenty one closely printed pages with matter which should really stir the public mind in a first number to stir the public mind is everything i didnt think that my colleagues sufficiently realised that fact though i had indeed endeavoured to explain it to them in the second third or fourth publication you may descend gradually to an ordinary level you may become not exactly dull for dulness in a magazine should be avoided but what i may perhaps call adagio as compared with the con forza movement with which the publication certainly should be opened no reader expects to be supplied from month to month with the cayenne pepper and shallot style of literature but in the preparation of a new literary banquet the first dish cannot be too highly spiced i knew all that and then turned it over in my mind whether i could not do something about the ballot it had never occurred to me before that there could be any difficulty in finding a subject i had to reject the ballot because at that period of my life i had in fact hardly studied the subject i was liberal and indeed radical in all my political ideas i was ready to go in for anything that was undoubtedly liberal and radical in a general way i was as firm in my politics as any member of the house of commons and had thought as much on public subjects as some of them i was an eager supporter of the ballot but when i took the pen in my hand there came upon me a feeling that that that i didnt exactly know how to say anything about it that other people would care to read the twenty one pages loomed before me as a wilderness which with such a staff i could never traverse it had not occurred to me before that it would be so difficult for a man to evoke from his mind ideas on a subject with which he supposed himself to be familiar and such thoughts as i had i could clothe in no fitting words on the fifth morning driven to despair i did write a page or two upon the ballot and then sinking back in my chair i began to ask myself a question as to which doubt was terrible to me was this the kind of work to which my gifts were applicable the pages which i had already written were manifestly not adapted to stir the public mind the sixth and seventh days i passed altogether within my room never once leaving the house i drank green tea i eat meat very slightly cooked i debarred myself from food for several hours so that the flesh might be kept well under i sat up one night nearly till daybreak with a wet towel round my head on the next i got up and lit my own fire at four oclock thinking that i might be stretching the cord too tight i took to reading a novel but could not remember the words as i read them so painfully anxious was i to produce the work i had undertaken to perform on the morning of the eighth day i was still without a subject i felt like the man who undertook to play the violin at a dance for five shillings and a dinner the dinner to be paid in advance but who when making his bargain had forgotten that he had never learned a note of music i had undertaken even to lead the band and as it seemed could not evoke a sound a horrid idea came upon me that i was struck as it were with a sudden idiotcy my mind had absolutely fled from me i sat in my arm chair looking at the wall counting the pattern on the paper and hardly making any real effort to think all the world seemed at once to have become a blank to me i went on muttering to myself no the ballot wont do as though there was nothing else but the ballot with which to stir the public mind on the eighth morning i made a minute and quite correct calculation of the number of words that were demanded of me taking the whole as forty two pages because of the necessity of recopying and i found that about four hours a day would be required for the mere act of writing the paper was there and the pen and ink but beyond that there was nothing ready i had thought to rack my brain but i began to doubt whether i had a brain to rack of all those matters of public interest which had hitherto been to me the very salt of my life i could not remember one which could possibly be converted into twenty one pages of type unconsciously i kept on muttering words about the ballot the ballot be i said aloud to myself in my agony on that sunday evening i began to consider what excuse i might best make to my colleagues i might send and say i was very sick i might face them and quarrel with them because of their ill treatment of me or i might tell only half a lie keeping within the letter of the truth and say that i had not yet finished my work but no i would not lie at all late on that sunday evening there came upon me a grand idea i would stand up before them and confess my inability to do the work i had undertaken i arranged the words of my little speech and almost took delight in them i who have intended to be a teacher am now aware that i have hardly as yet become a pupil in such case the panjandrum would be at an end the elements had not been happily blended but without me they could not i was sure be kept in any concert the panjandrum which i had already learned to love as a mother loves her first born the dear old panjandrum must perish before its birth i felt the pity of it the thing itself the idea and theory of it had been very good but how shall a man put forth a magazine when he finds himself unable to write a page of it within the compass of a week the meditations of that sunday were very bitter but perhaps they were useful i had long since perceived that mankind are divided into two classes those who shall speak and those who shall listen to the speech of others in seeing clearly the existence of such a division i had hitherto always assumed myself to belong to the first class might it not be probable that i had made a mistake and that it would become me modestly to take my allotted place in the second on the monday morning i began to think that i was ill and resolved that i would take my hat and go out into the park and breathe some air let the panjandrum live or die such another week as the last would i fancied send me to hanwell it was now november and at ten oclock when i looked out there was a soft drizzling rain coming down and the pavement of the street was deserted it was just the morning for work were work possible there still lay on the little table in the corner of the room the square single sheet of paper with its margin doubled down all fitted for the printer only that the sheet was still blank i looked at the page and i rubbed my brow and i gazed into the street and then determined that a two hours ring round the regents park was the only chance left for me as i put on my thick boots and old hat and prepared myself for a thorough wetting i felt as though at last i had hit upon the right plan violent exercise was needed and then inspiration might come inspiration would come the sooner if i could divest myself from all effort in searching for it i would take my walk and employ my mind simply in observing the world around me for some distance there was but little of the world to observe i was lodging at this period in a quiet and eligible street not far from theobalds road thence my way lay through bloomsbury square russell square and gower street and as i went i found the pavement to be almost deserted the thick soft rain came down not with a splash and various currents running off and leaving things washed though wet but gently insinuating itself everywhere and covering even the flags with mud i cared nothing for the mud i went through it all with a happy scorn for the poor creatures who were endeavouring to defend their clothes with umbrellas let the heavens do their worst to me i said to myself as i spun along with eager steps and i was conscious of a feeling that external injuries could avail me nothing if i could only cure the weakness that was within the park too was nearly empty no place in london is ever empty now but thirty years ago the population was palpably thinner i had not come out however to find a crowd a damp boy sweeping a crossing or an old woman trying to sell an apple was sufficient to fill my mind with thoughts as to the affairs of my fellow creatures why should it have been allotted to that old woman to sit there placing all her hopes on the chance sale of a few apples the cold rain entering her very bones and driving rheumatism into all her joints while another old woman of whom i had read a paragraph that morning was appointed to entertain royalty and go about the country with five or six carriages and four was there injustice in this and if so whence had the injustice come the reflection was probably not new but if properly thought out might it not suffice for the one and twenty pages sally brown the barrow woman v the duchess of would it not be possible to make the two women plead against each other in some imaginary court of justice beyond the limits of our conventional life some court in which the duchess should be forced to argue her own case and in which the barrow woman would decidedly get the better of her if this could be done how happy would have been my walk through the mud and slush as i was thinking of this i saw before me on the pathway a stout woman apparently middle aged but her back was towards me leading a girl who perhaps might be ten or eleven years old they had come up one of the streets from the new road to the park and were hurrying along so fast that the girl who held the woman by the arm was almost running the woman was evidently a servant but in authority an upper nurse perhaps or a housekeeper why she should have brought her charge out in the rain was a mystery but i could see from the elasticity of the childs step that she was happy and very eager she was a well made girl with long well rounded legs which came freely down beneath her frock with strong firm boots a straw hat and a plaid shawl wound carefully round her throat and waist as i followed them those rapid legs of hers seemed almost to twinkle in their motion as she kept pace with the stout woman who was conducting her the mud was all over her stockings but still there was about her an air of well to do comfort which made me feel that the mud was no more than a joke to her every now and then i caught something of a glimpse of her face as she half turned herself round in talking to the woman i could see or at least i could fancy that i saw that she was fair with large round eyes and soft light brown hair children did not then wear wigs upon their backs and i was driven to exercise my fancy as to her locks at last i resolved that i would pass them and have one look at her and i did so it put me to my best pace to do it but gradually i overtook them and could hear that the girl never ceased talking as she ran as i went by them i distinctly heard the words oh anne i do so wonder what hes like youll see miss said anne i looked back and saw that she was exactly as i had thought a fair strong healthy girl with round eyes and large mouth broad well formed nose and light hair who was the he as to whom her anxiety was so great the he whom she was tripping along through the rain and mud to see and kiss and love and wonder at and why hadnt she been taken in a cab would she be allowed to take off those very dirty stockings before she was introduced to her new found brother or wrapped in the arms of her stranger father i saw no more of them and heard no further word but i thought a great deal of the girl ah me if she could have been a young unknown newly found sister of my own how warmly would i have welcomed her how little should i have cared for the mud on her stockings how closely would i have folded her in my arms how anxious would i have been with anne as to those damp clothes what delight would i have had in feeding her coaxing her caressing her and playing with her there had seemed to belong to her a wholesome strong health which it had made me for the moment happy even to witness and then the sweet eloquent anxiety of her voice oh anne i do so wonder what hes like while i heard her voice i had seemed to hear and know so much of her and then she had passed out of my ken for ever i thought no more about the duchess and the apple woman but devoted my mind entirely to the girl and her brother i was persuaded that it must be a brother had it been a father there would have been more of awe in her tone it certainly was a brother gradually as the unforced imagination came to play upon the matter a little picture fashioned itself in my mind the girl was my own sister a sister whom i had never seen till she was thus brought to me for protection and love but she was older just budding into womanhood instead of running beside her nurse with twinkling legs there however was the same broad honest face the same round eyes the same strong nose and mouth she had come to me for love and protection having no other friend in the world to trust but having me i proudly declared to myself that she needed nothing further in two short months i was nothing to her or almost nothing i had a friend and in two little months my friend had become so much more than i ever could have been these wondrous castles in the air never get themselves well built when the mind with premeditated skill and labour sets itself to work to build them it is when they come uncalled for that they stand erect and strong before the minds eye with every mullioned window perfect the rounded walls all there the embrasures cut the fosse dug and the drawbridge down as i had made this castle for myself as i had sat with this girl by my side calling her the sweetest names as i had seen her blush when my friend came near her and had known at once with a mixed agony and joy how the thing was to be i swear that i never once thought of the panjandrum i walked the whole round of the regents park perfecting the building and i did perfect it took the girl to church gave her away to my friend walker and came back and sobbed and sputtered out my speech at the little breakfast before it occurred to me to suggest to myself that i might use the thing churchill smith and walter watt had been dead against a novel and indeed the matter had been put to the vote and it had been decided that there should be no novel but what is a novel the purport of that vote had been to negative a long serial tale running on from number to number in a manner which has since become well understood by the reading public i had thought my colleagues wrong and so thinking it was clearly my duty to correct their error if i might do so without infringing that loyalty and general obedience to expressed authority which are so essential to such a society as ours before i had got back to theobalds road i had persuaded myself that a short tale would be the very thing for the first number it might not stir the public mind to do that i would leave to churchill smith and walter watt but a well formed little story such as that of which i had now the full possession would fall on the readers of the panjandrum like sweet rain in summer making things fresh and green and joyous i was quite sure that it was needed walter watt might say what he pleased and churchill smith might look at me as sternly as he would sitting there silent with his forehead on his hand but i knew at least as much about a magazine as they did at any rate i would write my tale that very morning it had seemed to me to be impossible to get anything written now as i hurried up stairs to get rid of my wet clothes i felt that i could not take the pen quickly enough into my hand i had a thing to say and i would say it if i could complete my story and i did not doubt its completion from the very moment in which i realised its conception i should be saved at any rate from the disgrace of appearing empty handed in mrs st quintens parlour within a quarter of an hour of my arrival at home i had seated myself at my table and written the name of the tale the new inmate i doubt whether any five days in my life were ever happier than those which were devoted to this piece of work i began it that monday afternoon and finished it on the friday night while i was at the task all doubt vanished from my mind i did not care a fig for watt or smith and was quite sure that i should carry mrs st quinten with me each night i copied fairly what i had written in the day and i came to love the thing with an exceeding love there was a deal of pathos in it at least so i thought and i cried over it like a child i had strained all my means to prepare for the coming of the girl i am now going back for a moment to my castle in the air and had furnished for her a little sitting room and as pretty a white curtained chamber as a girl ever took pleasure in calling her own there were books for her and a small piano and a low sofa and all little feminine belongings i had said to myself that everything should be for her and i had sold my horse the horse of my imagination the reader will understand for i had never in truth possessed such an animal and told my club friends that i should no longer be one of them then the girl had come and had gone away to walker as it seemed to me at once to walker who still lived in lodgings and had not even a second sitting room for her comfort to walker who was indeed a good fellow in his way but possessed of no particular attractions either in wit manners or beauty i wanted them to change with me and to take my pretty home i should have been delighted to go to a garret leaving them everything but walker was proud and would not have it so and the girl protested that the piano and the white dimity curtains were nothing to her walker was everything walker of whom she had never heard when she came but a few weeks since to me as the only friend left to her in the world i worked myself up to such a pitch of feeling over my story that i could hardly write it for my tears i saw myself standing all alone in that pretty sitting room after they were gone and i pitied myself with an exceeding pity si vis me flere dolendum est primum ipsi tibi if success was to be obtained by obeying that instruction i might certainly expect success the way in which my work went without a pause was delightful when the pen was not in my hand i was longing for it while i was walking eating or reading i was still thinking of my story i dreamt of it it came to me to be a matter that admitted of no doubt the girl with the muddy stockings who had thus provided me in my need was to me a blessed memory when i kissed my sisters brow on her first arrival she was in my arms palpably all her sweetnesses were present to me as though i had her there in the little street turning out of theobalds road to this moment i can distinguish the voice in which she spoke to me that little whispered word when i asked her whether she cared for walker when one thinks of it the reality of it all is appalling what need is there of a sister or a friend in the flesh a sister or a friend with probably so many faults when by a little exercise of the mind they may be there at your elbow faultless it came to pass that the tale was more dear to me than the magazine as i read it through for the third or fourth time on the sunday morning i was chiefly anxious for the panjandrum in order that the new inmate might see the world we were to meet that evening at eight oclock and it was understood that the sitting would be prolonged to a late hour because of the readings it would fall to my lot to take the second reading as coming next to mrs st quinten and i should at any rate not be subjected to a weary audience we had however promised each other to be very patient and i was resolved that even to the production of churchill smith who would be the last i would give an undivided and eager attention i determined also in my joy that i would vote against the insertion of no colleagues contribution were we not in a boat together and would not each do his best even though a paper might be dull better a little dulness than the crushing of a friends spirit i fear that i thought that the new inmate might atone for much dulness i dined early on that day then took a walk round the regents park to renew my thoughts on the very spot on which they had first occurred to me and after that returning home gave a last touch to my work though it had been written after so hurried a fashion there was not a word in it which i had not weighed and found to be fitting i was the first at mrs st quintens house and found that lady very full of the magazine she asked however no questions as to my contribution of her own she at once spoke to me what do you think i have done at last she said in my reply to her question i made some slight allusion to the new inmate but i dont think she caught the words i have reviewed bishop berkeleys whole theory on matter said she what feeling i expressed by my gesture i cannot say but i think it must have been one of great awe and i have done it exhaustively she continued so that the subject need not be continued churchill does not like continuations perhaps it did not signify much if she were heavy i at any rate was light if her work should prove difficult of comprehension mine was easy if she spoke only to the wise and old i had addressed myself to babes and sucklings i said something as to the contrast again naming my little story but she was too full of bishop berkeley to heed me if she had worked as i had worked of course she was full of bishop berkeley to me the new inmate at that moment was more than all the bishops the other men soon came in clustering together and our number was complete regan whispered to me that jack hallam had not written a line and you i asked oh i am all right said he i dont suppose theyll let it pass but thats their affair not mine watt and smith took their places almost without speaking and preparation was made for the preliminary feast of the body the after feast was a matter of such vital importance to us that we hardly possessed our customary light hearted elasticity there was however an air of subdued triumph about our lydia of triumph subdued by the presence of her cousin as for myself i was supremely happy i said a word to watt asking him as to his performance i dont suppose you will like it he replied but it is at any rate a fair specimen of that which it has been my ambition to produce i assured him with enthusiasm that i was thoroughly prepared to approve and that too without carping criticism but we must be critics he observed of churchill smith i asked no question when we had eaten and drunk we began the work of the evening by giving in the names of our papers and describing the nature of the work we had done mrs st quinten was the first and read her title from a scrap of paper a review of bishop berkeleys theory churchill smith remarked that it was a very dangerous subject the lady begged him to wait till he should hear the paper read of course i will hear it read said her cousin to me it was evident that smith would object to this essay without any scruple if he did not in truth approve of it then it was my turn and i explained in the quietest tone which i could assume that i had written a little tale called the new inmate it was very simple i said but i trusted it might not be rejected on that score there was silence for a moment and i prompted regan to proceed but i was interrupted by walter watt i thought said he that we had positively decided against prose fiction i protested that the decision had been given against novels against long serial stories to be continued from number to number this was a little thing completed within my twenty one allotted pages our vote was taken as to prose fiction said watt i appealed to hallam who at once took my part as also did regan walter is quite correct as to the purport of our decision said churchill smith i turned to mrs st quinten i dont see why we shouldnt have a short story she said i then declared that with their permission i would at any rate read it and again requested regan to proceed upon this walter watt rose upon his feet and made a speech the vote had been taken and could not be rescinded after such a vote it was not open to me to read my story the story no doubt was very good he was pleased to say so but it was not matter of the sort which they intended to use seeing the purpose which they had in view he thought that the reading of the story would be waste of time it will clearly be waste of time said churchill smith walter watt went on to explain to us that if from one meeting to another we did not allow ourselves to be bound by our own decisions we should never appear before the public i will acknowledge that i was enraged it seemed to me impossible that such folly should be allowed to prevail or that after all my efforts i should be treated by my own friends after such a fashion i also got upon my legs and protested loudly that mr watt and mr smith did not even know what had been the subject under discussion when the vote adverse to novels had been taken no record was kept of our proceedings and as i clearly showed to them mr regan and mr hallam were quite as likely to hold correct views on this subject as were mr watt and mr smith all calling of men pat and jack and walter was for the moment over watt admitted the truth of this argument and declared that they must again decide whether my story of the new inmate was or was not a novel in the sense intended when the previous vote was taken if not if the decision on that point should be in my favour then the privilege of reading it would at any rate belong to me i believed so thoroughly in my own work that i desired nothing beyond this we went to work therefore and took the votes on the proposition was or was not the story of the new inmate debarred by the previous resolution against the admission of novels the decision manifestly rested with mrs st quinten i was master easily master of three votes hallam and regan were altogether with me and in a matter of such import i had no hesitation in voting for myself had the question been the acceptance or rejection of the story for the magazine then by the nature of our constitution i should have had no voice in the matter but this was not the case and i recorded my own vote in my own favour without a blush having done so i turned to mrs st quinten with an air of supplication in my face of which i myself was aware and of which i became at once ashamed she looked round at me almost furtively keeping her eyes otherwise fixed upon churchill smiths immovable countenance i did not condescend to speak a word to her what words i had to say i had spoken to them all and was confident in the justice of my cause i quickly dropped that look of supplication and threw myself back in my chair the moment was one of intense interest almost of agony but i could not allow myself to think that in very truth my work would be rejected by them before it was seen if such were to be their decision how would it be possible that the panjandrum should ever be brought into existence who could endure such ignominy and still persevere there was silence among us which to me in the intensity of my feelings seemed to last for minutes regan was the first to speak now mrs st quinten he said it all rests with you an idea shot across my mind at the moment of the folly of which we had been guilty in placing our most vital interests in the hands of a woman merely on the score of gallantry two votes had been given to her as against one of ours simply because she was a woman it may be that there had been something in the arrangement of compensation for the tea and muffins but if so how poor was the cause for so great an effect she sat there the arbiter of our destinies you had better give your vote said smith roughly you think it is a novel she said appealing to him there can be no doubt of it he replied a novel is not a novel because it is long or short such is the matter which we intended to declare that we would not put forth in our magazine i protest said i jumping up i protest against this interference then there was a loud and very angry discussion whether churchill smith was justified in his endeavour to bias mrs st quinten and we were nearly brought to a vote upon that i myself was very anxious to have that question decided to have any question decided in which churchill smith could be shown to be in the wrong but no one would back me and it seemed to me as though even regan and jack hallam were falling off from me though jack had never yet restored to me that article of clothing to which allusion was made in the first chapter of this little history and i had been almost as anxious for pats latin translation as for my own production it was decided without a vote that any amount of free questioning as to each others opinions and of free answering was to be considered fair i tell her my opinion you can tell her yours said churchill smith it is my opinion said i that you want to dictate to everybody and to rule the whole thing i think we did mean to exclude all story telling said mrs st quinten and so the decision was given against me looking back at it i know that they were right on the exact point then under discussion they had intended to exclude all stories but heaven and earth was there ever such folly as that of which they had been guilty in coming to such a resolution i have often suggested to myself since that had the new inmate been read on that evening the panjandrum might have become a living reality and that the fortieth volume of the publication might now have been standing on the shelves of many a well filled library the decision however had been given against me and i sat like one stricken dumb paralysed or turned to stone i remember it as though it were yesterday i did not speak a word but simply moving my chair an inch or two i turned my face away from the lady who had thus blasted all my hopes i fear that my eyes were wet and that a hot tear trickled down each cheek no note of triumph was sounded and i verily believe they all suffered in my too conspicuous sufferings to both watt and smith it had been a matter of pure conscience mrs st quinten woman like had obeyed the man in whose strength she trusted there was silence for a few moments and then watt invited regan to proceed he had divided his work into three portions but what they were called whether they were verse or prose translations or original comic or serious i never knew i could not listen then for me to continue my services to the panjandrum was an impossibility i had been crushed so crushed that i had not vitality left me to escape from the room or i should not have remained there pat regans papers were nothing to me now watt i knew had written an essay called the real aristocrat which was published elsewhere afterwards jack hallams work was not ready there was something said of his delinquency but i cared not what i only wish that my work also had been unready churchill smith also had some essay on the basis of political right that if i remember rightly was its title i often talked the matter over in after days with pat regan and i know that from the moment in which my consternation was made apparent to them the thing went very heavily at the time and for some hours after the adverse decision i was altogether unmanned and unable to collect my thoughts before the evening was over there occurred a further episode in our affairs which awakened me the names of the papers had been given in and mrs st quinten began to read her essay nothing more than the drone of her voice reached the tympanum of my ears i did not look at her or think of her or care to hear a word that she uttered i believe i almost slept in my agony but sleeping or waking i was turning over in my mind wearily and incapably the idea of declining to give any opinion as to the propriety of inserting or rejecting the review of bishop berkeleys theory on the score that my connection with the panjandrum had been severed but the sound of the reading went on and i did not make up my mind i hardly endeavoured to make it up but sat dreamily revelling in my own grievance and pondering over the suicidal folly of the panjandrum company the reading went on and on without interruption without question and without applause i know i slept during some portion of the time for i remember that regan kicked my shin and i remember also a feeling of compassion for the reader who was hardly able to rouse herself up to the pitch of spirit necessary for the occasion but allowed herself to be quelled by the cold steady gaze of her cousin churchill watt sat immovable with his hands in his trousers pockets leaning back in his chair the very picture of dispassionate criticism jack hallam amused himself by firing paper pellets at regan sundry of which struck me on the head and face once mrs st quinten burst forth in offence mr hallam she said i am sorry to be so tedious i like it of all things said jack it was certainly very long half comatose as i was with my own sufferings i had begun to ask myself before mrs st quinten had finished her task whether it would be possible to endure three other readings lengthy as this ah if i might have read my new inmate how different would the feeling have been of what the lady said about berkeley i did not catch a word but the name of the philosophical bishop seemed to be repeated usque ad nauseam of a sudden i was aware that i had snored a kick from pat regan wounded my shin a pellet from jack hallam fell on my nose and the essay was completed i looked up and could see that drops of perspiration were standing on the ladys brow there was a pause and even i was now aroused to attention we were to write our verdicts on paper simply the word insert or reject and what should i write instead of doing so should i declare at once that i was severed from the panjandrum by the treatment i had received that i was severed in fact i was very sure could any human flesh and blood have continued its services to any magazine after such humiliation as i had suffered nevertheless it might perhaps be more manly were i to accept the responsibility of voting on the present occasion and if so how should i vote i had not followed a single sentence and yet i was convinced that matter such as that would never stir the british public mind but as the thing went we were not called upon for our formal verdicts lydia as soon as she had done reading turned at once to her cousin she cared for no verdict but his well said she what do you think of it at first he did not answer i know i read it badly she continued but i hope you caught my meaning it is utter nonsense he said without moving his head oh churchill she exclaimed it is utter nonsense he repeated it is out of the question that it should be published she glanced her eyes round the company but ventured no spoken appeal jack hallam said something about unnecessary severity and want of courtesy watt simply shook his head i say it is trash said smith rising from his chair you shall not disgrace yourself give it to me she put her hand upon the manuscript as though to save it give it to me he said sternly and took it from her unresisting grasp then he stalked to the fire and tearing the sheets in pieces thrust them between the bars of course there was a great commotion we were all up in a moment standing around her as though to console her miss collins came in and absolutely wept over her ill used friend for the instant i had forgotten the new inmate as though it had never been written she was deluged in tears hiding her face upon the table but she uttered no word of reproach and ventured not a syllable in defence of her essay i didnt think it was so bad as that she murmured amidst her sobs i did not dare to accuse the man of cruelty i myself had become so small among them that my voice would have had no weight but i did think him cruel and hated him on her account as well as on my own jack hallam remarked that for this night at least our work must be considered to be over it is over altogether said churchill smith i have known that for weeks past and i have known too what fools we have been to make the attempt i hope at least that we may have learnt a lesson that will be of service to us perhaps you had better go now and ill just say a word or two to my cousin before i leave her how we got out of the room i hardly remember there was no doubt some leave taking between us four and the unfortunate lydia but it amounted i think to no more than mere decency required to churchill smith i know that i did not speak i never saw either of the cousins again nor as has been already told did i ever distinctly hear what was their fate in life and yet how intimately connected with them had i been for the last six or eight months for not calling upon her so that we might have mingled the tears of our disappointment together i much blamed myself but the subject which we must have discussed the failure namely of the panjandrum was one so sore and full of sorrow that i could not bring myself to face the interview churchill smith i know made various efforts to obtain literary employment but never succeeded because he would yield no inch in the expression of his own violent opinions i doubt whether he ever earned as much as by his writings i heard of his living and almost starving still in london and then that he went to fight for polish freedom it is believed that he died in a russian prison but i could never find any one who knew with accuracy the circumstances of his fate he was a man who could go forth with his life in his hand and in meeting death could feel that he encountered only that which he had expected mrs st quinten certainly vanished during the next summer from the street in which she had bestowed upon us so many muffins and what became of her i never heard on that evening pat regan and i consoled ourselves together as best we might jack hallam and walter watt having parted from us under the walls of marylebone workhouse pat and i walked down to a modest house of refreshment with which we were acquainted in leicester square and there arranged the obsequies of the panjandrum over a pint of stout and a baked potato pats equanimity was marvellous it had not even yet been ruffled although the indignities thrown upon him had almost surpassed those inflicted on myself his lord bateman had been first rejected and after that his subsequent contributions had been absolutely ignored merely because mr churchill smith had not approved his cousins essay upon bishop berkeley it was rot real rot said pat alluding to lydias essay and apologising for smith but why not have gone on and heard yours said i mine would have been rot too said pat it isnt so easy after all to do this kind of thing we agreed that the obsequies should be very private indeed as the panjandrum had as yet not had a body of its own it was hardly necessary to open the earth for the purposes of interment we agreed simply to say nothing about it to any one i would go to mr x and tell him that we had abandoned our project and there would be an end of it as the night advanced i offered to read the new inmate to my friend but he truly remarked that of reading aloud they had surely had enough that night when he reflected that but for the violence of mr smiths proceedings we might even then at that moment have been listening to an essay upon the basis of political rights i think that he rejoiced that the panjandrum was no more on the following morning i called on mr x and explained to him that portion of the occurrences of the previous evening with which it was necessary that he should be made acquainted i thought that he was rather brusque but i cannot complain that he was upon the whole unfriendly the truth is sir he said you none of you exactly knew what you wanted to be after you were very anxious to do something grand but hadnt got this grand thing clear before your eye people you know may have too much genius or may have too little which of the two he thought was our case he did not say but he did promise to hear my story of the new inmate read with reference to its possible insertion in another periodical publication with which he had lately become connected perhaps some of my readers may remember its appearance in the first number of the marble arch where it attracted no little attention and was supposed to have given assistance not altogether despicable towards the establishment of that excellent periodical such was the history of the panjandrum the spotted dog illustration the spotted dog part i the attempt some few years since we received the following letter dear sir i write to you for literary employment and i implore you to provide me with it if it be within your power to do so my capacity for such work is not small and my acquirements are considerable my need is very great and my views in regard to remuneration are modest i was educated at and was afterwards a scholar of college cambridge i left the university without a degree in consequence of a quarrel with the college tutor i was rusticated and not allowed to return after that i became for awhile a student for the chancery bar i then lived for some years in paris and i understand and speak french as though it were my own language for all purposes of literature i am equally conversant with german i read italian i am of course familiar with latin in regard to greek i will only say that i am less ignorant of it than nineteen twentieths of our national scholars i am well read in modern and ancient history i have especially studied political economy i have not neglected other matters necessary to the education of an enlightened man unless it be natural philosophy i can write english and can write it with rapidity i am a poet at least i so esteem myself i am not a believer my character will not bear investigation in saying which i mean you to understand not that i steal or cheat but that i live in a dirty lodging spend many of my hours in a public house and cannot pay tradesmens bills where tradesmen have been found to trust me i have a wife and four children which burden forbids me to free myself from all care by a bare bodkin i am just past forty and since i quarrelled with my family because i could not understand the trinity i have never been the owner of a ten pound note my wife was not a lady i married her because i was determined to take refuge from the conventional thraldom of so called gentlemen amidst the liberty of the lower orders my life of course has been a mistake indeed to live at all is it not a folly i am at present employed on the staff of two or three of the penny dreadfuls your august highness in literature has perhaps never heard of a penny dreadful i write for them matter which we among ourselves call blood and nastiness and which is copied from one to another for this i am paid forty five shillings a week for thirty shillings a week i will do any work that you may impose upon me for the term of six months i write this letter as a last effort to rescue myself from the filth of my present position but i entertain no hope of any success if you ask it i will come and see you but do not send for me unless you mean to employ me as i am ashamed of myself i live at no cucumber court grays inn lane but if you write address to the care of mr grimes the spotted dog liquorpond street now i have told you my whole life and you may help me if you will i do not expect an answer yours truly julius mackenzie indeed he had told us his whole life and what a picture of a life he had drawn there was something in the letter which compelled attention it was impossible to throw it half read into the waste paper basket and to think of it not at all we did read it probably twice and then put ourselves to work to consider how much of it might be true and how much false had the man been a boy at and then a scholar of his college we concluded that so far the narrative was true had he abandoned his dependence on wealthy friends from conscientious scruples as he pretended or had other and less creditable reasons caused the severance on that point we did not quite believe him and then as to those assertions made by himself in regard to his own capabilities how far did they gain credence with us we think that we believed them all making some small discount with the exception of that one in which he proclaimed himself to be a poet a man may know whether he understands french and be quite ignorant whether the rhymed lines which he produces are or are not poetry when he told us that he was an infidel and that his character would not bear investigation we went with him altogether his allusion to suicide we regarded as a foolish boast we gave him credit for the four children but were not certain about the wife we quite believed the general assertion of his impecuniosity that stuff about conventional thraldom we hope we took at its worth when he told us that his life had been a mistake he spoke to us gospel truth of the penny dreadfuls and of blood and nastiness so called we had never before heard but we did not think it remarkable that a man so gifted as our correspondent should earn forty five shillings a week by writing for the cheaper periodicals it did not however appear to us probable that any one so remunerated would be willing to leave that engagement for another which should give him only thirty shillings when he spoke of the filth of his present position our heart began to bleed for him we know what it is so well and can fathom so accurately the degradation of the educated man who having been ambitious in the career of literature falls into that slough of despond by which the profession of literature is almost surrounded there we were with him as brothers together when we came to mr grimes and the spotted dog in liquorpond street we thought that we had better refrain from answering the letter by which decision on our part he would not according to his own statement be much disappointed mr julius mackenzie perhaps at this very time rich uncles and aunts were buttoning up their pockets against the sinner because of his devotion to the spotted dog there are well to do people among the mackenzies it might be the case that that heterodox want of comprehension in regard to the trinity was the cause of it but we have observed that in most families grievous as are doubts upon such sacred subjects they are not held to be cause of hostility so invincible as is a thorough going devotion to a spotted dog if the spotted dog had brought about these troubles any interposition from ourselves would be useless for twenty four hours we had given up all idea of answering the letter but it then occurred to us that men who have become disreputable as drunkards do not put forth their own abominations when making appeals for aid if this man were really given to drink he would hardly have told us of his association with the public house probably he was much at the spotted dog and hated himself for being there the more we thought of it the more we fancied that the gist of his letter might be true it seemed that the man had desired to tell the truth as he himself believed it it so happened that at that time we had been asked to provide an index to a certain learned manuscript in three volumes the intended publisher of the work had already procured an index from a professional compiler of such matters but the thing had been so badly done that it could not be used some knowledge of the classics was required though it was not much more than a familiarity with the names of latin and greek authors to which perhaps should be added some acquaintance with the names also of the better known editors and commentators the gentleman who had had the task in hand had failed conspicuously and i had been told by my enterprising friend mr x the publisher that would be freely paid on the proper accomplishment of the undertaking the work apparently so trifling in its nature demanded a scholars acquirements and could hardly be completed in less than two months we had snubbed the offer saying that we should be ashamed to ask an educated man to give his time and labour for so small a remuneration but to mr julius mackenzie for two months work would manifestly be a godsend if mr julius mackenzie did in truth possess the knowledge for which he gave himself credit if he was as he said familiar with latin and was less ignorant of greek than nineteen twentieths of our national scholars he might perhaps be able to earn this we certainly knew no one else who could and who would do the work properly for that money we therefore wrote to mr julius mackenzie and requested his presence our note was short cautious and also courteous we regretted that a man so gifted should be driven by stress of circumstances to such need we could undertake nothing but if it would not put him to too much trouble to call upon us we might perhaps be able to suggest something to him precisely at the hour named mr julius mackenzie came to us we well remember his appearance which was one unutterably painful to behold he was a tall man very thin thin we might say as a whipping post were it not that ones idea of a whipping post conveys erectness and rigidity whereas this man as he stood before us was full of bends and curves and crookedness his big head seemed to lean forward over his miserably narrow chest his back was bowed and his legs were crooked and tottering he had told us that he was over forty but we doubted and doubt now whether he had not added something to his years in order partially to excuse the wan worn weariness of his countenance he carried an infinity of thick ragged wild dirty hair dark in colour though not black which age had not yet begun to grizzle he wore a miserable attempt at a beard stubbly uneven and half shorn as though it had been cut down within an inch of his chin with blunt scissors he had two ugly projecting teeth and his cheeks were hollow his eyes were deep set but very bright illuminating his whole face so that it was impossible to look at him and to think him to be one wholly insignificant his eyebrows were large and shaggy but well formed not meeting across the brow with single stiffly projecting hairs a pair of eyebrows which added much strength to his countenance his nose was long and well shaped but red as a huge carbuncle the moment we saw him we connected that nose with the spotted dog it was not a blotched nose not a nose covered with many carbuncles but a brightly red smooth well formed nose one glowing carbuncle in itself he was dressed in a long brown great coat which was buttoned up round his throat and which came nearly to his feet the binding of the coat was frayed the buttons were half uncovered the button holes were tattered the velvet collar had become party coloured with dirt and usage it was in the month of december and a great coat was needed but this great coat looked as though it were worn because other garments were not at his command not an inch of linen or even of flannel shirt was visible below his coat we could only see his broken boots and the soiled legs of his trousers which had reached that age which in trousers defies description when we looked at him we could not but ask ourselves whether this man had been born a gentleman and was still a scholar and yet there was that in his face which prompted us to believe the account he had given of himself as we looked at him we felt sure that he possessed keen intellect and that he was too much of a man to boast of acquirements which he did not believe himself to possess we shook hands with him asked him to sit down and murmured something of our sorrow that he should be in distress i am pretty well used to it said he there was nothing mean in his voice there was indeed a touch of humour in it and in his manner there was nothing of the abjectness of supplication we had his letter in our hands and we read a portion of it again as he sat opposite to us we then remarked that we did not understand how he having a wife and family dependent on him could offer to give up a third of his income with the mere object of changing the nature of his work you dont know what it is said he to write for the penny dreadfuls im at it seven hours a day and hate the very words that i write i cursed myself afterwards for sending that letter i know that to hope is to be an ass but i did send it and here i am we looked at his nose and felt that we must be careful before we suggested to our learned friend dr to put his manuscript into the hands of mr julius mackenzie if it had been a printed book the attempt might have been made without much hazard but our friends work which was elaborate and very learned had not yet reached the honours of the printing house we had had our own doubts whether it might ever assume the form of a real book but our friend who was a wealthy as well as a learned man was as yet very determined he desired at any rate that the thing should be perfected and his publisher had therefore come to us offering for the codification and index were anything other than good to befall his manuscript his lamentations would be loud not on his own score but on behalf of learning in general it behoved us therefore to be cautious we pretended to read the letter again in order that we might gain time for a decision for we were greatly frightened by that gleaming nose let the reader understand that the nose was by no means bardolphian if we have read shakespeare aright bardolphs nose was a thing of terror from its size as well as its hue it was a mighty vat into which had ascended all the divinest particles distilled from the cellars of the hostelrie in eastcheap such at least is the idea which stage representations have left upon all our minds but the nose now before us was a well formed nose would have been a commanding nose for the power of command shows itself much in the nasal organ had it not been for its colour while we were thinking of this and doubting much as to our friends manuscript mr mackenzie interrupted us you think i am a drunkard said he the mans mother wit had enabled him to read our inmost thoughts as we looked up the man had risen from his chair and was standing over us he loomed upon us very tall although his legs were crooked and his back bent those piercing eyes and that nose which almost assumed an air of authority as he carried it were a great way above us there seemed to be an infinity of that old brown great coat he had divined our thoughts and we did not dare to contradict him we felt that a weak vapid unmanly smile was creeping over our face we were smiling as a man smiles who intends to imply some contemptuous assent with the self depreciating comment of his companion such a mode of expression is in our estimation most cowardly and most odious we had not intended it but we knew that the smile had pervaded us of course you do said he i was a drunkard but i am not one now it doesnt matter only i wish you hadnt sent for me ill go away at once so saying he was about to depart but we stopped him we assured him with much energy that we did not mean to offend him he protested that there was no offence he was too well used to that kind of thing to be made more than wretched by it such was his heart breaking phrase as for anger ive lost all that long ago of course you take me for a drunkard and i should still be a drunkard only only what i asked it dont matter said he i need not trouble you more than i have said already you havent got anything for me to do i suppose then i explained to him that i had something he might do if i could venture to entrust him with the work with some trouble i got him to sit down again and to listen while i explained to him the circumstances i had been grievously afflicted when he alluded to his former habit of drinking a former habit as he himself now stated but i entertained no hesitation in raising questions as to his erudition i felt almost assured that his answers would be satisfactory and that no discomfiture would arise from such questioning we were quickly able to perceive that we at any rate could not examine him in classical literature as soon as we mentioned the name and nature of the work he went off at score and satisfied us amply that he was familiar at least with the title pages of editions we began indeed to fear whether he might not be too caustic a critic on our own friends performance dr is only an amateur himself said we deprecating in advance any such exercise of the red nosed mans too severe erudition we never get much beyond dilettanteism here said he as far as greek and latin are concerned what a terrible man he would have been could he have got upon the staff of the saturday review instead of going to the spotted dog we endeavoured to bring the interview to an end by telling him that we would consult the learned doctor from whom the manuscript had emanated and we hinted that a reference would be of course acceptable his impudence or perhaps we should rather call it his straightforward sincere audacity was unbounded mr grimes of the spotted dog knows me better than any one else said he we blew the breath out of our mouth with astonishment im not asking you to go to him to find out whether i know latin and greek said mr mackenzie you must find that out for yourself we assured him that we thought we had found that out but he can tell you that i wont pawn your manuscript the man was so grim and brave that he almost frightened us we hinted however that literary reference should be given the gentleman who paid him forty five shillings a week the manager in short of the penny dreadful might tell us something of him then he wrote for us a name on a scrap of paper and added to it an address in the close vicinity of fleet street at which we remembered to have seen the title of a periodical which we now knew to be a penny dreadful before he took his leave he made us a speech again standing up over us though we also were on our legs it was that bend in his neck combined with his natural height which gave him such an air of superiority in conversation he seemed to overshadow us and to have his own way with us because he was enabled to look down upon us there was a footstool on our hearth rug and we remember to have attempted to stand upon that in order that we might escape this supervision but we stumbled and had to kick it from us and something was added to our sense of inferiority by this little failure i dont expect much from this he said i never do expect much and i have misfortunes independent of my poverty which make it impossible that i should be other than a miserable wretch bad health we asked no nothing absolutely personal but never mind i must not trouble you with more of my history but if you can do this thing for me it may be the means of redeeming me from utter degradation we then assured him that we would do our best and he left us with a promise that he would call again on that day week the first step which we took on his behalf was one the very idea of which had at first almost moved us to ridicule we made enquiry respecting mr julius mackenzie of mr grimes the landlord of the spotted dog though mr grimes did keep the spotted dog he might be a man of sense and possibly of conscience at any rate he would tell us something or confirm our doubts by refusing to tell us anything we found mr grimes seated in a very neat little back parlour and were peculiarly taken by the appearance of a lady in a little cap and black silk gown whom we soon found to be mrs grimes had we ventured to employ our intellect in personifying for ourselves an imaginary mrs grimes as the landlady of a spotted dog public house in liquorpond street the figure we should have built up for ourselves would have been the very opposite of that which this lady presented to us she was slim and young and pretty and had pleasant little tricks of words in spite of occasional slips in her grammar which made us almost think that it might be our duty to come very often to the spotted dog to enquire about mr julius mackenzie mr grimes was a man about forty fully ten years the senior of his wife with a clear gray eye and a mouth and chin from which we surmised that he would be competent to clear the spotted dog of unruly visitors after twelve oclock whenever it might be his wish to do so we soon made known our request mr mackenzie had come to us for literary employment could they tell us anything about mr mackenzie hes as clever an author in the way of writing and that kind of thing as there is in all london said mrs grimes with energy perhaps her opinion ought not to have been taken for much but it had its weight we explained however that at the present moment we were specially anxious to know something of the gentlemans character and mode of life mr grimes whose manner to us was quite courteous sat silent thinking how to answer us his more impulsive and friendly wife was again ready with her assurance there aint an honester gentleman breathing and i say he is a gentleman though hes that poor he hasnt sometimes a shirt to his back i dont think hes ever very well off for shirts said mr grimes i wouldnt be slow to give him one of yours john only i know he wouldnt take it said mrs grimes well now look here sir weve that feeling for him that our young woman there would draw anything for him hed ask money or no money shed never venture to name money to him if he wanted a glass of anything hot or cold beer or spirits isnt that so john shes fool enough for anything as far as i know said mr grimes she aint no fool at all and id do the same if i was there and sod you john there is nothing mackenzied ask as he wouldnt give him said mrs grimes pointing with her thumb over her shoulder to her husband who was standing on the hearth rug that is in the way of drawing liquor and refreshments and such like but he never raised a glass to his lips in this house as he didnt pay for nor yet took a biscuit out of that basket hes a gentleman all over is mackenzie it was strong testimony but still we had not quite got at the bottom of the matter doesnt he raise a great many glasses to his lips we asked no he dont said mrs grimes only in reason hes had misfortunes said mr grimes indeed he has said the lady what i call the very troublesomest of troubles if you was troubled like him john whered you be i know where youd be said john hes got a bad wife sir the worst as ever was continued mrs grimes talk of drink there is nothing that woman wouldnt do for it shed pawn the very clothes off her childrens back in mid winter to get it shed rob the food out of her husbands mouth for a drop of gin as for herself she aint no womans notions left of keeping herself any way shed as soon be picked out of the gutter as not and as for words out of her mouth or clothes on her back she hasnt got sir not an item of a females feelings left about her mrs grimes had been very eloquent and had painted the troublesomest of all troubles with glowing words this was what the wretched man had come to by marrying a woman who was not a lady in order that he might escape the conventional thraldom of gentility but still the drunken wife was not all there was the evidence of his own nose against himself and the additional fact that he had acknowledged himself to have been formerly a drunkard i suppose he has drunk himself we said he has drunk in course said mrs grimes the world has been pretty rough with him sir said mr grimes but he dont drink now continued the lady at least if he do we dont see it as for her she wouldnt show herself inside our door it aint often that man and wife draws their milk from the same cow said mr grimes but mackenzie is here every day of his life said mrs grimes when hes got a sixpence to pay for it hell come in here and have a glass of beer and a bit of something to eat we does make him a little extra welcome and thats the truth of it we knows what he is and we knows what he was as for book learning sir it dont matter what language it is its all as one to him he knows em all round just as i know my catechism cant you say fairer than that for him polly asked mr grimes dont you talk of catechisms john nor yet of nothing else as a man ought to set his mind to unless it is keeping the spotted dog but as for mackenzie he knows off by heart whole books full of learning there was some furreners here as come from i dont know where it was they come from only it wasnt france nor yet germany and he talked to them just as though he hadnt been born in england at all i dont think there ever was such a man for knowing things hell go on with poetry out of his own head till you think it comes from him like web from a spider we could not help thinking of the wonderful companionship which there must have been in that parlour while the reduced man was spinning his web and mrs grimes with her needlework lying idle in her lap was sitting by listening with rapt admiration in passing by the spotted dog one would not imagine such a scene to have its existence within but then so many things do have existence of which we imagine nothing mr grimes ended the interview the fact is sir if you can give him employment better than what he has now youll be helping a man who has seen better days and who only wants help to see em again hes got it all there and mr grimes put his finger up to his head hes got it all here too said mrs grimes laying her hand upon her heart hereupon we took our leave suggesting to these excellent friends that if it should come to pass that we had further dealings with mr mackenzie we might perhaps trouble them again they assured us that we should always be welcome and mr grimes himself saw us to the door having made profuse offers of such good cheer as the house afforded we were upon the whole much taken with the spotted dog from thence we went to the office of the penny dreadful in the vicinity of fleet street as we walked thither we could not but think of mrs grimess words the troublesomest of troubles we acknowledged to ourselves that they were true words can there be any trouble more troublesome than that of suffering from the shame inflicted by a degraded wife we had just parted from mr grimes not indeed having seen very much of him in the course of our interview but little as we had seen we were sure that he was assisted in his position by a buoyant pride in that he called himself the master and owner and husband of mrs grimes in the very step with which he passed in and out of his own door you could see that there was nothing that he was ashamed of about his household when abroad he could talk of his missus with a conviction that the picture which the word would convey to all who heard him would redound to his honour but what must have been the reflections of julius mackenzie when his mind dwelt upon his wife we remembered the words of his letter i have a wife and four children which burden forbids me to free myself from all care with a bare bodkin as we thought of them and of the story which had been told to us at the spotted dog they lost that tone of rhodomontade with which they had invested themselves when we first read them a wife who is indifferent to being picked out of the gutter and who will pawn her childrens clothes for gin must be a trouble than which none can be more troublesome we did not find that we ingratiated ourselves with the people at the office of the periodical for which mr mackenzie worked and yet we endeavoured to do so assuming in our manner and tone something of the familiarity of a common pursuit after much delay we came upon a gentleman sitting in a dark cupboard who twisted round his stool to face us while he spoke to us we believe that he was the editor of more than one penny dreadful and that as many as a dozen serial novels were being issued to the world at the same time under his supervision oh said he so youre at that game are you we assured him that we were at no game at all but were simply influenced by a desire to assist a distressed scholar that be blowed said our brother mackenzies doing as well here as hell do anywhere hes a drunken blackguard when alls said and done so youre going to buy him up are you you wont keep him long and then hell have to starve we assured the gentleman that we had no desire to buy up mr mackenzie we explained our ideas as to the freedom of the literary profession in accordance with which mr mackenzie could not be wrong in applying to us for work and we especially deprecated any severity on our brothers part towards the man more especially begging that nothing might be decided as we were far from thinking it certain that we could provide mr mackenzie with any literary employment thats all right said our brother twisting back his stool he cant work for both of us thats all he has his bread here regular week after week and i dont suppose youll do as much as that for him then we went away shaking the dust off our feet and wondering much at the great development of literature which latter years have produced we had not even known of the existence of these papers and yet there they were going forth into the hands of hundreds of thousands of readers all of whom were being more or less instructed in their modes of life and manner of thinking by the stories which were thus brought before them but there might be truth in what our brother had said to us should mr mackenzie abandon his present engagement for the sake of the job which we proposed to put in his hands might he not thereby injure rather than improve his prospects we were acquainted with only one learned doctor desirous of having his manuscripts codified and indexed at his own expense as for writing for the periodical with which we were connected we knew enough of the business to be aware that mr mackenzies gifts of erudition would very probably not so much assist him in attempting such work as would his late training act against him a man might be able to read and even talk a dozen languages just as though he hadnt been born in england at all and yet not write the language with which we dealt after the fashion which suited our readers it might be that he would fly much above our heads and do work infinitely too big for us we did not regard our own heads as being very high but for such altitude as they held a certain class of writing was adapted the gentleman whom we had just left would require no doubt altogether another style it was probable that mr mackenzie had already fitted himself to his present audience and even were it not so we could not promise him forty five shillings a week or even that thirty shillings for which he asked there is nothing more dangerous than the attempt to befriend a man in middle life by transplanting him from one soil to another when mr mackenzie came to us again we endeavoured to explain all this to him we had in the meantime seen our friend the doctor whose beneficence of spirit in regard to the unfortunate man of letters was extreme he was charmed with our account of the man and saw with his minds eye the work for the performance of which he was pining perfected in a manner that would be a blessing to the scholars of all future ages he was at first anxious to ask julius mackenzie down to his rectory and even after we had explained to him that this would not at present be expedient was full of a dream of future friendship with a man who would be able to discuss the digamma with him who would have studied greek metres and have an opinion of his own as to porsons canon we were in possession of the manuscript and had our friends authority for handing it over to mr mackenzie he came to us according to appointment and his nose seemed to be redder than ever we thought that we discovered a discouraging flavour of spirits in his breath mrs grimes had declared that he drank only in reason but the ideas of the wife of a publican even though that wife were mrs grimes might be very different from our own as to what was reasonable in that matter and as we looked at him he seemed to be more rough more ragged almost more wretched than before it might be that in taking his part with my brother of the penny dreadful with the doctor and even with myself in thinking over his claims i had endowed him with higher qualities than i had been justified in giving to him as i considered him and his appearance i certainly could not assure myself that he looked like a man worthy to be trusted a policeman seeing him at a street corner would have had an eye upon him in a moment he rubbed himself together within his old coat as men do when they come out of gin shops his eye was as bright as before but we thought that his mouth was meaner and his nose redder we were almost disenchanted with him we said nothing to him at first about the spotted dog but suggested to him our fears that if he undertook work at our hands he would lose the much more permanent employment which he got from the gentleman whom we had seen in the cupboard we then explained to him that we could promise to him no continuation of employment the violence with which he cursed the gentleman who had sat in the cupboard appalled us and had we think some effect in bringing back to us that feeling of respect for him which we had almost lost it may be difficult to explain why we respected him because he cursed and swore horribly we do not like cursing and swearing and were any of our younger contributors to indulge themselves after that fashion in our presence we should at the very least frown upon them we did not frown upon julius mackenzie but stood up gazing into his face above us again feeling that the man was powerful perhaps we respected him because he was not in the least afraid of us he went on to assert that he cared not not a straw we will say for the gentleman in the cupboard he knew the gentleman in the cupboard very well and the gentleman in the cupboard knew him as long as he took his work to the gentleman in the cupboard the gentleman in the cupboard would be only too happy to purchase that work at the rate of sixpence for a page of manuscript containing two hundred and fifty words that was his rate of payment for prose fiction and at that rate he could earn forty five shillings a week he wasnt afraid of the gentleman in the cupboard he had had some words with the gentleman in the cupboard before now and they two understood each other very well he hinted moreover that there were other gentlemen in other cupboards but with none of them could he advance beyond forty five shillings a week for this he had to sit with his pen in his hand seven hours seven days a week and the very paper pens and ink came to fifteenpence out of the money he had struck for wages once and for a halcyon month or two had carried his point of sevenpence halfpenny a page but the gentlemen in the cupboards had told him that it could not be they too must live his matter was no doubt attractive but any price above sixpence a page unfitted it for their market all this mr julius mackenzie explained to us with much violence of expression when i named mrs grimes to him the tone of his voice was altered yes said he i thought theyd say a word for me theyre the best friends ive got now i dont know that you ought quite to believe her for i think shed perhaps tell a lie to do me a service we assured him that we did believe every word mrs grimes had said to us after much pausing over the matter we told him that we were empowered to trust him with our friends work and the manuscript was produced upon the table if he would undertake the work and perform it he should be paid s d for each of the three volumes as they were completed and we undertook moreover on our own responsibility to advance him money in small amounts through the hands of mrs grimes if he really settled himself to the task at first he was in ecstasies and as we explained to him the way in which the index should be brought out and the codification performed he turned over the pages rapidly and showed us that he understood at any rate the nature of the work to be done but when we came to details he was less happy in what workshop was this new work to be performed there was a moment in which we almost thought of telling him to do the work in our own room but we hesitated luckily remembering that his continual presence with us for two or three months would probably destroy us altogether it appeared that his present work was done sometimes at the spotted dog and sometimes at home in his lodgings he said not a word to us about his wife but we could understand that there would be periods in which to work at home would be impossible to him he did not pretend to deny that there might be danger on that score nor did he ask permission to take the entire manuscript at once away to his abode we knew that if he took part he must take the whole as the work could not be done in parts counter references would be needed my circumstances are bad very bad indeed he said we expressed the great trouble to which we should be subjected if any evil should happen to the manuscript i will give it up he said towering over us again and shaking his head i cannot expect that i should be trusted but we were determined that it should not be given up sooner than give the matter up we would make some arrangement by hiring a place in which he might work even though we were to pay ten shillings a week for a room for him out of the money the bargain would be a good one for him at last we determined that we would pay a second visit to the spotted dog and consult mrs grimes we felt that we should have a pleasure in arranging together with mrs grimes any scheme of benevolence on behalf of this unfortunate and remarkable man so we told him that we would think over the matter and send a letter to his address at the spotted dog which he should receive on the following morning he then gathered himself up rubbed himself together again inside his coat and took his departure as soon as he was gone we sat looking at the learned doctors manuscript and thinking of what we had done there lay the work of years by which our dear and venerable old friend expected that he would take rank among the great commentators of modern times we in truth did not anticipate for him all the glory to which he looked forward we feared that there might be disappointment hot discussion on verbal accuracies or on rules of metre are perhaps not so much in vogue now as they were a hundred years ago there might be disappointment and great sorrow but we could not with equanimity anticipate the prevention of this sorrow by the possible loss or destruction of the manuscript which had been entrusted to us the doctor himself had seemed to anticipate no such danger when we told him of mackenzies learning and misfortunes he was eager at once that the thing should be done merely stipulating that he should have an interview with mr mackenzie before he returned to his rectory that same day we went to the spotted dog and found mrs grimes alone mackenzie had been there immediately after leaving our room and had told her what had taken place she was full of the subject and anxious to give every possible assistance she confessed at once that the papers would not be safe in the rooms inhabited by mackenzie and his wife he pays five shillings a week she said for a wretched place round in cucumber court they are all huddled together any way and how he manages to do a thing at all there in the way of author work is a wonder to everybody sometimes he cant and then hell sit for hours together at the little table in our tap room we went into the tap room and saw the little table it was a wonder indeed that any one should be able to compose and write tales of imagination in a place so dreary dark and ill omened the little table was hardly more than a long slab or plank perhaps eighteen inches wide when we visited the place there were two brewers draymen seated there and three draggled wretched looking women the carters were eating enormous hunches of bread and bacon which they cut and put into their mouths slowly solemnly and in silence the three women were seated on a bench and when i saw them had no signs of festivity before them it must be presumed that they had paid for something or they would hardly have been allowed to sit there its empty now said mrs grimes taking no immediate notice of the men or of the women but sometimes hell sit writing in that corner when theres such a jabber of voices as you wouldnt hear a cannon go off over at reids and that thick with smoke youd amost cut it with a knife dont he peter the man whom she addressed endeavoured to prepare himself for answer by swallowing at the moment three square inches of bread and bacon which he had just put into his mouth he made an awful effort but failed and failing nodded his head three times they all know him here sir continued mrs grimes hell go on writing writing writing for hours together and nobodyll say nothing to him will they peter peter who was now half way through the work he had laid out for himself muttered some inarticulate grunt of assent we then went back to the snug little room inside the bar it was quite clear to me that the man could not manipulate the doctors manuscript of which he would have to spread a dozen sheets before him at the same time in the place i had just visited even could he have occupied the chamber alone the accommodation would not have been sufficient for the purpose it was equally clear that he could not be allowed to use mrs grimess snuggery how are we to get a place for him said i appealing to the lady he shall have a place she said ill go bail he shant lose the job for want of a workshop then she sat down and began to think it over i was just about to propose the hiring of some decent room in the neighbourhood when she made a suggestion which i acknowledge startled me ill have a big table put into my own bed room said she and he shall do it there there aint another hole or corner about the place asd suit and he can lay the gentlemans papers all about on the bed square and clean and orderly cant he now and i can see after em as he dont lose em cant i now by this time there had sprung up an intimacy between ourselves and mrs grimes which seemed to justify an expression of the doubt which i then threw on the propriety of such a disarrangement of her most private domestic affairs mr grimes will hardly approve of that we said oh john wont mind whatll it matter to john as long as mackenzie is out in time for him to go to bed we aint early birds morning or night thats true in our line folks cant be early but from ten to six theres the room and he shall have it come up and see sir so we followed mrs grimes up the narrow staircase to the marital bower it aint large but therell be room for the table and for him to sit at it wont there now it was a dark little room with one small window looking out under the low roof and facing the heavy high dead wall of the brewery opposite but it was clean and sweet and the furniture in it was all solid and good old fashioned and made of mahogany two or three of mrs grimess gowns were laid upon the bed and other portions of her dress were hung on pegs behind the doors the only untidy article in the room was a pair of johns trousers which he had failed to put out of sight she was not a bit abashed but took them up and folded them and patted them and laid them in the capacious wardrobe well have all these things away she said and then he can have all his papers out upon the bed just as he pleases we own that there was something in the proposed arrangement which dismayed us we also were married and what would our wife have said had we proposed that a contributor even a contributor not red nosed and seething with gin that any best disciplined contributor should be invited to write an article within the precincts of our sanctum we could not bring ourselves to believe that mr grimes would authorise the proposition there is something holy about the bed room of a married couple and there would be a special desecration in the continued presence of mr julius mackenzie we thought it better that we should explain something of all this to her do you know we said this seems to be hardly prudent why not prudent she asked up in your bed room you know mr grimes will be sure to dislike it what john not he i know what youre a thinking of mr she said but were different in our ways than what you are things to us are only just what they are we havent time nor yet money nor perhaps edication for seemings and thinkings as you have if you was travelling out amongst the wild injeans youd ask any one to have a bit in your bed room as soon as look at em if youd got a bit for em to eat were travelling among wild injeans all our lives and a bed room aint no more to us than any other room mackenzie shall come up here and ill have the table fixed for him just there by the window i hadnt another word to say to her and i could not keep myself from thinking for many an hour afterwards whether it may not be a good thing for men and for women also to believe that they are always travelling among wild indians when we went down mr grimes himself was in the little parlour he did not seem at all surprised at seeing his wife enter the room from above accompanied by a stranger she at once began her story and told the arrangement which she proposed which she did as i observed without any actual request for his sanction looking at mr grimess face i thought that he did not quite like it but he accepted it almost without a word scratching his head and raising his eyebrows you know john he could no more do it at home than he could fly said mrs grimes who said he could do it at home and he couldnt do it in the tap room could he if so there aint no other place and so thats settled john grimes again scratched his head and the matter was settled before we left the house mackenzie himself came in and was told in our presence of the accommodation which was to be prepared for him its just like you mrs grimes was all he said in the way of thanks then mrs grimes made her bargain with him somewhat sternly he should have the room for five hours a day ten till three or twelve till five but he must settle which and then stick to his hours and i wont have nothing up there in the way of drink said john grimes whos asking to have drink there said mackenzie youre not asking now but maybe you will i wont have it thats all that shall be all right john said mrs grimes nodding her head women are that soft in the way of judgment that theyll go and do amost anything good or bad when theyve got their feelings up such was the only rebuke which in our hearing mr grimes administered to his pretty wife mackenzie whispered something to the publican but grimes only shook his head we understood it all thoroughly he did not like the scheme but he would not contradict his wife in an act of real kindness we then made an appointment with the scholar for meeting our friend and his future patron at our rooms and took our leave of the spotted dog before we went however mrs grimes insisted on producing some cherry bounce as she called it which after sundry refusals on our part was brought in on a small round shining tray in a little bottle covered all over with gold sprigs with four tiny glasses similarly ornamented mrs grimes poured out the liquor using a very sparing hand when she came to the glass which was intended for herself we find it as a rule easier to talk with the grimeses of the world than to eat with them or to drink with them when the glass was handed to us we did not know whether or no we were expected to say something we waited however till mr grimes and mackenzie had been provided with their glasses proud to see you at the spotted dog mr said grimes that we are said mrs grimes smiling at us over her almost imperceptible drop of drink julius mackenzie just bobbed his head and swallowed the cordial at a gulp as a dog does a lump of meat leaving the impression on his friends around him that he has not got from it half the enjoyment which it might have given him had he been a little more patient in the process i could not but think that had mackenzie allowed the cherry bounce to trickle a little in his palate as i did myself it would have gratified him more than it did in being chucked down his throat with all the impetus which his elbow could give to the glass thats tidy tipple said mr grimes winking his eye we acknowledged that it was tidy my mother made it as used to keep the pig and magpie at colchester said mrs grimes in this way we learned a good deal of mrs grimess history her very earliest years had been passed among wild indians then came the interview between the doctor and mr mackenzie we must confess that we greatly feared the impression which our younger friend might make on the elder we had of course told the doctor of the red nose and he had accepted the information with a smile but he was a man who would feel the contamination of contact with a drunkard and who would shrink from an unpleasant association there are vices of which we habitually take altogether different views in accordance with the manner in which they are brought under our notice this vice of drunkenness is often a joke in the mouths of those to whom the thing itself is a horror even before our boys we talk of it as being rather funny though to see one of them funny himself would almost break our hearts the learned commentator had accepted our account of the red nose as though it were simply a part of the undeserved misery of the wretched man but should he find the wretched man to be actually redolent of gin his feelings might be changed the doctor was with us first and the volumes of the ms were displayed upon the table the compiler of them as he lifted here a page and there a page handled them with the gentleness of a lover they had been exquisitely arranged and were very fair the pagings and the margins and the chapterings and all the complementary paraphernalia of authorship were perfect a lifetime my friend just a lifetime the doctor had said to us speaking of his own work while we were waiting for the man to whose hands was to be entrusted the result of so much labour and scholarship we wished at that moment that we had never been called on to interfere in the matter mackenzie came and the introduction was made the doctor was a gentleman of the old school very neat in his attire dressed in perfect black with kneebreeches and black gaiters with a closely shorn chin and an exquisitely white cravat though he was in truth simply the rector of his parish his parish was one which entitled him to call himself a dean and he wore a clerical rosette on his hat he was a well made tall portly gentleman with whom to take the slightest liberty would have been impossible his well formed full face was singularly expressive of benevolence but there was in it too an air of command which created an involuntary respect he was a man whose means were ample and who could afford to keep two curates so that the appanages of a church dignitary did in some sort belong to him we doubt whether he really understood what work meant even when he spoke with so much pathos of the labour of his life but he was a man not at all exacting in regard to the work of others and who was anxious to make the world as smooth and rosy to those around him as it had been to himself he came forward paused a moment and then shook hands with mackenzie our work had been done and we remained in the background during the interview it was now for the doctor to satisfy himself with the scholarship and if he chose to take cognizance of the matter with the morals of his proposed assistant mackenzie himself was more subdued in his manner than he had been when talking with ourselves the doctor made a little speech standing at the table with one hand on one volume and the other on another he told of all his work with a mixture of modesty as to the thing done and self assertion as to his interest in doing it which was charming he acknowledged that the sum proposed for the aid which he required was inconsiderable but it had been fixed by the proposed publisher should mr mackenzie find that the labour was long he would willingly increase it then he commenced a conversation respecting the greek dramatists which had none of the air or tone of an examination but which still served the purpose of enabling mackenzie to show his scholarship in that respect there was no doubt that the ragged red nosed disreputable man who stood there longing for his job was the greater proficient of the two we never discovered that he had had access to books in later years but his memory of the old things seemed to be perfect when it was suggested that references would be required it seemed that he did know his way into the library of the british museum when i wasnt quite so shabby he said boldly i used to be there the doctor instantly produced a ten pound note and insisted that it should be taken in advance mackenzie hesitated and we suggested that it was premature but the doctor was firm if an old scholar maynt assist one younger than himself he said i dont know when one man may aid another and this is no alms it is simply a pledge for work to be done mackenzie took the money muttering something of an assurance that as far as his ability went the work should be done well it should certainly he said be done diligently when money had passed of course the thing was settled but in truth the bank note had been given not from judgment in settling the matter but from the generous impulse of the moment there was however no receding the doctor expressed by no hint a doubt as to the safety of his manuscript he was by far too fine a gentleman to give the man whom he employed pain in that direction if there were risk he would now run the risk and so the thing was settled we did not however give the manuscript on that occasion into mackenzies hands but took it down afterwards locked in an old despatch box of our own to the spotted dog and left the box with the key of it in the hands of mrs grimes again we went up into that ladys bed room and saw that the big table had been placed by the window for mackenzies accommodation it so nearly filled the room that as we observed john grimes could not get round at all to his side of the bed it was arranged that mackenzie was to begin on the morrow illustration illustration part ii the result during the next month we saw a good deal of mr julius mackenzie and made ourselves quite at home in mrs grimess bed room we went in and out of the spotted dog as if we had known that establishment all our lives and spent many a quarter of an hour with the hostess in her little parlour discussing the prospects of mr mackenzie and his family he had procured to himself decent if not exactly new garments out of the money so liberally provided by my learned friend the doctor and spent much of his time in the library of the british museum he certainly worked very hard for he did not altogether abandon his old engagement before the end of the first month the index of the first volume nearly completed had been sent down for the inspection of the doctor and had been returned with ample eulogium and some little criticism the criticisms mackenzie answered by letter with true scholarly spirit and the doctor was delighted nothing could be more pleasant to him than a correspondence prolonged almost indefinitely as to the respective merits of a or a or on the demand for a spondee or an iamb when he found that the work was really in industrious hands he ceased to be clamorous for early publication and gave us to understand privately that mr mackenzie was not to be limited to the sum named the matter of remuneration was indeed left very much to ourselves and mackenzie had certainly found a most efficient friend in the author whose works had been confided to his hands all this was very pleasant and mackenzie throughout that month worked very hard according to the statements made to me by mrs grimes he took no more gin than what was necessary for a hard working man as to the exact quantity of that cordial which she imagined to be beneficial and needful we made no close enquiry he certainly kept himself in a condition for work and so far all went on happily nevertheless there was a terrible skeleton in the cupboard or rather out of the cupboard for the skeleton could not be got to hide itself a certain portion of his prosperity reached the hands of his wife and she was behaving herself worse than ever the four children had been covered with decent garments under mrs grimess care and then mrs mackenzie had appeared at the spotted dog loudly demanding a new outfit for herself she came not only once but often and mr grimes was beginning to protest that he saw too much of the family we had become very intimate with mrs grimes and she did not hesitate to confide to us her fears lest john should cut up rough before the thing was completed you see she said it is against the house no doubt that woman coming nigh it but still she was firm and mackenzie was not disturbed in the possession of the bed room at last mrs mackenzie was provided with some articles of female attire and then on the very next day she and the four children were again stripped almost naked the wretched creature must have steeped herself in gin to the shoulders for in one day she made a sweep of everything she then came in a state of furious intoxication to the spotted dog and was removed by the police under the express order of the landlord we can hardly say which was the most surprising to us the loyalty of mrs grimes or the patience of john during that night as we were told two days afterwards by his wife he stormed with passion the papers she had locked up in order that he should not get at them and destroy them he swore that everything should be cleared out on the following morning but when the morning came he did not even say a word to mackenzie as the wretched downcast broken hearted creature passed up stairs to his work you see i knows him and how to deal with him said mrs grimes speaking of her husband there aint another like himself nowheres hes that good a softer hearteder man there aint in the public line he can speak dreadful when his dander is up and can look oh laws he just can look at you but he could no more put his hands upon a woman in the way of hurting no more than be an archbishop where could be the man thought we to ourselves as this was said to us who could have put a hand in the way of hurting upon mrs grimes on that occasion to the best of our belief the policeman contented himself with depositing mrs mackenzie at her own lodgings on the next day she was picked up drunk in the street and carried away to the lock up house at the very moment in which the story was being told to us by mrs grimes mackenzie had gone to the police office to pay the fine and to bring his wife home we asked with dismay and surprise why he should interfere to rescue her why he did not leave her in custody as long as the police would keep her whod there be to look after the children asked mrs grimes as though she were offended at our suggestion then she went on to explain that in such a household as that of poor mackenzie the wife is absolutely a necessity even though she be an habitual drunkard intolerable as she was her services were necessary to him a husband as drinks is bad said mrs grimes with something we thought of an apologetic tone for the vice upon which her own prosperity was partly built but when a woman takes to it its the devil we thought that she was right as we pictured to ourselves that man of letters satisfying the magistrates demand for his wifes misconduct and taking the degraded half naked creature once more home to his children we saw him about twelve oclock on that day and he had then too evidently been endeavouring to support his misery by the free use of alcohol we did not speak of it down in the parlour but even mrs grimes we think would have admitted that he had taken more than was good for him he was sitting up in the bed room with his head hanging upon his hand with a swarm of our learned friends papers spread on the table before him mrs grimes when he entered the house had gone up stairs to give them out to him but he had made no attempt to settle himself to his work this kind of thing must come to an end he said to us with a thick husky voice we muttered something to him as to the need there was that he should exert a manly courage in his troubles manly he said well yes manly a man should be a man of course there are some things which a man cant bear ive borne more than enough and ill have an end of it we shall never forget that scene after awhile he got up and became almost violent talk of bearing who had borne half as much as he there were things a man should not bear as for manliness he believed that the truly manly thing would be to put an end to the lives of his wife his children and himself at one swoop of course the judgment of a mealy mouthed world would be against him but what would that matter to him when he and they had vanished out of this miserable place into the infinite realms of nothingness was he fit to live or were they was there any chance for his children but that of becoming thieves and prostitutes and for that poor wretch of a woman from out of whose bosom even her human instincts had been washed by gin would not death to her be indeed a charity there was but one drawback to all this when he should have destroyed them how would it be with him if he should afterwards fail to make sure work with his own life in such case it was not hanging that he would fear but the self reproach that would come upon him in that he had succeeded in sending others out of their misery but had flinched when his own turn had come though he was drunk when he said these horrid things or so nearly drunk that he could not perfect the articulation of his words still there was a marvellous eloquence with him when we attempted to answer and told him of that canon which had been set against self slaughter he laughed us to scorn there was something terrible to us in the audacity of the arguments which he used when he asserted for himself the right to shuffle off from his shoulders a burden which they had not been made broad enough to bear there was an intensity and a thorough hopelessness of suffering in his case an openness of acknowledged degradation which robbed us for the time of all that power which the respectable ones of the earth have over the disreputable when we came upon him with our wise saws our wisdom was shattered instantly and flung back upon us in fragments what promise could we dare to hold out to him that further patience would produce any result that could be beneficial what further harm could any such doing on his part bring upon him did we think that were he brought out to stand at the gallows foot with the knowledge that ten minutes would usher him into what folks called eternity his sense of suffering would be as great as it had been when he conducted that woman out of court and along the streets to his home amidst the jeering congratulations of his neighbours when you have fallen so low said he that you can fall no lower the ordinary trammels of the world cease to bind you though his words were knocked against each other with the dulled utterances of intoxication his intellect was terribly clear and his scorn for himself and for the world that had so treated him was irrepressible we must have been over an hour with him up there in the bed room and even then we did not leave him as it was manifest that he could do no work on that day we collected the papers together and proposed that he should take a walk with us he was patient as we shovelled together the doctors pages and did not object to our suggestion we found it necessary to call up mrs grimes to assist us in putting away the opus magnum and were astonished to find how much she had come to know about the work added to the doctors manuscript there were now the pages of mackenzies indexes and there were other pages of reference for use in making future indexes as to all of which mrs grimes seemed to be quite at home we have no doubt that she was familiar with the names of greek tragedians and could have pointed out to us in print the performances of the chorus a little fresh airll do you a deal of good mr mackenzie she said to the unfortunate man only take a biscuit in your pocket we got him out to the street but he angrily refused to take the biscuit which she endeavoured to force into his hands that was a memorable walk turning from the end of liquorpond street up grays inn lane towards holborn we at once came upon the entrance into a miserable court there said he it is down there that i live she is sleeping it off now and the children are hanging about her wondering whether mother has got money to have another go at it when she rises id take you down to see it all only itd sicken you we did not offer to go down the court abstaining rather for his sake than for our own the look of the place was as of a spot squalid fever stricken and utterly degraded and this man who was our companion had been born and bred a gentleman had been nourished with that soft and gentle care which comes of wealth and love combined had received the education which the country gives to her most favoured sons and had taken such advantage of that education as is seldom taken by any of those favoured ones and cucumber court with a drunken wife and four half clothed half starved children was the condition to which he had brought himself the world knows nothing higher nor brighter than had been his outset in life nothing lower nor more debased than the result and yet he was one whose time and intellect had been employed upon the pursuit of knowledge who even up to this day had high ideas of what should be a mans career who worked very hard and had always worked who as far as we knew had struck upon no rocks in the pursuit of mere pleasure it had all come to him from that idea of his youth that it would be good for him to take refuge from the conventional thraldom of so called gentlemen amidst the liberty of the lower orders his life as he had himself owned had indeed been a mistake we passed on from the court and crossing the road went through the squares of grays inn down chancery lane through the little iron gate into lincolns inn round through the old square than which we know no place in london more conducive to suicide and the new square which has a gloom of its own not so potent and savouring only of madness till at last we found ourselves in the temple gardens i do not know why we had thus clung to the purlieus of the law except it was that he was telling us how in his early days when he had been sent away from cambridge as on this occasion he acknowledged to us for an attempt to pull the tutors nose in revenge for a supposed insult he had intended to push his fortunes as a barrister he pointed up to a certain window in a dark corner of that suicidal old court and told us that for one year he had there sat at the feet of a great gamaliel in chancery and had worked with all his energies of course we asked him why he had left a prospect so alluring though his answers to us were not quite explicit we think that he did not attempt to conceal the truth he learned to drink and that gamaliel took upon himself to rebuke the failing and by the end of that year he had quarrelled irreconcilably with his family there had been great wrath at home when he was sent from cambridge greater wrath when he expressed his opinion upon certain questions of religious faith and wrath to the final severance of all family relations when he told the chosen gamaliel that he should get drunk as often as he pleased after that he had taken refuge among the lower orders and his life such as it was had come of it in fleet street as we came out of the temple we turned into an eating house and had some food by this time the exercise and the air had carried off the fumes of the liquor which he had taken and i knew that it would be well that he should eat we had a mutton chop and a hot potato and a pint of beer each and sat down to table for the first and last time as mutual friends it was odd to see how in his converse with us on that day he seemed to possess a double identity though the hopeless misery of his condition was always present to him was constantly on his tongue yet he could talk about his own career and his own character as though they belonged to a third person he could even laugh at the wretched mistake he had made in life and speculate as to its consequences for himself he was well aware that death was the only release that he could expect we did not dare to tell him that if his wife should die then things might be better with him we could only suggest to him that work itself if he would do honest work would console him for many sufferings you dont know the filth of it he said to us ah dear how well we remember the terrible word and the gesture with which he pronounced it and the gleam of his eyes as he said it his manner to us on this occasion was completely changed and we had a gratification in feeling that a sense had come back upon him of his old associations i remember this room so well he said when i used to have friends and money and indeed the room was one which has been made memorable by genius i did not think ever to have found myself here again we observed however that he could not eat the food that was placed before him a morsel or two of the meat he swallowed and struggled to eat the crust of his bread but he could not make a clean plate of it as we did regretting that the nature of chops did not allow of ampler dimensions his beer was quickly finished and we suggested to him a second tankard with a queer half abashed twinkle of the eye he accepted our offer and then the second pint disappeared also we had our doubts on the subject but at last decided against any further offer had he chosen to call for it he must have had a third but he did not call for it we left him at the door of the tavern and he then promised that in spite of all that he had suffered and all that he had said he would make another effort to complete the doctors work whether i go or stay he said id like to earn the money that ive spent there was something terrible in that idea of his going whither was he to go the doctor heard nothing of the misfortune of these three or four inauspicious days and the work was again going on prosperously when he came up again to london at the end of the second month he told us something of his banker and something of his lawyer and murmured a word or two as to a new curate whom he needed but we knew that he had come up to london because he could not bear a longer absence from the great object of his affections he could not endure to be thus parted from his manuscript and was again childishly anxious that a portion of it should be in the printers hands at sixty five sir he said to us a man has no time to dally with his work he had been dallying with his work all his life and we sincerely believed that it would be well with him if he could be contented to dally with it to the end if all that mackenzie said of it was true the doctors erudition was not equalled by his originality or by his judgment of that question however we could take no cognizance he was bent upon publishing and as he was willing and able to pay for his whim and was his own master nothing that we could do would keep him out of the printers hands he was desirous of seeing mackenzie and was anxious even to see him once at his work of course he could meet his assistant in our editorial room and all the papers could easily be brought backwards and forwards in the old despatch box but in the interest of all parties we hesitated as to taking our revered and reverend friend to the spotted dog though we had told him that his work was being done at a public house we thought that his mind had conceived the idea of some modest inn and that he would be shocked at being introduced to a place which he would regard simply as a gin shop mrs grimes or if not mrs grimes then mr grimes might object to another visitor to their bed room and mackenzie himself would be thrown out of gear by the appearance of those clerical gaiters upon the humble scene of his labours we therefore gave him such reasons as were available for submitting at any rate for the present to having the papers brought up to him at our room and we ourselves went down to the spotted dog to make an appointment with mackenzie for the following day we had last seen him about a week before and then the task was progressing well he had told us that another fortnight would finish it we had enquired also of mrs grimes about the mans wife all she could tell us was that the woman had not again troubled them at the spotted dog she expressed her belief however that the drunkard had been more than once in the hands of the police since the day on which mackenzie had walked with us through the squares of the inns of court it was late when we reached the public house on the occasion to which we now allude and the evening was dark and rainy it was then the end of january and it might have been about six oclock we knew that we should not find mackenzie at the public house but it was probable that mrs grimes could send for him or at least could make the appointment for us we went into the little parlour where she was seated with her husband and we could immediately see from the countenance of both of them that something was amiss we began by telling mrs grimes that the doctor had come to town mackenzie aint here sir said mrs grimes and we almost thought that the very tone of her voice was altered we explained that we had not expected to find him at that hour and asked if she could send for him she only shook her head grimes was standing with his back to the fire and his hands in his trousers pockets up to this moment he had not spoken a word we asked if the man was drunk she again shook her head could she bid him to come to us to morrow and bring the box and the papers with him again she shook her head ive told her that i wont have no more of it said grimes nor yet i wont he was drunk this morning as drunk as an owl he was sober john as you are when he came for the papers this afternoon at two oclock so the box and the papers had all been taken away and she was here yesterday rampaging about the place without as much clothes on as would cover her nakedness said mr grimes i wont have no more of it ive done for that man what his own flesh and blood wouldnt do i know that and i wont have no more of it mary anne youll have that table cleared out after breakfast to morrow when a man to whom his wife is usually polly addresses her as mary anne then it may be surmised that that man is in earnest we knew that he was in earnest and she knew it also he wasnt drunk john no nor yet in liquor when he come and took away that box this afternoon we understood this reiterated assertion it was in some sort excusing to us her own breach of trust in having allowed the manuscript to be withdrawn from her own charge or was assuring us that at the worst she had not been guilty of the impropriety of allowing the man to take it away when he was unfit to have it in his charge as for blaming her who could have thought of it had mackenzie at any time chosen to pass down stairs with the box in his hands it was not to be expected that she should stop him violently and now that he had done so we could not blame her but we felt that a great weight had fallen upon our own hearts if evil should come to the manuscript would not the doctors wrath fall upon us with a crushing weight something must be done at once and we suggested that it would be well that somebody should go round to cucumber court id go as soon as look said mrs grimes but he wont let me you dont stir a foot out of this to night not that way said mr grimes who wants to stir said mrs grimes we felt that there was something more to be told than we had yet heard and a great fear fell upon us the womans manner to us was altered and we were sure that this had come not from altered feelings on her part but from circumstances which had frightened her it was not her husband that she feared but the truth of something that her husband had said to her if there is anything more to tell for gods sake tell it we said addressing ourselves rather to the man than to the woman then grimes did tell us his story on the previous evening mackenzie had received three or four sovereigns from mrs grimes being of course a portion of the doctors payments and early on that morning all liquorpond street had been in a state of excitement with the drunken fury of mackenzies wife she had found her way into the spotted dog and was being actually extruded by the strength of grimes himself of grimes who had been brought down half dressed from his bed room by the row when mackenzie himself equally drunk appeared upon the scene no john not equally drunk said mrs grimes bother exclaimed her husband going on with his story the man had struggled to take the woman by the arm and the two had fallen and rolled in the street together i was looking out of the window and it was awful to see said mrs grimes we felt that it was awful to hear a man and such a man rolling in the gutter with a drunken woman himself drunk and that woman his wife there aint to be no more of it at the spotted dog thats all said john grimes as he finished his part of the story then at last mrs grimes became voluble all this had occurred before nine in the morning the woman must have been at it all night she said so must the man said john anyways he came back about dinner and he was sober then i asked him not to go up and offered to make him a cup of tea it was just as youd gone out after dinner john he wont have no more tea here said john and he didnt have any then he wouldnt he said have any tea but went up stairs what was i to do i couldnt tell him as he shouldnt well during the row in the morning john had said something as to mackenzie not coming about the premises any more of course i did said grimes he was a little cut then no doubt continued the lady and i didnt think as he would have noticed what john had said i mean it to be noticed now he had noticed it then sir though he wasnt just as he should be at that hour of the morning well what does he do he goes up stairs and packs up all the papers at once leastways thats as i suppose they aint there now you can go and look if you please sir well when he came down whether i was in the kitchen though it isnt often as my eyes is off the bar or in the tap room or busy drawing which i do do sometimes sir when there are a many calling for liquor i cant say but if i aint never to stand upright again i didnt see him pass out with the box but miss wilcox did you can ask her miss wilcox was the young lady in the bar whom we did not think ourselves called upon to examine feeling no doubt whatever as to the fact of the box having been taken away by mackenzie in all this mrs grimes seemed to defend herself as though some serious charge was to be brought against her whereas all that she had done had been done out of pure charity and in exercising her charity towards mackenzie she had shown an almost exaggerated kindness towards ourselves if theres anything wrong it isnt your fault we said nor yet mine said john grimes no indeed we replied it aint none of our faults continued he only this you cant wash a blackamoor white nor it aint no use trying he dont come here any more thats all a man in drink we dont mind we has to put up with it and they aint that tarnation desperate as is a woman as long as a man can keep his legs hell try to steady hisself but there is women who when theyve liquor gets a fury for rampaging there aint a many as can beat this one sir shes that strong it took four of us to hold her though she cant hardly do a stroke of work shes that weak when shes sober we had now heard the whole story and while hearing it had determined that it was our duty to go round into cucumber court and seek the manuscript and the box we were unwilling to pry into the wretchedness of the mans home but something was due to the doctor and we had to make that appointment for the morrow if it were still possible that such an appointment should be kept we asked for the number of the house remembering well the entrance into the court then there was a whisper between john and his wife and the husband offered to accompany us its a roughish place he said but they know me hed better go along with you said mrs grimes we of course were glad of such companionship and glad also to find that the landlord upon whom we had inflicted so much trouble was still sufficiently our friend to take this trouble on our behalf its a dreary place enough said grimes as he led us up the narrow archway indeed it was a dreary place the court spread itself a little in breadth but very little when the passage was passed and there were houses on each side of it there was neither gutter nor as far as we saw drain but the broken flags were slippery with moist mud and here and there strewed about between the houses there were the remains of cabbages and turnip tops the place swarmed with children over whom one ghastly gas lamp at the end of the court threw a flickering and uncertain light there was a clamour of scolding voices to which it seemed that no heed was paid and there was a smell of damp rotting nastiness amidst which it seemed to us to be almost impossible that life should be continued grimes led the way without further speech to the middle house on the left hand of the court and asked a man who was sitting on the low threshold of the door whether mackenzie was within so that be you muster grimes be it said the man without stirring yes hes there i guess but theyve been and took her then we passed on into the house no matter about that said the man as we apologised for kicking him in our passage he had not moved and it had been impossible to enter without kicking him it seemed that mackenzie held the two rooms on the ground floor and we entered them at once there was no light but we could see the glimmer of a fire in the grate and presently we became aware of the presence of children grimes asked after mackenzie and a girls voice told us that he was in the inner room the publican then demanded a light and the girl with some hesitation lit the end of a farthing candle which was fixed in a small bottle we endeavoured to look round the room by the glimmer which this afforded but could see nothing but the presence of four children three of whom seemed to be seated in apathy on the floor grimes taking the candle in his hand passed at once into the other room and we followed him holding the bottle something over his head he contrived to throw a gleam of light upon one of the two beds with which the room was fitted and there we saw the body of julius mackenzie stretched in the torpor of dead intoxication his head lay against the wall his body was across the bed and his feet dangled on to the floor he still wore his dirty boots and his clothes as he had worn them in the morning no sight so piteous so wretched and at the same time so eloquent had we ever seen before his eyes were closed and the light of his face was therefore quenched his mouth was open and the slaver had fallen upon his beard his dark clotted hair had been pulled over his face by the unconscious movement of his hands there came from him a stertorous sound of breathing as though he were being choked by the attitude in which he lay and even in his drunkenness there was an uneasy twitching as of pain about his face and there sat and had been sitting for hours past the four children in the other room knowing the condition of the parent whom they most respected but not even endeavouring to do anything for his comfort what could they do they knew by long training and thorough experience that a fit of drunkenness had to be got out of by sleep to them there was nothing shocking in it it was but a periodical misfortune shell have to own hes been and done it now said grimes looking down upon the man and alluding to his wifes good natured obstinacy he handed the candle to us and with a mixture of tenderness and roughness of which the roughness was only in the manner and the tenderness was real he raised mackenzies head and placed it on the bolster and lifted the mans legs on to the bed then he took off the mans boots and the old silk handkerchief from the neck and pulled the trousers straight and arranged the folds of the coat it was almost as though he were laying out one that was dead the eldest girl was now standing by us and grimes asked her how long her father had been in that condition jack hoggart brought him in just afore it was dark said the girl then it was explained to us that jack hoggart was the man whom we had seen sitting on the door step and your mother asked grimes the perlice took her afore dinner and you children what have you had to eat in answer to this the girl only shook her head grimes took no immediate notice of this but called the drunken man by his name and shook his shoulder and looked round to a broken ewer which stood on the little table for water to dash upon him but there was no water in the jug he called again and repeated the shaking and at last mackenzie opened his eyes and in a dull half conscious manner looked up at us come my man said grimes shake this off and have done with it hadnt you better try to get up we asked there was a faint attempt at rising then a smile a smile which was terrible to witness so sad was all which it said then a look of utter abject misery coming as we thought from a momentary remembrance of his degradation and after that he sank back in the dull brutal painless death like apathy of absolute unconsciousness itll be morning afore hell move said the girl shes about right said grimes hes got it too heavy for us to do anything but just leave him well take a look for the box and the papers and the man upon whom we were looking down had been born a gentleman and was a finished scholar one so well educated so ripe in literary acquirement that we knew few whom we could call his equal judging of the matter by the light of our reason we cannot say that the horror of the scene should have been enhanced to us by these recollections had the man been a shoemaker or a coalheaver there would have been enough of tragedy in it to make an angel weep that sight of the child standing by the bedside of her drunken father while the other parent was away in custody and in no degree shocked at what she saw because the thing was so common to her but the thought of what the man had been of what he was of what he might have been and the steps by which he had brought himself to the foul degradation which we witnessed filled us with a dismay which we should hardly have felt had the gifts which he had polluted and the intellect which he had wasted been less capable of noble uses our purpose in coming to the court was to rescue the doctors papers from danger and we turned to accompany grimes into the other room as we did so the publican asked the girl if she knew anything of a black box which her father had taken away from the spotted dog the box is here said the girl and the papers asked grimes thereupon the girl shook her head and we both hurried into the outer room i hardly know who first discovered the sight which we encountered or whether it was shown to us by the child the whole fire place was strewn with half burnt sheets of manuscript there were scraps of pages of which almost the whole had been destroyed others which were hardly more than scorched and heaps of paper ashes all lying tumbled together about the fender we went down on our knees to examine them thinking at the moment that the poor creature might in his despair have burned his own work and have spared that of the doctor but it was not so we found scores of charred pages of the doctors elaborate handwriting by this time grimes had found the open box and we perceived that the sheets remaining in it were tumbled and huddled together in absolute confusion there were pages of the various volumes mixed with those which mackenzie himself had written and they were all crushed and rolled and twisted as though they had been thrust thither as waste paper out of the way twas mother as done it said the girl and we put em back again when the perlice took her there was nothing more to learn nothing more by the hearing which any useful clue could be obtained what had been the exact course of the scenes which had been enacted there that morning it little booted us to enquire it was enough and more than enough that we knew that the mischief had been done we went down on our knees before the fire and rescued from the ashes with our hands every fragment of manuscript that we could find then we put the mass altogether in the box and gazed upon the wretched remnants almost in tears you had better go and get a bit of someat to eat said grimes handing a coin to the elder girl its hard on them to starve cause their fathers drunk sir then he took the closed box in his hand and we followed him out into the street ill send or step up to look after him to morrow said grimes as he put us and the box into a cab we little thought when we made to the drunkard that foolish request to arise that we should never speak to him again as we returned to our office in the cab that we might deposit the box there ready for the following day our mind was chiefly occupied in thinking over the undeserved grievances which had fallen upon ourselves we had been moved by the charitable desire to do services to two different persons to the learned doctor and to the red nosed drunkard and this had come of it there had been nothing for us to gain by assisting either the one or the other we had taken infinite trouble attempting to bring together two men who wanted each others services working hard in sheer benevolence and what had been the result we had spent half an hour on our knees in the undignified and almost disreputable work of raking among mrs mackenzies cinders and now we had to face the anger the dismay the reproach and worse than all the agony of the doctor as to mackenzie we asserted to ourselves again and again that nothing further could be done for him he had made his bed and he must lie upon it but oh why why had we attempted to meddle with a being so degraded we got out of the cab at our office door thinking of the doctors countenance as we should see it on the morrow our heart sank within us and we asked ourselves if it was so bad with us now how it would be with us when we returned to the place on the following morning but on the following morning we did return no doubt each individual reader to whom we address ourselves has at some period felt that indescribable load of personal short lived care which causes the heart to sink down into the boots it is not great grief that does it nor is it excessive fear but the unpleasant operation comes from the mixture of the two it is the anticipation of some imperfectly understood evil that does it some evil out of which there might perhaps be an escape if we could only see the way in this case we saw no way out of it the doctor was to be with us at one oclock and he would come with smiles expecting to meet his learned colleague how should we break it to the doctor we might indeed send to him putting off the meeting but the advantage coming from that would be slight if any we must see the injured grecian sooner or later and we had resolved much as we feared that the evil hour should not be postponed we spent an hour that morning in arranging the fragments of the first volume about a third had been destroyed of the second nearly every page had been either burned or mutilated of the third but little had been injured mackenzies own work had fared better than the doctors but there was no comfort in that after what had passed i thought it quite improbable that the doctor would make any use of mackenzies work so much of the manuscript as could still be placed in continuous pages we laid out upon the table volume by volume that in the middle sinking down from its original goodly bulk almost to the dimensions of a poor sermon and the half burned bits we left in the box then we sat ourselves down at our accustomed table and pretended to try to work our ears were very sharp and we heard the doctors step upon our stairs within a minute or two of the appointed time our heart went to the very toes of our boots we shuffled in our chair rose from it and sat down again and were conscious that we were not equal to the occasion hitherto we had after some mild literary form patronised the doctor as a man of letters in town will patronise his literary friend from the country but we now feared him as a truant school boy fears his master and yet it was so necessary that we should wear some air of self assurance in a moment he was with us wearing that bland smile which we knew so well and which at the present moment almost overpowered us we had been sure that he would wear that smile and had especially feared it ah said he grasping us by the hand i thought i should have been late i see that our friend is not here yet doctor we replied a great misfortune has happened a great misfortune mr mackenzie is not dead no he is not dead perhaps it would have been better that he had died long since he has destroyed your manuscript the doctors face fell and his hands at the same time and he stood looking at us i need not tell you doctor what my feelings are and how great my remorse destroyed it then we took him by the hand and led him to the table he turned first upon the appetising and comparatively uninjured third volume and seemed to think that we had hoaxed him this is not destroyed he said with a smile but before i could explain anything his hands were among the fragments in the box as i am a living man they have burned it he exclaimed i i i then he turned from us and walked twice the length of the room backwards and forwards while we stood still patiently waiting the explosion of his wrath my friend he said when his walk was over a great man underwent the same sorrow newtons manuscript was burned i will take it home with me and we will say no more about it i never thought very much of the doctor as a divine but i hold him to have been as good a christian as i ever met but that plan of his of saying no more about it could not quite be carried out i was endeavouring to explain to him as i thought it necessary to do the circumstances of the case and he was protesting his indifference to any such details when there came a knock at the door and the boy who waited on us below ushered mrs grimes into the room as the reader is aware we had during the last two months become very intimate with the landlady of the spotted dog but we had never hitherto had the pleasure of seeing her outside her own house oh mr she began and then she paused seeing the doctor we thought it expedient that there should be some introduction mrs grimes we said this is the gentleman whose invaluable manuscript has been destroyed by that unfortunate drunkard oh then youre the doctor sir the doctor bowed and smiled his heart must have been very heavy but he bowed politely and smiled sweetly oh dear she said i dont know how to tell you to tell us what asked the doctor what has happened since we demanded the woman stood shaking before us and then sank into a chair then arose to us at the moment some idea that the drunken woman in her mad rage had done some great damage to the spotted dog had set fire to the house or injured mr grimes personally or perhaps run a muck amidst the jugs and pitchers window glass and gas lights something had been done which would give the grimeses a pecuniary claim on me or on the doctor and the woman had been sent hither to make the first protest oh when should i see the last of the results of my imprudence in having attempted to befriend such a one as julius mackenzie if you have anything to tell you had better tell it we said gravely hes been and not destroyed himself asked the doctor oh yes sir he have indeed from ear to ear and is now a lying at the spotted dog and so after all that was the end of julius mackenzie we need hardly say that our feelings which up to that moment had been very hostile to the man underwent a sudden revulsion poor overburdened struggling ill used abandoned creature the world had been hard upon him with a severity which almost induced one to make complaint against omnipotence the poor wretch had been willing to work had been industrious in his calling had had capacity for work and he had also struggled gallantly against his evil fate had recognised and endeavoured to perform his duty to his children and to the miserable woman who had brought him to his ruin and that sin of drunkenness had seemed to us to be in him rather the reflex of her vice than the result of his own vicious tendencies still it might be doubtful whether she had not learned the vice from him they had both in truth been drunkards as long as they had been known in the neighbourhood of the spotted dog but it was stated by all who had known them there that he was never seen to be drunk unless when she had disgraced him by the public exposure of her own abomination such as he was he had now come to his end this was the upshot of his loud claims for liberty from his youth upwards liberty as against his father and family liberty as against his college tutor liberty as against all pastors masters and instructors liberty as against the conventional thraldom of the world he was now lying a wretched corpse at the spotted dog with his throat cut from ear to ear till the coroners jury should have decided whether or not they would call him a suicide mrs grimes had come to tell us that the coroner was to be at the spotted dog at four oclock and to say that her husband hoped that we would be present we had seen mackenzie so lately and had so much to do with the employment of the last days of his life that we could not refuse this request though it came accompanied by no legal summons then mrs grimes again became voluble and poured out to us her biography of mackenzie as far as she knew it he had been married to the woman ten years and certainly had been a drunkard before he married her as for her shed been well nigh suckled on gin said mrs grimes though he didnt know it poor fellow whether this was true or not she had certainly taken to drink soon after her marriage and then his life had been passed in alternate fits of despondency and of desperate efforts to improve his own condition and that of his children mrs grimes declared to us that when the fit came on them when the woman had begun and the man had followed they would expend upon drink in two days what would have kept the family for a fortnight they say as how it was nothing for them to swallow forty shillings worth of gin in forty eight hours the doctor held up his hands in horror and it didnt none of it come our way said mrs grimes indeed john wouldnt let us serve it for em she sat there for half an hour and during the whole time she was telling us of the mans life but the reader will already have heard more than enough of it by what immediate demon the woman had been instigated to burn the husbands work almost immediately on its production within her own home we never heard doubtless there had been some terrible scene in which the mans sufferings must have been carried almost beyond endurance and he had feelings sir he had said mrs grimes he knew as a woman should be decent and a mans wife especial im sure we pitied him so john and i that we could have cried over him john would say a hard word to him at times but hed have walked round london to do him a good turn john aint to say edicated hisself but he do respect learning when she had told us all mrs grimes went and we were left alone with the doctor he at once consented to accompany us to the spotted dog and we spent the hour that still remained to us in discussing the fate of the unfortunate man we doubt whether an allusion was made during the time to the burned manuscript if so it was certainly not made by the doctor himself the tragedy which had occurred in connection with it had made him feel it to be unfitting even to mention his own loss that such a one should have gone to his account in such a manner without hope without belief and without fear as burley said to bothwell and bothwell boasted to burley that was the theme of the doctors discourse the mercy of god is infinite he said bowing his head with closed eyes and folded hands to threaten while the life is in the man is human to believe in the execution of those threats when the life has passed away is almost beyond the power of humanity at the hour fixed we were at the spotted dog and found there a crowd assembled the coroner was already seated in mrs grimess little parlour and the body as we were told had been laid out in the tap room the inquest was soon over the fact that he had destroyed himself in the low state of physical suffering and mental despondency which followed his intoxication was not doubted at the very time that he was doing it his wife was being taken from the lock up house to the police office in the police van he was not penniless for he had sent the children out with money for their breakfasts giving special caution as to the youngest a little toddling thing of three years old and then he had done it the eldest girl returning to the house had found him lying dead upon the floor we were called upon for our evidence and went into the tap room accompanied by the doctor alas the very table which had been dragged up stairs into the landladys bed room with the charitable object of assisting mackenzie in his work the table at which we had sat with him conning the doctors pages had now been dragged down again and was used for another purpose we had little to say as to the matter except that we had known the man to be industrious and capable and that we had alas seen him utterly prostrated by drink on the evening before his death the saddest sight of all on this occasion was the appearance of mackenzies wife whom we had never before seen she had been brought there by a policeman but whether she was still in custody we did not know she had been dressed either by the decency of the police or by the care of her neighbours in an old black gown which was a world too large and too long for her and on her head there was a black bonnet which nearly enveloped her she was a small woman and as far as we could judge from the glance we got of her face pale and worn and wan she had not such outward marks of a drunkards career as those which poor mackenzie always carried with him she was taken up to the coroner and what answers she gave to him were spoken in so low a voice that they did not reach us the policeman with whom we spoke told us that she did not feel it much that she was callous now and beyond the power of mental suffering shes frightened just this minute sir but it isnt more than that said the policeman we gave one glance along the table at the burden which it bore but we saw nothing beyond the outward lines of that which had so lately been the figure of a man we should have liked to see the countenance once more the morbid curiosity to see such horrid sights is strong with most of us but we did not wish to be thought to wish to see it especially by our friend the doctor and we abstained from pushing our way to the head of the table the doctor himself remained quiescent in the corner of the room the farthest from the spectacle when the matter was submitted to them the jury lost not a moment in declaring their verdict they said that the man had destroyed himself while suffering under temporary insanity produced by intoxication and that was the end of julius mackenzie the scholar on the following day the doctor returned to the country taking with him our black box to the continued use of which as a sarcophagus he had been made very welcome for our share in bringing upon him the great catastrophe of his life he never uttered to us either by spoken or written word a single reproach that idea of suffering as the great philosopher had suffered seemed to comfort him if newton bore it surely i can he said to us with his bland smile when we renewed the expression of our regret something passed between us coming more from us than from him as to the expediency of finding out some youthful scholar who could go down to the rectory and reconstruct from its ruins the edifice of our friends learning the doctor had given us some encouragement and we had begun to make enquiry when we received the following letter rectory dear mr you were so kind as to say that you would endeavour to find for me an assistant in arranging and reconstructing the fragments of my work on the metres of the greek dramatists your promise has been an additional kindness dear courteous kind old gentleman for we knew well that no slightest sting of sarcasm was intended to be conveyed in these words your promise has been an additional kindness but looking upon the matter carefully and giving to it the best consideration in my power i have determined to relinquish the design that which has been destroyed cannot be replaced and it may well be that it was not worth replacing i am old now and never could do again that which perhaps i was never fitted to do with any fair prospect of success i will never turn again to the ashes of my unborn child but will console myself with the memory of my grievance knowing well as i do so that consolation from the severity of harsh but just criticism might have been more difficult to find when i think of the end of my efforts as a scholar my mind reverts to the terrible and fatal catastrophe of one whose scholarship was infinitely more finished and more ripe than mine whenever it may suit you to come into this part of the country pray remember that it will give very great pleasure to myself and to my daughter to welcome you at our parsonage believe me to be my dear mr yours very sincerely we never have found the time to accept the doctors invitation and our eyes have never again rested on the black box containing the ashes of the unborn child to which the doctor will never turn again we can picture him to ourselves standing full of thought with his hand upon the lid but never venturing to turn the lock indeed we do not doubt but that the key of the box is put away among other secret treasures a lock of his wifes hair perhaps and the little shoe of the boy who did not live long enough to stand at his fathers knee for a tender soft hearted man was the doctor and one who fed much on the memories of the past we often called upon mr and mrs grimes at the spotted dog and would sit there talking of mackenzie and his family mackenzies widow soon vanished out of the neighbourhood and no one there knew what was the fate of her or of her children and then also mr grimes went and took his wife with him but they could not be said to vanish scratching his head one day he told me with a dolorous voice that he had made his fortune weve got as snug a little place as ever you see just two mile out of colchester said mrs grimes triumphantly with thirty acres of land just to amuse john and as for the spotted dog im that sick of it another yeard wear me to a dry bone we looked at her and saw no tendency that way and we looked at john and thought that he was not triumphant who followed mr and mrs grimes at the spotted dog we have never visited liquorpond street to see mrs brumby illustration mrs brumby we think that we are justified in asserting that of all the persons with whom we have been brought in contact in the course of our editorial experiences men or women boys or girls mrs brumby was the most hateful and the most hated we are sure of this that for some months she was the most feared during which period she made life a burden to us and more than once induced us to calculate whether it would not be well that we should abandon our public duties and retire to some private corner into which it would be impossible that mrs brumby should follow us years have rolled on since then and we believe that mrs brumby has gone before the great judge and been called upon to account for the injuries she did us we know that she went from these shores to a distant land when her nefarious projects failed at home she was then by no means a young woman we never could find that she left relative or friend behind her and we know of none now except those close and dearest friends of our own who supported us in our misery who remember even that she existed whether she be alive or whether she be dead her story shall be told not in a spirit of revenge but with strict justice what there was in her of good shall be set down with honesty and indeed there was much in her that was good she was energetic full of resources very brave constant devoted to the interests of the poor creature whose name she bore and by no means a fool she was utterly unscrupulous dishonest a liar cruel hard as a nether mill stone to all the world except lieutenant brumby harder to him than to all the world besides when he made any faintest attempt at rebellion and as far as we could judge absolutely without conscience had she been a man and had circumstances favoured her she might have been a prime minister or an archbishop or a chief justice we intend no silly satire on present or past holders of the great offices indicated but we think that they have generally been achieved by such a combination of intellect perseverance audacity and readiness as that which mrs brumby certainly possessed and that freedom from the weakness of scruple which in men who have risen in public life we may perhaps call adaptability to compromise was in her so strong that had she been a man she would have trimmed her bark to any wind that blew and certainly have sailed into some port but she was a woman and the ports were not open to her those ports were not open to her which had she been a man would have been within her reach but fortunately for us and for the world at large as to the general question though so very unfortunately as regarded this special case the port of literature is open to women it seems to be the only really desirable harbour to which a female captain can steer her vessel with much hope of success there are the fine arts no doubt there seems to be no reason why a woman should not paint as well as titian but they dont with the pen they hold their own and certainly run a better race against men on that course than on any other mrs brumby who was very desirous of running a race and winning a place and who had seen all this put on her cap and jacket and boots chose her colours and entered her name why oh why did she select the course upon which we wretched we were bound by our duties to regulate the running we may as well say at once that though mrs brumby might have made a very good prime minister she could not write a paper for a magazine or produce literary work of any description that was worth paper and ink we feel sure that we may declare without hesitation that no perseverance on her part no labour however unswerving no training however long would have enabled her to do in a fitting manner even a review for the literary curricle there was very much in her but that was not in her we find it difficult to describe the special deficiency under which she laboured but it existed and was past remedy as a man suffering from a chronic stiff joint cannot run and cannot hope to run so was it with her she could not combine words so as to make sentences or sentences so as to make paragraphs she did not know what style meant we believe that had she ever read johnson gibbon archdeacon coxe mr grote and macaulay would have been all the same to her and yet this woman chose literature as her profession and clung to it for awhile with a persistence which brought her nearer to the rewards of success than many come who are at all points worthy to receive them we have said that she was not a young woman when we knew her we cannot fancy her to have been ever young we cannot bring our imagination to picture to ourselves the person of mrs brumby surrounded by the advantages of youth when we knew her she may probably have been forty or forty five and she then possessed a rigidity of demeanour and a sternness of presence which we think must have become her better than any softer guise or more tender phase of manner could ever have done in her earlier years there was no attempt about her to disguise or modify her sex such as women have made since those days she talked much about her husband the lieutenant and she wore a double roll of very stiff dark brown curls on each side of her face or rather over her brows which would not have been worn by a woman meaning to throw off as far as possible her femininity whether those curls were or were not artificial we never knew our male acquaintances who saw her used to swear that they were false but a lady who once saw her assured us that they were real she told us that there is a kind of hair growing on the heads of some women thick short crisp and shiny which will maintain its curl unbroken and unruffled for days she told us also that women blessed with such hair are always pachy dermatous and strong minded such certainly was the character of mrs brumby she was a tall thin woman not very tall or very thin for aught that we can remember her figure may have been good but we do remember well that she never seemed to us to have any charm of womanhood there was a certain fire in her dark eyes eyes which were we think quite black but it was the fire of contention and not of love her features were well formed her nose somewhat long and her lips thin and her face too narrow perhaps for beauty her chin was long and the space from her nose to her upper lip was long she always carried a well wearing brown complexion a complexion with which no man had a right to find fault but which to a pondering speculative man produced unconsciously a consideration whether in a matter of kissing an ordinary mahogany table did not offer a preferable surface when we saw her she wore we think always a dark stuff dress a fur tippet in winter and a most ill arranged shawl in summer and a large commanding bonnet which grew in our eyes till it assumed all the attributes of a helmet inspiring that reverence and creating that fear which minervas headgear is intended to produce when we add our conviction that mrs brumby trusted nothing to female charms that she neither suffered nor enjoyed anything from female vanity and that the lieutenant was perfectly safe let her roam the world alone as she might in search of editors we shall have said enough to introduce the lady to our readers of her early life or their early lives we know nothing but the unfortunate circumstances which brought us into contact with mrs brumby made us also acquainted with the lieutenant the lieutenant we think was younger than his wife a good deal younger we used to imagine though his looks may have been deceptive he was a confirmed invalid and there are phases of ill health which give an appearance of youthfulness rather than of age what was his special ailing we never heard though as we shall mention further on we had our own idea on that subject but he was always spoken of in our hearing as one who always had been ill who always was ill who always would be ill and who never ought to think of getting well he had been in some regiment called the duke of sussexs own and his wife used to imagine that her claims upon the public as a woman of literature were enhanced by the royalty of her husbands corps we never knew her attempt to make any other use whatever of his services he was not confined to his bed and could walk at any rate about the house but she never asked him or allowed him to do anything whether he ever succeeded in getting his face outside the door we do not know he wore when we saw him an old dressing gown and slippers he was a pale slight light haired man and we fancy that he took a delight in novels their settled income consisted of his half pay and some very small property which belonged to her together they might perhaps have possessed per annum when we knew them they had lodgings in harpur street near theobalds road and she had resolved to push her way in london as a woman of literature she had been told that she would have to deal with hard people and that she must herself be hard that advantage would be taken of her weakness and that she must therefore struggle vehemently to equal the strength of those with whom she would be brought in contact that editors publishers and brother authors would suck her brains and give her nothing for them and that therefore she must get what she could out of them giving them as little as possible in return it was an evil lesson that she had learned but she omitted nothing in the performance of the duties which that lesson imposed upon her she first came to us with a pressing introduction from an acquaintance of ours who was connected with a weekly publication called the literary curricle the literary curricle was not in our estimation a strong paper and we will own that we despised it we did not think very much of the acquaintance by whom the strong introductory letter was written but mrs brumby forced herself into our presence with the letter in her hand and before she left us extracted from us a promise that we would read a manuscript which she pulled out of a bag which she carried with her of that first interview a short account shall be given but it must first be explained that the editor of the literary curricle had received mrs brumby with another letter from another editor whom she had first taken by storm without any introduction whatever this first gentleman whom we had not the pleasure of knowing had under what pressure we who knew the lady can imagine printed three or four short paragraphs from mrs brumbys pen whether they reached publication we never could learn but we saw the printed slips he however passed her on to the literary curricle which dealt almost exclusively in the reviewing of books and our friend at the office of that influential organ sent her to us with an intimation that her very peculiar and well developed talents were adapted rather for the creation of tales or the composition of original treatises than for reviewing the letter was very strong and we learned afterwards that mrs brumby had consented to abandon her connection with the literary curricle only on the receipt of a letter in her praise that should be very strong indeed she rejected the two first offered to her and herself dictated the epithets with which the third was loaded on no other terms would she leave the office of the literary curricle we cannot say that the letter strong as it was had much effect upon us but this effect it had perhaps that after reading it we could not speak to the lady with that acerbity which we might have used had she come to us without it as it was we were not very civil and began our intercourse by assuring her that we could not avail ourselves of her services having said so and observing that she still kept her seat we rose from our chair being well aware how potent a spell that movement is wont to exercise upon visitors who are unwilling to go she kept her seat and argued the matter out with us a magazine such as that which we then conducted must she surmised require depth of erudition keenness of intellect grasp of hand force of expression and lightness of touch that she possessed all these gifts she had she alleged brought to us convincing evidence there was the letter from the editor of the literary curricle with which she had been long connected declaring the fact did we mean to cast doubt upon the word of our own intimate friend for the gentleman at the office of the literary curricle had written to us as dear though as far as we could remember we had never spoken half a dozen words to him in our life then she repeated the explanation given by her godfather of the abrupt termination of the close connection which had long existed between her and the curricle she could not bring herself to waste her energies in the reviewing of books at that moment we certainly did believe that she had been long engaged on the curricle though there was certainly not a word in our correspondents letter absolutely stating that to be the fact he declared to us her capabilities and excellences but did not say that he had ever used them himself indeed he told us that great as they were they were hardly suited for his work she before she had left us on that occasion had committed herself to positive falsehoods she boasted of the income she had earned from two periodicals whereas up to that moment she had never received a shilling for what she had written we find it difficult even after so many years when the shame of the thing has worn off together with the hairs of our head to explain how it was that we allowed her to get in the first instance any hold upon us we did not care a brass farthing for the man who had written from the literary curricle his letter to us was an impertinence and we should have stated as much to mrs brumby had we cared to go into such matter with her and our first feelings with regard to the lady herself were feelings of dislike and almost of contempt even though we did believe that she had been a writer for the press we disliked her nose and her lips and her bonnet and the colour of her face we didnt want her though we were very much younger then than we are now we had already learned to set our backs up against strong minded female intruders as we said before we rose from our chair with the idea of banishing her not absolutely uncivilly but altogether unceremoniously it never occurred to us during that meeting that she could be of any possible service to us or that we should ever be of any slightest service to her nevertheless she had extracted from us a great many words and had made a great many observations herself before she left us when a man speaks a great many words it is impossible that he should remember what they all were that we told mrs brumby on that occasion that we did not doubt but that we would use the manuscript which she left in our hands we are quite sure was not true we never went so near making a promise in our lives even when pressed by youth and beauty and are quite sure that what we did say to mrs brumby was by no means near akin to this that we undertook to read the manuscript we think probable and therein lay our first fault the unfortunate slip from which our future troubles sprang and grew to such terrible dimensions we cannot now remember how the hated parcel the abominable roll came into our hands we do remember the face and form and figure of the woman as she brought it out of the large reticule which she carried and we remember also how we put our hands behind us to avoid it as she presented it to us we told her flatly that we did not want it and would not have it and yet it came into our hands we think that it must have been placed close to our elbow and that being used to such playthings we took it up we know that it was in our hands and that we did not know how to rid ourselves of it when she began to tell us the story of the lieutenant we were hard hearted enough to inform her as we have under perhaps lesser compulsion informed others since that the distress of the man or of the woman should never be accepted as a reason for publishing the works of the writer she answered us gallantly enough that she had never been weak enough or foolish enough so to think i base my claim to attention she said on quite another ground do not suppose sir that i am appealing to your pity i scorn to do so but i wish you should know my position as a married woman and that you should understand that my husband though unfortunately an invalid has been long attached to a regiment which is peculiarly the duke of sussexs own you cannot but be aware of the connection which his royal highness has long maintained with literature mrs brumby could not write but she could speak the words she had just uttered were absolutely devoid of sense the absurdity of them was ludicrous and gross but they were not without a certain efficacy they did not fill us with any respect for her literary capacity because of her connection with the duke of sussex but they did make us feel that she was able to speak up for herself we are told sometimes that the world accords to a man that treatment which he himself boldly demands and though the statement seems to be monstrous there is much truth in it when mrs brumby spoke of her husbands regiment being peculiarly the duke of sussexs own she used a tone which compelled from us more courtesy than we had hitherto shown her we knew that the duke was neither a man of letters nor a warrior though he had a library and as we were now told a regiment had he been both his being so would have formed no legitimate claim for mrs brumby upon us but nevertheless the royal duke helped her to win her way it was not his royalty but her audacity that was prevailing she sat with us for more than an hour and when she left us the manuscript was with us and we had no doubt undertaken to read it we are perfectly certain that at that time we had not gone beyond this in the way of promising assistance to mrs brumby the would be author who cannot make his way either by intellect or favour can hardly do better perhaps than establish a grievance let there be anything of a case of ill usage against editor or publisher and the aspirant if he be energetic and unscrupulous will greatly increase his chance of working his way into print mrs brumby was both energetic and unscrupulous and she did establish her grievance as soon as she brought her first visit to a close the roll which was still in our hands was chucked across our table to a corner commodiously supported by the wall so that occasionally there was accumulated in it a heap of such unwelcome manuscripts in the doing of this in the moment of our so chucking the parcel it was always our conscientious intention to make a clearance of the whole heap at the very furthest by the end of the week we knew that strong hopes were bound up in those various little packets that eager thoughts were imprisoned there the owners of which believed that they were endowed with wings fit for arial soaring that young hearts ay and old hearts too sore with deferred hope were waiting to know whether their aspirations might now be realised whether those azure wings might at last be released from bondage and allowed to try their strength in the broad sunlight of public favour we think too that we had a conscience and perhaps the heap was cleared as frequently as are the heaps of other editors but there it would grow in the commodious corner of our big table too often for our own peace of mind the aspect of each individual little parcel would be known to us and we would allow ourselves to fancy that by certain external signs we could tell the nature of the interior some of them would promise well so well as to create even almost an appetite for their perusal but there would be others from which we would turn with aversion which we seemed to abhor which when we handled the heap our fingers would refuse to touch and which thus lying there neglected and ill used would have the dust of many days added to those other marks which inspired disgust we confess that as soon as mrs brumbys back was turned her roll was sent in upon this heap with that determined force which a strong feeling of dislike can lend even to a mans little finger and there it lay for perhaps a fortnight when during that period we extracted first one packet and then another for judgment we would still leave mrs brumbys roll behind in the corner on such occasions a pang of conscience will touch the heart some idea of neglected duty will be present to the mind a silent promise will perhaps be made that it shall be the next some momentary sudden resolve will be half formed that for the future a rigid order of succession shall be maintained which no favour shall be allowed to infringe but alas when the hand is again at work selecting the odious ugly thing is left behind till at last it becomes infested with strange terrors with an absolute power of its own and the guilty conscience will become afraid all this happened in regard to mrs brumbys manuscript dear dear yes mrs brumby we would catch ourselves exclaiming with that silent inward voice which occasionally makes itself audible to most of us and then quite silently without even whispered violence we would devote mrs brumby to the infernal gods and so the packet remained amidst the heap perhaps for a fortnight theres a lady waiting in your room sir this was said to us one morning on our reaching our office by the lad whom we used to call our clerk he is now managing a red hot tory newspaper down in barsetshire has a long beard a flaring eye a round belly and is upon the whole the most arrogant personage we know in the days of mrs brumby he was a little wizened fellow about eighteen years old but looking three years younger modest often almost dumb and in regard to ourselves not only reverential but timid we turned upon him in great anger what business had any woman to be in our room in our absence were not our orders on this subject exact and very urgent was he not kept at an expense of s a week we did not actually throw the amount in his teeth but such was intended to be the effect of our rebuke at s a week paid out of our own pocket nominally indeed as a clerk but chiefly for the very purpose of keeping female visitors out of our room and now in our absence and in his there was actually a woman among the manuscripts we felt from the first moment that it was mrs brumby with bated breath and downcast eyes the lad explained to us his inability to exclude her she walked straight in right over me he said and as for being alone she hasnt been alone i havent left her not a minute we walked at once into our own room feeling how fruitless it was to discuss the matter further with the boy in the passage and there we found mrs brumby seated in the chair opposite to our own we had gathered ourselves up if we may so describe an action which was purely mental with a view to severity we thought that her intrusion was altogether unwarrantable and that it behoved us to let her know that such was the case we entered the room with a clouded brow and intended that she should read our displeasure in our eyes but mrs brumby could gather herself up quite as well as we could do and she did so she also could call clouds to her forehead and could flash anger from her eyes madam we exclaimed as we paused for a moment and looked at her but she cared nothing for our madam and condescended to no apology rising from her chair she asked us why we had not kept the promise we had made her to use her article in our next number we dont know how far our readers will understand all that was included in this accusation use her contribution in our next number it had never occurred to us as probable or hardly as possible that we should use it in any number our eye glanced at the heap to see whether her fingers had been at work but we perceived that the heap had not been touched we have always flattered ourselves that no one can touch our heap without our knowing it she saw the motion of our eye and at once understood it mrs brumby no doubt possessed great intelligence and moreover a certain majesty of demeanour there was always something of the helmet of minerva in the bonnet which she wore her shawl was an old shawl but she was never ashamed of it and she could always put herself forward as though there were nothing behind her to be concealed the concealing of which was a burden to her i cannot suppose she said that my paper has been altogether neglected we picked out the roll with all the audacity we could assume and proceeded to explain how very much in error she was in supposing that we had ever even hinted at its publication we had certainly said that we would read it mentioning no time we never did mention any time in making any such promise you named a week sir said mrs brumby and now a month has passed by you assured me that it would be accepted unless returned within seven days of course it will be accepted now we contradicted her flatly we explained we protested we threatened we endeavoured to put the manuscript into her hand and made a faint attempt to stick it into her bag she was indignant dignified and very strong she said nothing on that occasion about legal proceedings but stuck manfully to her assertion that we had bound ourselves to decide upon her manuscript within a week do you think sir said she that i would entrust the very essence of my brain to the keeping of a stranger without some such assurance as that we acknowledged that we had undertaken to read the paper but again disowned the week and how long would you be justified in taking demanded mrs brumby if a month why not a year does it not occur to you sir that when the very best of my intellect my inmost thoughts lie there at your disposal and she pointed to the heap it may be possible that a property has been confided to you too valuable to justify neglect had i given you a ring to keep you would have locked it up but the best jewels of my mind are left to the tender mercies of your charwoman what she said was absolutely nonsense abominable villanous trash but she said it so well that we found ourselves apologising for our own misconduct there had perhaps been a little undue delay in our peculiar business such would occasionally occur when we had got to this any expression of our wrath at her intrusion was impossible as we entered the room we had intended almost to fling her manuscript at her head we now found ourselves handling it almost affectionately while we expressed regret for our want of punctuality mrs brumby was gracious and pardoned us but her forgiveness was not of the kind which denotes the intention of the injured one to forget as well as forgive the trespass she had suffered from us a great injustice but she would say no more on that score now on the condition that we would at once attend to her essay she thrice repeated the words at once and she did so without rebuke from us and then she made us a proposition the like of which never reached us before or since would we fix an hour within the next day or two at which we would call upon her in harpur street and arrange as to terms the lieutenant she said would be delighted to make our acquaintance call upon her upon mrs brumby travel to harpur street theobalds road on the business of a chance bit of scribbling which was wholly indifferent to us except in so far as it was a trouble to us and then we were invited to make arrangements as to terms terms had the owner of the most illustrious lips in the land offered to make us known in those days to the partner of her greatness she could not have done so with more assurance that she was conferring on us an honour than was assumed by mrs brumby when she proposed to introduce us to the lieutenant when many wrongs are concentrated in one short speech and great injuries inflicted by a few cleverly combined words it is generally difficult to reply so that some of the wrongs shall not pass unnoticed we cannot always be so happy as was mr john robinson when in saying that he hadnt been dead at all he did really say everything that the occasion required we were so dismayed by the proposition that we should go to harpur street so hurt in our own personal dignity that we lost ourselves in endeavouring to make it understood that such a journey on our part was quite out of the question were we to do that mrs brumby we should live in cabs and spend our entire days in making visits she smiled at us as we endeavoured to express our indignation and said something as to circumstances being different in different cases something also if we remember right she hinted as to the intelligence needed for discovering the differences she left our office quicker than we had expected saying that as we could not afford to spend our time in cabs she would call again on the day but one following her departure was almost abrupt but she went apparently in good humour it never occurred to us at the moment to suspect that she hurried away before we should have had time to repudiate certain suggestions which she had made when we found ourselves alone with the roll of paper in our hands we were very angry with mrs brumby but almost more angry with ourselves we were in no way bound to the woman and yet she had in some degree substantiated a claim upon us we piqued ourselves specially on never making any promise beyond the vaguest assurance that this or that proposed contribution should receive consideration at some altogether undefined time but now we were positively pledged to read mrs brumbys effusion and have our verdict ready by the day after to morrow we were wont too to keep ourselves much secluded from strangers and here was mrs brumby who had already been with us twice positively entitled to a third audience we had been scolded and then forgiven and then ridiculed by a woman who was old and ugly and false and there was present to us a conviction that though she was old and ugly and false mrs brumby was no ordinary woman perhaps it might be that she was really qualified to give us valuable assistance in regard to the magazine as to which we must own we were sometimes driven to use matter that was not quite so brilliant as for our readers sakes we would have wished it to be we feel ourselves compelled to admit that old and ugly women taken on the average do better literary work than they who are young and pretty i did not like mrs brumby but it might be that in her the age would find another de stal so thinking we cut the little string and had the manuscript open in our own hands we cannot remember whether she had already indicated to us the subject of the essay but it was headed costume in there were perhaps thirty closely filled pages of which we read perhaps a third the handwriting was unexceptionable orderly clean and legible but the matter was undeniable twaddle it proffered advice to women that they should be simple and to men that they should be cleanly in their attire anything of less worth for the purpose of amusement or of instruction could not be imagined there was in fact nothing in it it has been our fate to look at a great many such essays and to cause them at once either to be destroyed or returned there could be no doubt at all as to mrs brumbys essay she came punctual as the clock as she seated herself in our chair and made some remark as to her hope that we were satisfied we felt something like fear steal across our bosom we were about to give offence and dreaded the arguments that would follow it was however quite clear that we could not publish mrs brumbys essay on costume and therefore though she looked more like minerva now than ever we must go through our task we told her in half a dozen words that we had read the paper and that it would not suit our columns not suit your columns she said looking at us by no means in sorrow but in great anger you do not mean to trifle with me like that after all you have made me suffer we protested that we were responsible for none of her sufferings sir she said when i was last here you owned the wrong you had done me we felt that we must protest against this and we rose in our wrath there were two of us angry now madam we said you have kindly offered us your essay and we have courteously declined it you will allow us to say that this must end the matter there were allusions here to kindness and courtesy but the reader will understand that the sense of the words was altogether changed by the tone of the voice indeed sir the matter will not be ended so if you think that your position will enable you to trample upon those who make literature really a profession you are very much mistaken mrs brumby we said we can give you no other answer and as our time is valuable time valuable she exclaimed and as she stood up an artist might have taken her for a model of minerva had she only held a spear in her hand and is no time valuable do you think but yours i had sir your distinct promise that the paper should be published if it was left in your hands above a week that is untrue madam untrue sir absolutely untrue mrs brumby was undoubtedly a woman and might be very like a goddess but we were not going to allow her to palm off upon us without flat contradiction so absolute a falsehood as that we never dreamed of publishing your paper then why sir have you troubled yourself to read it from the beginning to the end we had certainly intimated that we had made ourselves acquainted with the entire essay but we had in fact skimmed and skipped through about a third of it how dare you say sir you have never dreamed of publishing it when you know that you studied it with that view we didnt read it all we said but we read quite enough and yet but this moment ago you told me that you had perused it carefully the word peruse we certainly never used in our life we object to perusing as we do to commencing and performing we read and we begin and we do as to that assurance which the word carefully would intend to convey we believe that we were to that extent guilty i think sir she continued that you had better see the lieutenant with a view to fighting the gentleman we asked no sir an officer in the duke of sussexs own draws his sword against no enemy so unworthy of his steel she had told me at a former interview that the lieutenant was so confirmed an invalid as to be barely able on his best days to drag himself out of bed one fights with ones equal but the law gives redress from injury whether it be inflicted by equal by superior or by inferior and mrs brumby as she uttered the last word wagged her helmet at us in a manner which left no doubt as to the position which she assigned to us it became clearly necessary that an end should be put to an intercourse which had become so very unpleasant we told our minerva very plainly that we must beg her to leave us there is however nothing more difficult to achieve than the expulsion of a woman who is unwilling to quit the place she occupies we remember to have seen a lady take possession of a seat in a mail coach to which she was not entitled and which had been booked and paid for by another person the agent for the coaching business desired her with many threats to descend but she simply replied that the journey to her was a matter of such moment that she felt herself called upon to keep her place the agent sent the coachman to pull her out the coachman threatened with his hands as well as with his words and then set the guard at her the guard attacked her with inflamed visage and fearful words about her majestys mails and then set the ostlers at her we thought the ostlers were going to handle her roughly but it ended by their scratching their heads and by a declaration on the part of one of them that she was the rummest go hed ever seen she was a woman and they couldnt touch her a policeman was called upon for assistance who offered to lock her up but he could only do so if allowed to lock up the whole coach as well it was ended by the production of another coach by an exchange of the luggage and passengers by a delay of two hours and an embarrassing possession of the original vehicle by the lady in the midst of a crowd of jeering boys and girls we could tell mrs brumby to go and we could direct our boy to open the door and we could make motions indicatory of departure with our left hand but we could not forcibly turn her out of the room she asked us for the name of our lawyer and we did write down for her on a slip of paper the address of a most respectable firm whom we were pleased to regard as our attorneys but who had never yet earned six and eightpence from the magazine young sharp of the firm of sharp and butterwell was our friend and would no doubt see to the matter for us should it be necessary but we could not believe that the woman would be so foolish she made various assertions to us as to her position in the world of literature and it was on this occasion that she brought out those printed slips which we have before mentioned she offered to refer the matter in dispute between us to the arbitration of the editor of the curricle and when we indignantly declined such interference protesting that there was no matter in dispute she again informed us that if we thought to trample upon her we were very much mistaken then there occurred a little episode which moved us to laughter in the midst of our wrath our boy in obedience to our pressing commands that he should usher mrs brumby out of our presence did lightly touch her arm feeling the degradation of the assault minerva swung round upon the unfortunate lad and gave him a box on the ear which well be bound the editor of the west barsetshire gazette remembers to this day madam we said as soon as we had swallowed down the first involuntary attack of laughter if you conduct yourself in this manner we must send for the police do sir if you dare replied minerva and every man of letters in the metropolis shall hear of your conduct there was nothing in her threat to move us but we confess that we were uncomfortable before i leave you sir she said i will give you one more chance will you perform your contract with me and accept my contribution certainly not we replied she afterwards quoted this answer as admitting a contract we are often told that everything must come to an end and there was an end at last to mrs brumbys visit she went from us with an assurance that she should at once return home pick up the lieutenant hinting that the exertion caused altogether by our wickedness might be the death of that gallant officer and go with him direct to her attorney the world of literature should hear of the terrible injustice which had been done to her and the courts of law should hear of it too we confess that we were grievously annoyed by the time that mrs brumby had left the premises our clerk had gone also he had rushed off to the nearest police court to swear an information against her on account of the box on the ear which she had given him and we were unable to leave our desk till he had returned we found that for the present the doing of any work in our line of business was quite out of the question a calm mind is required for the critical reading of manuscripts and whose mind could be calm after such insults as those we had received we sat in our chair idle reflective indignant making resolutions that we would never again open our lips to a woman coming to us with a letter of introduction and a contribution till our lad returned to us we were forced to give him a sovereign before we could induce him to withdraw his information we object strongly to all bribery but in this case we could see the amount of ridicule which would be heaped upon our whole establishment if some low conditioned lawyer were allowed to cross examine us as to our intercourse with mrs brumby it was with difficulty that the clerk arranged the matter the next day at the police office and his object was not effected without the farther payment by us of s d for costs it was then understood between us and the clerk that on no excuse whatever should mrs brumby be again admitted to my room and i thought that the matter was over she shall have to fight her way through if she does get in said the lad she aint going to knock me about any more woman or no woman o dea certe we exclaimed it shall be a dear job to her if she touches me again said the clerk catching up the sound we really thought we had done with mrs brumby but at the end of four or five days there came to us a letter which we have still in our possession and which we will now venture to make public it was as follows it was addressed not to ourselves but to messrs x y and z the very respectable proprietors of the periodical which we were managing on their behalf pluck court grays inn st march gentlemen we are instructed by our client lieutenant brumby late of the duke of sussexs own regiment to call upon you for payment of the sum of twenty five guineas due to him for a manuscript essay on costume supplied by his wife to the magazine which is we believe your property by special contract with mr the editor we are also directed to require from you and from mr a full apology in writing for the assault committed on mrs brumby in your editors room on the th instant and an assurance also that the columns of your periodical shall not be closed against that lady because of this transaction we request that s d our costs may be forwarded to us together with the above named sum of twenty five guineas we are gentlemen your obedient servants badger and blister messrs x y z paternoster row we were in the habit of looking in at the shop in paternoster row on the first of every month and on that inauspicious first of april the above letter was handed to us by our friend mr x i hope you havent been and put your foot in it said mr x we protested that we had not put our foot in it at all and we told him the whole story dont let us have a lawsuit whatever you do said mr x the magazine isnt worth it we ridiculed the idea of a lawsuit but we took away with us messrs badger and blisters letter and showed it to our legal adviser mr sharp mr sharp was of opinion that badger and blister meant fighting when we pointed out to him the absolute absurdity of the whole thing he merely informed us that we did not know badger and blister theyll take up any case said he however hopeless and work it with superhuman energy on the mere chance of getting something out of the defendant whatever is got out of him becomes theirs they never disgorge we were quite confident that nothing could be got out of the magazine on behalf of mrs brumby and we left the case in mr sharps hands thinking that our trouble in the matter was over a fortnight elapsed and then we were called upon to meet mr sharp in paternoster row we found our friend mr x with a somewhat unpleasant visage mr x was a thriving man usually just and sometimes generous but he didnt like being put upon mr sharp had actually recommended that some trifle should be paid to mrs brumby and mr x seemed to think that this expense would in case that advice were followed have been incurred through fault on our part a ten pound note will set it all right said mr sharp yes a ten pound note just flung into the gutter i wonder that you allowed yourself to have anything to do with such a woman we protested against this injustice giving mr x to know that he didnt understand and couldnt understand our business im not so sure of that said mr x there was almost a quarrel and we began to doubt whether mrs brumby would not be the means of taking the very bread from out of our mouths mr sharp at last suggested that in spite of what he had seen from mrs brumby the lieutenant would probably be a gentleman not a doubt about it said mr x who was always fond of officers and of the army and at the moment seemed to think more of a paltry lieutenant than of his own editor mr sharp actually pressed upon us and upon mr x that we should call upon the lieutenant and explain matters to him mrs brumby had always been with us at twelve oclock go at noon said mr sharp and youll certainly find her out he instructed us to tell the lieutenant just the plain truth as he called it and to explain that in no way could the proprietors of a magazine be made liable to payment for an article because the editor in discharge of his duty had consented to read it perhaps the lieutenant doesnt know that his name has been used at all said mr sharp at any rate it will be well to learn what sort of a man he is a high minded gentleman no doubt said mr x the name of whose second boy was already down at the horse guards for a commission though it was sorely against the grain and in direct opposition to our own opinion we were constrained to go to harpur street theobalds road and to call upon lieutenant brumby we had not explained to mr x or to mr sharp what had passed between mrs brumby and ourselves when she suggested such a visit but the memory of the words which we and she had then spoken was on us as we endeavoured to dissuade our lawyer and our publisher nevertheless at their instigation we made the visit the house in harpur street was small and dingy and old the door was opened for us by the normal lodging house maid of all work who when we asked for the lieutenant left us in the passage that she might go and see we sent up our name and in a few minutes were ushered into a sitting room up two flights of stairs the room was not untidy but it was as comfortless as any chamber we ever saw the lieutenant was lying on an old horsehair sofa but we had been so far lucky as to find him alone mr sharp had been correct in his prediction as to the customary absence of the lady at that hour in the morning in one corner of the room we saw an old ram shackle desk at which we did not doubt were written those essays on costume and other subjects in the disposing of which the lady displayed so much energy the lieutenant himself was a small gray man dressed or rather enveloped in what i supposed to be an old wrapper of his wifes he held in his hands a well worn volume of a novel and when he rose to greet us he almost trembled with dismay and bashfulness his feet were thrust into slippers which were too old to stick on them and round his throat he wore a dirty once white woollen comforter we never learned what was the individual character of the corps which specially belonged to hrh the duke of sussex but if it was conspicuous for dash and gallantry lieutenant brumby could hardly have held his own among his brother officers we knew however from his wife that he had been invalided and as an invalid we respected him we proceeded to inform him that we had been called upon to pay him a sum of twenty five guineas and to explain how entirely void of justice any such claim must be we suggested to him that he might be made to pay some serious sum by the lawyers he employed and that the matter to us was an annoyance and a trouble chiefly because we had no wish to be brought into conflict with any one so respectable as lieutenant brumby he looked at us with imploring eyes as though begging us not to be too hard upon him in the absence of his wife trembled from head to foot and muttered a few words which were nearly inaudible we will not state as a fact that the lieutenant had taken to drinking spirits early in life but that certainly was our impression during the only interview we ever had with him when we pressed upon him as a question which he must answer whether he did not think that he had better withdraw his claim he fell back upon his sofa and began to sob while he was thus weeping mrs brumby entered the room she had in her hand the card which we had given to the maid of all work and was therefore prepared for the interview sir she said i hope you have come to settle my husbands just demands amidst the husbands wailings there had been one little sentence which reached our ears she does it all he had said throwing his eyes up piteously towards our face at that moment the door had been opened and mrs brumby had entered the room when she spoke of her husbands just demands we turned to the poor prostrate lieutenant and were deterred from any severity towards him by the look of supplication in his eye the lieutenant is not well this morning said mrs brumby and you will therefore be pleased to address yourself to me we explained that the absurd demand for payment had been made on the proprietors of the magazine in the name of lieutenant brumby and that we had therefore been obliged in the performance of a most unpleasant duty to call upon that gentleman but she laughed our argument to scorn you have driven me to take legal steps she said and as i am only a woman i must take them in the name of my husband but i am the person aggrieved and if you have any excuse to make you can make it to me your safer course sir will be to pay me the money that you owe me i had come there on a fools errand and before i could get away was very angry both with mr sharp and mr x i could hardly get a word in amidst the storm of indignant reproaches which was bursting over my head during the whole of the visit one would have thought from hearing her that she had half filled the pages of the magazine for the last six months and that we individually had pocketed the proceeds of her labour she laughed in our face when we suggested that she could not really intend to prosecute the suit and told us to mind our own business when we hinted that the law was an expensive amusement we sir she said will have the amusement and you will have to pay the bill when we left her she was indignant defiant and self confident and what will the reader suppose was the end of all this the whole truth has been told as accurately as we can tell it as far as we know our own business we were not wrong in any single step we took our treatment of mrs brumby was courteous customary and conciliatory we had treated her with more consideration than we had perhaps ever before shown to an unknown would be contributor she had been admitted thrice to our presence we had read at any rate enough of her trash to be sure of its nature on the other hand we had been insulted and our clerk had had his ears boxed what should have been the result we will tell the reader what was the result mr x paid to messrs badger and blister on behalf of the lieutenant and we under mr sharps advice wrote a letter to mrs brumby in which we expressed deep sorrow for our clerks misconduct and our own regret that we should have delayed the perusal of her manuscript we could not bring ourselves to write the words ourselves with our own fingers but signed the document which mr sharp put before us mr sharp had declared to messrs x y and z that unless some such arrangement were made he thought that we should be cast for a much greater sum before a jury for one whole morning in paternoster row we resisted this infamous tax not only on our patience but as we then felt it on our honour we thought that our very old friend mr x should have stood to us more firmly and not have demanded from us a task that was so peculiarly repugnant to our feelings and it is peculiarly repugnant to my feelings to pay for nothing said mr x who was not we think without some little feeling of revenge against us but i prefer that to a lawsuit and then he argued that the simple act on our part of signing such a letter as that presented to us could cost us no trouble and ought to occasion us no sorrow what can come of it wholl know it said mr x weve got to pay and that we shall feel it came to that at last that we were constrained to sign the letter and did sign it it did us no harm and can have done mrs brumby no good but the moment in which we signed it was perhaps the bitterest we ever knew that in such a transaction mrs brumby should have been so thoroughly successful and that we should have been so shamefully degraded has always appeared to us to be an injury too deep to remain unredressed for ever can such wrongs be and the heavens not fall our greatest comfort has been in the reflection that neither the lieutenant nor his wife ever saw a shilling of the that doubtless never went beyond badger and blister the end printed by w h smith and son strand london
