which the baths of vernet are situated is not much known to english or indeed to any travellers tourists in search of good hotels and picturesque beauty combined do not generally extend their journeys to the eastern pyrenees they rarely get beyond luchon and in this they are right as they thus end their peregrinations at the most lovely spot among these mountains and are as a rule so deceived imposed on and bewildered by guides innkeepers and horseowners at this otherwise delightful place as to become undesirous of further travel nor do invalids from distant parts frequent vernet people of fashion go to the eaux bonnes and to luchon and people who are really ill to barges and cauterets it is at these places that one meets crowds of parisians and the daughters and wives of rich merchants from bordeaux with an admixture now by no means inconsiderable of englishmen and englishwomen but the eastern pyrenees are still unfrequented and probably they will remain so for though there are among them lovely valleysand of all such the valley of vernet is perhaps the most lovelythey cannot compete with the mountain scenery of other touristsloved regions in europe at the port de venasquez and the brche de roland in the western pyrenees or rather to speak more truly at spots in the close vicinity of these famous mountain entrances from france into spain one can make comparisons with switzerland northern italy the tyrol and ireland which will not be injurious to the scenes then under view but among the eastern mountains this can rarely be done the hills do not stand thickly together so as to group themselves the passes from one valley to another though not wanting in altitude are not close pressed together with overhanging rocks and are deficient in grandeur as well as loveliness and then as a natural consequence of all this the hotelsare not quite as good as they should be but there is one mountain among them which can claim to rank with the pc du midi or the maledetta no one can poohpooh the stern old canigou standing high and solitary solemn and grand between the two roads which run from perpignan into spain the one by prades and the other by le boulon under the canigou towards the west lie the hot baths of vernet in a close secluded valley which as i have said before is as far as i know the sweetest spot in these eastern pyrenees the frequenters of these baths were a few years back gathered almost entirely from towns not very far distant from perpignan narbonne carcassonne and bzires and the baths were not therefore famous expensive or luxurious but those who believed in them believed with great faith and it was certainly the fact that men and women who went thither worn with toil sick with excesses and nervous through overcare came back fresh and strong fit once more to attack the world with all its woes their character in latter days does not seem to have changed though their circle of admirers may perhaps be somewhat extended in those days by far the most noted and illustrious person in the village of vernet was la mre bauche that there had once been a pre bauche was known to the world for there was a fils bauche who lived with his mother but no one seemed to remember more of him than that he had once existed at vernet he had never been known la mre bauche was a native of the village but her married life had been passed away from it and she had returned in her early widowhood to become proprietress and manager or as one may say the heart and soul of the htel bauche at vernet this hotel was a large and somewhat rough establishment intended for the accommodation of invalids who came to vernet for their health it was built immediately over one of the thermal springs so that the water flowed from the bowels of the earth directly into the baths there was accommodation for seventy people and during the summer and autumn months the place was always full not a few also were to be found there during the winter and spring for the charges of madame bauche were low and the accommodation reasonably good and in this respect as indeed in all others madame bauche had the reputation of being an honest woman she had a certain price from which no earthly consideration would induce her to depart and there were certain returns for this price in the shape of djeuners and dinners baths and beds which she never failed to give in accordance with the dictates of a strict conscience these were traits in the character of an hotelkeeper which cannot be praised too highly and which had met their due reward in the custom of the public but nevertheless there were those who thought that there was occasionally ground for complaint in the conduct even of madame bauche in the first place she was deficient in that pleasant smiling softness which should belong to any keeper of a house of public entertainment in her general mode of life she was stern and silent with her guests autocratic authoritative and sometimes contradictory in her house and altogether irrational and unconciliatory when any change even for a day was proposed to her or when any shadow of a complaint reached her ears indeed of complaint as made against the establishment she was altogether intolerant to such she had but one answer he or she who complained might leave the place at a moments notice if it so pleased them there were always others ready to take their places the power of making this answer came to her from the lowness of her prices and it was a power which was very dear to her the baths were taken at different hours according to medical advice but the usual time was from five to seven in the morning the djeuner or early meal was at nine oclock the dinner was at four after that no eating or drinking was allowed in the htel bauche there was a caf in the village at which ladies and gentlemen could get a cup of coffee or a glass of eau sucr but no such accommodation was to be had in the establishment not by any possible bribery or persuasion could any meal be procured at any other than the authorised hours a visitor who should enter the salle manger more than ten minutes after the last bell would be looked at very sourly by madame bauche who on all occasions sat at the top of her own table should any one appear as much as half an hour late he would receive only his share of what had not been handed round but after the last dish had been so handed it was utterly useless for any one to enter the room at all her appearance at the period of our tale was perhaps not altogether in her favour she was about sixty years of age and was very stout and short in the neck she wore her own gray hair which at dinner was always tidy enough but during the whole day previous to that hour she might be seen with it escaping from under her cap in extreme disorder her eyebrows were large and bushy but those alone would not have given to her face that look of indomitable sternness which it possessed her eyebrows were serious in their effect but not so serious as the pair of green spectacles which she always wore under them it was thought by those who had analysed the subject that the great secret of madame bauches power lay in her green spectacles her custom was to move about and through the whole establishment every day from breakfast till the period came for her to dress for dinner she would visit every chamber and every bath walk once or twice round the salle manger and very repeatedly round the kitchen she would go into every hole and corner and peer into everything through her green spectacles and in these walks it was not always thought pleasant to meet her her custom was to move very slowly with her hands generally clasped behind her back she rarely spoke to the guests unless she was spoken to and on such occasions she would not often diverge into general conversation if any one had aught to say connected with the business of the establishment she would listen and then she would make her answersoften not pleasant in the hearing and thus she walked her path through the world a stern hard solemn old woman not without gusts of passionate explosion but honest withal and not without some inward benevolence and true tenderness of heart children she had had many some seven or eight one or two had died others had been married she had sons settled far away from home and at the time of which we are now speaking but one was left in any way subject to maternal authority adolphe bauche was the only one of her children of whom much was remembered by the present denizens and hangerson of the hotel he was the youngest of the number and having been born only very shortly before the return of madame bauche to vernet had been altogether reared there it was thought by the world of those parts and rightly thought that he was his mothers darlingmore so than had been any of his brothers and sistersthe very apple of her eye and gem of her life at this time he was about twentyfive years of age and for the last two years had been absent from vernetfor reasons which will shortly be made to appear he had been sent to paris to see something of the world and learn to talk french instead of the patois of his valley and having left paris had come down south into languedoc and remained there picking up some agricultural lore which it was thought might prove useful in the valley farms of vernet he was now expected home again very speedily much to his mothers delight that she was kind and gracious to her favourite child does not perhaps give much proof of her benevolence but she had also been kind and gracious to the orphan child of a neighbour nay to the orphan child of a rival innkeeper at vernet there had been more than one water establishment but the proprietor of the second had died some few years after madame bauche had settled herself at the place his house had not thrived and his only child a little girl was left altogether without provision this little girl marie clavert la mre bauche had taken into her own house immediately after the fathers death although she had most cordially hated that father marie was then an infant and madame bauche had accepted the charge without much thought perhaps as to what might be the childs ultimate destiny but since then she had thoroughly done the duty of a mother by the little girl who had become the pet of the whole establishment the favourite plaything of adolphe baucheand at last of course his early sweetheart and then and therefore there had come troubles at vernet of course all the world of the valley had seen what was taking place and what was likely to take place long before madame bauche knew anything about it but at last it broke upon her senses that her son adolphe bauche the heir to all her virtues and all her riches the first young man in that or any neighbouring valley was absolutely contemplating the idea of marrying that poor little orphan marie clavert that any one should ever fall in love with marie clavert had never occurred to madame bauche she had always regarded the child as a child as the object of her charity and as a little thing to be looked on as poor marie by all the world she looking through her green spectacles had never seen that marie clavert was a beautiful creature full of ripening charms such as young men love to look on marie was of infinite daily use to madame bauche in a hundred little things about the house and the old lady thoroughly recognised and appreciated her ability but for this very reason she had never taught herself to regard marie otherwise than as a useful drudge she was very fond of her protgeso much so that she would listen to her in affairs about the house when she would listen to no one elsebut maries prettiness and grace and sweetness as a girl had all been thrown away upon maman bauche as marie used to call her but unluckily it had not been thrown away upon adolphe he had appreciated as it was natural that he should do all that had been so utterly indifferent to his mother and consequently had fallen in love consequently also he had told his love and consequently also marie had returned his love adolphe had been hitherto contradicted but in few things and thought that all difficulty would be prevented by his informing his mother that he wished to marry marie clavert but marie with a womans instinct had known better she had trembled and almost crouched with fear when she confessed her love and had absolutely hid herself from sight when adolphe went forth prepared to ask his mothers consent to his marriage the indignation and passionate wrath of madame bauche were past and gone two years before the date of this story and i need not therefore much enlarge upon that subject she was at first abusive and bitter which was bad for marie and afterwards bitter and silent which was worse it was of course determined that poor marie should be sent away to some asylum for orphans or penniless paupersin short anywhere out of the way what mattered her outlook into the world her happiness or indeed her very existence the outlook and happiness of adolphe bauchewas not that to be considered as everything at vernet but this terrible sharp aspect of affairs did not last very long in the first place la mre bauche had under those green spectacles a heart that in truth was tender and affectionate and after the first two days of anger she admitted that something must be done for marie clavert and after the fourth day she acknowledged that the world of the hotel her world would not go as well without marie clavert as it would with her and in the next place madame bauche had a friend whose advice in grave matters she would sometimes take this friend had told her that it would be much better to send away adolphe since it was so necessary that there should be a sending away of some one that he would be much benefited by passing some months of his life away from his native valley and that an absence of a year or two would teach him to forget marie even if it did not teach marie to forget him and we must say a word or two about this friend at vernet he was usually called m le capitaine though in fact he had never reached that rank he had been in the army and having been wounded in the leg while still a souslieutenant had been pensioned and had thus been interdicted from treading any further the thorny path that leads to glory for the last fifteen years he had resided under the roof of madame bauche at first as a casual visitor going and coming but now for many years as constant there as she was herself he was so constantly called le capitaine that his real name was seldom heard it may however as well be known to us that this was theodore campan he was a tall welllooking man always dressed in black garments of a coarse description certainly but scrupulously clean and well brushed of perhaps fifty years of age and conspicuous for the rigid uprightness of his backand for a black wooden leg this wooden leg was perhaps the most remarkable trait in his character it was always jet black being painted or polished or japanned as occasion might require by the hands of the capitaine himself it was longer than ordinary wooden legs as indeed the capitaine was longer than ordinary men but nevertheless it never seemed in any way to impede the rigid punctilious propriety of his movements it was never in his way as wooden legs usually are in the way of their wearers and then to render it more illustrious it had round its middle round the calf of the leg we may so say a band of bright brass which shone like burnished gold it had been the capitaines custom now for some years past to retire every evening at about seven oclock into the sanctum sanctorum of madame bauches habitation the dark little private sittingroom in which she made out her bills and calculated her profits and there regale himself in her presenceand indeed at her expense for the items never appeared in the billwith coffee and cognac i have said that there was never eating or drinking at the establishment after the regular dinnerhours but in so saying i spoke of the world at large nothing further was allowed in the way of trade but in the way of friendship so much was nowadays always allowed to the capitaine it was at these moments that madame bauche discussed her private affairs and asked for and received advice for even madame bauche was mortal nor could her green spectacles without other aid carry her through all the troubles of life it was now five years since the world of vernet discovered that la mre bauche was going to marry the capitaine and for eighteen months the world of vernet had been full of this matter but any amount of patience is at last exhausted and as no further steps in that direction were ever taken beyond the daily cup of coffee that subject died awayvery much unheeded by la mre bauche but she though she thought of no matrimony for herself thought much of matrimony for other people and over most of those cups of evening coffee and cognac a matrimonial project was discussed in these latter days it has been seen that the capitaine pleaded in maries favour when the fury of madame bauches indignation broke forth and that ultimately marie was kept at home and adolphe sent away by his advice but adolphe cannot always stay away madame bauche had pleaded in her difficulty the truth of this the capitaine had admitted but marie he said might be married to some one else before two years were over and so the matter had commenced but to whom should she be married to this question the capitaine had answered in perfect innocence of heart that la mre bauche would be much better able to make such a choice than himself he did not know how marie might stand with regard to money if madame would give some little dot the affair the capitaine thought would be more easily arranged all these things took months to say during which period marie went on with her work in melancholy listlessness one comfort she had adolphe before he went had promised to her holding in his hand as he did so a little cross which she had given him that no earthly consideration should sever themthat sooner or later he would certainly be her husband marie felt that her limbs could not work nor her tongue speak were it not for this one drop of water in her cup and then deeply meditating la mre bauche hit upon a plan and herself communicated it to the capitaine over a second cup of coffee into which she poured a full teaspoonful more than the usual allowance of cognac why should not he the capitaine himself be the man to marry marie clavert it was a very startling proposal the idea of matrimony for himself never having as yet entered into the capitaines head at any period of his life but la mre bauche did contrive to make it not altogether unacceptable as to that matter of dowry she was prepared to be more than generous she did love marie well and could find it in her heart to give her anythinganything except her son her own adolphe what she proposed was this adolphe himself would never keep the baths if the capitaine would take marie for his wife marie madame bauche declared should be the mistress after her death subject of course to certain settlements as to adolphes pecuniary interests the plan was discussed a thousand times and at last so for brought to bear that marie was made acquainted with ithaving been called in to sit in presence with la mre bauche and her future proposed husband the poor girl manifested no disgust to the stiff ungainly lover whom they assigned to herwho through his whole frame was in appearance almost as wooden as his own leg on the whole indeed marie liked the capitaine and felt that he was her friend and in her country such marriages were not uncommon the capitaine was perhaps a little beyond the age at which a man might usually be thought justified in demanding the services of a young girl as his nurse and wife but then marie of herself had so little to giveexcept her youth and beauty and goodness but yet she could not absolutely consent for was she not absolutely pledged to her own adolphe and therefore when the great pecuniary advantages were one by one displayed before her and when la mre bauche as a last argument informed her that as wife of the capitaine she would be regarded as second mistress in the establishment and not as a servant she could only burst out into tears and say that she did not know i will be very kind to you said the capitaine as kind as a man can be marie took his hard withered hand and kissed it and then looked up into his face with beseeching eyes which were not without avail upon his heart we will not press her now said the capitaine there is time enough but let his heart be touched ever so much one thing was certain it could not be permitted that she should marry adolphe to that view of the matter he had given in his unrestricted adhesion nor could he by any means withdraw it without losing altogether his position in the establishment of madame bauche nor indeed did his conscience tell him that such a marriage should be permitted that would be too much if every pretty girl were allowed to marry the first young man that might fall in love with her what would the world come to and it soon appeared that there was not time enoughthat the time was growing very scant in three months adolphe would be back and if everything was not arranged by that time matters might still go astray and then madame bauche asked her final question you do not think do you that you can ever marry adolphe and as she asked it the accustomed terror of her green spectacles magnified itself tenfold marie could only answer by another burst of tears the affair was at last settled among them marie said that she would consent to marry the capitaine when she should hear from adolphes own mouth that he adolphe loved her no longer she declared with many tears that her vows and pledges prevented her from promising more than this it was not her fault at any rate not now that she loved her lover it was not her faultnot now at leastthat she was bound by these pledges when she heard from his own mouth that he had discarded her then she would marry the capitaineor indeed sacrifice herself in any other way that la mre bauche might desire what would anything signify then madame bauches spectacles remained unmoved but not her heart marie she told the capitaine should be equal to herself in the establishment when once she was entitled to be called madame campan and she should be to her quite as a daughter she should have her cup of coffee every evening and dine at the big table and wear a silk gown at church and the servants should all call her madame a great career should be open to her if she would only give up her foolish girlish childish love for adolphe and all these great promises were repeated to marie by the capitaine but nevertheless there was but one thing in the world which in maries eyes was of any value and that one thing was the heart of adolphe bauche without that she would be nothing with thatwith that assured she could wait patiently till doomsday letters were written to adolphe during all these eventful doings and a letter came from him saying that he greatly valued maries love but that as it had been clearly proved to him that their marriage would be neither for her advantage nor for his he was willing to give it up he consented to her marriage with the capitaine and expressed his gratitude to his mother for the pecuniary advantages which she had held out to him oh adolphe adolphe but alas alas is not such the way of most mens heartsand of the hearts of some women this letter was read to marie but it had no more effect upon her than would have had some dry legal document in those days and in those places men and women did not depend much upon letters nor when they were written was there expressed in them much of heart or of feeling marie would understand as she was well aware the glance of adolphes eye and the tone of adolphes voice she would perceive at once from them what her lover really meant what he wished what in the innermost corner of his heart he really desired that she should do but from that stiff constrained written document she could understand nothing it was agreed therefore that adolphe should return and that she would accept her fate from his mouth the capitaine who knew more of human nature than poor marie felt tolerably sure of his bride adolphe who had seen something of the world would not care very much for the girl of his own valley money and pleasure and some little position in the world would soon wean him from his love and then marie would accept her destinyas other girls in the same position had done since the french world began and now it was the evening before adolphes expected arrival la mre bauche was discussing the matter with the capitaine over the usual cup of coffee madame bauche had of late become rather nervous on the matter thinking that they had been somewhat rash in acceding so much to marie it seemed to her that it was absolutely now left to the two young lovers to say whether or no they would have each other or not now nothing on earth could be further from madame bauches intention than this her decree and resolve was to heap down blessings on all persons concernedprovided always that she could have her own way but provided she did not have her own way to heap downanything but blessings she had her code of morality in this matter she would do good if possible to everybody around her but she would not on any score be induced to consent that adolphe should marry marie clavert should that be in the wind she would rid the house of marie of the capitaine and even of adolphe himself she had become therefore somewhat querulous and selfopinionated in her discussions with her friend i dont know she said on the evening in question i dont know it may be all right but if adolphe turns against me what are we to do then mre bauche said the capitaine sipping his coffee and puffing out the smoke of his cigar adolphe will not turn against us it had been somewhat remarked by many that the capitaine was more at home in the house and somewhat freer in his manner of talking with madame bauche since this matrimonial alliance had been on the tapis than he had ever been before la mre herself observed it and did not quite like it but how could she prevent it now when the capitaine was once married she would make him know his place in spite of all her promises to marie but if he says he likes the girl continued madame bauche my friend you may be sure that he will say nothing of the kind he has not been away two years without seeing girls as pretty as marie and then you have his letter that is nothing capitaine he would eat his letter as quick as you would eat an omelet aux fines herbes now the capitaine was especially quick over an omelet aux fines herbes and mre bauche you also have the purse he will know that he cannot eat that except with your good will ah exclaimed madame bauche poor lad he has not a sous in the world unless i give it to him but it did not seem that this reflection was in itself displeasing to her adolphe will now be a man of the world continued the capitaine he will know that it does not do to throw away everything for a pair of red lips that is the folly of a boy and adolphe will be no longer a boy believe me mre bauche things will be right enough and then we shall have marie sick and ill and half dying on our hands said madame bauche this was not flattering to the capitaine and so he felt it perhaps so perhaps not he said but at any rate she will get over it it is a malady which rarely kills young womenespecially when another alliance awaits them bah said madame bauche and in saying that word she avenged herself for the too great liberty which the capitaine had lately taken he shrugged his shoulders took a pinch of snuff and uninvited helped himself to a teaspoonful of cognac then the conference ended and on the next morning before breakfast adolphe bauche arrived on that morning poor marie hardly knew how to bear herself a month or two back and even up to the last day or two she had felt a sort of confidence that adolphe would be true to her but the nearer came that fatal day the less strong was the confidence of the poor girl she knew that those two longheaded aged counsellors were plotting against her happiness and she felt that she could hardly dare hope for success with such terrible foes opposed to her on the evening before the day madame bauche had met her in the passages and kissed her as she wished her good night marie knew little about sacrifices but she felt that it was a sacrificial kiss in those days a sort of diligence with the mails for olette passed through prades early in the morning and a conveyance was sent from vernet to bring adolphe to the baths never was prince or princess expected with more anxiety madame bauche was up and dressed long before the hour and was heard to say five several times that she was sure he would not come the capitaine was out and on the high road moving about with his wooden leg as perpendicular as a lamppost and almost as black marie also was up but nobody had seen her she was up and had been out about the place before any of them were stirring but now that the world was on the move she lay hidden like a hare in its form and then the old charbanc clattered up to the door and adolphe jumped out of it into his mothers arms he was fatter and fairer than she had last seen him had a larger beard was more fashionably clothed and certainly looked more like a man marie also saw him out of her little window and she thought that he looked like a god was it probable she said to herself that one so godlike would still care for her the mother was delighted with her son who rattled away quite at his ease he shook hands very cordially with the capitaineof whose intended alliance with his own sweetheart he had been informed and then as he entered the house with his hand under his mothers arm he asked one question about her and where is marie said he marie oh upstairs you shall see her after breakfast said la mre bauche and so they entered the house and went in to breakfast among the guests everybody had heard something of the story and they were all on the alert to see the young man whose love or want of love was considered to be of so much importance you will see that it will be all right said the capitaine carrying his head very high i think so i think so said la mre bauche who now that the capitaine was right no longer desired to contradict him i know that it will be all right said the capitaine i told you that adolphe would return a man and he is a man look at him he does not care this for marie clavert and the capitaine with much eloquence in his motion pitched over a neighbouring wall a small stone which he held in his hand and then they all went to breakfast with many signs of outward joy and not without some inward joy for madame bauche thought she saw that her son was cured of his love in the mean time marie sat up stairs still afraid to show herself he has come said a young girl a servant in the house running up to the door of maries room yes said marie i could see that he has come and oh how beautiful he is said the girl putting her hands together and looking up to the ceiling marie in her heart of hearts wished that he was not half so beautiful as then her chance of having him might be greater and the company are all talking to him as though he were the prfet said the girl never mind who is talking to him said marie go away and leave meyou are wanted for your work why before this was he not talking to her why not if he were really true to her alas it began to fall upon her mind that he would be false and what then what should she do then she sat still gloomily thinking of that other spouse that had been promised to her as speedily after breakfast as was possible adolphe was invited to a conference in his mothers private room she had much debated in her own mind whether the capitaine should be invited to this conference or no for many reasons she would have wished to exclude him she did not like to teach her son that she was unable to manage her own affairs and she would have been well pleased to make the capitaine understand that his assistance was not absolutely necessary to her but then she had an inward fear that her green spectacles would not now be as efficacious on adolphe as they had once been in old days before he had seen the world and become a man it might be necessary that her son being a man should be opposed by a man so the capitaine was invited to the conference what took place there need not be described at length the three were closeted for two hours at the end of which time they came forth together the countenance of madame bauche was serene and comfortable her hopes of ultimate success ran higher than ever the face of the capitaine was masked as are always the faces of great diplomatists he walked placid and upright raising his wooden leg with an ease and skill that was absolutely marvellous but poor adolphes brow was clouded yes poor adolphe for he was poor in spirit he had pledged himself to give up marie and to accept the liberal allowance which his mother tendered him but it remained for him now to communicate these tidings to marie herself could not you tell her he had said to his mother with very little of that manliness in his face on which his mother now so prided herself but la mre bauche explained to him that it was a part of the general agreement that marie was to hear his decision from his own mouth but you need not regard it said the capitaine with the most indifferent air in the world the girl expects it only she has some childish idea that she is bound till you yourself release her i dont think she will be troublesome adolphe at that moment did feel that he should have liked to kick the capitaine out of his mothers house and where should the meeting take place in the hall of the bathhouse suggested madame bauche because as she observed they could walk round and round and nobody ever went there at that time of day but to this adolphe objected it would be so cold and dismal and melancholy the capitaine thought that mre bauches little parlour was the place but la mre herself did not like this they might be overheard as she well knew and she guessed that the meeting would not conclude without some sobs that would certainly be bitter and might perhaps be loud send her up to the grotto and i will follow her said adolphe on this therefore they agreed now the grotto was a natural excavation in a high rock which stood precipitously upright over the establishment of the baths a steep zigzag path with almost neverending steps had been made along the face of the rock from a little flower garden attached to the house which lay immediately under the mountain close along the front of the hotel ran a little brawling river leaving barely room for a road between it and the door over this there was a wooden bridge leading to the garden and some two or three hundred yards from the bridge began the steps by which the ascent was made to the grotto when the season was full and the weather perfectly warm the place was much frequented there was a green table in it and four or five deal chairs a green garden seat also was there which however had been removed into the innermost back corner of the excavation as its hinder legs were somewhat at fault a wall about two feet high ran along the face of it guarding its occupants from the precipice in fact it was no grotto but a little chasm in the rock such as we often see up above our heads in rocky valleys and which by means of these steep steps had been turned into a source of exercise and amusement for the visitors at the hotel standing at the wall one could look down into the garden and down also upon the shining slate roof of madame bauches house and to the left might be seen the sombre silent snowcapped top of stern old canigou king of mountains among those eastern pyrenees and so madame bauche undertook to send marie up to the grotto and adolphe undertook to follow her thither it was now spring and though the winds had fallen and the snow was no longer lying on the lower peaks still the air was fresh and cold and there was no danger that any of the few guests at the establishment would visit the place make her put on her cloak mre bauche said the capitaine who did not wish that his bride should have a cold in her head on their weddingday la mre bauche pished and pshawed as though she were not minded to pay any attention to recommendations on such subjects from the capitaine but nevertheless when marie was seen slowly to creep across the little bridge about fifteen minutes after this time she had a handkerchief on her head and was closely wrapped in a dark brown cloak poor marie herself little heeded the cold fresh air but she was glad to avail herself of any means by which she might hide her face when madame bauche sought her out in her own little room and with a smiling face and kind kiss bade her go to the grotto she knew or fancied that she knew that it was all over he will tell you all the truthhow it all is said la mre we will do all we can you know to make you happy marie but you must remember what monsieur le cur told us the other day in this vale of tears we cannot have everything as we shall have some day when our poor wicked souls have been purged of all their wickedness now go dear and take your cloak yes maman and adolphe will come to you and try and behave well like a sensible girl yes mamanand so she went bearing on her brow another sacrificial kissand bearing in her heart such an unutterable load of woe adolphe had gone out of the house before her but standing in the stable yard well within the gate so that she should not see him he watched her slowly crossing the bridge and mounting the first flight of the steps he had often seen her tripping up those stairs and had almost as often followed her with his quicker feet and she when she would hear him would run and then he would catch her breathless at the top and steal kisses from her when all power of refusing them had been robbed from her by her efforts at escape there was no such running now no such following no thought of such kisses as for him he would fain have skulked off and shirked the interview had he dared but he did not dare so he waited there out of heart for some ten minutes speaking a word now and then to the bathman who was standing by just to show that he was at his ease but the bathman knew that he was not at his ease such wouldbe lies as those rarely achieve deceptionare rarely believed and then at the end of the ten minutes with steps as slow as maries had been he also ascended to the grotto marie had watched him from the top but so that she herself should not be seen he however had not once lifted up his head to look for her but with eyes turned to the ground had plodded his way up to the cave when he entered she was standing in the middle with her eyes downcast and her hands clasped before her she had retired some way from the wall so that no eyes might possibly see her but those of her false lover there she stood when he entered striving to stand motionless but trembling like a leaf in every limb it was only when he reached the top step that he made up his mind how he would behave perhaps after all the capitaine was right perhaps she would not mind it marie said he with a voice that attempted to be cheerful this is an odd place to meet in after such a long absence and he held out his hand to her but only his hand he offered her no salute he did not even kiss her cheek as a brother would have done of the rules of the outside world it must be remembered that poor marie knew but little he had been a brother to her before he had become her lover but marie took his hand saying yes it has been very long and now that i have come back he went on to say it seems that we are all in a confusion together i never knew such a piece of work however it is all for the best i suppose perhaps so said marie still trembling violently and still looking down upon the ground and then there was silence between them for a minute or so i tell you what it is marie said adolphe at last dropping her hand and making a great effort to get through the work before him i am afraid we two have been very foolish dont you think we have now it seems quite clear that we can never get ourselves married dont you see it in that light maries head turned round and round with her but she was not of the fainting order she took three steps backwards and leant against the wall of the cave she also was trying to think how she might best fight her battle was there no chance for her could no eloquence no love prevail on her own beauty she counted but little but might not prayers do something and a reference to those old vows which had been so frequent so eager so solemnly pledged between them never get ourselves married she said repeating his words never adolphe can we never be married upon my word my dear girl i fear not you see my mother is so dead against it but we could wait could we not ah but thats just it marie we cannot wait we must decide nowtoday you see i can do nothing without money from herand as for you you see she wont even let you stay in the house unless you marry old campan at once hes a very good sort of fellow though old as he is and if you do marry him why you see youll stay here and have it all your own way in everything as for me i shall come and see you all from time to time and shall be able to push my way as i ought to do then adolphe you wish me to marry the capitaine upon my honour i think it is the best thing you can do i do indeed oh adolphe what can i do for you you know suppose i was to go down to my mother and tell her that i had decided to keep you myself what would come of it look at it in that light marie she could not turn you outyou her own son but she would turn you out and deuced quick too i can assure you of that i can upon my honour i should not care that and she made a motion with her hand to show how indifferent she would be to such treatment as regarded herself not that if i still had the promise of your love but what would you do i would work there are other houses beside that one and she pointed to the slate roof of the bauche establishment and for mei should not have a penny in the world said the young man she came up to him and took his right hand between both of hers and pressed it warmly oh so warmly you would have my love said she my deepest warmest best hearts love i should want nothing more nothing on earth if i could still have yours and she leaned against his shoulder and looked with all her eyes into his face but marie thats nonsense you know no adolphe it is not nonsense do not let them teach you so what does love mean if it does not mean that oh adolphe you do love me you do love me you do love me yesi love you he said slowlyas though he would not have said it if he could have helped it and then his arm crept slowly round her waist as though in that also he could not help himself and do not i love you said the passionate girl oh i do so dearly with all my heart with all my soul adolphe i so love you that i cannot give you up have i not sworn to be yours sworn sworn a thousand times how can i marry that man oh adolphe how can you wish that i should marry him and she clung to him and looked at him and besought him with her eyes i shouldnt wish itonly and then he paused it was hard to tell her that he was willing to sacrifice her to the old man because he wanted money from his mother only what but adolphe do not wish it at all have you not sworn that i should be your wife look here look at this and she brought out from her bosom a little charm that he had given her in return for that cross did you not kiss that when you swore before the figure of the virgin that i should be your wife and do you not remember that i feared to swear too because your mother was so angry and then you made me after that adolphe oh adolphe tell me that i may have some hope i will wait oh i will wait so patiently he turned himself away from her and walked backwards and forwards uneasily through the grotto he did love herlove her as such men do love sweet pretty girls the warmth of her hand the affection of her touch the pure bright passion of her tearladen eye had reawakened what power of love there was within him but what was he to do even if he were willing to give up the immediate golden hopes which his mother held out to him how was he to begin and then how carry out this work of selfdevotion marie would be turned away and he would be left a victim in the hands of his mother and of that stiff woodenlegged militairea penniless victim left to mope about the place without a grain of influence or a morsel of pleasure but what can we do he exclaimed again as he once more met maries searching eye we can be true and honest and we can wait she said coming close up to him and taking hold of his arm i do not fear it and she is not my mother adolphe you need not fear your own mother fear no of course i dont fear but i dont see how the very devil we can manage it will you let me tell her that i will not marry the capitaine that i will not give up your promises and then i am ready to leave the house it would do no good it would do every good adolphe if i had your promised word once more if i could hear from your own voice one more tone of love do you not remember this place it was here that you forced me to say that i loved you it is here also that you will tell me that i have been deceived it is not i that would deceive you he said i wonder that you should be so hard upon me god knows that i have trouble enough well if i am a trouble to you be it so be it as you wish and she leaned back against the wall of the rock and crossing her arms upon her breast looked away from him and fixed her eyes upon the sharp granite peaks of canigou he again betook himself to walk backwards and forwards through the cave he had quite enough of love for her to make him wish to marry her quite enough now at this moment to make the idea of her marriage with the capitaine very distasteful to him enough probably to make him become a decently good husband to her should fate enable him to marry her but not enough to enable him to support all the punishment which would be the sure effects of his mothers displeasure besides he had promised his mother that he would give up mariehad entirely given in his adhesion to that plan of the marriage with the capitaine he had owned that the path of life as marked out for him by his mother was the one which it behoved him as a man to follow it was this view of his duties as a man which had been specially urged on him with all the capitaines eloquence and old campan had entirely succeeded it is so easy to get the assent of such young men so weak in mind and so weak in pocket when the arguments are backed by a promise of two thousand francs a year ill tell you what ill do at last he said ill get my mother by herself and will ask her to let the matter remain as it is for the present not if it be a trouble m adolphe and the proud girl still held her hands upon her bosom and still looked towards the mountain you know what i mean marie you can understand how she and the capitaine are worrying me but tell me adolphe do you love me you know i love you only and you will not give me up i will ask my mother i will try and make her yield marie could not feel that she received much confidence from her lovers promise but still even that weak and unsteady as it was even that was better than absolute fixed rejection so she thanked him promised him with tears in her eyes that she would always always be faithful to him and then bade him go down to the house she would follow she said as soon as his passing had ceased to be observed then she looked at him as though she expected some sign of renewed love but no such sign was vouchsafed to her now that she thirsted for the touch of his lip upon her cheek it was denied to her he did as she bade him he went down slowly loitering by himself and in about half an hour she followed him and unobserved crept to her chamber again we will pass over what took place between the mother and the son but late in that evening after the guests had gone to bed marie received a message desiring her to wait on madame bauche in a small salon which looked out from one end of the house it was intended as a private sittingroom should any special stranger arrive who required such accommodation and therefore was but seldom used here she found la mre bauche sitting in an armchair behind a small table on which stood two candles and on a sofa against the wall sat adolphe the capitaine was not in the room shut the door marie and come in and sit down said madame bauche it was easy to understand from the tone of her voice that she was angry and stern in an unbending mood and resolved to carry out to the very letter all the threats conveyed by those terrible spectacles marie did as she was bid she closed the door and sat down on the chair that was nearest to her marie said la mre baucheand the voice sounded fierce in the poor girls ears and an angry fire glimmered through the green glasseswhat is all this about that i hear do you dare to say that you hold my son bound to marry you and then the august mother paused for an answer but marie had no answer to give she looked suppliantly towards her lover as though beseeching him to carry on the fight for her but if she could not do battle for herself certainly he could not do it for her what little amount of fighting he had had in him had been thoroughly vanquished before her arrival i will have an answer and that immediately said madame bauche i am not going to be betrayed into ignominy and disgrace by the object of my own charity who picked you out of the gutter miss and brought you up and fed you when you would otherwise have gone to the foundling and this is your gratitude for it all you are not satisfied with being fed and clothed and cherished by me but you must rob me of my son know this then adolphe shall never marry a child of charity such as you are marie sat still stunned by the harshness of these words la mre bauche had often scolded her indeed she was given to much scolding but she had scolded her as a mother may scold a child and when this story of maries love first reached her ears she had been very angry but her anger had never brought her to such a pass as this indeed marie had not hitherto been taught to look at the matter in this light no one had heretofore twitted her with eating the bread of charity it had not occurred to her that on this account she was unfit to be adolphes wife there in that valley they were all so nearly equal that no idea of her own inferiority had ever pressed itself upon her mind but now when the voice ceased she again looked at him but it was no longer a beseeching look did he also altogether scorn her that was now the inquiry which her eyes were called upon to make no she could not say that he did it seemed to her that his energies were chiefly occupied in pulling to pieces the tassel on the sofa cushion and now miss let me know at once whether this nonsense is to be over or not continued la mre bauche and i will tell you at once i am not going to maintain you here in my house to plot against our welfare and happiness as marie clavert you shall not stay here capitaine campan is willing to marry you and as his wife i will keep my word to you though you little deserve it if you refuse to marry him you must go as to my son he is there and he will tell you now in my presence that he altogether declines the honour you propose for him and then she ceased waiting for an answer drumming the table with a wafer stamp which happened to be ready to her hand but marie said nothing adolphe had been appealed to but adolphe had not yet spoken well miss said la mre bauche then marie rose from her seat and walking round she touched adolphe lightly on the shoulder adolphe she said it is for you to speak now i will do as you bid me he gave a long sigh looked first at marie and then at his mother shook himself slightly and then spoke upon my word marie i think mother is right it would never do for us to marry it would not indeed then it is decided said marie returning to her chair and you will marry the capitaine said la mre bauche marie merely bowed her head in token of acquiescence then we are friends again come here marie and kiss me you must know that it is my duty to take care of my own son but i dont want to be angry with you if i can help it i dont indeed when once you are madame campan you shall be my own child and you shall have any room in the house you like to choosethere and she once more imprinted a kiss on maries cold forehead how they all got out of the room and off to their own chambers i can hardly tell but in five minutes from the time of this last kiss they were divided la mre bauche had patted marie and smiled on her and called her her dear good little madame campan her young little mistress of the htel bauche and had then got herself into her own room satisfied with her own victory nor must my readers be too severe on madame bauche she had already done much for marie clavert and when she found herself once more by her own bedside she prayed to be forgiven for the cruelty which she felt that she had shown to the orphan but in making this prayer with her favourite crucifix in her hand and the little image of the virgin before her she pleaded her duty to her son was it not right she asked the virgin that she should save her son from a bad marriage and then she promised ever so much of recompense both to the virgin and to marie a new trousseau for each with candles to the virgin with a gold watch and chain for marie as soon as she should be marie campan she had been cruel she acknowledged it but at such a crisis was it not defensible and then the recompense should be so full but there was one other meeting that night very short indeed but not the less significant not long after they had all separated just so long as to allow of the house being quiet adolphe still sitting in his room meditating on what the day had done for him heard a low tap at his door come in he said as men always do say and marie opening the door stood just within the verge of his chamber she had on her countenance neither the soft look of entreating love which she had worn up there in the grotto nor did she appear crushed and subdued as she had done before his mother she carried her head somewhat more erect than usual and looked boldly out at him from under her soft eyelashes there might still be love there but it was love proudly resolving to quell itself adolphe as he looked at her felt that he was afraid of her it is all over then between us m adolphe she said well yes dont you think it had better be so eh marie and this is the meaning of oaths and vows sworn to each other so sacredly but marie you heard what my mother said oh sir i have not come to ask you again to love me oh no i am not thinking of that but this this would be a lie if i kept it now it would choke me if i wore it as that mans wife take it back and she tendered to him the little charm which she had always worn round her neck since he had given it to her he took it abstractedly without thinking what he did and placed it on his dressingtable and you she continued can you still keep that cross oh no you must give me back that it would remind you too often of vows that were untrue marie he said do not be so harsh to me harsh said she no there has been enough of harshness i would not be harsh to you adolphe but give me the cross it would prove a curse to you if you kept it he then opened a little box which stood upon the table and taking out the cross gave it to her and now goodbye she said we shall have but little more to say to each other i know this now that i was wrong ever to have loved you i should have been to you as one of the other poor girls in the house but oh how was i to help it to this he made no answer and she closing the door softly went back to her chamber and thus ended the first day of adolphe bauches return to his own house on the next morning the capitaine and marie were formally betrothed this was done with some little ceremony in the presence of all the guests who were staying at the establishment and with all manner of gracious acknowledgments of maries virtues it seemed as though la mre bauche could not be courteous enough to her there was no more talk of her being a child of charity no more allusion now to the gutter la mre bauche with her own hand brought her cake with a glass of wine after her betrothal was over and patted her on the cheek and called her her dear little marie campan and then the capitaine was made up of infinite politeness and the guests all wished her joy and the servants of the house began to perceive that she was a person entitled to respect how different was all this from that harsh attack that was made on her the preceding evening only adolphehe alone kept aloof though he was present there he said nothing he and he only offered no congratulations in the midst of all these gala doings marie herself said little or nothing la mre bauche perceived this but she forgave it angrily as she had expressed herself at the idea of maries daring to love her son she had still acknowledged within her own heart that such love had been natural she could feel no pity for marie as long as adolphe was in danger but now she knew how to pity her so marie was still petted and still encouraged though she went through the days work sullenly and in silence as to the capitaine it was all one to him he was a man of the world he did not expect that he should really be preferred con amore to a young fellow like adolphe but he did expect that marie like other girls would do as she was bid and that in a few days she would regain her temper and be reconciled to her life and then the marriage was fixed for a very early day for as la mre said what was the use of waiting all their minds were made up now and therefore the sooner the two were married the better did not the capitaine think so the capitaine said that he did think so and then marie was asked it was all one to her she said whatever maman bauche liked that she would do only she would not name a day herself indeed she would neither do nor say anything herself which tended in any way to a furtherance of these matrimonials but then she acquiesced quietly enough if not readily in what other people did and said and so the marriage was fixed for the day week after adolphes return the whole of that week passed much in the same way the servants about the place spoke among themselves of maries perverseness obstinacy and ingratitude because she would not look pleased or answer madame bauches courtesies with gratitude but la mre herself showed no signs of anger marie had yielded to her and she required no more and she remembered also the harsh words she had used to gain her purpose and she reflected on all that marie had lost on these accounts she was forbearing and exacted nothingnothing but that one sacrifice which was to be made in accordance to her wishes and it was made they were married in the great salon the diningroom immediately after breakfast madame bauche was dressed in a new puce silk dress and looked very magnificent on the occasion she simpered and smiled and looked gay even in spite of her spectacles and as the ceremony was being performed she held fast clutched in her hand the gold watch and chain which were intended for marie as soon as ever the marriage should be completed the capitaine was dressed exactly as usual only that all his clothes were new madame bauche had endeavoured to persuade him to wear a blue coat but he answered that such a change would not he was sure be to maries taste to tell the truth marie would hardly have known the difference had he presented himself in scarlet vestments adolphe however was dressed very finely but he did not make himself prominent on the occasion marie watched him closely though none saw that she did so and of his garments she could have given an account with much accuracyof his garments ay and of every look is he a man she said at last to herself that he can stand by and see all this she too was dressed in silk they had put on her what they pleased and she bore the burden of her wedding finery without complaint and without pride there was no blush on her face as she walked up to the table at which the priest stood nor hesitation in her low voice as she made the necessary answers she put her hand into that of the capitaine when required to do so and when the ring was put on her finger she shuddered but ever so slightly no one observed it but la mre bauche in one week she will be used to it and then we shall all be happy said la mre to herself and ii will be so kind to her and so the marriage was completed and the watch was at once given to marie thank you maman said she as the trinket was fastened to her girdle had it been a pincushion that had cost three sous it would have affected her as much and then there was cake and wine and sweetmeats and after a few minutes marie disappeared for an hour or so the capitaine was taken up with the congratulations of his friends and with the efforts necessary to the wearing of his new honours with an air of ease but after that time he began to be uneasy because his wife did not come to him at two or three in the afternoon he went to la mre bauche to complain this lackadaisical nonsense is no good he said at any rate it is too late now marie had better come down among us and show herself satisfied with her husband but madame bauche took maries part you must not be too hard on marie she said she has gone through a good deal this week past and is very young whereas capitaine you are not very young the capitaine merely shrugged his shoulders in the mean time mre bauche went up to visit her protge in her own room and came down with a report that she was suffering from a headache she could not appear at dinner madame bauche said but would make one at the little party which was to be given in the evening with this the capitaine was forced to be content the dinner therefore went on quietly without her much as it did on other ordinary days and then there was a little time for vacancy during which the gentlemen drank their coffee and smoked their cigars at the caf talking over the event that had taken place that morning and the ladies brushed their hair and added some ribbon or some brooch to their usual apparel twice during this time did madame bauche go up to maries room with offers to assist her not yet maman not quite yet said marie piteously through her tears and then twice did the green spectacles leave the room covering eyes which also were not dry ah what had she done what had she dared to take upon herself to do she could not undo it now and then it became quite dark in the passages and out of doors and the guests assembled in the salon la mre came in and out three or four times uneasy in her gait and unpleasant in her aspect and everybody began to see that things were wrong she is ill i am afraid said one the excitement has been too much said a second and he is so old whispered a third and the capitaine stalked about erect on his wooden leg taking snuff and striving to look indifferent but he also was uneasy in his mind presently la mre came in again with a quicker step than before and whispered something first to adolphe and then to the capitaine whereupon they both followed her out of the room not in her chamber said adolphe then she must be in yours said the capitaine she is in neither said la mre bauche with her sternest voice nor is she in the house and now there was no longer an affectation of indifference on the part of any of them they were anything but indifferent the capitaine was eager in his demands that the matter should still be kept secret from the guests she had always been romantic he said and had now gone out to walk by the riverside they three and the old bathman would go out and look for her but it is pitch dark said la mre bauche we will take lanterns said the capitaine and so they sallied forth with creeping steps over the gravel so that they might not be heard by those within and proceeded to search for the young wife marie marie said la mre bauche in piteous accents do come to me pray do hush said the capitaine theyll hear you if you call he could not endure that the world should learn that a marriage with him had been so distasteful to marie clavert marie dear marie called madame bauche louder than before quite regardless of the capitaines feelings but no marie answered in her innermost heart now did la mre bauche wish that this cruel marriage had been left undone adolphe was foremost with his lamp but he hardly dared to look in the spot where he felt that it was most likely that she should have taken refuge how could he meet her again alone in that grotto yet he alone of the four was young it was clearly for him to ascend marie he shouted are you there as he slowly began the long ascent of the steps but he had hardly begun to mount when a whirring sound struck his ear and he felt that the air near him was moved and then there was a crash upon the lower platform of rock and a moan repeated twice but so faintly and a rustle of silk and a slight struggle somewhere as he knew within twenty paces of him and then all was again quiet and still in the night air what was that asked the capitaine in a hoarse voice he made his way half across the little garden and he also was within forty or fifty yards of the flat rock but adolphe was unable to answer him he had fainted and the lamp had fallen from his hands and rolled to the bottom of the steps but the capitaine though even his heart was all but quenched within him had still strength enough to make his way up to the rock and there holding the lantern above his eyes he saw all that was left for him to see of his bride as for la mre bauche she never again sat at the head of that tablenever again dictated to guestsnever again laid down laws for the management of any one a poor bedridden old woman she lay there in her house at vernet for some seven tedious years and then was gathered to her fathers as for the capitainebut what matters he was made of sterner stuff what matters either the fate of such a one as adolphe bauche the oconors of castle conor county mayo i shall never forget my first introduction to country life in ireland my first days hunting there or the manner in which i passed the evening afterwards nor shall i ever cease to be grateful for the hospitality which i received from the oconors of castle conor my acquaintance with the family was first made in the following manner but before i begin my story let me inform my reader that my name is archibald green i had been for a fortnight in dublin and was about to proceed into county mayo on business which would occupy me there for some weeks my headquarters would i found be at the town of ballyglass and i soon learned that ballyglass was not a place in which i should find hotel accommodation of a luxurious kind or much congenial society indigenous to the place itself but you are a hunting man you say said old sir p c and in that case you will soon know tom oconor tom wont let you be dull id write you a letter to tom only hell certainly make you out without my taking the trouble i did think at the time that the old baronet might have written the letter for me as he had been a friend of my fathers in former days but he did not and i started for ballyglass with no other introduction to any one in the county than that contained in sir ps promise that i should soon know mr thomas oconor i had already provided myself with a horse groom saddle and bridle and these i sent down en avant that the ballyglassians might know that i was somebody perhaps before i arrived tom oconor might learn that a hunting man was coming into the neighbourhood and i might find at the inn a polite note intimating that a bed was at my service at castle conor i had heard so much of the free hospitality of the irish gentry as to imagine that such a thing might be possible but i found nothing of the kind hunting gentlemen in those days were very common in county mayo and one horse was no great evidence of a mans standing in the world men there as i learnt afterwards are sought for themselves quite as much as they are elsewhere and though my grooms topboots were neat and my horse a very tidy animal my entry into ballyglass created no sensation whatever in about four days after my arrival when i was already infinitely disgusted with the little pothouse in which i was forced to stay and had made up my mind that the people in county mayo were a churlish set i sent my horse on to a meet of the foxhounds and followed after myself on an open car no one but an erratic foxhunter such as i ama foxhunter i mean whose lot it has been to wander about from one pack of hounds to anothercan understand the melancholy feeling which a man has when he first intrudes himself unknown by any one among an entirely new set of sportsmen when a stranger falls thus as it were out of the moon into a hunt it is impossible that men should not stare at him and ask who he is and it is so disagreeable to be stared at and to have such questions asked this feeling does not come upon a man in leicestershire or gloucestershire where the numbers are large and a stranger or two will always be overlooked but in small hunting fields it is so painful that a man has to pluck up much courage before he encounters it we met on the morning in question at binghams grove there were not above twelve or fifteen men out all of whom or nearly all were cousins to each other they seemed to be all toms and pats and larrys and micks i was done up very knowingly in pink and thought that i looked quite the thing but for two or three hours nobody noticed me i had my eyes about me however and soon found out which of them was tom oconor he was a finelooking fellow thin and tall but not largely made with a piercing gray eye and a beautiful voice for speaking to a hound he had two sons there also short slight fellows but exquisite horsemen i already felt that i had a kind of acquaintance with the father but i hardly knew on what ground to put in my claim we had no sport early in the morning it was a cold bleak february day with occasional storms of sleet we rode from cover to cover but all in vain i am sorry sir that we are to have such a bad day as you are a stranger here said one gentleman to me this was jack oconor toms eldest son my bosom friend for many a year after poor jack i fear that the encumbered estates court sent him altogether adrift upon the world we may still have a run from poulnaroe if the gentleman chooses to come on said a voice coming from behind with a sharp trot it was tom oconor wherever the hounds go ill follow said i then come on to poulnaroe said mr oconor i trotted on quickly by his side and before we reached the cover had managed to slip in something about sir p c what the deuce said he what a friend of sir ps why the deuce didnt you tell me so what are you doing down here where are you staying c c c at poulnaroe we found a fox but before we did so mr oconor had asked me over to castle conor and this he did in such a way that there was no possibility of refusing himor i should rather say of disobeying him for his invitation came quite in the tone of a command youll come to us of course when the day is overand let me see were near ballyglass now but the run will be right away in our direction just send word for them to send your things to castle conor but theyre all about and unpacked said i never mind write a note and say what you want now and go and get the rest tomorrow yourself here patseypatsey run into ballyglass for this gentleman at once now dont be long for the chances are we shall find here and then after giving some further hurried instructions he left me to write a line in pencil to the innkeepers wife on the back of a ditch this i accordingly did send my small portmanteau i said and all my black dress clothes and shirts and socks and all that and above all my dressing things which are on the little table and the satin neckhandkerchief and whatever you do mind you send my pumps and i underscored the latter word for jack oconor when his father left me went on pressing the invitation my sisters are going to get up a dance said he and if you are fond of that kind of things perhaps we can amuse you now in those days i was very fond of dancingand very fond of young ladies too and therefore glad enough to learn that tom oconor had daughters as well as sons on this account i was very particular in underscoring the word pumps and hurry you young divil jack oconor said to patsey i have told him to take the portmanteau over on a car said i all right then youll find it there on our arrival we had an excellent run in which i may make bold to say that i did not acquit myself badly i stuck very close to the hounds as did the whole of the oconor brood and when the fellow contrived to earth himself as he did i received those compliments on my horse which is the most approved praise which one foxhunter ever gives to another well buy that fellow of you before we let you go said peter the youngest son i advise you to look sharp after your money if you sell him to my brother said jack and then we trotted slowly off to castle conor which however was by no means near to us we have ten miles to gogood irish miles said the father i dont know that i ever remember a fox from poulnaroe taking that line before he wasnt a poulnaroe fox said peter i dont know that said jack and then they debated that question hotly our horses were very tired and it was late before we reached mr oconors house that getting home from hunting with a thoroughly weary animal who has no longer sympathy or example to carry him on is very tedious work in the present instance i had company with me but when a man is alone when his horse toes at every ten steps when the night is dark and the rain pouring and there are yet eight miles of road to be conqueredat such times a man is almost apt to swear that he will give up hunting at last we were in the castle conor stable yardfor we had approached the house by some back way and as we entered the house by a door leading through a wilderness of back passages mr oconor said out loud now boys remember i sit down to dinner in twenty minutes and then turning expressly to me he laid his hand kindly upon my shoulder and said i hope you will make yourself quite at home at castle conorand whatever you do dont keep us waiting for dinner you can dress in twenty minutes i suppose in ten said i glibly thats well jack and peter will show you your room and so he turned away and left us my two young friends made their way into the great hall and thence into the drawingroom and i followed them we were all dressed in pink and had waded deep through bog and mud i did not exactly know whither i was being led in this guise but i soon found myself in the presence of two young ladies and of a girl about thirteen years of age my sisters said jack introducing me very laconically miss oconor miss kate oconor miss tizzy oconor my name is not tizzy said the younger its eliza how do you do sir i hope you had a fine hunt was papa well up jack jack did not condescend to answer this question but asked one of the elder girls whether anything had come and whether a room had been made ready for me oh yes said miss oconor they came i know for i saw them brought into the house and i hope mr green will find everything comfortable as she said this i thought i saw a slight smile steal across her remarkably pretty mouth they were both exceedingly pretty girls fanny the elder wore long glossy curlsfor i write oh reader of bygone days as long ago as that when ladies wore curls if it pleased them so to do and gentlemen danced in pumps with black handkerchiefs round their necksyes long black or nearly black silken curls and then she had such eyesi never knew whether they were most wicked or most bright and her face was all dimples and each dimple was laden with laughter and laden with love kate was probably the prettier girl of the two but on the whole not so attractive she was fairer than her sister and wore her hair in braids and was also somewhat more demure in her manner in spite of the special injunctions of mr oconor senior it was impossible not to loiter for five minutes over the drawingroom fire talking to these hourismore especially as i seemed to know them intimately by intuition before half of the five minutes was over they were so easy so pretty so graceful so kind they seemed to take it so much as a matter of course that i should stand there talking in my red coat and muddy boots well do go and dress yourselves at last said fanny pretending to speak to her brothers but looking more especially at me you know how mad papa will be and remember mr green we expect great things from your dancing tonight your coming just at this time is such a godsend and again that soupon of a smile passed over her face i hurried up to my room peter and jack coming with me to the door is everything right said peter looking among the towels and waterjugs theyve given you a decent fire for a wonder said jack stirring up the red hot turf which blazed in the grate all right as a trivet said i and look alive like a good fellow said jack we had scowled at each other in the morning as very young men do when they are strangers and now after a few hours we were intimate friends i immediately turned to my work and was gratified to find that all my things were laid out ready for dressing my portmanteau had of course come open as my keys were in my pocket and therefore some of the excellent servants of the house had been able to save me all the trouble of unpacking there was my shirt hanging before the fire my black clothes were spread upon the bed my socks and collar and handkerchief beside them my brushes were on the toilet table and everything prepared exactly as though my own man had been there how nice i immediately went to work at getting off my spurs and boots and then proceeded to loosen the buttons at my knees in doing this i sat down in the armchair which had been drawn up for me opposite the fire but what was the object on which my eyes then fellthe objects i should rather say immediately in front of my chair was placed just ready for my feet an enormous pair of shootingbootshalfboots made to lace up round the ankles with thick double leather soles and each bearing half a stone of iron in the shape of nails and heelpieces i had superintended the making of these shoes in burlington arcade with the greatest diligence i was never a good shot and like some other sportsmen intended to make up for my deficiency in performance by the excellence of my shooting apparel those nails are not large enough i had said nor nearly large enough but when the boots came home they struck even me as being too heavy too metalsome he he he laughed the boot boy as he turned them up for me to look at it may therefore be imagined of what nature were the articles which were thus set out for the evenings dancing and then the way in which they were placed when i saw this the conviction flew across my mind like a flash of lightning that the preparation had been made under other eyes than those of the servant the heavy big boots were placed so prettily before the chair and the strings of each were made to dangle down at the sides as though just ready for tying they seemed to say the boots did now make haste we at any rate are readyyou cannot say that you were kept waiting for us no mere servants hand had ever enabled a pair of boots to laugh at one so completely but what was i to do i rushed at the small portmanteau thinking that my pumps also might be there the woman surely could not have been such a fool as to send me those tons of iron for my evening wear but alas alas no pumps were there there was nothing else in the way of covering for my feet not even a pair of slippers and now what was i to do the absolute magnitude of my misfortune only loomed upon me by degrees the twenty minutes allowed by that stern old paterfamilias were already gone and i had done nothing towards dressing and indeed it was impossible that i should do anything that would be of avail i could not go down to dinner in my stocking feet nor could i put on my black dress trousers over a pair of mudpainted topboots as for those ironsoled horrors and then i gave one of them a kick with the side of my bare foot which sent it half way under the bed but what was i to do i began washing myself and brushing my hair with this horrid weight upon my mind my first plan was to go to bed and send down word that i had been taken suddenly ill in the stomach then to rise early in the morning and get away unobserved but by such a course of action i should lose all chance of any further acquaintance with those pretty girls that they were already aware of the extent of my predicament and were now enjoying itof that i was quite sure what if i boldly put on the shootingboots and clattered down to dinner in them what if i took the bull by the horns and made myself the most of the joke this might be very well for the dinner but it would be a bad joke for me when the hour for dancing came and alas i felt that i lacked the courage it is not every man that can walk down to dinner in a strange house full of ladies wearing such boots as those i have described should i not attempt to borrow a pair this all the world will say should have been my first idea but i have not yet mentioned that i am myself a largeboned man and that my feet are especially well developed i had never for a moment entertained a hope that i should find any one in that house whose boot i could wear but at last i rang the bell i would send for jack and if everything failed i would communicate my grief to him i had to ring twice before anybody came the servants i well knew were putting the dinner on the table at last a man entered the room dressed in rather shabby black whom i afterwards learned to be the butler what is your name my friend said i determined to make an ally of the man my name why larry sure yer honer and the masther is out of his sinses in a hurry becase yer honer dont come down is he though well now larry tell me this which of all the gentlemen in the house has got the largest foot is it the largest foot yer honer said larry altogether surprised by my question yes the largest foot and then i proceeded to explain to him my misfortune he took up first my topboot and then the shootingbootin looking at which he gazed with wonder at the nailsand then he glanced at my feet measuring them with his eye and after this he pronounced his opinion yer honer couldnt wear a morsel of leather belonging to ere a one of em young or ould there niver was a foot like that yet among the oconors but are there no strangers staying here theres three or four on em come in to dinner but theyll be wanting their own boots im thinking and theres young misther dillon hes come to stay but lord love you and he again looked at the enormous extent which lay between the heel and the toe of the shooting apparatus which he still held in his hand i niver see such a foot as that in the whole barony he said barring my own now larry was a large man much larger altogether than myself and as he said this i looked down involuntarily at his feet or rather at his foot for as he stood i could only see one and then a sudden hope filled my heart on that foot there glittered a shoenot indeed such as were my own which were now resting ingloriously at ballyglass while they were so sorely needed at castle conor but one which i could wear before ladies without shameand in my present frame of mind with infinite contentment let me look at that one of your own said i to the man as though it were merely a subject for experimental inquiry larry accustomed to obedience took off the shoe and handed it to me my own foot was immediately in it and i found that it fitted me like a glove and now the other said inot smiling for a smile would have put him on his guard but somewhat sternly so that that habit of obedience should not desert him at this perilous moment and then i stretched out my hand but yer honer cant keep em you know said he i havent the ghost of another shoe to my feet but i only looked more sternly than before and still held out my hand custom prevailed larry stooped down slowly looking at me the while and pulling off the other slipper handed it to me with much hesitation alas as i put it to my foot i found that it was old and worn and irredeemably down at heelthat it was in fact no counterpart at all to that other one which was to do duty as its fellow but nevertheless i put my foot into it and felt that a descent to the drawingroom was now possible but yer honer will give em back to a poor man said larry almost crying the masthers mad this minute becase the dinners not up glory to god only listhen to that and as he spoke a tremendous peal rang out from some bell down stairs that had evidently been shaken by an angry hand larry said iand i endeavoured to assume a look of very grave importance as i spokei look to you to assist me in this matter ochwirra sthrue then and will you let me go just listhen to that and another angry peal rang out loud and repeated if you do as i ask you i continued you shall be well rewarded look here look at these boots and i held up the shootingshoes new from burlington arcade they cost thirty shillingsthirty shillings and i will give them to you for the loan of this pair of slippers theyd be no use at all to me yer honer not the laist use in life you could do with them very well for tonight and then you could sell them and here are ten shillings besides and i held out half a sovereign which the poor fellow took into his hand i waited no further parley but immediately walked out of the room with one foot i was sufficiently pleased as regarded that i felt that i had overcome my difficulty but the other was not so satisfactory whenever i attempted to lift it from the ground the horrid slipper would fall off or only just hang by the toe as for dancing that would be out of the question och murther murther sang out larry as he heard me going down stairs what will i do at all tare and ounds there hes at it agin as mad as blazes this last exclamation had reference to another peal which was evidently the work of the masters hand i confess i was not quite comfortable as i walked down stairs in the first place i was nearly half an hour late and i knew from the vigour of the peals that had sounded that my slowness had already been made the subject of strong remarks and then my left shoe went flop flop on every alternate step of the stairs by no exertion of my foot in the drawing up of my toe could i induce it to remain permanently fixed upon my foot but over and above and worse than all this was the conviction strong upon my mind that i should become a subject of merriment to the girls as soon as i entered the room they would understand the cause of my distress and probably at this moment were expecting to hear me clatter through the stone hall with those odious metal boots however i hurried down and entered the drawingroom determined to keep my position near the door so that i might have as little as possible to do on entering and as little as possible in going out but i had other difficulties in store for me i had not as yet been introduced to mrs oconor nor to miss oconor the squires unmarried sister upon my word i thought you were never coming said mr oconor as soon as he saw me it is just one hour since we entered the house jack i wish you would find out what has come to that fellow larry and again he rang the bell he was too angry or it might be too impatient to go through the ceremony of introducing me to anybody i saw that the two girls looked at me very sharply but i stood at the back of an armchair so that no one could see my feet but that little imp tizzy walked round deliberately looked at my heels and then walked back again it was clear that she was in the secret there were eight or ten people in the room but i was too much fluttered to notice well who they were mamma said miss oconor let me introduce mr green to you it luckily happened that mrs oconor was on the same side of the fire as myself and i was able to take the hand which she offered me without coming round into the middle of the circle mrs oconor was a little woman apparently not of much importance in the world but if one might judge from first appearance very goodnatured and my aunt die mr green said kate pointing to a very straightbacked grimlooking lady who occupied a corner of a sofa on the opposite side of the hearth i knew that politeness required that i should walk across the room and make acquaintance with her but under the existing circumstances how was i to obey the dictates of politeness i was determined therefore to stand my ground and merely bowed across the room at miss oconor in so doing i made an enemy who never deserted me during the whole of my intercourse with the family but for her who knows who might have been sitting opposite to me as i now write upon my word mr green the ladies will expect much from an adonis who takes so long over his toilet said tom oconor in that cruel tone of banter which he knew so well how to use you forget father that men in london cant jump in and out of their clothes as quick as we wild irishmen said jack mr green knows that we expect a great deal from him this evening i hope you polk well mr green said kate i muttered something about never dancing but i knew that that which i said was inaudible i dont think mr green will dance said tizzy at least not much the impudence of that child was i think unparalleled by any that i have ever witnessed but in the name of all thats holy why dont we have dinner and mr oconor thundered at the door larry larry larry he screamed yes yer honer itll be all right in two seconds answered larry from some bottomless abyss tare an ages whatll i do at all i heard him continuing as he made his way into the hall oh what a clatter he made upon the pavementfor it was all stone and how the drops of perspiration stood upon my brow as i listened to him and then there was a pause for the man had gone into the diningroom i could see now that mr oconor was becoming very angry and jack the eldest sonoh how often he and i have laughed over all this sinceleft the drawingroom for the second time immediately afterwards larrys footsteps were again heard hurrying across the hall and then there was a great slither and an exclamation and the noise of a falland i could plainly hear poor larrys head strike against the stone floor ochone ochone he cried at the top of his voiceim murthered with em now intirely and d em for bootsst peter be good to me there was a general rush into the hall and i was carried with the stream the poor fellow who had broken his head would be sure to tell how i had robbed him of his shoes the coachman was already helping him up and peter goodnaturedly lent a hand what on earth is the matter said mr oconor he must be tipsy whispered miss oconor the maiden sister i aint tipsy at all thin said larry getting up and rubbing the back of his head and sundry other parts of his body tipsy indeed and then he added when he was quite upright the dinner is sarvedat last and he bore it all without telling ill give that fellow a guinea tomorrow morning said i to myselfif its the last that i have in the world i shall never forget the countenance of the miss oconors as larry scrambled up cursing the unfortunate bootswhat on earth has he got on said mr oconor sorrow take em for shoes ejaculated larry but his spirit was good and he said not a word to betray me we all then went in to dinner how we best could it was useless for us to go back into the drawingroom that each might seek his own partner mr oconor the masther not caring much for the girls who were around him and being already half beside himself with the confusion and delay led the way by himself i as a stranger should have given my arm to mrs oconor but as it was i took her eldest daughter instead and contrived to shuffle along into the diningroom without exciting much attention and when there i found myself happily placed between kate and fanny i never knew anything so awkward said fanny i declare i cant conceive what has come to our old servant larry hes generally the most precise person in the world and now he is nearly an hour lateand then he tumbles down in the hall i am afraid i am responsible for the delay said i but not for the tumble i suppose said kate from the other side i felt that i blushed up to the eyes but i did not dare to enter into explanations tom said tizzy addressing her father across the table i hope you had a good run today it did seem odd to me that a young lady should call her father tom but such was the fact well pretty well said mr oconor and i hope you were up with the hounds you may ask mr green that he at any rate was with them and therefore he can tell you oh he wasnt before you i know no englishman could get before youi am quite sure of that dont you be impertinent miss said kate you can easily see mr green that papa spoils my sister eliza do you hunt in topboots mr green said tizzy to this i made no answer she would have drawn me into a conversation about my feet in half a minute and the slightest allusion to the subject threw me into a fit of perspiration are you fond of hunting miss oconor asked i blindly hurrying into any other subject of conversation miss oconor owned that she was fond of huntingjust a little only papa would not allow it when the hounds met anywhere within reach of castle conor she and kate would ride out to look at them and if papa was not there that dayan omission of rare occurrencethey would ride a few fields with the hounds but he lets tizzy keep with them the whole day said she whispering and has tizzy a pony of her own oh yes tizzy has everything shes papas pet you know and whose pet are you i asked ohi am nobodys pet unless sometimes jack makes a pet of me when hes in a good humour do you make pets of your sisters mr green i have none but if i had i should not make pets of them not of your own sisters no as for myself id sooner make a pet of my friends sister a great deal how very unnatural said miss oconor with the prettiest look of surprise imaginable not at all unnatural i think said i looking tenderly and lovingly into her face where does one find girls so pretty so easy so sweet so talkative as the irish girls and then with all their talking and all their ease who ever hears of their misbehaving they certainly love flirting as they also love dancing but they flirt without mischief and without malice i had now quite forgotten my misfortune and was beginning to think how well i should like to have fanny oconor for my wife in this frame of mind i was bending over towards her as a servant took away a plate from the other side when a sepulchral note sounded in my ear it was like the memento mori of the old romanas though some one pointed in the midst of my bliss to the sword hung over my head by a thread it was the voice of larry whispering in his agony just above my head theys disthroying my poor feet intirely intirely so they is i cant bear it much longer yer honer i had committed murder like macbeth and now my banquo had come to disturb me at my feast what is it he says to you asked fanny oh nothing i answered once more in my misery there seems to be some point of confidence between you and our larry she remarked oh no said i quite confused not at all you need not be ashamed of it half the gentlemen in the county have their confidences with larryand some of the ladies too i can tell you he was born in this house and never lived anywhere else and i am sure he has a larger circle of acquaintance than any one else in it i could not recover my selfpossession for the next ten minutes whenever larry was on our side of the table i was afraid he was coming to me with another agonised whisper when he was opposite i could not but watch him as he hobbled in his misery it was evident that the boots were too tight for him and had they been made throughout of iron they could not have been less capable of yielding to the feet i pitied him from the bottom of my heart and i pitied myself also wishing that i was well in bed upstairs with some feigned malady so that larry might have had his own again and then for a moment i missed him from the room he had doubtless gone to relieve his tortured feet in the servants hall and as he did so was cursing my cruelty but what mattered it let him curse if he would only stay away and do that i would appease his wrath when we were alone together with pecuniary satisfaction but there was no such rest in store for me larry larry shouted mr oconor where on earth has the fellow gone to they were all cousins at the table except myself and mr oconor was not therefore restrained by any feeling of ceremony there is something wrong with that fellow today what is it jack upon my word sir i dont know said jack i think he must be tipsy whispered miss oconor the maiden sister who always sat at her brothers left hand but a whisper though it was it was audible all down the table no maam it aint dhrink at all said the coachman it is his feet as does it his feet shouted tom oconor yes i know its his feet said that horrid tizzy hes got on great thick nailed shoes it was that that made him tumble down in the hall i glanced at each side of me and could see that there was a certain consciousness expressed in the face of each of my two neighbourson kates mouth there was decidedly a smile or rather perhaps the slightest possible inclination that way whereas on fannys part i thought i saw something like a rising sorrow at my distress so at least i flattered myself send him back into the room immediately said tom who looked at me as though he had some consciousness that i had introduced all this confusion into his household what should i do would it not be best for me to make a clean breast of it before them all but alas i lacked the courage the coachman went out and we were left for five minutes without any servant and mr oconor the while became more and more savage i attempted to say a word to fanny but failed vox faucibus hsit i dont think he has got any others said tizzyat least none others left on the whole i am glad i did not marry into the family as i could not have endured that girl to stay in my house as a sisterinlaw where the d has that other fellow gone to said tom jack do go out and see what is the matter if anybody is drunk send for me oh there is nobody drunk said tizzy jack went out and the coachman returned but what was done and said i hardly remember the whole room seemed to swim round and round and as far as i can recollect the company sat mute neither eating nor drinking presently jack returned its all right said he i always liked jack at the present moment he just looked towards me and laughed slightly all right said tom but is the fellow coming we can do with richard i suppose said jack noi cant do with richard said the father and i will know what it all means where is that fellow larry larry had been standing just outside the door and now he entered gently as a mouse no sound came from his footfall nor was there in his face that look of pain which it had worn for the last fifteen minutes but he was not the less abashed frightened and unhappy what is all this about larry said his master turning to him i insist upon knowing och thin mr green yer honer i wouldnt be afther telling agin yer honer indeed i wouldnt thin av the masther would only let me hould my tongue and he looked across at me deprecating my anger mr green said mr oconor yes yer honer its all along of his honors thick shoes and larry stepping backwards towards the door lifted them up from some corner and coming well forward exposed them with the soles uppermost to the whole table and thats not all yer honer but theyve squoze the very toes of me into a jelly there was now a loud laugh in which jack and peter and fanny and kate and tizzy all joined as too did mr oconorand i also myself after a while whose boots are they demanded miss oconor senior with her severest tone and grimmest accent deed then and the divil may have them for me miss answered larry they war mr greens but the likes of him wont wear them agin afther the likes of mebarring he wanted them very particular added he remembering his own pumps i began muttering something feeling that the time had come when i must tell the tale but jack with great good nature took up the story and told it so well that i hardly suffered in the telling and thats it said tom oconor laughing till i thought he would have fallen from his chair so youve got larrys shoes on and very well he fills them said jack and its his honer thats welcome to em said larry grinning from ear to ear now that he saw that the masther was once more in a good humour i hope theyll be nice shoes for dancing said kate only theres one down at the heel i know said tizzy the servants shoes this was an exclamation made by the maiden lady and intended apparently only for her brothers ear but it was clearly audible by all the party better that than no dinner said peter but what are you to do about the dancing said fanny with an air of dismay on her face which flattered me with an idea that she did care whether i danced or no in the mean time larry now as happy as an emperor was tripping round the room without any shoes to encumber him as he withdrew the plates from the table and its his honer thats welcome to em said he again as he pulled off the tablecloth with a flourish and why wouldnt he and he able to folly the hounds betther nor any englishman that iver war in these parts beforeanyways so mick says now mick was the huntsman and this little tale of eulogy from larry went far towards easing my grief i had ridden well to the hounds that day and i knew it there was nothing more said about the shoes and i was soon again at my ease although miss oconor did say something about the impropriety of larry walking about in his stocking feet the ladies however soon withdrewto my sorrow for i was getting on swimmingly with fanny and then we gentlemen gathered round the fire and filled our glasses in about ten minutes a very light tap was heard the door was opened to the extent of three inches and a female voice which i readily recognised called to jack jack went out and in a second or two put his head back into the room and called to megreen he said just step here a moment theres a good fellow i went out and there i found fanny standing with her brother here are the girls at their wits ends said he about your dancing so fanny has put a boy upon one of the horses and proposes that you should send another line to mrs meehan at ballyglass its only ten miles and hell be back in two hours i need hardly say that i acted in conformity with this advice i went into mr oconors book room with jack and his sister and there scribbled a note it was delightful to feel how intimate i was with them and how anxious they were to make me happy and we wont begin till they come said fanny oh miss oconor pray dont wait said i oh but we will she answered you have your wine to drink and then theres the tea and then well have a song or two ill spin it out see if i dont and so we went to the front door where the boy was already on his horseher own nag as i afterwards found and patsey said she ride for your life and patsey whatever you do dont come back without mr greens pumpshis dancingshoes you know and in about two hours the pumps did arrive and i dont think i ever spent a pleasanter evening or got more satisfaction out of a pair of shoes they had not been two minutes on my feet before larry was carrying a tray of negus across the room in those which i had worn at dinner the dillon girls are going to stay here said fanny as i wished her good night at two oclock and well have dancing every evening as long as you remain but i shall leave tomorrow said i indeed you wont papa will take care of that and so he did you had better go over to ballyglass yourself tomorrow said he and collect your own things theres no knowing else what you may have to borrow of larry i stayed there three weeks and in the middle of the third i thought that everything would be arranged between me and fanny but the aunt interfered and in about a twelvemonth after my adventures she consented to make a more fortunate man happy for his life john bull on the guadalquivir i am an englishman living as all englishman should do in england and my wife would not i think be well pleased were any one to insinuate that she were other than an englishwoman but in the circumstances of my marriage i became connected with the south of spain and the narrative which i am to tell requires that i should refer to some of those details the pomfrets and daguilars have long been in trade together in this country and one of the partners has usually resided at seville for the sake of the works which the firm there possesses my father james pomfret lived there for ten years before his marriage and since that and up to the present period old mr daguilar has always been on the spot he was i believe born in spain but he came very early to england he married an english wife and his sons had been educated exclusively in england his only daughter maria daguilar did not pass so large a proportion of her early life in this country but she came to us for a visit at the age of seventeen and when she returned i made up my mind that i most assuredly would go after her so i did and she is now sitting on the other side of the fireplace with a legion of small linen habiliments in a huge basket by her side i felt at the first that there was something lacking to make my cup of love perfectly delightful it was very sweet but there was wanting that flower of romance which is generally added to the heavenly draught by a slight admixture of opposition i feared that the path of my true love would run too smooth when maria came to our house my mother and elder sister seemed to be quite willing that i should be continually alone with her and she had not been there ten days before my father by chance remarked that there was nothing old mr daguilar valued so highly as a thorough feeling of intimate alliance between the two families which had been so long connected in trade i was never told that maria was to be my wife but i felt that the same thing was done without words and when after six weeks of somewhat elaborate attendance upon her i asked her to be mrs john pomfret i had no more fear of a refusal or even of hesitation on her part than i now have when i suggest to my partner some commercial transaction of undoubted advantage but maria even at that age had about her a quiet sustained decision of character quite unlike anything i had seen in english girls i used to hear and do still hear how much more flippant is the education of girls in france and spain than in england and i know that this is shown to be the result of many causesthe roman catholic religion being perhaps the chief offender but nevertheless i rarely see in one of our own young women the same power of a selfsustained demeanour as i meet on the continent it goes no deeper than the demeanour people say i can only answer that i have not found that shallowness in my own wife miss daguilar replied to me that she was not prepared with an answer she had only known me six weeks and wanted more time to think about it besides there was one in her own country with whom she would wish to consult i knew she had no mother and as for consulting old mr daguilar on such a subject that idea i knew could not have troubled her besides as i afterwards learned mr daguilar had already proposed the marriage to his partner exactly as he would have proposed a division of assets my mother declared that maria was a foolish chitin which bythebye she showed her entire ignorance of miss daguilars character my eldest sister begged that no constraint might be put on the young ladys inclinationswhich provoked me to assert that the young ladys inclinations were by no means opposed to my own and my father in the coolest manner suggested that the matter might stand over for twelve months and that i might then go to seville and see about it stand over for twelve months would not maria long before that time have been snapped up and carried off by one of those inordinately rich spanish grandees who are still to be met with occasionally in andalucia my fathers dictum however had gone forth and maria in the calmest voice protested that she thought it very wise i should be less of a boy by that time she said smiling on me but driving wedges between every fibre of my body as she spoke be it so i said proudly at any rate i am not so much of a boy that i shall forget you and john you still have the trade to learn she added with her deliciously foreign intonationspeaking very slowly but with perfect pronunciation the trade to learn however i said not a word but stalked out of the room meaning to see her no more before she went but i could not resist attending on her in the hall as she started and when she took leave of us she put her face up to be kissed by me as she did by my father and seemed to receive as much emotion from one embrace as from the other hell go out by the packet of the st april said my father speaking of me as though i were a bale of goods ah that will be so nice said maria settling her dress in the carriage the oranges will be ripe for him then on the th april i did sail and felt still very like a bale of goods i had received one letter from her in which she merely stated that her papa would have a room ready for me on my arrival and in answer to that i had sent an epistle somewhat longer and as i then thought a little more to the purpose her turn of mind was more practical than mine and i must confess my belief that she did not appreciate my poetry i landed at cadiz and was there joined by an old family friend one of the very best fellows that ever lived he was to accompany me up as far as seville and as he had lived for a year or two at xeres was supposed to be more spanish almost than a spaniard his name was johnson and he was in the wine trade and whether for travelling or whether for staying at homewhether for paying you a visit in your own house or whether for entertaining you in histhere never was and i am prepared to maintain there never will be a stancher friend a choicer companion or a safer guide than thomas johnson words cannot produce a eulogium sufficient for his merits but as i have since learned he was not quite so spanish as i had imagined three years among the bodegas of xeres had taught him no doubt to appreciate the exact twang of a good dry sherry but not as i now conceive the exactest flavour of the true spanish character i was very lucky however in meeting such a friend and now reckon him as one of the stanchest allies of the house of pomfret daguilar and pomfret he met me at cadiz took me about the town which appeared to me to be of no very great interestthough the young ladies were all very well but in this respect i was then a stoic till such time as i might be able to throw myself at the feet of her whom i was ready to proclaim the most lovely of all the dulcineas of andalucia he carried me up by boat and railway to xeres gave me a most terrific headache by dragging me out into the glare of the sun after i had tasted some half a dozen different wines and went through all the ordinary hospitalities on the next day we returned to puerto and from thence getting across to st lucar and bonanza found ourselves on the banks of the guadalquivir and took our places in the boat for seville i need say but little to my readers respecting that farfamed river thirty years ago we in england generally believed that on its banks was to be found a pure elysium of pastoral beauty that picturesque shepherds and lovely maidens here fed their flocks in fields of asphodel that the limpid stream ran cool and crystal over bright stones and beneath perennial shade and that everything on the guadalquivir was as lovely and as poetical as its name now it is pretty widely known that no uglier river oozes down to its bourn in the sea through unwholesome banks of low mud it is brown and dirty ungifted by any scenic advantage margined for miles upon miles by huge flat expansive fields in which cattle are rearedthe bulls wanted for the bullfights among other and birds of prey sit constant on the shore watching for the carcases of such as die such are the charms of the golden guadalquivir at first we were very dull on board that steamer i never found myself in a position in which there was less to do there was a nasty smell about the little boat which made me almost ill every turn in the river was so exactly like the last that we might have been standing still there was no amusement except eating and that when once done was not of a kind to make an early repetition desirable even johnson was becoming dull and i began to doubt whether i was so desirous as i once had been to travel the length and breadth of all spain but about noon a little incident occurred which did for a time remove some of our tedium the boat had stopped to take in passengers on the river and among others a man had come on board dressed in a fashion that to my eyes was equally strange and picturesque indeed his appearance was so singular that i could not but regard him with care though i felt at first averse to stare at a fellowpassenger on account of his clothes he was a man of about fifty but as active apparently as though not more than twentyfive he was of low stature but of admirable make his hair was just becoming grizzled but was short and crisp and well cared for his face was prepossessing having a look of good humour added to courtesy and there was a pleasant soft smile round his mouth which ingratiated one at the first sight but it was his dress rather than his person which attracted attention he wore the ordinary andalucian capof which such hideous parodies are now making themselves common in englandbut was not contented with the usual ornament of the double tuft the cap was small and jaunty trimmed with silk velvetas is common here with men careful to adorn their persons but this mans cap was finished off with a jewelled button and golden filigree work he was dressed in a short jacket with a standup collar and that also was covered with golden buttons and with golden buttonholes it was all gilt down the front and all lace down the back the rows of buttons were double and those of the more backward row hung down in heavy pendules his waistcoat was of coloured silkvery pretty to look at and ornamented with a small sash through which gold threads were worked all the buttons of his breeches also were of gold and there were gold tags to all the buttonholes his stockings were of the finest silk and clocked with gold from the knee to the ankle dress any englishman in such a garb and he will at once give you the idea of a hog in armour in the first place he will lack the proper spirit to carry it off and in the next place the motion of his limbs will disgrace the ornaments they bear and so best most englishmen will say very likely and therefore let no englishman try it but my spaniard did not look at all like a hog in armour he walked slowly down the plank into the boat whistling lowly but very clearly a few bars from an opera tune it was plain to see that he was master of himself of his ornaments and of his limbs he had no appearance of thinking that men were looking at him or of feeling that he was beauteous in his attirenothing could be more natural than his footfall or the quiet glance of his cheery gray eye he walked up to the captain who held the helm and lightly raised his hand to his cap the captain taking one hand from the wheel did the same and then the stranger turning his back to the stern of the vessel and fronting down the river with his face continued to whistle slowly clearly and in excellent time grand as were his clothes they were no burden on his mind what is he said i going up to my friend johnson with a whisper well ive been looking at him said johnsonwhich was true enough hes aan uncommonly goodlooking fellow isnt he particularly so said i and got up quite irrespective of expense is he aaa gentleman now do you think well those things are so different in spain that its almost impossible to make an englishman understand them one learns to know all this sort of people by being with them in the country but one cant explain no exactly are they real gold yes yes i dare say they are they sometimes have them silver gilt it is quite a common thing then isnt it asked i well not exactly that ah yes i see of course he is a torero a what a mayo i will explain it all to you you will see them about in all places and you will get used to them but i havent seen one other as yet no and they are not all so gay as this nor so new in their finery you know and what is a torero well a torero is a man engaged in bullfighting oh he is a matador is he said i looking at him with more than all my eyes no not exactly thatnot of necessity he is probably a mayo a fellow that dresses himself smart for fairs and will be seen hanging about with the bullfighters what would be a sporting fellow in englandonly he wont drink and curse like a low man on the turf there come shall we go and speak to him i cant talk to him said i diffident of my spanish i had received lessons in england from maria daguilar but six weeks is little enough for making love let alone the learning of a foreign language oh ill do the talking youll find the language easy enough before long it soon becomes the same as english to you when you live among them and then johnson walking up to the stranger accosted him with that goodnatured familiarity with which a thoroughly nice fellow always opens a conversation with his inferior of course i could not understand the words which were exchanged but it was clear enough that the mayo took the address in good part and was inclined to be communicative and social they are all of pure gold said johnson turning to me after a minute making as he spoke a motion with his head to show the importance of the information are they indeed said i where on earth did a fellow like that get them whereupon johnson again returned to his conversation with the man after another minute he raised his hand and began to finger the button on the shoulder and to aid him in doing so the man of the bullring turned a little on one side they are wonderfully well made said johnson talking to me and still fingering the button they are manufactured he says at osuna and he tells me that they make them better there than anywhere else i wonder what the whole set would cost said i an enormous deal of money for a fellow like him i should think over twelve ounces said johnson having asked the question and that will be more than forty pounds what an uncommon ass he must be said i as johnson by this time was very closely scrutinising the whole set of ornaments i thought i might do so also and going up close to our friend i too began to handle the buttons and tags on the other side nothing could have been more goodhumoured than he wasso much so that i was emboldened to hold up his arm that i might see the cut of his coat to take off his cap and examine the make to stuff my finger in beneath his sash and at last to kneel down while i persuaded him to hold up his legs that i might look to the clocking the fellow was thoroughly goodnatured and why should i not indulge my curiosity youll upset him if you dont take care said johnson for i had got fast hold of him by one ankle and was determined to finish the survey completely oh no i shant said i a bullfighting chap can surely stand on one leg but what i wonder at is how on earth he can afford it whereupon johnson again began to interrogate him in spanish he says he has got no children said johnson having received a reply and that as he has nobody but himself to look after he is able to allow himself such little luxuries tell him that i say he would be better with a wife and couple of babies said iand johnson interpreted he says that hell think of it some of these days when he finds that the supply of fools in the world is becoming short said johnson we had nearly done with him now but after regaining my feet i addressed myself once more to the heavy pendules which hung down almost under his arm i lifted one of these meaning to feel its weight between my fingers but unfortunately i gave a lurch probably through the motion of the boat and still holding by the button tore it almost off from our friends coat oh i am so sorry i said in broad english it do not matter at all he said bowing and speaking with equal plainness and then taking a knife from his pocket he cut the pendule off leaving a bit of torn cloth on the side of his jacket upon my word i am quite unhappy said i but i always am so awkward whereupon he bowed low couldnt i make it right said i bringing out my purse he lifted his hand and i saw that it was small and white he lifted it and gently put it upon my purse smiling sweetly as he did so thank you no seor thank you no and then bowing to us both he walked away down into the cabin upon my word he is a deuced wellmannered fellow said i you shouldnt have offered him money said johnson a spaniard does not like it why i thought you could do nothing without money in this country doesnt every one take bribes ah yes that is a different thing but not the price of a button by jove he understood english too did you see that yes and i called him an ass i hope he doesnt mind it oh no he wont think anything about it said johnson that sort of fellows dont i dare say we shall see him in the bullring next sunday and then well make all right with a glass of lemonade and so our adventure ended with the man of the gold ornaments i was sorry that i had spoken english before him so heedlessly and resolved that i would never be guilty of such gaucherie again but then who would think that a spanish bullfighter would talk a foreign language i was sorry also that i had torn his coat it had looked so awkward and sorry again that i had offered the man money altogether i was a little ashamed of myself but i had too much to look forward to at seville to allow any heaviness to remain long at my heart and before i had arrived at the marvellous city i had forgotten both him and his buttons nothing could be nicer than the way in which i was welcomed at mr daguilars house or more kindi may almost say affectionatethan marias manner to me but it was too affectionate and i am not sure that i should not have liked my reception better had she been more diffident in her tone and less inclined to greet me with open warmth as it was she again gave me her cheek to kiss in her fathers presence and called me dear john and asked me specially after some rabbits which i had kept at home merely for a younger sister and then it seemed as though she were in no way embarrassed by the peculiar circumstances of our position twelve months since i had asked her to be my wife and now she was to give me an answer and yet she was as assured in her gait and as serenely joyous in her tone as though i were a brother just returned from college it could not be that she meant to refuse me or she would not smile on me and be so loving but i could almost have found it in my heart to wish that she would it is quite possible said i to myself that i may not be found so ready for this family bargain a love that is to be had like a bale of goods is not exactly the love to suit my taste but then when i met her again in the morning i could no more have quarrelled with her than i could have flown i was inexpressibly charmed with the whole city and especially with the house in which mr daguilar lived it opened from the corner of a narrow unfrequented streeta corner like an elbowand as seen from the exterior there was nothing prepossessing to recommend it but the outer door led by a short hall or passage to an inner door or grille made of open ornamental ironwork and through that we entered a court or patio as they called it nothing could be more lovely or deliciously cool than was this small court the building on each side was covered by trelliswork and beautiful creepers vines and parasite flowers now in the full magnificence of the early summer grew up and clustered round the windows every inch of wall was covered so that none of the glaring whitewash wounded the eye in the four corners of the patio were four large orangetrees covered with fruit i would not say a word in special praise of these remembering that childish promise she had made on my behalf in the middle of the court there was a fountain and round about on the marble floor there were chairs and here and there a small table as though the space were really a portion of the house it was here that we used to take our cup of coffee and smoke our cigarettes i and old mr daguilar while maria sat by not only approving but occasionally rolling for me the thin paper round the fragrant weed with her taper fingers beyond the patio was an open passage or gallery filled also with flowers in pots and then beyond this one entered the drawingroom of the house it was by no means a princely palace or mansion fit for the owner of untold wealth the rooms were not over large nor very numerous but the most had been made of a small space and everything had been done to relieve the heat of an almost tropical sun it is pretty is it not she said as she took me through it very pretty i said i wish we could live in such houses oh they would not do at all for dear old fat cold cozy england you are quite different you know in everything from us in the south more phlegmatic but then so much steadier the men and the houses are all the same i can hardly tell why but even this wounded me it seemed to me as though she were inclined to put into one and the same category things english dull useful and solid and that she was disposed to show a sufficient appreciation for such necessaries of life though she herself had another and inner sensea sense keenly alive to the poetry of her own southern clime and that i as being english was to have no participation in this latter charm an english husband might do very well the interests of the firm might make such an arrangement desirable such a mariage de convenanceso i argued to myselfmight be quite compatible withwith heaven only knows what delights of superterrestial romance from which i as being an english thickheaded lump of useful coarse mortality was to be altogether debarred she had spoken to me of oranges and having finished the survey of the house she offered me some sweet little cakes it could not be that of such things were the thoughts which lay undivulged beneath the clear waters of those deep black eyesundivulged to me though no one else could have so good a right to read those thoughts it could not be that that noble brow gave index of a mind intent on the trade of which she spoke so often words of other sort than any that had been vouchsafed to me must fall at times from the rich curves of that perfect mouth so felt i then pining for something to make me unhappy ah me i know all about it now and am content but i wish that some learned pundit would give us a good definition of romance would describe in words that feeling with which our hearts are so pestered when we are young which makes us sigh for we know not what and forbids us to be contented with what god sends us we invest female beauty with impossible attributes and are angry because our women have not the spiritualised souls of angels anxious as we are that they should also be human in the flesh a man looks at her he would love as at a distant landscape in a mountainous land the peaks are glorious with more than the beauty of earth and rock and vegetation he dreams of some mysterious grandeur of design which tempts him on under the hot sun and over the sharp rock till he has reached the mountain goal which he had set before him but when there he finds that the beauty is wellnigh gone and as for that delicious mystery on which his soul had fed it has vanished for ever i know all about it now and am as i said content beneath those deep black eyes there lay a well of love good honest homely love love of father and husband and children that were to comeof that love which loves to see the loved ones prospering in honesty that noble browfor it is noble i am unchanged in that opinion and will go unchanged to my gravecovers thoughts as to the welfare of many and an intellect fitted to the management of a household of servants namely and children and perchance a husband that mouth can speak words of wisdom of very useful wisdomthough of poetry it has latterly uttered little that was original poetry and romance they are splendid mountain views seen in the distance so let men be content to see them and not attempt to tread upon the fallacious heather of the mystic hills in the first week of my sojourn in seville i spoke no word of overt love to maria thinking as i confess to induce her thereby to alter her mode of conduct to myself she knows that i have come here to make love to herto repeat my offer and she will at any rate be chagrined if i am slow to do so but it had no effect at home my mother was rather particular about her table and marias greatest efforts seemed to be used in giving me as nice dinners as we gave her in those days i did not care a straw about my dinner and so i took an opportunity of telling her dear me said she looking at me almost with grief do you not what a pity and do you not like music either oh yes i adore it i replied i felt sure at the time that had i been born in her own sunny clime she would never have talked to me about eating but that was my mistake i used to walk out with her about the city seeing all that is there of beauty and magnificence and in what city is there more that is worth the seeing at first this was very delightful to me for i felt that i was blessed with a privilege that would not be granted to any other man but its value soon fell in my eyes for others would accost her and walk on the other side talking to her in spanish as though i hardly existed or were a servant there for her protection and i was not allowed to take her arm and thus to appropriate her as i should have done in england no john she said with the sweetest prettiest smile we dont do that here only when people are married and she made this allusion to married life out openly with no slightest tremor on her tongue oh i beg pardon said i drawing back my hand and feeling angry with myself for not being fully acquainted with all the customs of a foreign country you need not beg pardon said she when we were in england we always walked so it is just a custom you know and then i saw her drop her large dark eyes to the ground and bow gracefully in answer to some salute i looked round and saw that we had been joined by a young cavaliera spanish nobleman as i saw at once a man with jet black hair and a straight nose and a black moustache and patent leather boots very slim and very tall andthough i would not confess it thenuncommonly handsome i myself am inclined to be stout my hair is light my nose broad i have no hair on my upper lip and my whiskers are rough and uneven i could punch your head though my fine fellow said i to myself when i saw that he placed himself at marias side and think very little of the achievement the wretch went on with us round the plaza for some quarter of an hour talking spanish with the greatest fluency and she was every whit as fluent of course i could not understand a word that they said of all positions that a man can occupy i think that that is about the most uncomfortable and i cannot say that even up to this day i have quite forgiven her for that quarter of an hour i shall go in said i unable to bear my feelings and preparing to leave her the heat is unendurable oh dear john why did you not speak before she answered you cannot leave me here you know as i am in your charge but i will go with you almost directly and then she finished her conversation with the spaniard speaking with an animation she had never displayed in her conversations with me it had been agreed between us for two or three days before this that we were to rise early on the following morning for the sake of ascending the tower of the cathedral and visiting the giralda as the iron figure is called which turns upon a pivot on the extreme summit we had often wandered together up and down the long dark gloomy aisle of the stupendous building and had together seen its treasury of art but as yet we had not performed the task which has to be achieved by all visitors to seville and in order that we might have a clear view over the surrounding country and not be tormented by the heat of an advanced sun we had settled that we would ascend the giralda before breakfast and now as i walked away from the plaza towards mr daguilars house with maria by my side i made up my mind that i would settle my business during this visit to the cathedral yes and i would so manage the settlement that there should be no doubt left as to my intentions and my own ideas i would not be guilty of shillyshally conduct i would tell her frankly what i felt and what i thought and would make her understand that i did not desire her hand if i could not have her heart i did not value the kindness of her manner seeing that that kindness sprung from indifference rather than passion and so i would declare to her and i would ask her also who was this young man with whom she was intimatefor whom all her volubility and energy of tone seemed to be employed she had told me once that it behoved her to consult a friend in seville as to the expediency of her marriage with me was this the friend whom she had wished to consult if so she need not trouble herself under such circumstances i should decline the connection and i resolved that i would find out how this might be a man who proposes to take a woman to his bosom as his wife has a right to ask for informationay and to receive it too it flashed upon my mind at this moment that donna maria was well enough inclined to come to me as my wife but i could hardly define the buts to myself for there were three or four of them why did she always speak to me in a tone of childish affection as though i were a schoolboy home for the holidays i would have all this out with her on the tower on the following morning standing under the giralda on that morning we met together in the patio soon after five oclock and started for the cathedral she looked beautiful with her black mantilla over her head and with black gloves on and her black morning silk dressbeautiful composed and at her ease as though she were well satisfied to undertake this early morning walk from feelings of good naturesustained probably by some undercurrent of a deeper sentiment well i would know all about it before i returned to her fathers house there hardly stands as i think on the earth a building more remarkable than the cathedral of seville and hardly one more grand its enormous size its gloom and darkness the richness of ornamentation in the details contrasted with the severe simplicity of the larger outlines the variety of its architecture the glory of its paintings and the wondrous splendour of its metallic decoration its altarfriezes screens rails gates and the like render it to my mind the first in interest among churches it has not the coloured glass of chartres or the marble glory of milan or such a forest of aisles as antwerp or so perfect a hue in stone as westminster nor in mixed beauty of form and colour does it possess anything equal to the choir of cologne but for combined magnificence and awecompelling grandeur i regard it as superior to all other ecclesiastical edifices it is its deep gloom with which the stranger is so greatly struck on his first entrance in a region so hot as the south of spain a cool interior is a main object with the architect and this it has been necessary to effect by the exclusion of light consequently the church is dark mysterious and almost cold on the morning in question as we entered it seemed to be filled with gloom and the distant sound of a slow footstep here and there beyond the transept inspired one almost with awe maria when she first met me had begun to talk with her usual smile offering me coffee and a biscuit before i started i never eat biscuit i said with almost a severe tone as i turned from her that dark horrid man of the plazawould she have offered him a cake had she been going to walk with him in the gloom of the morning after that little had been spoken between us she walked by my side with her accustomed smile but she had as i flattered myself begun to learn that i was not to be won by a meaningless good nature we are lucky in our morning for the view that was all she said speaking with that peculiarly clear but slow pronunciation which she had assumed in learning our language we entered the cathedral and walking the whole length of the aisle left it again at the porters porch at the farther end here we passed through a low door on to the stone flight of steps and at once began to ascend there are a party of your countrymen up before us said maria the porter says that they went through the lodge half an hour since i hope they will return before we are on the top said i bethinking myself of the task that was before me and indeed my heart was hardly at ease within me for that which i had to say would require all the spirit of which i was master the ascent to the giralda is very long and very fatiguing and we had to pause on the various landings and in the singular belfry in order that miss daguilar might recruit her strength and breath as we rested on one of these occasions in a gallery which runs round the tower below the belfry we heard a great noise of shouting and a clattering of sticks among the bells it is the party of your countrymen who went up before us said she what a pity that englishmen should always make so much noise and then she spoke in spanish to the custodian of the bells who is usually to be found in a little cabin up there within the tower he says that they went up shouting like demons continued maria and it seemed to me that she looked as though i ought to be ashamed of the name of an englishman they may not be so solemn in their demeanour as spaniards i answered but for all that there may be quite as much in them we then again began to mount and before we had ascended much farther we passed my three countrymen they were young men with gray coats and gray trousers with slouched hats and without gloves they had fair faces and fair hair and swung big sticks in their hands with crooked handles they laughed and talked loud and when we met them seemed to be racing with each other but nevertheless they were gentlemen no one who knows by sight what an english gentleman is could have doubted that but i did acknowledge to myself that they should have remembered that the edifice they were treading was a church and that the silence they were invading was the cherished property of a courteous people they are all just the same as big boys said maria the colour instantly flew into my face and i felt that it was my duty to speak up for my own countrymen the word boys especially wounded my ears it was as a boy that she treated me but on looking at that befringed young spanish donwho was not apparently my elder in ageshe had recognised a man however i said nothing further till i reached the summit one cannot speak with manly dignity while one is out of breath on a staircase there john she said stretching her hands away over the fair plain of the guadalquivir as soon as we stood against the parapet is not that lovely i would not deign to notice this maria i said i think that you are too hard upon my countrymen too hard no for i love them they are so good and industrious and they come home to their wives and take care of their children but why do they make themselves sosowhat the french call gauche good and industrious and come home to their wives thought i i believe you hardly understand us as yet i answered our domestic virtues are not always so very prominent but i believe we know how to conduct ourselves as gentlemen at any rate as well as spaniards i was very angrynot at the faults but at the good qualities imputed to us in affairs of business yes said maria with a look of firm confidence in her own opinionthat look of confidence which she has never lost and i pray that she may never lose it while i remain with herbut in the little intercourses of the world no a spaniard never forgets what is personally due either to himself or his neighbours if he is eating an onion he eats it as an onion should be eaten in such matters as that he is very grand no doubt said i angrily and why should you not eat an onion properly john now i heard a story yesterday from don about two englishmen which annoyed me very much i did not exactly catch the name of the don in question but i felt through every nerve in my body that it was the man who had been talking to her on the plaza and what have they done said i but it is the same everywhere we are always abused but nevertheless no people are so welcome at any rate we pay for the mischief we do i was angry with myself the moment the words were out of my mouth for after all there is no feeling more mean than that pocketconfidence with which an englishman sometimes swaggers there was no mischief done in this case she answered it was simply that two men have made themselves ridiculous for ever the story is all about seville and of course it annoys me that they should be englishmen and what did they do the marquis dalmavivas was coming up to seville in the boat and they behaved to him in the most outrageous manner he is here now and is going to give a series of ftes of course he will not ask a single englishman we shall manage to live even though the marquis dalmavivas may frown upon us said i proudly he is the richest and also the best of our noblemen continued maria and i never heard of anything so absurd as what they did to him it made me blush when don told me don toms i thought she said if he be the best of your noblemen how comes it that he is angry because he has met two vulgar men it is not to be supposed that every englishman is a gentleman angry oh no he was not angry he enjoyed the joke too much for that he got completely the best of them though they did not know it poor fools how would your lord john russell behave if two spaniards in an english railway carriage were to pull him about and tear his clothes he would give them in charge to a policeman of course said i speaking of such a matter with the contempt it deserved if that were done here your ambassador would be demanding national explanations but almavivas did much betterhe laughed at them without letting them know it but do you mean that they took hold of him violently without any provocation they must have been drunk oh no they were sober enough i did not see it so i do not quite know exactly how it was but i understand that they committed themselves most absurdly absolutely took hold of his coat and tore it and but they did such ridiculous things that i cannot tell you and yet don toms if that was the mans name had been able to tell her and she had been able to listen to him what made them take hold of the marquis said i curiosity i suppose she answered he dresses somewhat fancifully and they could not understand that any one should wear garments different from their own but even then the blow did not strike home upon me is it not pretty to look down upon the quiet town she said coming close up to me so that the skirt of her dress pressed me and her elbow touched my arm now was the moment i should have asked her how her heart stood towards me but i was sore and uncomfortable and my destiny was before me she was willing enough to let these english faults pass by without further notice but i would not allow the subject to drop i will find out who these men were said i and learn the truth of it when did it occur last thursday i think he said why that was the day we came up in the boat johnson and myself there was no marquis there then and we were the only englishmen on board it was on thursday certainly because it was well known in seville that he arrived on that day you must have remarked him because he talks english perfectlythough bythebye these men would go on chattering before him about himself as though it were impossible that a spaniard should know their language they are ignorant of spanish and they cannot bring themselves to believe that any one should be better educated than themselves now the blow had fallen and i straightway appreciated the necessity of returning immediately to clapham where my family resided and giving up for ever all idea of spanish connections i had resolved to assert the full strength of my manhood on that tower and now words had been spoken which left me weak as a child i felt that i was shivering and did not dare to pronounce the truth which must be made known as to speaking of love and signifying my pleasure that don toms should for the future be kept at a distance any such effort was quite beyond me had don toms been there he might have walked off with her from before my face without a struggle on my part now i remember about it she continued i think he must have been in the boat on thursday and now that i remember i replied turning away to hide my embarrassment he was there your friend down below in the plaza seems to have made out a grand story no doubt he is not fond of the english there was such a man there and i did take hold oh john was it you yes donna maria it was i and if lord john russell were to dress himself in the same way but i had no time to complete my description of what might occur under so extravagantly impossible a combination of circumstances for as i was yet speaking the little door leading out on to the leads of the tower was opened and my friend the mayo of the boat still bearing all his gewgaws on his back stepped up on to the platform my eye instantly perceived that the one pendule was still missing from his jacket he did not come alone but three other gentlemen followed him who however had no peculiarities in their dress he saw me at once and bowed and smiled and then observing donna maria he lifted his cap from his head and addressing himself to her in spanish began to converse with her as though she were an old friend seor said maria after the first words of greeting had been spoken between them you must permit me to present to you my fathers most particular friend and my ownmr pomfret john this is the marquis dalmavivas i cannot now describe the grace with which this introduction was effected or the beauty of her face as she uttered the word there was a boldness about her as though she had said i know it allthe whole story but in spite of that you must take him on my representation and be gracious to him in spite of what he has done you must be content to do that or in quarrelling with him you must quarrel with me also and it was done at the spur of the momentwithout delay she who not five minutes since had been loudly condemning the unknown englishman for his rudeness had already pardoned him now that he was known to be her friend and had determined that he should be pardoned by others also or that she would share his disgrace i recognised the nobleness of this at the moment but nevertheless i was so sore that i would almost have preferred that she should have disowned me the marquis immediately lifted his cap with his left hand while he gave me his right i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman he said we had some conversation in the boat together yes said i pointing to his rent and you still bear the marks of our encounter was it not delightful donna maria he continued turning to her your friends friend took me for a torero and it served you properly seor said donna maria laughing you have no right to go about with all those rich ornaments upon you oh quite properly indeed i make no complaint and i must beg your friend to understand and his friend also how grateful i am for their solicitude as to my pecuniary welfare they were inclined to be severe on me for being so extravagant in such trifles i was obliged to explain that i had no wife at home kept without her proper allowance of dresses in order that i might be gay they are foreigners and you should forgive their error said she and in token that i do so said the marquis i shall beg your friend to accept the little ornament which attracted his attention and so saying he pulled the identical button out of his pocket and gracefully proffered it to me i shall carry it about with me always said i accepting it as a memento of humiliation when i look at it i shall ever remember the folly of an englishman and the courtesy of a spaniard and as i made the speech i could not but reflect whether it might under any circumstances be possible that lord john russell should be induced to give a button off his coat to a spaniard there were other civil speeches made and before we left the tower the marquis had asked me to his parties and exacted from me an unwilling promise that i would attend them the seora he said bowing again to maria would he was sure grace them she had done so on the previous year and as i had accepted his little present i was bound to acknowledge him as my friend all this was very pretty and of course i said that i would go but i had not at that time the slightest intention of doing so maria had behaved admirably she had covered my confusion and shown herself not ashamed to own me delinquent as i was but not the less had she expressed her opinion in language terribly strong of the awkwardness of which i had been guilty and had shown almost an aversion to my english character i should leave seville as quickly as i could and should certainly not again put myself in the way of the marquis dalmavivas indeed i dreaded the moment that i should be first alone with her and should find myself forced to say something indicative of my feelingsto hear something also indicative of her feelings i had come out this morning resolved to demand my rights and to exercise themand now my only wish was to run away i hated the marquis and longed to be alone that i might cast his button from me to think that a man should be so ruined by such a trifle we descended that prodigious flight without a word upon the subject and almost without a word at all she had carried herself well in the presence of almavivas and had been too proud to seem ashamed of her companion but now as i could well see her feelings of disgust and contempt had returned when i begged her not to hurry herself she would hardly answer me and when she did speak her voice was constrained and unlike herself and yet how beautiful she was well my dream of spanish love must be over but i was sure of this that having known her and given her my heart i could never afterwards share it with another we came out at last on the dark gloomy aisle of the cathedral and walked together without a word up along the side of the choir till we came to the transept there was not a soul near us and not a sound was to be heard but the distant low pattering of a mass then in course of celebration at some faroff chapel in the cathedral when we got to the transept maria turned a little as though she was going to the transept door and then stopped herself she stood still and when i stood also she made two steps towards me and put her hand on my arm oh john she said well said i after all it does not signify you can make a joke of it when my back is turned dearest johnshe had never spoken to me in that way beforeyou must not be angry with me it is better that we should explain to each other is it not oh much better i am very glad you heard of it at once i do not look at it quite in the same light that you do but nevertheless what do you mean but i know you are angry with me and yet you cannot think that i intended those words for you of course i know now that there was nothing rude in what passed oh but there was no i am sure there was not you could not be rude though you are so free hearted i see it all now and so does the marquis you will like him so much when you come to know him tell me that you wont be cross with me for what i have said sometimes i think that i have displeased you and yet my whole wish has been to welcome you to seville and to make you comfortable as an old friend promise me that you will not be cross with me cross with her i certainly had no intention of being cross but i had begun to think that she would not care what my humour might be maria i said taking hold of her hand no john do not do that it is in the church you know maria will you answer me a question yes she said very slowly looking down upon the stone slabs beneath our feet do you love me love you yes do you love me you were to give me an answer here in seville and now i ask for it i have almost taught myself to think that it is needless to ask and now this horrid mischance what do you mean said she speaking very quickly why this miserable blunder about the marquiss button after that i suppose the marquis oh john is that to make a difference between you and mea little joke like that but does it not make a change between ussuch a thing as that oh john but tell me maria what am i to hope if you will say that you can love me i shall care nothing for the marquis in that case i can bear to be laughed at who will dare to laugh at you not the marquis whom i am sure you will like your friend in the plaza who told you of all this what poor toms i do not know about his being poor i mean the gentleman who was with you last night yes toms you do not know who he is not in the least how droll he is your own clerkpartly your own now that you are one of the firm and john i mean to make you do something for him he is such a good fellow and last year he married a young girl whom i loveoh almost like a sister do something for him of course i would i promised then and there that i would raise his salary to any conceivable amount that a spanish clerk could desire which promise i have since kept if not absolutely to the letter at any rate to an extent which has been considered satisfactory by the gentlemans wife but mariadearest maria remember john we are in the church and poor papa will be waiting breakfast i need hardly continue the story further it will be known to all that my lovesuit throve in spite of my unfortunate raid on the button of the marquis dalmavivas at whose series of ftes through that month i was i may boast an honoured guest i have since that had the pleasure of entertaining him in my own poor house in england and one of our boys bears his christian name from that day in which i ascended the giralda to this present day in which i write i have never once had occasion to complain of a deficiency of romance either in maria daguilar or in maria pomfret miss sarah jack of spanish town jamaica there is nothing so melancholy as a country in its decadence unless it be a people in their decadence i am not aware that the latter misfortune can be attributed to the anglosaxon race in any part of the world but there is reason to fear that it has fallen on an english colony in the island of jamaica jamaica was one of those spots on which fortune shone with the full warmth of all her noonday splendour that sun has setwhether for ever or no none but a prophet can tell but as far as a plain man may see there are at present but few signs of a coming morrow or of another summer it is not just or proper that one should grieve over the misfortunes of jamaica with a stronger grief because her savannahs are so lovely her forests so rich her mountains so green and her rivers so rapid but it is so it is piteous that a land so beautiful should be one which fate has marked for misfortune had guiana with its flat level unlovely soil become povertystricken one would hardly sorrow over it as one does sorrow for jamaica as regards scenery she is the gem of the western tropics it is impossible to conceive spots on the earths surface more gracious to the eye than those steep green valleys which stretch down to the southwest from the blue mountain peak towards the sea and but little behind these in beauty are the rich wooded hills which in the western part of the island divide the counties of hanover and westmoreland the hero of the tale which i am going to tell was a sugargrower in the latter district and the heroine was a girl who lived under that blue mountain peak the very name of a sugargrower as connected with jamaica savours of fruitless struggle failure and desolation and from his earliest growth fruitless struggle failure and desolation had been the lot of maurice cumming at eighteen years of age he had been left by his father sole possessor of the mount pleasant estate than which in her palmy days jamaica had little to boast of that was more pleasant or more palmy but those days had passed by before roger cumming the father of our friend had died these misfortunes coming on the head of one another at intervals of a few years had first stunned and then killed him his slaves rose against him as they did against other proprietors around him and burned down his house and mills his homestead and offices those who know the amount of capital which a sugargrower must invest in such buildings will understand the extent of this misfortune then the slaves were emancipated it is not perhaps possible that we nowadays should regard this as a calamity but it was quite impossible that a jamaica proprietor of those days should not have done so men will do much for philanthropy they will work hard they will give the coat from their backnay the very shirt from their body but few men will endure to look on with satisfaction while their commerce is destroyed but even this mr cumming did bear after a while and kept his shoulder to the wheel he kept his shoulder to the wheel till that third misfortune came upon himtill the protection duty on jamaica sugar was abolished then he turned his face to the wall and died his son at this time was not of age and the large but lessening property which mr cumming left behind him was for three years in the hands of trustees but nevertheless maurice young as he was managed the estate it was he who grew the canes and made the sugaror else failed to make it he was the massa to whom the free negroes looked as the source from whence their wants should be supplied notwithstanding that being free they were ill inclined to work for him let his want of work be ever so sore mount pleasant had been a very large property in addition to his sugarcanes mr cumming had grown coffee for his land ran up into the hills of trelawney to that altitude which in the tropics seems necessary for the perfect growth of the coffee berry but it soon became evident that labour for the double produce could not be had and the coffee plantation was abandoned wild brush and the thick undergrowth of forest reappeared on the hillsides which had been rich with produce and the evil recreated and exaggerated itself negroes squatted on the abandoned property and being able to live with abundance from their stolen gardens were less willing than ever to work in the cane pieces and thus things went from bad to worse in the good old times mr cummings sugar produce had spread itself annually over some three hundred acres but by degrees this dwindled down to half that extent of land and then in those old golden days they had always taken a full hogshead from the acrevery often more the estate had sometimes given four hundred hogsheads in the year but in the days of which we now speak the crop had fallen below fifty at this time maurice cumming was eightandtwenty and it is hardly too much to say that misfortune had nearly crushed him but nevertheless it had not crushed him he and some few like him had still hoped against hope had still persisted in looking forward to a future for the island which once was so generous with its gifts when his father died he might still have had enough for the wants of life had he sold his property for what it would fetch there was money in england and the remains of large wealth but he would not sacrifice mount pleasant or abandon jamaica and now after ten years struggling he still kept mount pleasant and the mill was still going but all other property had parted from his hands by nature maurice cumming would have been gay and lively a man with a happy spirit and easy temper but struggling had made him silent if not morose and had saddened if not soured his temper he had lived alone at mount pleasant or generally alone work or want of money and the constant difficulty of getting labour for his estate had left him but little time for a young mans ordinary amusements of the charms of ladies society he had known but little very many of the estates around him had been absolutely abandoned as was the case with his own coffee plantation and from others men had sent away their wives and daughters nay most of the proprietors had gone themselves leaving an overseer to extract what little might yet be extracted out of the property it too often happened that that little was not sufficient to meet the demands of the overseer himself the house at mount pleasant had been an irregular lowroofed picturesque residence built with only one floor and surrounded on all sides by large verandahs in the old days it had always been kept in perfect order but now this was far from being the case few young bachelors can keep a house in order but no bachelor young or old can do so under such a doom as that of maurice cumming every shilling that maurice cumming could collect was spent in bribing negroes to work for him but bribe as he would the negroes would not work no massa me pain here me no workee today and sambo would lay his fat hand on his fat stomach i have said that he lived generally alone occasionally his house on mount pleasant was enlivened by visits of an aunt a maiden sister of his mother whose usual residence was at spanish town it is or should be known to all men that spanish town was and is the seat of jamaica legislature but maurice was not over fond of his relative in this he was both wrong and foolish for miss sarah jacksuch was her namewas in many respects a good woman and was certainly a rich woman it is true that she was not a handsome woman nor a fashionable woman nor perhaps altogether an agreeable woman she was tall thin ungainly and yellow her voice which she used freely was harsh she was a politician and a patriot she regarded england as the greatest of countries and jamaica as the greatest of colonies but much as she loved england she was very loud in denouncing what she called the perfidy of the mother to the brightest of her children and much as she loved jamaica she was equally severe in her taunts against those of her brotherislanders who would not believe that the island might yet flourish as it had flourished in her fathers days it is because you and men like you will not do your duty by your country she had said some score of times to mauricenot with much justice considering the laboriousness of his life but maurice knew well what she meant what could i do there up at spanish town he would answer among such a pack as there are there here i may do something and then she would reply with the full swing of her eloquence it is because you and such as you think only of yourself and not of jamaica that jamaica has come to such a pass as this why is there a pack there as you call them in the honourable house of assembly why are not the best men in the island to be found there as the best men in england are to be found in the british house of commons a pack indeed my father was proud of a seat in that house and i remember the day maurice cumming when your father also thought it no shame to represent his own parish if men like you who have a stake in the country will not go there of course the house is filled with men who have no stake if they are a pack it is you who send them thereyou and others like you all had its effect though at the moment maurice would shrug his shoulders and turn away his head from the torrent of the ladys discourse but miss jack though she was not greatly liked was greatly respected maurice would not own that she convinced him but at last he did allow his name to be put up as candidate for his own parish and in due time he became a member of the honourable house of assembly in jamaica this honour entails on the holder of it the necessity of living at or within reach of spanish town for some ten weeks towards the close of every year now on the whole face of the uninhabited globe there is perhaps no spot more dull to look at more lethean in its aspect more corpselike or more cadaverous than spanish town it is the headquarters of the government the seat of the legislature the residence of the governorbut nevertheless it is as it were a city of the very dead here as we have said before lived miss jack in a large forlorn ghostlike house in which her father and all her family had lived before her and as a matter of course maurice cumming when he came up to attend to his duties as a member of the legislature took up his abode with her now at the time of which we are specially speaking he had completed the first of these annual visits he had already benefited his country by sitting out one session of the colonial parliament and had satisfied himself that he did no other good than that of keeping away some person more objectionable than himself he was however prepared to repeat this selfsacrifice in a spirit of patriotism for which he received a very meagre meed of eulogy from miss jack and an amount of selfapplause which was not much more extensive down at mount pleasant i can do something he would say over and over again but what good can any man do up here you can do your duty miss jack would answer as others did before you when the colony was made to prosper and then they would run off into a long discussion about free labour and protective duties but at the present moment maurice cumming had another vexation on his mind over and above that arising from his wasted hours at spanish town and his fruitless labours at mount pleasant he was in love and was not altogether satisfied with the conduct of his ladylove miss jack had other nephews besides maurice cumming and nieces also of whom marian leslie was one the family of the leslies lived up near newcastlein the mountains that is which stand over kingstonat a distance of some eighteen miles from kingston but in a climate as different from that of the town as the climate of naples is from that of berlin in kingston the heat is all but intolerable throughout the year by day and by night in the house and out of it in the mountains round newcastle some four thousand feet above the sea it is merely warm during the day and cool enough at night to make a blanket desirable it is pleasant enough living up amongst those green mountains there are no roads there for wheeled carriages nor are there carriages with or without wheels all journeys are made on horseback every visit paid from house to house is performed in this manner ladies young and old live before dinner in their ridinghabits the hospitality is free easy and unembarrassed the scenery is magnificent the tropical foliage is wild and luxuriant beyond measure there may be enjoyed all that a southern climate has to offer of enjoyment without the penalties which such enjoyments usually entail mrs leslie was a halfsister of miss jack and miss jack had been a halfsister also of mrs cumming but mrs leslie and mrs cumming had in no way been related and it had so happened that up to the period of his legislative efforts maurice cumming had seen nothing of the leslies soon after his arrival at spanish town he had been taken by miss jack to shandy hall for so the residence of the leslies was called and having remained there for three days had fallen in love with marian leslie now in the west indies all young ladies flirt it is the first habit of their natureand few young ladies in the west indies were more given to flirting or understood the science better than marian leslie maurice cumming fell violently in love and during his first visit at shandy hall found that marian was perfectionfor during this first visit her propensities were exerted altogether in his own favour that little circumstance does make such a difference in a young mans judgment of a girl he came back full of admiration not altogether to miss jacks dissatisfaction for miss jack was willing enough that both her nephew and her niece should settle down into married life but then maurice met his fair one at a governors ballat a ball where red coats abounded and aidesdecamp dancing in spurs and narrowwaisted lieutenants with sashes or epaulettes the aidesdecamp and narrowwaisted lieutenants waltzed better than he did and as one after the other whisked round the ballroom with marian firmly clasped in his arms maurices feelings were not of the sweetest nor was this the worst of it had the whisking been divided equally among ten he might have forgiven it but there was one specially narrowwaisted lieutenant who towards the end of the evening kept marian nearly wholly to himself now to a man in love who has had but little experience of either balls or young ladies this is intolerable he only met her twice after that before his return to mount pleasant and on the first occasion that odious soldier was not there but a specially devout young clergyman was present an unmarried evangelical handsome young curate fresh from england and marians piety had been so excited that she had cared for no one else it appeared moreover that the curates gifts for conversion were confined as regarded that opportunity to marians advantage i will have nothing more to say to her said maurice to himself scowling but just as he went away marian had given him her hand and called him mauricefor she pretended that they were cousinsand had looked into his eyes and declared that she did hope that the assembly at spanish town would soon be sitting again hitherto she said she had not cared one straw about it then poor maurice pressed the little fingers which lay within his own and swore that he would be at shandy hall on the day before his return to mount pleasant so he was and there he found the narrowwaisted lieutenant not now bedecked with sash and epaulettes but lolling at his ease on mrs leslies sofa in a white jacket while marian sat at his feet telling his fortune with a book about flowers oh a musk rose mr ewing you know what a musk rose means then she got up and shook hands with mr cumming but her eyes still went away to the white jacket and the sofa poor maurice had often been nearly brokenhearted in his efforts to manage his free black labourers but even that was easier than managing such as marian leslie marian leslie was a creoleas also were miss jack and maurice cumminga child of the tropics but by no means such a child as tropical children are generally thought to be by us in more northern latitudes she was blackhaired and blackeyed but her lips were as red and her cheeks as rosy as though she had been born and bred in regions where the snow lies in winter she was a small pretty beautifully made little creature somewhat idle as regards the work of the world but active and strong enough when dancing or riding were required from her her father was a banker and was fairly prosperous in spite of the poverty of his country his house of business was at kingston and he usually slept there twice a week but he always resided at shandy hall and mrs leslie and her children knew but very little of the miseries of kingston for be it known to all men that of all towns kingston jamaica is the most miserable i fear that i shall have set my readers very much against marian lesliemuch more so than i would wish to do as a rule they will not know how thoroughly flirting is an institution in the west indiespractised by all young ladies and laid aside by them when they marry exactly as their younglady names and younglady habits of various kinds are laid aside all i would say of marian leslie is this that she understood the working of the institution more thoroughly than others did and i must add also in her favour that she did not keep her flirting for sly corners nor did her admirers keep their distance till mamma was out of the way it mattered not to her who was present had she been called on to make one at a synod of the clergy of the island she would have flirted with the bishop before all his priests and there have been bishops in the colony who would not have gainsayed her but maurice cumming did not rightly calculate all this nor indeed did miss jack do so as thoroughly as she should have done for miss jack knew more about such matters than did poor maurice if you like marian why dont you marry her miss jack had once said to him and this coming from miss jack who was made of money was a great deal she wouldnt have me maurice had answered thats more than you know or i either was miss jacks reply but if you like to try ill help you with reference to this maurice as he left miss jacks residence on his return to mount pleasant had declared that marian leslie was not worth an honest mans love psha miss jack replied marian will do like other girls when you marry a wife i suppose you mean to be master at any rate i shant marry her said maurice and so he went his way back to hanover with a sore heart and no wonder for that was the very day on which lieutenant ewing had asked the question about the musk rose but there was a dogged constancy of feeling about maurice which could not allow him to disburden himself of his love when he was again at mount pleasant among his sugarcanes and hogsheads he could not help thinking about marian it is true he always thought of her as flying round that ballroom in ewings arms or looking up with rapt admiration into that young parsons face and so he got but little pleasure from his thoughts but not the less was he in love with hernot the less though he would swear to himself three times in the day that for no earthly consideration would he marry marian leslie the early months of the year from january to may are the busiest with a jamaica sugargrower and in this year they were very busy months with maurice cumming it seemed as though there were actually some truth in miss jacks prediction that prosperity would return to him if he attended to his country for the prices of sugar had risen higher than they had ever been since the duty had been withdrawn and there was more promise of a crop at mount pleasant than he had seen since his reign commenced but then the question of labour how he slaved in trying to get work from those free negroes and alas how often he slaved in vain but it was not all in vain for as things went on it became clear to him that in this year he would for the first time since he commenced obtain something like a return from his land what if the turningpoint had come and things were now about to run the other way but then the happiness which might have accrued to him from this source was dashed by his thoughts of marian leslie why had he thrown himself in the way of that syren why had he left mount pleasant at all he knew that on his return to spanish town his first work would be to visit shandy hall and yet he felt that of all places in the island shandy hall was the last which he ought to visit and then about the beginning of may when he was hard at work turning the last of his canes into sugar and rum he received his annual visit from miss jack and whom should miss jack bring with her but mr leslie ill tell you what it is said miss jack i have spoken to mr leslie about you and marian then you had no business to do anything of the kind said maurice blushing up to his ears nonsense replied miss jack i understand what i am about of course mr leslie will want to know something about the estate then he may go back as wise as he came for hell learn nothing from me not that i have anything to hide so i told him now there are a large family of them you see and of course he cant give marian much i dont care a straw if he doesnt give her a shilling if she cared for me or i for her i shouldnt look after her for her money but a little money is not a bad thing maurice said miss jack who in her time had had a good deal and had managed to take care of it it is all one to me but what i was going to say is thishumha i dont like to pledge myself for fear i should raise hopes which maynt be fulfilled dont pledge yourself to anything aunt in which marian leslie and i are concerned but what i was going to say is this my money what little i have you know must go some day either to you or to the leslies you may give all to them if you please of course i may and i dare say i shall said miss jack who was beginning to be irritated but at any rate you might have the civility to listen to me when i am endeavouring to put you on your legs i am sure i think about nothing else morning noon and night and yet i never get a decent word from you marian is too good for you thats the truth but at length miss jack was allowed to open her budget and to make her proposition which amounted to thisthat she had already told mr leslie that she would settle the bulk of her property conjointly on maurice and marian if they would make a match of it now as mr leslie had long been casting a hankering eye after miss jacks money with a strong conviction however that maurice cumming was her favourite nephew and probable heir this proposition was not unpalatable so he agreed to go down to mount pleasant and look about him but you may live for the next thirty years my dear miss jack mr leslie had said yes i may miss jack replied looking very dry and i am sure i hope you will continued mr leslie and then the subject was allowed to drop for mr leslie knew that it was not always easy to talk to miss jack on such matters miss jack was a person in whom i think we may say that the good predominated over the bad she was often morose crabbed and selfopinionated but then she knew her own imperfections and forgave those she loved for evincing their dislike of them maurice cumming was often inattentive to her plainly showing that he was worried by her importunities and ill at ease in her company but she loved her nephew with all her heart and though she dearly liked to tyrannise over him never allowed herself to be really angry with him though he so frequently refused to bow to her dictation and she loved marian leslie also though marian was so sweet and lovely and she herself so harsh and illfavoured she loved marian though marian would often be impertinent she forgave the flirting the lightheartedness the love of amusement marian she said to herself was young and pretty she miss jack had never known marians temptation and so she resolved in her own mind that marian should be made a good and happy womanbut always as the wife of maurice cumming but maurice turned a deaf ear to all these good tidingsor rather he turned to them an ear that seemed to be deaf he dearly ardently loved that little flirt but seeing that she was a flirt that she had flirted so grossly when he was by he would not confess his love to a human being he would not have it known that he was wasting his heart for a worthless little chit to whom every man was the sameexcept that those were most eligible whose toes were the lightest and their outside trappings the brightest that he did love her he could not help but he would not disgrace himself by acknowledging it he was very civil to mr leslie but he would not speak a word that could be taken as a proposal for marian it had been part of miss jacks plan that the engagement should absolutely be made down there at mount pleasant without any reference to the young lady but maurice could not be induced to break the ice so he took mr leslie through his mills and over his canepieces talked to him about the laziness of the niggers while the niggers themselves stood by tittering and rode with him away to the high grounds where the coffee plantation had been in the good old days but not a word was said between them about marian and yet marian was never out of his heart and then came the day on which mr leslie was to go back to kingston and you wont have her then said miss jack to her nephew early that morning you wont be said by me not in this matter aunt then you will live and die a poor man you mean that i suppose its likely enough that i shall theres this comfort at any rate im used to it and then miss jack was silent again for a while very well sir thats enough she said angrily and then she began again but maurice you wouldnt have to wait for my death you know and she put out her hand and touched his arm entreating him as it were to yield to her oh maurice she said i do so want to make you comfortable let us speak to mr leslie but maurice would not he took her hand and thanked her but said that on this matter he must be his own master very well sir she exclaimed i have done in future you may manage for yourself as for me i shall go back with mr leslie to kingston and so she did mr leslie returned that day taking her with him when he took his leave his invitation to maurice to come to shandy hall was not very pressing mrs leslie and the children will always be glad to see you said he remember me very kindly to mrs leslie and the children said maurice and so they parted you have brought me down here on a regular fools errand said mr leslie on their journey back to town it will all come right yet replied miss jack take my word for it he loves her fudge said mr leslie but he could not afford to quarrel with his rich connection in spite of all that he had said and thought to the contrary maurice did look forward during the remainder of the summer to his return to spanish town with something like impatience it was very dull work being there alone at mount pleasant and let him do what he would to prevent it his very dreams took him to shandy hall but at last the slow time made itself away and he found himself once more in his aunts house a couple of days passed and no word was said about the leslies on the morning of the third day he determined to go to shandy hall hitherto he had never been there without staying for the night but on this occasion he made up his mind to return the same day it would not be civil of me not to go there he said to his aunt certainly not she replied forbearing to press the matter further but why make such a terrible hard days work of it oh i shall go down in the cool before breakfast and then i need not have the bother of taking a bag and in this way he started miss jack said nothing further but she longed in her heart that she might be at marians elbow unseen during the visit he found them all at breakfast and the first to welcome him at the hall door was marian oh mr cumming we are so glad to see you and she looked into his eyes with a way she had that was enough to make a mans heart wild but she did not call him maurice now miss jack had spoken to her sister mrs leslie as well as to mr leslie about this marriage scheme just let them alone was mrs leslies advice you cant alter marian by lecturing her if they really love each other theyll come together and if they dont why then theyd better not and you really mean that youre going back to spanish town today said mrs leslie to her visitor im afraid i must indeed i havent brought my things with me and then he again caught marians eye and began to wish that his resolution had not been so sternly made i suppose you are so fond of that house of assembly said marian that you cannot tear yourself away for more than one day youll not be able i suppose to find time to come to our picnic next week maurice said he feared that he should not have time to go to a picnic oh nonsense said fannyone of the younger girlsyou must come we cant do without him can we marian has got your name down the first on the list of the gentlemen said another yes and captain ewings second said bell the youngest im afraid i must induce your sister to alter her list said maurice in his sternest manner i cannot manage to go and im sure she will not miss me marian looked at the little girl who had so unfortunately mentioned the warriors name and the little girl knew that she had sinned oh we cannot possibly do without you can we marian said fanny its to be at bingleys dell and weve got a bed for you at newcastle quite near you know and another for began bell but she stopped herself go away to your lessons bell said marian you know how angry mamma will be at your staying here all the morning and poor bell with a sorrowful look left the room we are all certainly very anxious that you should come very anxious for a great many reasons said marian in a voice that was rather solemn and as though the matter were one of considerable import but if you really cannot why of course there is no more to be said there will be plenty without me i am sure as regards numbers i dare say there will for we shall have pretty nearly the whole of the two regiments and marian as she alluded to the officers spoke in a tone which might lead one to think that she would much rather be without them but we counted on you as being one of ourselves and as you had been away so long we thoughtwe thought and then she turned away her face and did not finish her speech before he could make up his mind as to his answer she had risen from her chair and walked out of the room maurice almost thought that he saw a tear in her eye as she went he did ride back to spanish town that afternoon after an early dinner but before he went marian spoke to him alone for one minute i hope you are not offended with me she said offended oh no how could i be offended with you because you seem so stern i am sure i would do anything i could to oblige you if i knew how it would be so shocking not to be good friends with a cousin like you but there are so many different sorts of friends said maurice of course there are there are a great many friends that one does not care a bit forpeople that one meets at balls and places like that and at picnics said maurice well some of them there too but we are not like that are we what could maurice do but say no and declare that their friendship was of a warmer description and how could he resist promising to go to the picnic though as he made the promise he knew that misery would be in store for him he did promise and then she gave him her hand and called him maurice oh i am so glad she said it seemed so shocking that you should refuse to join us and mind and be early maurice for i shall want to explain it all we are to meet you know at clifton gate at one oclock but do you be a little before that and we shall be there maurice cumming resolved within his own breast as he rode back to spanish town that if marian behaved to him all that day at the picnic as she had done this day at shandy hall he would ask her to be his wife before he left her and miss jack also was to be at the picnic there is no need of going early said she when her nephew made a fuss about the starting people are never very punctual at such affairs as that and then they are always quite long enough but maurice explained that he was anxious to be early and on this occasion he carried his point when they reached clifton gate the ladies were already there not in carriages as people go to picnics in other and tamer countries but each on her own horse or her own pony but they were not alone beside miss leslie was a gentleman whom maurice knew as lieutenant graham of the flagship at port royal and at a little distance which quite enabled him to join in the conversation was captain ewing the lieutenant with the narrow waist of the previous year we shall have a delightful day miss leslie said the lieutenant oh charming isnt it said marian but now to choose a place for dinner captain ewingwhat do you say will you commission me to select you know im very well up in geometry and all that but that wont teach you what sort of a place does for a picnic dinnerwill it mr cumming and then she shook hands with maurice but did not take any further special notice of him well all go together if you please the commission is too important to be left to one and then marian rode off and the lieutenant and the captain rode with her it was open for maurice to join them if he chose but he did not choose he had come there ever so much earlier than he need have done dragging his aunt with him because marian had told him that his services would be specially required by her and now as soon as she saw him she went away with the two officerswent away without vouchsafing him a word he made up his mind there on the spot that he would never think of her againnever speak to her otherwise than he might speak to the most indifferent of mortals and yet he was a man that could struggle right manfully with the worlds troubles one who had struggled with them from his boyhood and had never been overcome now he was unable to conceal the bitterness of his wrath because a little girl had ridden off to look for a green spot for her tablecloth without asking his assistance picnics are i think in general rather tedious for the elderly people who accompany them when the joints become a little stiff dinners are eaten most comfortably with the accompaniment of chairs and tables and a roof overhead is an agrment de plus but nevertheless picnics cannot exist without a certain allowance of elderly people the miss marians and captains ewing cannot go out to dine on the grass without some one to look after them so the elderly people go to picnics in a dull tame way doing their duty and wishing the day over now on the morning in question when marian rode off with captain ewing and lieutenant graham maurice cumming remained among the elderly people a certain mr pomken a great jamaica agriculturist one of the council a man who had known the good old times got him by the button and held him fast discoursing wisely of sugar and rum of gadsden pans and recreant negroes on all of which subjects maurice cumming was known to have an opinion of his own but as mr pomkens words sounded into one ear into the other fell notes listened to from afarthe shrill laughing voice of marian leslie as she gave her happy order to her satellites around her and ever and anon the bass hawhaw of captain ewing who was made welcome as the chief of her attendants that evening in a whisper to a brother councillor mr pomken communicated his opinion that after all there was not so much in that young cumming as some people said but mr pomken had no idea that that young cumming was in love and then the dinner came spread over half an acre maurice was among the last who seated himself and when he did so it was in an awkward comfortless corner behind mr pomkens back and far away from the laughter and mirth of the day but yet from his comfortless corner he could see marian as she sat in her pride of power with her friend julia davis near her a flirt as bad as herself and her satellites around her obedient to her nod and happy in her smiles now i wont allow any more champagne said marian or who will there be steady enough to help me over the rocks to the grotto oh you have promised me cried the captain indeed i have not have i julia miss davis has certainly promised me said the lieutenant i have made no promise and dont think i shall go at all said julia who was sometimes inclined to imagine that captain ewing should be her own property all which and much more of the kind maurice cumming could not hear but he could seeand imagine which was worse how innocent and inane are after all the flirtings of most young ladies if all their words and doings in that line could be brought to paper i do not know whether there be as a rule more vocal expression of the sentiment of love between a man and woman than there is between two thrushes they whistle and call to each other guided by instinct rather than by reason you are going home with the ladies tonight i believe said maurice to miss jack immediately after dinner miss jack acknowledged that such was her destination for the night then my going back to spanish town at once wont hurt any onefor to tell the truth i have had enough of this work why maurice you were in such a hurry to come the more fool i and so now i am in a hurry to go away dont notice it to anybody miss jack looked in his face and saw that he was really wretched and she knew the cause of his wretchedness dont go yet maurice she said and then added with a tenderness that was quite uncommon with her go to her maurice and speak to her openly and freely once for all you will find that she will listen then dear maurice do for my sake he made no answer but walked away roaming sadly by himself among the trees listen he exclaimed to himself yes she will alter a dozen times in as many hours who can care for a creature that can change as she changes and yet he could not help caring for her as he went on climbing among rocks he again came upon the sound of voices and heard especially that of captain ewing now miss leslie if you will take my hand you will soon be over all the difficulty and then a party of seven or eight scrambling over some stones came nearly on the level on which he stood in full view of him and leading the others were captain ewing and miss leslie he turned on his heel to go away when he caught the sound of a step following him and a voice saying oh there is mr cumming and i want to speak to him and in a minute a light hand was on his arm why are you running away from us said marian becauseoh i dont know i am not running away you have your party made up and i am not going to intrude on it what nonsense do come now we are going to this wonderful grotto i thought it so illnatured of you not joining us at dinner indeed you know you had promised he did not answer her but he looked at herfull in the face with his sad eyes laden with love she half understood his countenance but only half understood it what is the matter maurice she said are you angry with me will you come and join us no marian i cannot do that but if you can leave them and come with me for half an hour i will not keep you longer she stood hesitating a moment while her companion remained on the spot where she had left him come miss leslie called captain ewing you will have it dark before we can get down i will come with you whispered she to maurice but wait a moment and she tripped back and in some five minutes returned after an eager argument with her friends there she said i dont care about the grotto one bit and i will walk with you nowonly they will think it so odd and so they started off together before the tropical darkness had fallen upon them maurice had told the tale of his loveand had told it in a manner differing much from that of marians usual admirers he spoke with passion and almost with violence he declared that his heart was so full of her image that he could not rid himself of it for one minute nor would he wish to do so he said if she would be his marian his own marian his very own but if not and then he explained to her with all a lovers warmth and with almost more than a lovers liberty what was his idea of her being his own his very own and in doing so inveighed against her usual lightheartedness in terms which at any rate were strong enough but marian bore it all well perhaps she knew that the lesson was somewhat deserved and perhaps she appreciated at its value the love of such a man as maurice cumming weighing in her judgment the difference between him and the ewings and the grahams and then she answered him well and prudently with words which startled him by their prudent seriousness as coming from her she begged his pardon heartily she said for any grief which she had caused him but yet how was she to be blamed seeing that she had known nothing of his feelings her father and mother had said something to her of this proposed marriage something but very little and she had answered by saying that she did not think maurice had any warmer regard for her than of a cousin after this answer neither father nor mother had pressed the matter further as to her own feelings she could then say nothing for she then knew nothingnothing but this that she loved no one better than him or rather that she loved no one else she would ask herself if she could love him but he must give her some little time for that in the meantimeand she smiled sweetly at him as she made the promiseshe would endeavour to do nothing that would offend him and then she added that on that evening she would dance with him any dances that he liked maurice with a selfdenial that was not very wise contented himself with engaging her for the first quadrille they were to dance that night in the messroom of the officers at newcastle this scheme had been added on as an adjunct to the picnic and it therefore became necessary that the ladies should retire to their own or their friends houses at newcastle to adjust their dresses marian leslie and julia davis were there accommodated with the loan of a small room by the majors wife and as they were brushing their hair and putting on their dancingshoes something was said between them about maurice cumming and so you are to be mrs c of mount pleasant said julia well i didnt think it would come to that at last but it has not come to that and if it did why should i not be mrs c as you call it the knight of the rueful countenance i call him i tell you what then he is an excellent young man and the fact is you dont know him i dont like excellent young men with long faces i suppose you wont be let to dance quick dances at all now i shall dance whatever dances i like as i have always done said marian with some little asperity in her tone not you or if you do youll lose your promotion youll never live to be my lady rue and what will graham say you know youve given him half a promise thats not true juliai never gave him the tenth part of a promise well he says so and then the words between the young ladies became a little more angry but nevertheless in due time they came forth with faces smiling as usual with their hair properly brushed and without any signs of warfare but marian had to stand another attack before the business of the evening commenced and this was from no less doughty an antagonist than her aunt miss jack miss jack soon found that maurice had not kept his threat of going home and though she did not absolutely learn from him that he had gone so far towards perfecting her dearest hopes as to make a formal offer to marian nevertheless she did gather that things were fast that way tending if only this dancing were over she said to herself dreading the unnumbered waltzes with ewing and the violent polkas with graham so miss jack resolved to say one word to mariana wise word in good season said miss jack to herself how sweet a thing it is marian said she step here a moment i want to say a word to you yes aunt sarah said marian following her aunt into a corner not quite in the best humour in the world for she had a dread of some further interference are you going to dance with maurice tonight yes i believe sothe first quadrille well what i was going to say is this i dont want you to dance many quick dances tonight for a reason i havethat is not a great many why aunt what nonsense now my dearest dearest girl it is all for your own sake well then it must out he does not like it you know what he maurice well aunt i dont know that im bound to dance or not to dance just as mr cumming may like papa does not mind my dancing the people have come here to dance and you can hardly want to make me ridiculous by sitting still and so that wise word did not appear to be very sweet and then the amusement of the evening commenced and marian stood up for a quadrille with her lover she however was not in the very best humour she had as she thought said and done enough for one day in maurices favour and she had no idea as she declared to herself of being lectured by aunt sarah dearest marian he said to her as the quadrille came to a close it is in your power to make me so happyso perfectly happy but then people have such different ideas of happiness she replied they cant all see with the same eyes you know and so they parted but during the early part of the evening she was sufficiently discreet she did waltz with lieutenant graham and polka with captain ewing but she did so in a tamer manner than was usual with her and she made no emulous attempts to dance down other couples when she had done she would sit down and then she consented to stand up for two quadrilles with two very tame gentlemen to whom no lover could object and so marian your wings are regularly clipped at last said julia davis coming up to her no more clipped than your own said marian if sir rue wont let you waltz now what will he require of you when youre married to him i am just as well able to waltz with whom i like as you are julia and if you say so in that way i shall think its envy hahaha i may have envied you some of your beaux before now i dare say i have but i certainly do not envy you sir rue and then she went off to her partner all this was too much for marians weak strength and before long she was again whirling round with captain ewing come miss leslie said he let us see what we can do graham and julia davis have been saying that your waltzing days are over but i think we can put them down marian as she got up and raised her arm in order that ewing might put his round her waist caught maurices eye as he leaned against a wall and read in it a stern rebuke this is too bad she said to herself he shall not make a slave of me at any rate as yet and away she went as madly more madly than ever and for the rest of the evening she danced with captain ewing and with him alone there is an intoxication quite distinct from that which comes from strong drink when the judgment is altogether overcome by the spirits this species of drunkenness comes on and in this way marian leslie was drunk that night for two hours she danced with captain ewing and ever and anon she kept saying to herself that she would teach the world to knowand of all the world mr cumming especiallythat she might be lead but not driven then about four oclock she went home and as she attempted to undress herself in her own room she burst into violent tears and opened her heart to her sisteroh fanny i do love him i do love him so dearly and now he will never come to me again maurice stood still with his back against the wall for the full two hours of marians exhibition and then he said to his aunt before he lefti hope you have now seen enough you will hardly mention her name to me again miss jack groaned from the bottom of her heart but she said nothing she said nothing that night to any one but she lay awake in her bed thinking till it was time to rise and dress herself ask miss marian to come to me she said to the black girl who came to assist her but it was not till she had sent three times that miss marian obeyed the summons at three oclock on the following day miss jack arrived at her own hall door in spanish town long as the distance was she ordinarily rode it all but on this occasion she had provided a carriage to bring her over as much of the journey as it was practicable for her to perform on wheels as soon as she reached her own hall door she asked if mr cumming was at home yes the servant said he was in the small bookroom at the back of the house up stairs silently as if afraid of being heard she stepped up her own stairs into her own drawingroom and very silently she was followed by a pair of feet lighter and smaller than her own miss jack was usually somewhat of a despot in her own house but there was nothing despotic about her now as she peered into the bookroom this she did with her bonnet still on looking round the halfopened door as though she were afraid to disturb her nephew he sat at the window looking out into the verandah which ran behind the house so intent on his thoughts that he did not hear her maurice she said can i come in come in oh yes of course and he turned round sharply at her i tell you what aunt i am not well here and i cannot stay out the session i shall go back to mount pleasant maurice and she walked close up to him as she spoke maurice i have brought some one with me to ask your pardon his face became red up to the roots of his hair as he stood looking at her without answering you would grant it certainly she continued if you knew how much it would be valued whom do you mean who is it he asked at last one who loves you as well as you love herand she cannot love you better come in marian the poor girl crept in at the door ashamed of what she was induced to do but yet looking anxiously into her lovers face you asked her yesterday to be your wife said miss jack and she did not then know her own mind now she has had a lesson you will ask her once again will you not maurice what was he to say how was he to refuse when that soft little hand was held out to him when those eyes laden with tears just ventured to look into his face i beg your pardon if i angered you last night she said in half a minute miss jack had left the room and in the space of another thirty seconds maurice had forgiven her i am your own now you know she whispered to him in the course of that long evening yesterday you know but the sentence was never finished it was in vain that julia davis was illnatured and sarcastic in vain that ewing and graham made joint attempt upon her constancy from that night to the morning of her marriageand the interval was only three monthsmarian leslie was never known to flirt the courtship of susan bell john munroe bell had been a lawyer in albany state of new york and as such had thriven well he had thriven well as long as thrift and thriving on this earth had been allowed to him but the almighty had seen fit to shorten his span early in life he had married a timid anxious pretty good little wife whose whole heart and mind had been given up to do his bidding and deserve his love she had not only deserved it but had possessed it and as long as john munroe bell had lived henrietta bellhetta as he called herhad been a woman rich in blessings after twelve years of such blessings he had left her and had left with her two daughters a second hetta and the heroine of our little story susan bell a lawyer in albany may thrive passing well for eight or ten years and yet not leave behind him any very large sum of money if he dies at the end of that time some small modicum some few thousand dollars john bell had amassed so that his widow and daughters were not absolutely driven to look for work or bread in those happy days when cash had begun to flow in plenteously to the young father of the family he had taken it into his head to build for himself or rather for his young female brood a small neat house in the outskirts of saratoga springs in doing so he was instigated as much by the excellence of the investment for his pocket as by the salubrity of the place for his girls he furnished the house well and then during some summer weeks his wife lived there and sometimes he let it how the widow grieved when the lord of her heart and master of her mind was laid in the grave i need not tell she had already counted ten years of widowhood and her children had grown to be young women beside her at the time of which i am now about to speak since that sad day on which they had left albany they had lived together at the cottage at the springs in winter their life had been lonely enough but as soon as the hot weather began to drive the fainting citizens out from new york they had always received two or three boardersold ladies generally and occasionally an old gentlemanpersons of very steady habits with whose pockets the widows moderate demands agreed better than the hotel charges and so the bells lived for ten years that saratoga is a gay place in july august and september the world knows well enough to girls who go there with trunks full of muslin and crinoline for whom a carriage and pair of horses is always waiting immediately after dinner whose fathers pockets are bursting with dollars it is a very gay place dancing and flirtations come as a matter of course and matrimony follows after with only too great rapidity but the place was not very gay for hetta or susan bell in the first place the widow was a timid woman and among other fears feared greatly that she should be thought guilty of setting traps for husbands poor mothers how often are they charged with this sin when their honest desires go no further than that their bairns may be respectit like the lave and then she feared flirtations flirtations that should be that and nothing more flirtations that are so destructive of the hearts sweetest essence she feared love also though she longed for that as well as feared itfor her girls i mean all such feelings for herself were long laid under groundand then like a timid creature as she was she had other indefinite fears and among them a great fear that those girls of hers would be left husbandlessa phase of life which after her twelve years of bliss she regarded as anything but desirable but the upshot wasthe upshot of so many fears and such small meansthat hetta and susan bell had but a dull life of it were it not that i am somewhat closely restricted in the number of my pages i would describe at full the merits and beauties of hetta and susan bell as it is i can but say a few words at our period of their lives hetta was nearly oneandtwenty and susan was just nineteen hetta was a short plump demure young woman with the softest smoothed hair and the brownest brightest eyes she was very useful in the house good at corn cakes and thought much particularly in these latter months of her religious duties her sister in the privacy of their own little room would sometimes twit her with the admiring patience with which she would listen to the lengthened eloquence of mr phineas beckard the baptist minister now mr phineas beckard was a bachelor susan was not so good a girl in the kitchen or about the house as was her sister but she was bright in the parlour and if that motherly heart could have been made to give out its inmost secretwhich however it could not have been made to give out in any way painful to dear hettaperhaps it might have been found that susan was loved with the closest love she was taller than her sister and lighter her eyes were blue as were her mothers her hair was brighter than hettas but not always so singularly neat she had a dimple on her chin whereas hetta had none dimples on her cheeks too when she smiled and oh such a mouth there my allowance of pages permits no more one piercing cold winters day there came knocking at the widows doora young man winter days when the ice of january is refrozen by the wind of february are very cold at saratoga springs in these days there was not often much to disturb the serenity of mrs bells house but on the day in question there came knocking at the doora young man mrs bell kept an old domestic who had lived with them in those happy albany days her name was kate obrien but though picturesque in name she was hardly so in person she was a thickset noisy goodnatured old irishwoman who had joined her lot to that of mrs bell when the latter first began housekeeping and knowing when she was well off had remained in the same place from that day forth she had known hetta as a baby and so to say had seen susans birth and what might you be wanting sir said kate obrien apparently not quite pleased as she opened the door and let in all the cold air i wish to see mrs bell is not this mrs bells house said the young man shaking the snow from out of the breast of his coat he did see mrs bell and we will now tell who he was and why he had come and how it came to pass that his carpetbag was brought down to the widows house and one of the front bedrooms was prepared for him and that he drank tea that night in the widows parlour his name was aaron dunn and by profession he was an engineer what peculiar misfortune in those days of frost and snow had befallen the line of rails which runs from schenectady to lake champlain i never quite understood banks and bridges had in some way come to grief and on aaron dunns shoulders was thrown the burden of seeing that they were duly repaired saratoga springs was the centre of these mishaps and therefore at saratoga springs it was necessary that he should take up his temporary abode now there was at that time in new york city a mr bell great in railway mattersan uncle of the once thriving but now departed albany lawyer he was a rich man but he liked his riches himself or at any rate had not found himself called upon to share them with the widow and daughters of his nephew but when it chanced to come to pass that he had a hand in despatching aaron dunn to saratoga he took the young man aside and recommended him to lodge with the widow there said he show her my card so much the rich uncle thought he might vouchsafe to do for the nephews widow mrs bell and both her daughters were in the parlour when aaron dunn was shown in snow and all he told his story in a rough shaky voice for his teeth chattered and he gave the card almost wishing that he had gone to the empty big hotel for the widows welcome was not at first quite warm the widow listened to him as he gave his message and then she took the card and looked at it hetta who was sitting on the side of the fireplace facing the door went on demurely with her work susan gave one glance roundher back was to the strangerand then another and then she moved her chair a little nearer to the wall so as to give the young man room to come to the fire if he would he did not come but his eyes glanced upon susan bell and he thought that the old man in new york was right and that the big hotel would be cold and dull it was a pretty face to look on that cold evening as she turned it up from the stocking she was mending perhaps you dont wish to take winter boarders maam said aaron dunn we never have done so yet sir said mrs bell timidly could she let this young wolf in among her lambfold he might be a wolfwho could tell mr bell seemed to think it would suit said aaron had he acquiesced in her timidity and not pressed the point it would have been all up with him but the widow did not like to go against the big uncle and so she said perhaps it may sir i guess it will finely said aaron and then the widow seeing that the matter was so far settled put down her work and came round into the passage hetta followed her for there would be housework to do aaron gave himself another shake settled the weekly number of dollarswith very little difficulty on his part for he had caught another glance at susans face and then went after his bag twas thus that aaron dunn obtained an entrance into mrs bells house but what if he be a wolf she said to herself over and over again that night though not exactly in those words ay but there is another side to that question what if he be a stalwart man honestminded with clever eye cunning hand ready brain broad back and warm heart in want of a wife mayhap a man that can earn his own bread and anothershalf a dozen others when the half dozen come would not that be a good sort of lodger such a question as that too did flit just flit across the widows sleepless mind but then she thought so much more of the wolf wolves she had taught herself to think were more common than stalwart honestminded wifedesirous men i wonder mother consented to take him said hetta when they were in the little room together and why shouldnt she said susan it will be a help yes it will be a little help said hetta but we have done very well hitherto without winter lodgers but uncle bell said she was to what is uncle bell to us said hetta who had a spirit of her own and she began to surmise within herself whether aaron dunn would join the baptist congregation and whether phineas beckard would approve of this new move he is a very wellbehaved young man at any rate said susan and he draws beautifully did you see those things he was doing he draws very well i dare say said hetta who regarded this as but a poor warranty for good behaviour hetta also had some fear of wolvesnot for herself perhaps but for her sister aaron dunns workthe commencement of his worklay at some distance from the springs and he left every morning with a lot of workmen by an early trainalmost before daylight and every morning cold and wintry as the mornings were the widow got him his breakfast with her own hands she took his dollars and would not leave him altogether to the awkward mercies of kate obrien nor would she trust her girls to attend upon the young man hetta she might have trusted but then susan would have asked why she was spared her share of such hardship in the evening leaving his work when it was dark aaron always returned and then the evening was passed together but they were passed with the most demure propriety these women would make the tea cut the bread and butter and then sew while aaron dunn when the cups were removed would always go to his plans and drawings on sundays they were more together but even on this day there was cause of separation for aaron went to the episcopalian church rather to the disgust of hetta in the afternoon however they were together and then phineas beckard came in to tea on sundays and he and aaron got to talking on religion and though they disagreed pretty much and would not give an inch either one or the other nevertheless the minister told the widow and hetta too probably that the lad had good stuff in him though he was so stiffnecked but he should be more modest in talking on such matters with a minister said hetta the rev phineas acknowledged that perhaps he should but he was honest enough to repeat that the lad had stuff in him perhaps after all he is not a wolf said the widow to herself things went on in this way for above a month aaron had declared to himself over and over again that that face was sweet to look upon and had unconsciously promised to himself certain delights in talking and perhaps walking with the owner of it but the walkings had not been achievednor even the talkings as yet the truth was that dunn was bashful with young women though he could be so stiffnecked with the minister and then he felt angry with himself inasmuch as he had advanced no further and as he lay in his bedwhich perhaps those pretty hands had helped to makehe resolved that he would be a thought bolder in his bearing he had no idea of making love to susan bell of course not but why should he not amuse himself by talking to a pretty girl when she sat so near him evening after evening what a very quiet young man he is said susan to her sister he has his bread to earn and sticks to his work said hetta no doubt he has his amusement when he is in the city added the elder sister not wishing to leave too strong an impression of the young mans virtue they had all now their settled places in the parlour hetta sat on one side of the fire close to the table having that side to herself there she sat always busy she must have made every dress and bit of linen worn in the house and hemmed every sheet and towel so busy was she always sometimes once in a week or so phineas beckard would come in and then place was made for him between hettas usual seat and the table for when there he would read out loud on the other side close also to the table sat the widow busy but not savagely busy as her elder daughter between mrs bell and the wall with her feet ever on the fender susan used to sit not absolutely idle but doing work of some slender pretty sort and talking ever and anon to her mother opposite to them all at the other side of the table far away from the fire would aaron dunn place himself with his plans and drawings before him are you a judge of bridges maam said aaron the evening after he had made his resolution twas thus he began his courtship of bridges said mrs belloh dear no sir but she put out her hand to take the little drawing which aaron handed to her because thats one ive planned for our bit of a new branch from moreau up to lake george i guess miss susan knows something about bridges i guess i dont said susanonly that they oughtnt to tumble down when the frost comes ha ha ha no more they ought ill tell mcevoy that mcevoy had been a former engineer on the line well that wont burst with any frost i guess oh my how pretty said the widow and then susan of course jumped up to look over her mothers shoulder the artful dodger he had drawn and coloured a beautiful little sketch of a bridge not an engineers plan with sections and measurements vexatious to a womans eye but a graceful little bridge with a string of cars running under it you could almost hear the bell going well that is a pretty bridge said susan isnt it hetta i dont know anything about bridges said hetta to whose clever eyes the dodge was quite apparent but in spite of her cleverness mrs bell and susan had soon moved their chairs round to the table and were looking through the contents of aarons portfolio but yet he maybe a wolf thought the poor widow just as she was kneeling down to say her prayers that evening certainly made a commencement though hetta went on pertinaciously with the body of a new dress the other two ladies did not put in another stitch that night from his drawings aaron got to his instruments and before bedtime was teaching susan how to draw parallel lines susan found that she had quite an aptitude for parallel lines and altogether had a good time of it that evening it is dull to go on week after week and month after month talking only to ones mother and sister it is dull though one does not oneself recognise it to be so a little change in such matters is so very pleasant susan had not the slightest idea of regarding aaron as even a possible lover but young ladies do like the conversation of young gentlemen oh my exceedingly proper prim old lady you who are so shocked at this as a general doctrine has it never occurred to you that the creator has so intended it susan understanding little of the how and why knew that she had had a good time and was rather in spirits as she went to bed but hetta had been frightened by the dodge oh hetta you should have looked at those drawings he is so clever said susan i dont know that they would have done me much good replied hetta good well theyd do me more good than a long sermon i know said susan except on a sunday of course she added apologetically this was an illtempered attack both on hetta and hettas admirer but then why had hetta been so snappish im sure hes a wolf thought hetta as she went to bed what a very clever young man he is thought susan to herself as she pulled the warm clothes round about her shoulders and ears well that certainly was an improvement thought aaron as he went through the same operation with a stronger feeling of selfapprobation than he had enjoyed for some time past in the course of the next fortnight the family arrangements all altered themselves unless when beckard was there aaron would sit in the widows place the widow would take susans chair and the two girls would be opposite and then dunn would read to them not sermons but passages from shakspeare and byron and longfellow he reads much better than mr beckard susan had said one night of course youre a competent judge had been hettas retort i mean that i like it better said susan its well that all people dont think alike replied hetta and then there was a deal of talking the widow herself as unconscious in this respect as her youngest daughter certainly did find that a little variety was agreeable on those long winter nights and talked herself with unaccustomed freedom and beckard came there oftener and talked very much when he was there the two young men did all the talking and they pounded each other immensely but still there grew up a sort of friendship between them mr beckard seems quite to take to him said mrs bell to her eldest daughter it is his great good nature mother replied hetta it was at the end of the second month when aaron took another step in advancea perilous step sometimes on evenings he still went on with his drawing for an hour or so but during three or four evenings he never asked any one to look at what he was doing on one friday he sat over his work till late without any reading or talking at all so late that at last mrs bell said if youre going to sit much longer mr dunn ill get you to put out the candles thereby showing had he known it or had she that the mothers confidence in the young man was growing fast hetta knew all about it and dreaded that the growth was too quick ive finished now said aaron and he looked carefully at the cardboard on which he had been washing in his watercolours ive finished now he then hesitated a moment but ultimately he put the card into his portfolio and carried it up to his bedroom who does not perceive that it was intended as a present to susan bell the question which aaron asked himself that night and which he hardly knew how to answer was this should he offer the drawing to susan in the presence of her mother and sister or on some occasion when they two might be alone together no such occasion had ever yet occurred but aaron thought that it might probably be brought about but then he wanted to make no fuss about it his first intention had been to chuck the drawing lightly across the table when it was completed and so make nothing of it but he had finished it with more care than he had at first intended and then he had hesitated when he had finished it it was too late now for that plan of chucking it over the table on the saturday evening when he came down from his room mr beckard was there and there was no opportunity that night on the sunday in conformity with a previous engagement he went to hear mr beckard preach and walked to and from meeting with the family this pleased mrs bell and they were all very gracious that afternoon but sunday was no day for the picture on monday the thing had become of importance to him things always do when they are kept over before tea that evening when he came down mrs bell and susan only were in the room he knew hetta for his foe and therefore determined to use this occasion miss susan he said stammering somewhat and blushing too poor fool i have done a little drawing which i want you to accept and he put his portfolio down on the table oh i dont know said susan who had seen the blush mrs bell had seen the blush also and pursed her mouth up and looked grave had there been no stammering and no blush she might have thought nothing of it aaron saw at once that his little gift was not to go down smoothly he was however in for it now so he picked it out from among the other papers in the case and brought it over to susan he endeavoured to hand it to her with an air of indifference but i cannot say that he succeeded it was a very pretty wellfinished watercoloured drawing representing still the same bridge but with more adjuncts in susans eyes it was a work of high art of pictures probably she had seen but little and her liking for the artist no doubt added to her admiration but the more she admired it and wished for it the stronger was her feeling that she ought not to take it poor susan she stood for a minute looking at the drawing but she said nothing not even a word of praise she felt that she was red in the face and uncourteous to their lodger but her mother was looking at her and she did not know how to behave herself mrs bell put out her hand for the sketch trying to bethink herself as she did so in what least uncivil way she could refuse the present she took a moment to look at it collecting her thoughts and as she did so her womans wit came to her aid oh dear mr dunn it is very pretty quite a beautiful picture i cannot let susan rob you of that you must keep that for some of your own particular friends but i did it for her said aaron innocently susan looked down at the ground half pleased at the declaration the drawing would look very pretty in a small gilt frame put over her dressingtable but the matter now was altogether in her mothers hands i am afraid it is too valuable sir for susan to accept it is not valuable at all said aaron declining to take it back from the widows hand oh i am quite sure it is it is worth ten dollars at leastor twenty said poor mrs bell not in the very best taste but she was perplexed and did not know how to get out of the scrape the article in question now lay upon the tablecloth appropriated by no one and at this moment hetta came into the room it is not worth ten cents said aaron with something like a frown on his brow but as we had been talking about the bridge i thought miss susan would accept it accept what said hetta and then her eye fell upon the drawing and she took it up it is beautifully done said mrs bell wishing much to soften the matter perhaps the more so that hetta the demure was now present i am telling mr dunn that we cant take a present of anything so valuable oh dear no said hetta it wouldnt be right it was a cold frosty evening in march and the fire was burning brightly on the hearth aaron dunn took up the drawing quietlyvery quietlyand rolling it up as such drawings are rolled put it between the blazing logs it was the work of four evenings and his chefduvre in the way of art susan when she saw what he had done burst out into tears the widow could very readily have done so also but she was able to refrain herself and merely exclaimedoh mr dunn if mr dunn chooses to burn his own picture he has certainly a right to do so said hetta aaron immediately felt ashamed of what he had done and he also could have cried but for his manliness he walked away to one of the parlourwindows and looked out upon the frosty night it was dark but the stars were bright and he thought that he should like to be walking fast by himself along the line of rails towards balston there he stood perhaps for three minutes he thought it would be proper to give susan time to recover from her tears will you please to come to your tea sir said the soft voice of mrs bell he turned round to do so and found that susan was gone it was not quite in her power to recover from her tears in three minutes and then the drawing had been so beautiful it had been done expressly for her too and there had been something she knew not what in his eye as he had so declared she had watched him intently over those four evenings work wondering why he did not show it till her feminine curiosity had become rather strong it was something very particular she was sure and she had learned that all that precious work had been for her now all that precious work was destroyed how was it possible that she should not cry for more than three minutes the others took their meal in perfect silence and when it was over the two women sat down to their work aaron had a book which he pretended to read but instead of reading he was bethinking himself that he had behaved badly what right had he to throw them all into such confusion by indulging in his passion he was ashamed of what he had done and fancied that susan would hate him fancying that he began to find at the same time that he by no means hated her at last hetta got up and left the room she knew that her sister was sitting alone in the cold and hetta was affectionate susan had not been in fault and therefore hetta went up to console her mrs bell said aaron as soon as the door was closed i beg your pardon for what i did just now oh sir im so sorry that the picture is burnt said poor mrs bell the picture does not matter a straw said aaron but i see that i have disturbed you alland i am afraid i have made miss susan unhappy she was grieved because your picture was burnt said mrs bell putting some emphasis on the your intending to show that her daughter had not regarded the drawing as her own but the emphasis bore another meaning and so the widow perceived as soon as she had spoken oh i can do twenty more of the same if anybody wanted them said aaron if i do another like it will you let her take it mrs belljust to show that you have forgiven me and that we are friends as we were before was he or was he not a wolf that was the question which mrs bell scarcely knew how to answer hetta had given her voice saying he was lupine mr beckards opinion she had not liked to ask directly mr beckard she thought would probably propose to hetta but as yet he had not done so and as he was still a stranger in the family she did not like in any way to compromise susans name indirectly she had asked the question and indirectly also mr beckards answer had been favourable but it mustnt mean anything sir was the widows weak answer when she had paused on the question for a moment oh no of course not said aaron joyously and his face became radiant and happy and i do beg your pardon for burning it and the young ladies pardon too and then he rapidly got out his cardboard and set himself to work about another bridge the widow meditating many things in her heart commenced the hemming of a handkerchief in about an hour the two girls came back to the room and silently took their accustomed places aaron hardly looked up but went on diligently with his drawing this bridge should be a better bridge than that other its acceptance was now assured of course it was to mean nothing that was a matter of course so he worked away diligently and said nothing to anybody when they went off to bed the two girls went into the mothers room oh mother i hope he is not very angry said susan angry said hetta if anybody should be angry it is mother he ought to have known that susan could not accept it he should never have offered it but hes doing another said mrs bell not for her said hetta yes he is said mrs bell and i have promised that she shall take it susan as she heard this sank gently into the chair behind her and her eyes became full of tears the intimation was almost too much for her oh mother said hetta but i particularly said that it was to mean nothing oh mother that makes it worse why should hetta interfere in this way thought susan to herself had she interfered when mr beckard gave hetta a testament bound in morocco had not she smiled and looked gratified and kissed her sister and declared that phineas beckard was a nice dear man and by far the most elegant preacher at the springs why should hetta be so cruel i dont see that my dear said the mother hetta would not explain before her sister so they all went to bed on the thursday evening the drawing was finished not a word had been said about it at any rate in his presence and he had gone on working in silence there said he late on the thursday evening i dont know that it will be any better if i go on daubing for another hour there miss susan theres another bridge i hope that will neither burst with the frost nor yet be destroyed by fire and he gave it a light flip with his fingers and sent it skimming over the table susan blushed and smiled and took it up oh it is beautiful she said isnt it beautifully done mother and then all the three got up to look at it and all confessed that it was excellently done and i am sure we are very much obliged to you said susan after a pause remembering that she had not yet thanked him oh its nothing said he not quite liking the word we on the following day he returned from his work to saratoga about noon this he had never done before and therefore no one expected that he would be seen in the house before the evening on this occasion however he went straight thither and as chance would have it both the widow and her elder daughter were out susan was there alone in charge of the house he walked in and opened the parlour door there she sat with her feet on the fender with her work unheeded on the table behind her and the picture aarons drawing lying on her knees she was gazing at it intently as he entered thinking in her young heart that it possessed all the beauties which a picture could possess oh mr dunn she said getting up and holding the telltale sketch behind the skirt of her dress miss susan i have come here to tell your mother that i must start for new york this afternoon and be there for six weeks or perhaps longer mother is out said she im so sorry is she said aaron and hetta too dear me and youll be wanting dinner ill go and see about it aaron began to swear that he could not possibly eat any dinner he had dined once and was going to dine againanything to keep her from going but you must have something mr dunn and she walked towards the door but he put his back to it miss susan said he i guess ive been here nearly two months yes sir i believe you have she replied shaking in her shoes and not knowing which way to look and i hope we have been good friends yes sir said susan almost beside herself as to what she was saying im going away now and it seems to be such a time before ill be back will it sir six weeks miss susan and then he paused looking into her eyes to see what he could read there she leant against the table pulling to pieces a morsel of halfravelled muslin which she held in her hand but her eyes were turned to the ground and he could hardly see them miss susan he continued i may as well speak out now as at another time he too was looking towards the ground and clearly did not know what to do with his hands the truth is just this ii love you dearly with all my heart i never saw any one i ever thought so beautiful so nice and so goodand whats more i never shall im not very good at this sort of thing i know but i couldnt go away from saratoga for six weeks and not tell you and then he ceased he did not ask for any love in return his presumption had not got so far as that yet he merely declared his passion leaning against the door and there he stood twiddling his thumbs susan had not the slightest conception of the way in which she ought to receive such a declaration she had never had a lover before nor had she ever thought of aaron absolutely as a lover though something very like love for him had been crossing over her spirit now at this moment she felt that he was the beauidal of manhood though his boots were covered with the railway mud and though his pantaloons were tucked up in rolls round his ankles he was a fine wellgrown openfaced fellow whose eye was bold and yet tender whose brow was full and broad and all his bearing manly love him of course she loved him why else had her heart melted with pleasure when her mother said that that second picture was to be accepted but what was she to say anything but the open truth she well knew that the open truth would not do at all what would her mother say and hetta if she were rashly to say that hetta she knew would be dead against such a lover and of her mothers approbation she had hardly more hope why they should disapprove of aaron as a lover she had never asked herself there are many nice things that seem to be wrong only because they are so nice maybe that susan regarded a lover as one of them oh mr dunn you shouldnt that in fact was all that she could say should not i said he well perhaps not but theres the truth and no harm ever comes of that perhaps id better not ask you for an answer now but i thought it better you should know it all and remember thisi only care for one thing now in the world and that is for your love and then he paused thinking possibly that in spite of what he had said he might perhaps get some sort of an answer some inkling of the state of her hearts disposition towards him but susan had at once resolved to take him at his word when he suggested that an immediate reply was not necessary to say that she loved him was of course impossible and to say that she did not was equally so she determined therefore to close at once with the offer of silence when he ceased speaking there was a moments pause during which he strove hard to read what might be written on her downturned face but he was not good at such reading well i guess ill go and get my things ready now he said and then turned round to open the door mother will be in before you are gone i suppose said susan i have only got twenty minutes said he looking at his watch but susan tell her what i have said to you goodbye and he put out his hand he knew he should see her again but this had been his plan to get her hand in his goodbye mr dunn and she gave him her hand he held it tight for a moment so that she could not draw it awaycould not if she would will you tell your mother he asked yes she answered quite in a whisper i guess id better tell her and then she gave a long sigh he pressed her hand again and got it up to his lips mr dunn dont she said but he did kiss it god bless you my own dearest dearest girl ill just open the door as i come down perhaps mrs bell will be here and then he rushed up stairs but mrs bell did not come in she and hetta were at a weekly service at mr beckards meetinghouse and mr beckard it seemed had much to say susan when left alone sat down and tried to think but she could not think she could only love she could use her mind only in recounting to herself the perfections of that demigod whose heavy steps were so audible overhead as he walked to and fro collecting his things and putting them into his bag and then just when he had finished she bethought herself that he must be hungry she flew to the kitchen but she was too late before she could even reach at the loaf of bread he descended the stairs with a clattering noise and heard her voice as she spoke quickly to kate obrien miss susan he said dont get anything for me for im off oh mr dunn i am so sorry youll be so hungry on your journey and she came out to him in the passage i shall want nothing on the journey dearest if youll say one kind word to me again her eyes went to the ground what do you want me to say mr dunn say god bless you aaron god bless you aaron said she and yet she was sure that she had not declared her love he however thought otherwise and went up to new york with a happy heart things happened in the next fortnight rather quickly susan at once resolved to tell her mother but she resolved also not to tell hetta that afternoon she got her mother to herself in mrs bells own room and then she made a clean breast of it and what did you say to him susan i said nothing mother nothing dear no mother not a word he told me he didnt want it she forgot how she had used his christian name in bidding god bless him oh dear said the widow was it very wrong asked susan but what do you think yourself my child asked mrs bell after a while what are your own feelings mrs bell was sitting on a chair and susan was standing opposite to her against the post of the bed she made no answer but moving from her place she threw herself into her mothers arms and hid her face on her mothers shoulder it was easy enough to guess what were her feelings but my darling said her mother you must not think that it is an engagement no said susan sorrowfully young men say those things to amuse themselves wolves she would have said had she spoken out her mind freely oh mother he is not like that the daughter contrived to extract a promise from the mother that hetta should not be told just at present mrs bell calculated that she had six weeks before her as yet mr beckard had not spoken out but there was reason to suppose that he would do so before those six weeks would be over and then she would be able to seek counsel from him mr beckard spoke out at the end of six days and hetta frankly accepted him i hope youll love your brotherinlaw said she to susan oh i will indeed said susan and in the softness of her heart at the moment she almost made up her mind to tell but hetta was full of her own affairs and thus it passed off it was then arranged that hetta should go and spend a week with mr beckards parents old mr beckard was a farmer living near utica and now that the match was declared and approved it was thought well that hetta should know her future husbands family so she went for a week and mr beckard went with her he will be back in plenty of time for me to speak to him before aaron dunns six weeks are over said mrs bell to herself but things did not go exactly as she expected on the very morning after the departure of the engaged couple there came a letter from aaron saying that he would be at saratoga that very evening the railway people had ordered him down again for some days special work then he was to go elsewhere and not to return to saratoga till june but he hoped so said the letter that mrs bell would not turn him into the street even then though the summer might have come and her regular lodgers might be expected oh dear oh dear said mrs bell to herself reflecting that she had no one of whom she could ask advice and that she must decide that very day why had she let mr beckard go without telling him then she told susan and susan spent the day trembling perhaps thought mrs bell he will say nothing about it in such case however would it not be her duty to say something poor mother she trembled nearly as much as susan it was dark when the fatal knock came at the door the teathings were already laid and the teacake was already baked for it would at any rate be necessary to give mr dunn his tea susan when she heard the knock rushed from her chair and took refuge up stairs the widow gave a long sigh and settled her dress kate obrien with willing step opened the door and bade her old friend welcome how are the ladies asked aaron trying to gather something from the face and voice of the domestic miss hetta and mr beckard be gone off to utica just manandwife like and so they are more power to them oh indeed im very glad said aaronand so he was very glad to have hetta the demure out of the way and then he made his way into the parlour doubting much and hoping much mrs bell rose from her chair and tried to look grave aaron glancing round the room saw that susan was not there he walked straight up to the widow and offered her his hand which she took it might be that susan had not thought fit to tell and in such case it would not be right for him to compromise her so he said never a word but the subject was too important to the mother to allow of her being silent when the young man stood before her oh mr dunn said she what is this you have been saying to susan i have asked her to be my wife said he drawing himself up and looking her full in the face mrs bells heart was almost as soft as her daughters and it was nearly gone but at the moment she had nothing to say but oh dear oh dear may i not call you mother said he taking both her hands in his oh dearoh dear but will you be good to her oh aaron dunn if you deceive my child in another quarter of an hour susan was kneeling at her mothers knee with her face on her mothers lap the mother was wiping tears out of her eyes and aaron was standing by holding one of the widows hands you are my mother too now said he what would hetta and mr beckard say when they came back but then he surely was not a wolf there were four or five days left for courtship before hetta and mr beckard would return four or five days during which susan might be happy aaron triumphant and mrs bell nervous days i have said but after all it was only the evenings that were so left every morning susan got up to give aaron his breakfast but mrs bell got up also susan boldly declared her right to do so and mrs bell found no objection which she could urge but after that aaron was always absent till seven or eight in the evening when he would return to his tea then came the hour or two of lovers intercourse but they were very tame those hours the widow still felt an undefined fear that she was wrong and though her heart yearned to know that her daughter was happy in the sweet happiness of accepted love yet she dreaded to be too confident not a word had been said about money matters not a word of aaron dunns relatives so she did not leave them by themselves but waited with what patience she could for the return of her wise counsellors and then susan hardly knew how to behave herself with her accepted suitor she felt that she was very happy but perhaps she was most happy when she was thinking about him through the long day assisting in fixing little things for his comfort and waiting for his evening return and as he sat there in the parlour she could be happy then too if she were but allowed to sit still and look at himnot stare at him but raise her eyes every now and again to his face for the shortest possible glance as she had been used to do ever since he came there but he unconscionable lover wanted to hear her speak was desirous of being talked to and perhaps thought that he should by rights be allowed to sit by her and hold her hand no such privileges were accorded to him if they had been alone together walking side by side on the green turf as lovers should walk she would soon have found the use of her tonguehave talked fast enough no doubt under such circumstances when a girls shyness has given way to real intimacy there is in general no end to her power of chatting but though there was much love between aaron and susan there was as yet but little intimacy and then let a mother be ever so motherlyand no mother could have more of a mothers tenderness than mrs bellstill her presence must be a restraint aaron was very fond of mrs bell but nevertheless he did sometimes wish that some domestic duty would take her out of the parlour for a few happy minutes susan went out very often but mrs bell seemed to be a fixture once for a moment he did find his love alone immediately as he came into the house my own susan you do love me do say so to me once and he contrived to slip his arm round her waist yes she whispered but she slipped like an eel from his hands and left him only preparing himself for a kiss and then when she got to her room half frightened she clasped her hands together and bethought herself that she did really love him with a strength and depth of love which filled her whole existence why could she not have told him something of all this and so the few days of his second sojourn at saratoga passed away not altogether satisfactorily it was settled that he should return to new york on saturday night leaving saratoga on that evening and as the beckardshetta was already regarded quite as a beckardwere to be back to dinner on that day mrs bell would have an opportunity of telling her wondrous tale it might be well that mr beckard should see aaron before his departure on that saturday the beckards did arrive just in time for dinner it may be imagined that susans appetite was not very keen nor her manner very collected but all this passed by unobserved in the importance attached to the various beckard arrangements which came under discussion ladies and gentlemen circumstanced as were hetta and mr beckard are perhaps a little too apt to think that their own affairs are paramount but after dinner susan vanished at once and when hetta prepared to follow her desirous of further talk about matrimonial arrangements her mother stopped her and the disclosure was made proposed to her said hetta who perhaps thought that one marriage in a family was enough at a time yes my loveand he did it i must say in a very honourable way telling her not to make any answer till she had spoken to menow that was very nice was it not phineas mrs bell had become very anxious that aaron should not be voted a wolf and what has been said to him since asked the discreet phineas whynothing absolutely decisive oh mrs bell you see i know nothing as to his means nothing at all said hetta he is a man that will always earn his bread said mr beckard and mrs bell blessed him in her heart for saying it but has he been encouraged asked hetta well yes he has said the widow then susan i suppose likes him asked phineas well yes she does said the widow and the conference ended in a resolution that phineas beckard should have a conversation with aaron dunn as to his worldly means and position and that he phineas should decide whether aaron might or might not be at once accepted as a lover according to the tenor of that conversation poor susan was not told anything of all this better not said hetta the demure it will only flurry her the more how would she have liked it if without consulting her they had left it to aaron to decide whether or no she might marry phineas they knew where on the works aaron was to be found and thither mr beckard rode after dinner we need not narrate at length the conference between the young men aaron at once declared that he had nothing but what he made as an engineer and explained that he held no permanent situation on the line he was well paid at that present moment but at the end of summer he would have to look for employment then you can hardly marry quite at present said the discreet minister perhaps not quite immediately and long engagements are never wise said the other three or four months suggested aaron but mr beckard shook his head the afternoon at mrs bells house was melancholy the final decision of the three judges was as follows there was to be no engagement of course no correspondence aaron was to be told that it would be better that he should get lodgings elsewhere when he returned but that he would be allowed to visit at mrs bells houseand at mrs beckards which was very considerate if he should succeed in getting a permanent appointment and if he and susan still held the same mind why then c c such was susans fate as communicated to her by mrs bell and hetta she sat still and wept when she heard it but she did not complain she had always felt that hetta would be against her maynt i see him then she said through her tears hetta thought she had better not mrs bell thought she might phineas decided that they might shake hands but only in full conclave there was to be no lovers farewell aaron was to leave the house at halfpast five but before he went susan should be called down poor susan she sat down and bemoaned herself uncomplaining but very sad susan was soft feminine and manageable but aaron dunn was not very soft was especially masculine and in some matters not easily manageable when mr beckard in the widows presencehetta had retired in obedience to her loverinformed him of the courts decision there came over his face the look which he had worn when he burned the picture mrs bell he said had encouraged his engagement and he did not understand why other people should now come and disturb it not an engagement aaron said mrs bell piteously he was able and willing to work he said and knew his profession what young man of his age had done better than he had and he glanced round at them with perhaps more pride than was quite becoming then mr beckard spoke out very wisely no doubt but perhaps a little too much at length sons and daughters as well as fathers and mothers will know very well what he said so i need not repeat his words i cannot say that aaron listened with much attention but he understood perfectly what the upshot of it was many a man understands the purport of many a sermon without listening to one word in ten mr beckard meant to be kind in his manner indeed was so only that aaron could not accept as kindness any interference on his part ill tell you what mrs bell said he i look upon myself as engaged to her and i look on her as engaged to me i tell you so fairly and i believe thats her mind as well as mine but aaron you wont try to see heror to write to hernot in secret will you when i try to see her ill come and knock at this door and if i write to her ill write to her full address by the post i never did and never will do anything in secret i know youre good and honest said the widow with her handkerchief to her eyes then why do you separate us asked he almost roughly i suppose i may see her at any rate before i go my times nearly up now i guess and then susan was called for and she and hetta came down together susan crept in behind her sister her eyes were red with weeping and her appearance was altogether disconsolate she had had a lover for a week and now she was to be robbed of him goodbye susan said aaron and he walked up to her without bashfulness or embarrassment had they all been compliant and gracious to him he would have been as bashful as his love but now his temper was hot goodbye susan and she took his hand and he held hers till he had finished and remember this i look upon you as my promised wife and i dont fear that youll deceive me at any rate i shant deceive you goodbye aaron she sobbed goodbye and god bless you my own darling and then without saying a word to any one else he turned his back upon them and went his way there had been something very consolatory very sweet to the poor girl in her lovers last words and yet they had almost made her tremble he had been so bold and stern and confident he had seemed so utterly to defy the impregnable discretion of mr beckard so to despise the demure propriety of hetta but of this she felt sure when she came to question her heart that she could never never never cease to love him better than all the world beside she would waitpatiently if she could find patienceand then if he deserted her she would die in another month hetta became mrs beckard susan brisked up a little for the occasion and looked very pretty as bridesmaid she was serviceable too in arranging household matters hemming linen and sewing tablecloths though of course in these matters she did not do a tenth of what hetta did then the summer came the saratoga summer of july august and september during which the widows house was full and susans hands saved the pain of her heart for she was forced into occupation now that hetta was gone to her own duties it was necessary that susans part in the household should be more prominent aaron did not come back to his work at saratoga why he did not they could not then learn during the whole long summer they heard not a word of him nor from him and then when the cold winter months came and their boarders had left them mrs beckard congratulated her sister in that she had given no further encouragement to a lover who cared so little for her this was very hard to bear but susan did bear it that winter was very sad they learned nothing of aaron dunn till about january and then they heard that he was doing very well he was engaged on the erie trunk line was paid highly and was much esteemed and yet he neither came nor sent he has an excellent situation their informant told them and a permanent one asked the widow oh yes no doubt said the gentleman for i happen to know that they count greatly on him and yet he sent no word of love after that the winter became very sad indeed mrs bell thought it to be her duty now to teach her daughter that in all probability she would see aaron dunn no more it was open to him to leave her without being absolutely a wolf he had been driven from the house when he was poor and they had no right to expect that he would return now that he had made some rise in the world men do amuse themselves in that way the widow tried to teach her he is not like that mother she said again but they do not think so much of these things as we do urged the mother dont they said susan oh so sorrowfully and so through the whole long winter months she became paler and paler and thinner and thinner and then hetta tried to console her with religion and that perhaps did not make things any better religious consolation is the best cure for all griefs but it must not be looked for specially with regard to any individual sorrow a religious man should he become bankrupt through the misfortunes of the world will find true consolation in his religion even for that sorrow but a bankrupt who has not thought much of such things will hardly find solace by taking up religion for that special occasion and hetta perhaps was hardly prudent in her attempts she thought that it was wicked in susan to grow thin and pale for love of aaron dunn and she hardly hid her thoughts susan was not sure but that it might be wicked but this doubt in no way tended to make her plump or rosy so that in those days she found no comfort in her sister but her mothers pity and soft love did ease her sufferings though it could not make them cease her mother did not tell her that she was wicked or bid her read long sermons or force her to go oftener to the meetinghouse he will never come again i think she said one day as with a shawl wrapped around her shoulders she leant with her head upon her mothers bosom my own darling said the mother pressing her child closely to her side you think he never will eh mother what could mrs bell say in her heart of hearts she did not think he ever would come again no my child i do not think he will and then the hot tears ran down and the sobs came thick and frequent my darling my darling exclaimed the mother and they wept together was i wicked to love him at the first she asked that night no my child you were not wicked at all at least i think not then why why was he sent away it was on her tongue to ask that question but she paused and spared her mother this was as they were going to bed the next morning susan did not get up she was not ill she said but weak and weary would her mother let her lie that day and then mrs bell went down alone to her room and sorrowed with all her heart for the sorrow of her child why oh why had she driven away from her doorsill the love of an honest man on the next morning susan again did not get upnor did she hear or if she heard she did not recognise the step of the postman who brought a letter to the door early before the widows breakfast the postman came and the letter which he brought was as follows my dear mrs bell i have now got a permanent situation on the erie line and the salary is enough for myself and a wife at least i think so and i hope you will too i shall be down at saratoga tomorrow evening and i hope neither susan nor you will refuse to receive me yours affectionately aaron dunn that was all it was very short and did not contain one word of love but it made the widows heart leap for joy she was rather afraid that aaron was angry he wrote so curtly and with such a brusque businesslike attention to mere facts but surely he could have but one object in coming there and then he alluded specially to a wife so the widows heart leapt with joy but how was she to tell susan she ran up stairs almost breathless with haste to the bedroom door but then she stopped too much joy she had heard was as dangerous as too much sorrow she must think it over for a while and so she crept back again but after breakfastthat is when she had sat for a while over her teacupshe returned to the room and this time she entered it the letter was in her hand but held so as to be hiddenin her left hand as she sat down with her right arm towards the invalid susan dear she said and smiled at her child youll be able to get up this morning eh dear yes mother said susan thinking that her mother objected to this idleness of her lying in bed and so she began to bestir herself i dont mean this very moment love indeed i want to sit with you for a little while and she put her right arm affectionately round her daughters waist dearest mother said susan ah theres one dearer than me i guess and mrs bell smiled sweetly as she made the maternal charge against her daughter susan raised herself quickly in the bed and looked straight into her mothers face mother mother she said what is it youve something to tell oh mother and stretching herself over she struck her hand against the corner of aarons letter mother youve a letter is he coming mother and with eager eyes and open lips she sat up holding tight to her mothers arm yes love i have got a letter is heis he coming how the mother answered i can hardly tell but she did answer and they were soon lying in each others arms warm with each others tears it was almost hard to say which was the happier aaron was to be there that eveningthat very evening oh mother let me get up said susan but mrs bell said no not yet her darling was pale and thin and she almost wished that aaron was not coming for another week what if he should come and look at her and finding her beauty gone vanish again and seek a wife elsewhere so susan lay in bed thinking of her happiness dozing now and again and fearing as she waked that it was a dream looking constantly at that drawing of his which she kept outside upon the bed nursing her love and thinking of it and endeavouring vainly endeavouring to arrange what she would say to him mother she said when mrs bell once went up to her you wont tell hetta and phineas will you not today i mean mrs bell agreed that it would be better not to tell them perhaps she thought that she had already depended too much on hetta and phineas in the matter susans finery in the way of dress had never been extensive and now lately in these last sad winter days she had thought but little of the fashion of her clothes but when she began to dress herself for the evening she did ask her mother with some anxiety what she had better wear if he loves you he will hardly see what you have on said the mother but not the less was she careful to smooth her daughters hair and make the most that might be made of those faded roses how susans heart beathow both their hearts beat as the hands of the clock came round to seven and then sharp at seven came the knock that same short bold ringing knock which susan had so soon learned to know as belonging to aaron dunn oh mother i had better go up stairs she cried starting from her chair no dear you would only be more nervous i will mother no no dear you have not time and then aaron dunn was in the room she had thought much what she would say to him but had not yet quite made up her mind it mattered however but very little on whatever she might have resolved her resolution would have vanished to the wind aaron dunn came into the room and in one second she found herself in the centre of a whirlwind and his arms were the storms that enveloped her on every side my own own darling girl he said over and over again as he pressed her to his heart quite regardless of mrs bell who stood by sobbing with joy my own susan aaron dear aaron she whispered but she had already recognised the fact that for the present meeting a passive part would become her well and save her a deal of trouble she had her lover there quite safe safe beyond anything that mr or mrs beckard might have to say to the contrary she was quite happy only that there were symptoms now and again that the whirlwind was about to engulf her yet once more dear aaron i am so glad you are come said the innocentminded widow as she went up stairs with him to show him his room and then he embraced her also dear dear mother he said on the next day there was as a matter of course a family conclave hetta and phineas came down and discussed the whole subject of the coming marriage with mrs bell hetta at first was not quite certainought they not to inquire whether the situation was permanent i wont inquire at all said mrs bell with an energy that startled both the daughter and soninlaw i would not part them now no not if and the widow shuddered as she thought of her daughters sunken eyes and pale cheeks he is a good lad said phineas and i trust she will make him a sober steady wife and so the matter was settled during this time susan and aaron were walking along the balston road and they also had settled the matterquite as satisfactorily such was the courtship of susan dunn relics of general chass a tale of antwerp that belgium is now one of the european kingdoms living by its own laws resting on its own bottom with a king and court palaces and parliament of its own is known to all the world and a very nice little kingdom it is full of old towns fine flemish pictures and interesting gothic churches but in the memory of very many of us who do not think ourselves old men belgium as it is now calledin those days it used to be flanders and brabantwas a part of holland and it obtained its own independence by a revolution in that revolution the most important military step was the siege of antwerp which was defended on the part of the dutch by general chass with the utmost gallantry but nevertheless ineffectually after the siege antwerp became quite a show place and among the visitors who flocked there to talk of the gallant general and to see what remained of the great effort which he had made to defend the place were two englishmen one was the hero of this little history and the other was a young man of considerably less weight in the world the less i say of the latter the better but it is necessary that i should give some description of the former the rev augustus horne was at the time of my narrative a beneficed clergyman of the church of england the profession which he had graced sat easily on him its external marks and signs were as pleasing to his friends as were its internal comforts to himself he was a man of much quiet mirth full of polished wit and on some rare occasions he could descend to the more noisy hilarity of a joke loved by his friends he loved all the world he had known no care and seen no sorrow always intended for holy orders he had entered them without a scruple and remained within their pale without a regret at twentyfour he had been a deacon at twentyseven a priest at thirty a rector and at thirtyfive a prebendary and as his rectory was rich and his prebendal stall well paid the rev augustus horne was called by all and called himself a happy man his stature was about six feet two and his corpulence exceeded even those bounds which symmetry would have preferred as being most perfectly compatible even with such a height but nevertheless mr horne was a wellmade man his hands and feet were small his face was handsome frank and full of expression his bright eyes twinkled with humour his finelycut mouth disclosed two marvellous rows of wellpreserved ivory and his slightly aquiline nose was just such a projection as one would wish to see on the face of a wellfed goodnatured dignitary of the church of england when i add to all this that the reverend gentleman was as generous as he was richand the kind mother in whose arms he had been nurtured had taken care that he should never wanti need hardly say that i was blessed with a very pleasant travelling companion i must mention one more interesting particular mr horne was rather inclined to dandyism in an innocent way his clerical starched neckcloth was always of the whitest his cambric handkerchief of the finest his bands adorned with the broadest border his sable suit never degenerated to a rusty brown it not only gave on all occasions glossy evidence of freshness but also of the talent which the artisan had displayed in turning out a welldressed clergyman of the church of england his hair was ever brushed with scrupulous attention and showed in its regular waves the guardian care of each separate bristle and all this was done with that ease and grace which should be the characteristics of a dignitary of the established english church i had accompanied mr horne to the rhine and we had reached brussels on our return just at the close of that revolution which ended in affording a throne to the soninlaw of george the fourth at that moment general chasss name and fame were in every mans mouth and like other curious admirers of the brave mr horne determined to devote two days to the scene of the late events at antwerp antwerp moreover possesses perhaps the finest spire and certainly one of the three or four finest pictures in the world of general chass of the cathedral and of the rubens i had heard much and was therefore well pleased that such should be his resolution this accomplished we were to return to brussels and thence vi ghent ostend and dover i to complete my legal studies in london and mr horne to enjoy once more the peaceful retirement of ollerton rectory as we were to be absent from brussels but one night we were enabled to indulge in the gratification of travelling without our luggage a small sacdenuit was prepared brushes combs razors strops a change of linen c c were carefully put up but our heavy baggage our coats waistcoats and other wearing apparel were unnecessary it was delightful to feel oneself so lighthanded the reverend gentleman with my humble self by his side left the portal of the htel de belle vue at am in good humour with all the world there were no railroads in those days but a cabriolet big enough to hold six persons with rope traces and corresponding appendages deposited us at the golden fleece in something less than six hours the inward man was duly fortified and we started for the castle it boots not here to describe the effects which gunpowder and grapeshot had had on the walls of antwerp let the curious in these matters read the horrors of the siege of troy or the history of jerusalem taken by titus the one may be found in homer and the other in josephus or if they prefer doings of a later date there is the taking of sebastopol as narrated in the columns of the times newspaper the accounts are equally true instructive and intelligible in the mean time allow the rev augustus horne and myself to enter the private chambers of the renowned though defeated general we rambled for a while through the covered way over the glacis and along the counterscarp and listened to the guide as he detailed to us in already accustomed words how the siege had gone then we got into the private apartments of the general and having dexterously shaken off our attendant wandered at large among the deserted rooms it is clear that no one ever comes here said i no said the rev augustus it seems not and to tell the truth i dont know why any one should come the chambers in themselves are not attractive what he said was true they were plain ugly square unfurnished rooms here a big one and there a little one as is usual in most housesunfurnished that is for the most part in one place we did find a table and a few chairs in another a bedstead and so on but to me it was pleasant to indulge in those ruminations which any traces of the great or unfortunate create in softly sympathising minds for a time we communicated our thoughts to each other as we roamed free as air through the apartments and then i lingered for a few moments behind while mr horne moved on with a quicker step at last i entered the bedchamber of the general and there i overtook my friend he was inspecting with much attention an article of the great mans wardrobe which he held in his hand it was precisely that virile habiliment to which a wellknown gallant captain alludes in his conversation with the posthumous appearance of miss bailey as containing a bank of england note the general must have been a large man george or he would hardly have filled these said mr horne holding up to the light the respectable leathern articles in question he must have been a very large manthe largest man in antwerp i should think or else his tailor has done him more than justice they were certainly large and had about them a charming regimental military appearance they were made of white leather with bright metal buttons at the knees and bright metal buttons at the top they owned no pockets and were with the exception of the legitimate outlet continuous in the circumference of the waistband no dangling strings gave them an appearance of senile imbecility were it not for a certain rigidity sternness and mental inflexibilitywe will call it military ardourwith which they were imbued they would have created envy in the bosom of a foxhunter mr horne was no foxhunter but still he seemed to be irresistibly taken with the ladylike propensity of wishing to wear them surely george he said the general must have been a stouter man than i amand he contemplated his own proportions with complacencythese whatsthenames are quite big enough for me i differed in opinion and was obliged to explain that i thought he did the good living of ollerton insufficient justice i am sure they are large enough for me he repeated with considerable obstinacy i smiled incredulously and then to settle the matter he resolved that he would try them on nobody had been in these rooms for the last hour and it appeared as though they were never visited even the guide had not come on with us but was employed in showing other parties about the fortifications it was clear that this portion of the building was left desolate and that the experiment might be safely made so the sportive rector declared that he would for a short time wear the regimentals which had once contained the valorous heart of general chass with all decorum the rev mr horne divested himself of the work of the london artists needle and carefully placing his own garments beyond the reach of dust essayed to fit himself in military garb at that important momentat the critical instant of the attemptthe clatter of female voices was heard approaching the chamber they must have suddenly come round some passage corner for it was evident by the sound that they were close upon us before we had any warning of their advent at this very minute mr horne was somewhat embarrassed in his attempts and was not fully in possession of his usual active powers of movement nor of his usual presence of mind he only looked for escape and seeing a door partly open he with difficulty retreated through it and i followed him we found that we were in a small dressingroom and as by good luck the door was defended by an inner bolt my friend was able to protect himself there shall be another siege at any rate as stout as the last before i surrender said he as the ladies seemed inclined to linger in the room it became a matter of importance that the abovenamed articles should fit not only for ornament but for use it was very cold and mr horne was altogether unused to move in a highland sphere of life but alas alas general chass had not been nurtured in the classical retirement of ollerton the ungiving leather would stretch no point to accommodate the divine though it had been willing to minister to the convenience of the soldier mr horne was vexed and chilled and throwing the now hateful garments into a corner and protecting himself from the cold as best he might by standing with his knees together and his body somewhat bent so as to give the skirts of his coat an opportunity of doing extra duty he begged me to see if those jabbering females were not going to leave him in peace to recover his own property i accordingly went to the door and opening it to a small extent i peeped through who shall describe my horror at the sight which i then saw the scene which had hitherto been tinted with comic effect was now becoming so decidedly tragic that i did not dare at once to acquaint my worthy pastor with that which was occurringand alas had already occurred five countrywomen of our ownit was easy to know them by their dress and general aspectwere standing in the middle of the room and one of them the centre of the group the senior harpy of the lot a maiden ladyi could have sworn to thatwith a red nose held in one hand a huge pair of scissors and in the otherthe already devoted goods of my most unfortunate companion down from the waistband through that goodly expanse a fell gash had already gone through and through and in useless unbecoming disorder the broadcloth fell pendant from her arm on this side and on that at that moment i confess that i had not the courage to speak to mr hornenot even to look at him i must describe that group of the figure next to me i could only see the back it was a broad back done up in black silk not of the newest the whole figure one may say was dumpy the black silk was not long as dresses now are worn nor wide in its skirts in every way it was skimpy considering the breadth it had to cover and below the silk i saw the heels of two thick shoes and enough to swear by of two woollen stockings above the silk was a red and blue shawl and above that a ponderous elaborate brown bonnet as to the materials of which i should not wish to undergo an examination over and beyond this i could only see the backs of her two hands they were held up as though in wonder at that which the rednosed holder of the scissors had dared to do opposite to this lady and with her face fully turned to me was a kindlylooking fat motherly woman with lightcoloured hair not in the best order she was hot and scarlet with exercise being perhaps too stout for the steep steps of the fortress and in one hand she held a handkerchief with which from time to time she wiped her brow in the other hand she held one of the extremities of my friends property feelinggood careful soulwhat was the texture of the cloth as she did so i could see a glance of approbation pass across her warm features i liked that ladys face in spite of her untidy hair and felt that had she been alone my friend would not have been injured on either side of her there stood a flaxenhaired maiden with long curls large blue eyes fresh red cheeks an undefined lumpy nose and large goodhumoured mouth they were as like as two peas only that one was half an inch taller than the other and there was no difficulty in discovering at a moments glance that they were the children of that overheated matron who was feeling the web of my friends cloth but the principal figure was she who held the centre place in the group she was tall and thin with fiercelooking eyes rendered more fierce by the spectacles which she wore with a red nose as i said before and about her an undescribable something which quite convinced me that she had never knowncould never knowaught of the comforts of married life it was she who held the scissors and the black garments it was she who had given that unkind cut as i looked at her she whisked herself quickly round from one companion to the other triumphing in what she had done and ready to triumph further in what she was about to do i immediately conceived a deep hatred for that queen of the harpies well i suppose they cant be wanted again said the mother rubbing her forehead oh dear no said she of the red nose they are relics i thought to leap forth but for what purpose should i have leaped the accursed scissors had already done their work and the symmetry nay even the utility of the vestment was destroyed general chass wore a very good articlei will say that for him continued the mother of course he did said the queen harpy why should he not seeing that the country paid for it for him well ladies whos for having a bit oh my you wont go for to cut them up said the stout back wont i said the scissors and she immediately made another incision whos for having a bit dont all speak at once i should like a morsel for a pincushion said flaxenhaired miss no a young lady about nineteen actuated by a general affection for all swordbearing fireeating heroes i should like to have something to make me think of the poor general snip snip went the scissors with professional rapidity and a round piece was extracted from the back of the calf of the left leg i shuddered with horror and so did the rev augustus horne with cold i hardly think its proper to cut them up said miss no oh isnt it said the harpy then ill do whats improper and she got her finger and thumb well through the holes in the scissors handles as she spoke resolution was plainly marked on her brow well if they are to be cut up i should certainly like a bit for a penwiper said no no was a literary young lady with a periodical correspondence a journal and an album snip snip went the scissors again and the broad part of the upper right division afforded ample materials for a penwiper then the lady with the back seeing that the desecration of the article had been completed plucked up heart of courage and put in her little request i think i might have a needlecase out of it said she just as a suvneer of the poor generaland a long fragment cut rapidly out of the waistband afforded her unqualified delight mamma with the hot face and untidy hair came next well girls she said as you are all served i dont see why im to be left out perhaps miss grogramshe was an old maid you seeperhaps miss grogram you could get me as much as would make a decentsized reticule there was not the slightest difficulty in doing this the harpy in the centre again went to work snip snip and extracting from that portion of the affairs which usually sustained the greater portion of mr hornes weight two large round pieces of cloth presented them to the wellpleased matron the general knew well where to get a bit of good broadcloth certainly said she again feeling the pieces and now for no said she whom i so absolutely hated i think there is still enough for a pair of slippers theres nothing so nice for the house as good black cloth slippers that are warm to the feet and dont show the dirt and so saying she spread out on the floor the lacerated remainders theres a nice bit there said young lady no poking at one of the pockets with the end of her parasol yes said the harpy contemplating her plunder but im thinking whether i couldnt get leggings as well i always wear leggings in the thick of the winter and so she concluded her operations and there was nothing left but a melancholy skeleton of seams and buttons all this having been achieved they pocketed their plunder and prepared to depart there are people who have a wonderful appetite for relics a stone with which washington had broken a window when a boywith which he had done so or had not for there is little difference a button that was on a coat of napoleons or on that of one of his lackeys a bullet said to have been picked up at waterloo or bunkers hill these and suchlike things are great treasures and their most desirable characteristic is the ease with which they are attained any bullet or any button does the work faith alone is necessary and now these ladies had made themselves happy and glorious with relics of general chass cut from the illused habiliments of an elderly english gentleman they departed at last and mr horne for once in an ill humour followed me into the bedroom here i must be excused if i draw a veil over his manly sorrow at discovering what fate had done for him remember what was his position unclothed in the castle of antwerp the nearest suitable change for those which had been destroyed was locked up in his portmanteau at the htel de belle vue in brussels he had nothing left to himliterally nothing in that antwerp world there was no other wretched being wandering then in that dutch town so utterly denuded of the goods of life for what is a man fitfor what can he be fitwhen left in such a position there are some evils which seem utterly to crush a man and if there be any misfortune to which a man may be allowed to succumb without imputation on his manliness surely it is such as this how was mr home to return to his hotel without incurring the displeasure of the municipality that was my first thought he had a cloak but it was at the inn and i found that my friend was oppressed with a great horror at the idea of being left alone so that i could not go in search of it there is an old saying that no man is a hero to his valet de chambrethe reason doubtless being this that it is customary for his valet to see the hero divested of those trappings in which so much of the heroic consists who reverences a clergyman without his gown or a warrior without his sword and sabretasche what would even minerva be without her helmet i do not wish it to be understood that i no longer reverenced mr horne because he was in an undress but he himself certainly lost much of his composed wellsustained dignity of demeanour he was fearful and querulous cold and rather cross when forgetting his size i offered him my own he thought that i was laughing at him he began to be afraid that the story would get abroad and he then and there exacted a promise that i would never tell it during his lifetime i have kept my word but now my old friend has been gathered to his fathers full of years at last i got him to the hotel it was long before he would leave the castle cloaked though he wasnot indeed till the shades of evening had dimmed the outlines of men and things and made indistinct the outward garniture of those who passed to and fro in the streets then wrapped in his cloak mr horne followed me along the quays and through the narrowest of the streets and at length without venturing to return the gaze of any one in the hotel court he made his way up to his own bedroom dinnerless and supperless he went to his couch but when there he did consent to receive some consolation in the shape of mutton cutlets and fried potatoes a savory omelet and a bottle of claret the mutton cutlets and fried potatoes at the golden fleece at antwerp areor were then for i am speaking now of wellnigh thirty years sinceremarkably good the claret also was of the best and so by degrees the look of despairing dismay passed from his face and some scintillations of the old fire returned to his eyes i wonder whether they find themselves much happier for what they have got said he a great deal happier said i theyll boast of those things to all their friends at home and we shall doubtless see some account of their success in the newspapers it would be delightful to expose their blunderto show them up would it not george to turn the tables on them yes said i i should like to have the laugh against them so would i only that i should compromise myself by telling the story it wouldnt do at all to have it told at oxford with my name attached to it to this also i assented to what would i not have assented in my anxiety to make him happy after his misery but all was not over yet he was in bed now but it was necessary that he should rise again on the morrow at home in england what was required might perhaps have been made during the night but here among the slow flemings any such exertion would have been impossible mr horne moreover had no desire to be troubled in his retirement by a tailor now the landlord of the golden fleece was a very stout mana very stout man indeed looking at him as he stood with his hands in his pockets at the portal of his own establishment i could not but think that he was stouter even than mr horne but then he was certainly much shorter and the want of due proportion probably added to his unwieldy appearance i walked round him once or twice wishfully measuring him in my eye and thinking of what texture might be the sunday best of such a man the clothes which he then had on were certainly not exactly suited to mr hornes tastes he saw that i was observing him and appeared uneasy and offended i had already ascertained that he spoke a little english of flemish i knew literally nothing and in french with which probably he was also acquainted i was by no means voluble the business which i had to transact was intricate and i required the use of my mothertongue it was intricate and delicate and difficult withal i began by remarking on the weather but he did not take my remarks kindly i am inclined to fancy that he thought i was desirous of borrowing money from him at any rate he gave me no encouragement in my first advances vat misfortune at last he asked when i had succeeded in making him understand that a gentleman up stairs required his assistance he has lost these things and i took hold of my own garments its a long story or id tell you how but he has not a pair in the world till he gets back to brusselsunless you can lend him one lost hees br and he opened his eyes wide and looked at me with astonishment yes yes exactly so said i interrupting him most astonishing thing isnt it but its quite true vas hees money in de pocket asked my suspicious landlord no no no its not so bad as that his money is all right i had the money luckily ah dat is better but he have lost hees b yes yes i was now getting rather impatient there is no mistake about it he has lost them as sure as you stand there and then i proceeded to explain that as the gentleman in question was very stout and as he the landlord was stout also he might assist us in this great calamity by a loan from his own wardrobe when he found that the money was not in the pocket and that his bill therefore would be paid he was not indisposed to be gracious he would he said desire his servant to take up what was required to mr hornes chamber i endeavoured to make him understand that a sombre colour would be preferable but he only answered that he would put the best that he had at the gentlemans disposal he could not think of offering anything less than his best on such an occasion and then he turned his back and went his way muttering as he went something in flemish which i believed to be an exclamation of astonishment that any man should under any circumstances lose such an article it was now getting late so when i had taken a short stroll by myself i went to bed without disturbing mr horne again that night on the following morning i thought it best not to go to him unless he sent for me so i desired the boots to let him know that i had ordered breakfast in a private room and that i would await him there unless he wished to see me he sent me word back to say that he would be with me very shortly he did not keep me waiting above half an hour but i confess that that half hour was not pleasantly spent i feared that his temper would be tried in dressing and that he would not be able to eat his breakfast in a happy state of mind so that when i heard his heavy footstep advancing along the passage my heart did misgive me and i felt that i was trembling that step was certainly slower and more ponderous than usual there was always a certain dignity in the very sound of his movements but now this seemed to have been enhanced to judge merely by the step one would have said that a bishop was coming that way instead of a prebendary and then he entered in the upper half of his august person no alteration was perceptible the hair was as regular and as graceful as ever the handkerchief as white the coat as immaculate but below his wellfilled waistcoat a pair of red plush began to shine in unmitigated splendour and continued from thence down to within an inch above his knee nor as it appeared could any pulling induce them to descend lower mr horne always wore black silk stockingsat least so the world supposed but it was now apparent that the world had been wrong in presuming him to be guilty of such extravagance those at any rate which he exhibited on the present occasion were more economical they were silk to the calf but thence upwards they continued their career in white cotton these then followed the plush first two snowy fullsized pillars of white and then two jet columns of flossy silk such was the appearance on that wellremembered morning of the rev augustus horne as he entered the room in which his breakfast was prepared i could see at a glance that a dark frown contracted his eyebrows and that the compressed muscles of his upper lip gave a strange degree of austerity to his open face he carried his head proudly on high determined to be dignified in spite of his misfortunes and advanced two steps into the room without a remark as though he were able to show that neither red plush nor black cloth could disarrange the equal poise of his mighty mind and after all what are a mans garments but the outward husks in which the fruit is kept duly tempered from the wind the rank is but the guinea stamp the mans the gowd for a that and is not the tailors art as little worthy as insignificant as that of the king who makes a marquis duke and a that who would be content to think that his manly dignity depended on his coat and waistcoat or his hold on the worlds esteem on any other garment of usual wear that no such weakness soiled his mind mr horne was determined to prove and thus he entered the room with measured tread and stern dignified demeanour having advanced two steps his eye caught mine i do not know whether he was moved by some unconscious smile on my partfor in truth i endeavoured to seem as indifferent as himself to the nature of his dressor whether he was invincibly tickled by some inward fancy of his own but suddenly his advancing step ceased a broad flash of comic humour spread itself over his features he retreated with his back against the wall and then burst out into an immoderate roar of loud laughter and iwhat else could i then do but laugh he laughed and i laughed he roared and i roared he lifted up his vast legs to view till the rays of the morning sun shone through the window on the bright hues which he displayed and he did not sit down to his breakfast till he had in every fantastic attitude shown off to the best advantage the red plush of which he had so recently become proud an antwerp private cabriolet on that day reached the yard of the htel de belle vue at about pm and four waiters in a frenzy of astonishment saw the reverend augustus horne descend from the vehicle and seek his chamber dressed in the garments which i have described but i am inclined to think that he never again favoured any of his friends with such a sight it was on the next evening after this that i went out to drink tea with two maiden ladies relatives of mine who kept a seminary for english girls at brussels the misses macmanus were very worthy women and earned their bread in an upright painstaking manner i would not for worlds have passed through brussels without paying them this compliment they were however perhaps a little dull and i was aware that i should not probably meet in their drawingroom many of the fashionable inhabitants of the city mr horne had declined to accompany me but in doing so he was good enough to express a warm admiration for the character of my worthy cousins the elder miss macmanus in her little note had informed me that she would have the pleasure of introducing me to a few of my compatriots i presumed she meant englishmen and as i was in the habit of meeting such every day of my life at home i cannot say that i was peculiarly elevated by the promise when however i entered the room there was no englishman therethere was no man of any kind there were twelve ladies collected together with the view of making the evening pass agreeably to me the single virile being among them all i felt as though i were a sort of mohammed in paradise but i certainly felt also that the paradise was none of my own choosing in the centre of the amphitheatre which the ladies formed sat the two misses macmanusthere at least they sat when they had completed the process of shaking hands with me to the left of them making one wing of the semicircle were arranged the five pupils by attending to whom the misses macmanus earned their living and the other wing consisted of the five ladies who had furnished themselves with relics of general chass they were my compatriots i was introduced to them all one after the other but their names did not abide in my memory one moment i was thinking too much of the singularity of the adventure and could not attend to such minuti that the redrosed harpy was miss grogram that i rememberedthat i may say i shall never forget but whether the motherly lady with the somewhat blowsy hair was mrs jones or mrs green or mrs walker i cannot now say the dumpy female with the broad back was always called aunt sally by the young ladies too much sugar spoils ones tea i think i have heard that even prosperity will cloy when it comes in overdoses and a schoolboy has been known to be overdone with jam i myself have always been peculiarly attached to ladies society and have avoided bachelor parties as things execrable in their very nature but on this special occasion i felt myself to be that schoolboyi was literally overdone with jam my tea was all sugar so that i could not drink it i was one among twelve what could i do or say the proportion of alloy was too small to have any effect in changing the nature of the virgin silver and the conversation became absolutely feminine i must confess also that my previous experience as to these compatriots of mine had not prejudiced me in their favour i regarded them withi am ashamed to say so seeing that they were ladiesbut almost with loathing when last i had seen them their occupation had reminded me of some obscene feast of harpies or almost of ghouls they had brought down to the verge of desperation the man whom of all men i most venerated on these accounts i was inclined to be taciturn with reference to themand then what could i have to say to the misses macmanuss five pupils my cousin at first made an effort or two in my favour but these efforts were fruitless i soon died away into utter unrecognised insignificance and the conversation as i have before said became feminine and indeed that horrid miss grogram who was as it were the princess of the ghouls nearly monopolised the whole of it mamma joneswe will call her jones for the occasionput in a word now and then as did also the elder and more energetic miss macmanus the dumpy lady with the broad back ate teacake incessantly the two daughters looked scornful as though they were above their company with reference to the five pupils and the five pupils themselves sat in a row with the utmost propriety each with her hands crossed on her lap before her of what they were talking at last i became utterly oblivious they had ignored me going into realms of muslin questions of maidservants female rights and cheap underclothing and i therefore had ignored them my mind had gone back to mr horne and his garments while they spoke of their rights i was thinking of his wrongs when they mentioned the price of flannel i thought of that of broadcloth but of a sudden my attention was arrested miss macmanus had said something of the black silks of antwerp when miss grogram replied that she had just returned from that city and had there enjoyed a great success my cousin had again asked something about the black silks thinking no doubt that miss grogram had achieved some bargain but that lady had soon undeceived her oh no said miss grogram it was at the castle we got such beautiful relics of general chass didnt we mrs jones indeed we did said mrs jones bringing out from beneath the skirts of her dress and ostensibly displaying a large black bag and ive got such a beautiful needlecase said the broadback displaying her prize ive been making it up all the morning and she handed over the article to miss macmanus and only look at this duck of a penwiper simpered flaxenhair no only think of wiping ones pens with relics of general chass and she handed it over to the other miss macmanus and mines a pincushion said no exhibiting the trophy but thats nothing to what ive got said miss grogram in the first place theres a pair of slippersa beautiful pairtheyre not made up yet of course and then the two misses macmanus and their five pupils were sitting openeared openeyed and openmouthed how all these sombrelooking articles could be relics of general chass did not at first appear clear to them what are they miss grogram said the elder miss macmanus holding the needlecase in one hand and mrs joness bag in the other miss macmanus was a strongminded female and i reverenced my cousin when i saw the decided way in which she intended to put down the greedy arrogance of miss grogram they are relics but where do they come from miss grogram why from the castle to be surefrom general chasses own rooms did anybody sell them to you no or give them to you why noat least not exactly give there they were and she took em said the broadback oh what a look miss grogram gave her took them of course i took them that is you took them as much as i did they were things that we found lying about what things asked miss macmanus in a peculiarly strongminded tone miss grogram seemed to be for a moment silenced i had been ignored as i have said and my existence forgotten but now i observed that the eyes of the culprits were turned towards methe eyes that is of four of them mrs jones looked at me from beneath her fan the two girls glanced at me furtively and then their eyes fell to the lowest flounces of their frocks miss grogram turned her spectacles right upon me and i fancied that she nodded her head at me as a sort of answer to miss macmanus the five pupils opened their mouths and eyes wider but she of the broad back was nothing abashed it would have been nothing to her had there been a dozen gentlemen in the room we just found a pair of black the whole truth was told in the plainest possible language oh aunt sally aunt sally how can you hold your tongue aunt sally and then miss grogram just cut them up with her scissors continued aunt sally not a whit abashed and gave us each a bit only she took more than half for herself it was clear to me that there had been some quarrel some delicious quarrel between aunt sally and miss grogram through the whole adventure i had rather respected aunt sally she took more than half for herself continued aunt sally she kept all the jemima said the elder miss macmanus interrupting the speaker and addressing her sister it is time i think for the young ladies to retire will you be kind enough to see them to their rooms the five pupils thereupon rose from their seats and courtesied they then left the room in file the younger miss macmanus showing them the way but we havent done any harm have we asked mrs jones with some tremulousness in her voice well i dont know said miss macmanus what im thinking of now is thisto whom i wonder did the garments properly belong who had been the owner and wearer of them why general chass of course said miss grogram they were the generals repeated the two young ladies blushing however as they alluded to the subject well we thought they were the generals certainly and a very excellent article they were said mrs jones perhaps they were the butlers said aunt sally i certainly had not given her credit for so much sarcasm butlers exclaimed miss grogram with a toss of her head oh aunt sally aunt sally how can you shrieked the two young ladies oh laws ejaculated mrs jones i dont think that they could have belonged to the butler said miss macmanus with much authority seeing that domestics in this country are never clad in garments of that description so far my own observation enables me to speak with certainty but it is equally sure that they were never the property of the general lately in command at antwerp generals when they are in full dress wear ornamental lace upon theirtheir regimentals and when so much she said and something more which it may be unnecessary that i should repeat but such were her eloquence and logic that no doubt would have been left on the mind of any impartial hearer if an argumentative speaker ever proved anything miss macmanus proved that general chass had never been the wearer of the article in question but i know very well they were his said miss grogram who was not an impartial hearer of course they were whose elses should they be im sure i hope they were his said one of the young ladies almost crying i wish id never taken it said the other dear dear dear said mrs jones ill give you my needlecase miss grogram said aunt sally i had sat hitherto silent during the whole scene meditating how best i might confound the rednosed harpy now i thought was the time for me to strike in i really think ladies that there has been some mistake said i there has been no mistake at all sir said miss grogram perhaps not i answered very mildly very likely not but some affair of a similar nature was very much talked about in antwerp yesterday oh laws again ejaculated mrs jones the affair i allude to has been talked about a good deal certainly i continued but perhaps it may be altogether a different circumstance and what may be the circumstance to which you allude asked miss macmanus in the same authoritative tone i dare say it has nothing to do with these ladies said i but an article of dress of the nature they have described was cut up in the castle of antwerp on the day before yesterday it belonged to a gentleman who was visiting the place and i was given to understand that he is determined to punish the people who have wronged him it cant be the same said miss grogram but i could see that she was trembling oh laws what will become of us said mrs jones you can all prove that i didnt touch them and that i warned her not said aunt sally in the mean time the two young ladies had almost fainted behind their fans but how had it come to pass asked miss macmanus that the gentleman had i know nothing more about it cousin said i only it does seem that there is an odd coincidence immediately after this i took my leave i saw that i had avenged my friend and spread dismay in the hearts of those who had injured him i had learned in the course of the evening at what hotel the five ladies were staying and in the course of the next morning i sauntered into the hall and finding one of the porters alone asked if they were still there the man told me that they had started by the earliest diligence and said he if you are a friend of theirs perhaps you will take charge of these things which they have left behind them so saying he pointed to a table at the back of the hall on which were lying the black bag the black needlecase the black pincushion and the black penwiper there was also a heap of fragments of cloth which i well knew had been intended by miss grogram for the comfort of her feet and ancles i declined the commission however they were no special friends of mine i said and i left all the relics still lying on the little table in the back hall upon the whole i am satisfied said the rev augustus horne when i told him the finale of the story an unprotected female at the pyramids in the happy days when we were young no description conveyed to us so complete an idea of mysterious reality as that of an oriental city we knew it was actually there but had such vague notions of its ways and looks let any one remember his early impressions as to bagdad or grand cairo and then say if this was not so it was probably taken from the arabian nights and the picture produced was one of strange fantastic luxurious houses of women who were either very young and very beautiful or else very old and very cunning but in either state exercising much more influence in life than women in the east do now of goodnatured capricious though sometimes tyrannical monarchs and of life full of quaint mysteries quite unintelligible in every phasis and on that account the more picturesque and perhaps grand cairo has thus filled us with more wonder even than bagdad we have been in a certain manner at home at bagdad but have only visited grand cairo occasionally i know no place which was to me in early years so delightfully mysterious as grand cairo but the route to india and australia has changed all this men from all countries going to the east now pass through cairo and its streets and costumes are no longer strange to us it has become also a resort for invalids or rather for those who fear that they may become invalids if they remain in a cold climate during the winter months and thus at cairo there is always to be found a considerable population of french americans and of english oriental life is brought home to us dreadfully diluted by western customs and the delights of the arabian nights are shorn of half their value when we have seen a thing it is never so magnificent to us as when it was half unknown it is not much that we deign to learn from these orientalswe who glory in our civilisation we do not copy their silence or their abstemiousness nor that invariable mindfulness of his own personal dignity which always adheres to a turk or to an arab we chatter as much at cairo as elsewhere and eat as much and drink as much and dress ourselves generally in the same old ugly costume but we do usually take upon ourselves to wear red caps and we do ride on donkeys nor are the visitors from the west to cairo by any means confined to the male sex ladies are to be seen in the streets quite regardless of the mahommedan custom which presumes a veil to be necessary for an appearance in public and to tell the truth the mahommedans in general do not appear to be much shocked by their effrontery a quarter of the town has in this way become inhabited by men wearing coats and waistcoats and by women who are without veils but the english tongue in egypt finds its centre at shepheards hotel it is here that people congregate who are looking out for parties to visit with them the upper nile and who are generally all smiles and courtesy and here also are to be found they who have just returned from this journey and who are often in a frame of mind towards their companions that is much less amiable from hence during the winter a cortge proceeds almost daily to the pyramids or to memphis or to the petrified forest or to the city of the sun and then again four or five times a month the house is filled with young aspirants going out to india male and female full of valour and bloom or with others coming home no longer young no longer aspiring but laden with children and grievances the party with whom we are at present concerned is not about to proceed further than the pyramids and we shall be able to go with them and return in one and the same day it consisted chiefly of an english family mr and mrs damer their daughter and two young sonsof these chiefly because they were the nucleus to which the others had attached themselves as adherents they had originated the journey and in the whole management of it mr damer regarded himself as the master the adherents were firstly m delabordeau a frenchman now resident in cairo who had given out that he was in some way concerned in the canal about to be made between the mediterranean and the red sea in discussion on this subject he had become acquainted with mr damer and although the latter gentleman true to english interests perpetually declared that the canal would never be made and thus irritated m delabordeau not a littlenevertheless some measure of friendship had grown up between them there was also an american gentleman mr jefferson ingram who was comprising all countries and all nations in one grand tour as american gentlemen so often do he was young and goodlooking and had made himself especially agreeable to mr damer who had declared more than once that mr ingram was by far the most rational american he had ever met mr ingram would listen to mr damer by the halfhour as to the virtue of the british constitution and had even sat by almost with patience when mr damer had expressed a doubt as to the good working of the united states scheme of policywhich in an american was most wonderful but some of the sojourners at shepheards had observed that mr ingram was in the habit of talking with miss damer almost as much as with her father and argued from that that fond as the young man was of politics he did sometimes turn his mind to other things also and then there was miss dawkins now miss dawkins was an important person both as to herself and as to her line of life and she must be described she was in the first place an unprotected female of about thirty years of age as this is becoming an established profession setting itself up as it were in opposition to the old world idea that women like green peas cannot come to perfection without supportingsticks it will be understood at once what were miss dawkinss sentiments she consideredor at any rate so expressed herselfthat peas could grow very well without sticks and could not only grow thus unsupported but could also make their way about the world without any incumbrance of sticks whatsoever she did not intend she said to rival ida pfeiffer seeing that she was attached in a moderate way to bed and board and was attached to society in a manner almost more than moderate but she had no idea of being prevented from seeing anything she wished to see because she had neither father nor husband nor brother available for the purpose of escort she was a human creature with arms and legs she said and she intended to use them and this was all very well but nevertheless she had a strong inclination to use the arms and legs of other people when she could make them serviceable in person miss dawkins was not without attraction i should exaggerate if i were to say that she was beautiful and elegant but she was good looking and not usually ill mannered she was tall and gifted with features rather sharp and with eyes very bright her hair was of the darkest shade of brown and was always worn in bandeaux very neatly she appeared generally in black though other circumstances did not lead one to suppose that she was in mourning and then no other travelling costume is so convenient she always wore a dark broadbrimmed straw hat as to the ribbons on which she was rather particular she was very neat about her gloves and boots and though it cannot be said that her dress was got up without reference to expense there can be no doubt that it was not effected without considerable outlayand more considerable thought miss dawkinssabrina dawkins was her name but she seldom had friends about her intimate enough to use the word sabrinawas certainly a clever young woman she could talk on most subjects if not well at least well enough to amuse if she had not read much she never showed any lamentable deficiency she was goodhumoured as a rule and could on occasions be very soft and winning people who had known her long would sometimes say that she was selfish but with new acquaintance she was forbearing and selfdenying with what income miss dawkins was blessed no one seemed to know she lived like a gentlewoman as far as outward appearance went and never seemed to be in want but some people would say that she knew very well how many sides there were to a shilling and some enemy had once declared that she was an old soldier such was miss dawkins she also as well as mr ingram and m delabordeau had laid herself out to find the weak side of mr damer mr damer with all his family was going up the nile and it was known that he had room for two in his boat over and above his own family miss dawkins had told him that she had not quite made up her mind to undergo so great a fatigue but that nevertheless she had a longing of the soul to see something of nubia to this mr damer had answered nothing but oh which miss dawkins had not found to be encouraging but she had not on that account despaired to a married man there are always two sides and in this instance there was mrs damer as well as mr damer when mr damer said oh miss dawkins sighed and said yes indeed then smiled and betook herself to mrs damer now mrs damer was softhearted and also somewhat oldfashioned she did not conceive any violent affection for miss dawkins but she told her daughter that the single lady by herself was a very nice young woman and that it was a thousand pities she should have to go about so much alone like miss damer had turned up her pretty nose thinking perhaps how small was the chance that it ever should be her own lot to be an unprotected female but miss dawkins carried her point at any rate as regarded the expedition to the pyramids miss damer i have said had a pretty nose i may also say that she had pretty eyes mouth and chin with other necessary appendages all pretty as to the two master damers who were respectively of the ages of fifteen and sixteen it may be sufficient to say that they were conspicuous for red caps and for the constancy with which they raced their donkeys and now the donkeys and the donkey boys and the dragomans were all standing at the steps of shepheards hotel to each donkey there was a donkeyboy and to each gentleman there was a dragoman so that a goodly cortge was assembled and a goodly noise was made it may here be remarked perhaps with some little pride that not half the noise is given in egypt to persons speaking any other language that is bestowed on those whose vocabulary is english this lasted for half an hour had the party been french the donkeys would have arrived only fifteen minutes before the appointed time and then out came damer pre and damer mre damer fille and damer fils damer mre was leaning on her husband as was her wont she was not an unprotected female and had no desire to make any attempts in that line damer fille was attended sedulously by mr ingram for whose demolishment however mr damer still brought up in a loud voice the fag ends of certain political arguments which he would fain have poured direct into the ears of his opponent had not his wife been so persistent in claiming her privileges m delabordeau should have followed with miss dawkins but his french politeness or else his fear of the unprotected female taught him to walk on the other side of the mistress of the party miss dawkins left the house with an eager young damer yelling on each side of her but nevertheless though thus neglected by the gentlemen of the party she was all smiles and prettiness and looked so sweetly on mr ingram when that gentleman stayed a moment to help her on to her donkey that his heart almost misgave him for leaving her as soon as she was in her seat and then they were off in going from the hotel to the pyramids our party had not to pass through any of the queer old narrow streets of the true cairocairo the oriental they all lay behind them as they went down by the back of the hotel by the barracks of the pasha and the college of the dervishes to the village of old cairo and the banks of the nile here they were kept half an hour while their dragomans made a bargain with the ferryman a stately reis or captain of a boat who declared with much dignity that he could not carry them over for a sum less than six times the amount to which he was justly entitled while the dragomans with great energy on behalf of their masters offered him only five times that sum as far as the reis was concerned the contest might soon have been at an end for the man was not without a conscience and would have been content with five times and a half but then the three dragomans quarrelled among themselves as to which should have the paying of the money and the affair became very tedious what horrid odious men said miss dawkins appealing to mr damer do you think they will let us go over at all well i suppose they will people do get over generally i believe abdallah abdallah why dont you pay the man that fellow is always striving to save half a piastre for me i wish he wasnt quite so particular said mrs damer who was already becoming rather tired but im sure hes a very honest man in trying to protect us from being robbed that he is said miss dawkins what a delightful trait of national character it is to see these men so faithful to their employers and then at last they got over the ferry mr ingram having descended among the combatants and settled the matter in dispute by threats and shouts and an uplifted stick they crossed the broad nile exactly at the spot where the nilometer or river guage measures from day to day and from year to year the increasing or decreasing treasures of the stream and landed at a village where thousands of eggs are made into chickens by the process of artificial incubation mrs damer thought that it was very hard upon the maternal hensthe hens which should have been maternalthat they should be thus robbed of the delights of motherhood so unnatural you know said miss dawkins so opposed to the fostering principles of creation dont you think so mr ingram mr ingram said he didnt know he was again seating miss damer on her donkey and it must be presumed that he performed this feat clumsily for fanny damer could jump on and off the animal with hardly a finger to help her when her brother or her father was her escort but now under the hands of mr ingram this work of mounting was one which required considerable time and care all which miss dawkins observed with precision its all very well talking said mr damer bringing up his donkey nearly alongside that of mr ingram and ignoring his daughters presence just as he would have done that of his dog but you must admit that political power is more equally distributed in england than it is in america perhaps it is said mr ingram equally distributed among we will say three dozen families and he made a feint as though to hold in his impetuous donkey using the spur however at the same time on the side that was unseen by mr damer as he did so fannys donkey became equally impetuous and the two cantered on in advance of the whole party it was quite in vain that mr damer at the top of his voice shouted out something about three dozen corruptible demagogues mr ingram found it quite impossible to restrain his donkey so as to listen to the sarcasm i do believe papa would talk politics said fanny if he were at the top of mont blanc or under the falls of niagara i do hate politics mr ingram i am sorry for that very said mr ingram almost sadly sorry why you dont want me to talk politics do you in america we are all politicians more or less and therefore i suppose you will hate us all well i rather think i should said fanny you would be such bores but there was something in her eye as she spoke which atoned for the harshness of her words a very nice young man is mr ingram dont you think so said miss dawkins to mrs damer mrs damer was going along upon her donkey not altogether comfortably she much wished to have her lord and legitimate protector by her side but he had left her to the care of a dragoman whose english was not intelligible to her and she was rather cross indeed miss dawkins i dont know who are nice and who are not this nasty donkey stumbles at ever step there i know i shall be down directly you need not be at all afraid of that they are perfectly safe i believe always said miss dawkins rising in her stirrup and handling her reins quite triumphantly a very little practice will make you quite at home i dont know what you mean by a very little practice i have been here six weeks why did you put me on such a bad donkey as this and she turned to abdallah the dragoman him berry good donkey my lady berry goodbest of all call him jack in cairo him go to pyramid and back and mind noting what does he say miss dawkins he says that that donkey is one called jack if so ive had him myself many times and jack is a very good donkey i wish you had him now with all my heart said mrs damer upon which miss dawkins offered to change but those perils of mounting and dismounting were to mrs damer a great deal too severe to admit of this seven miles of canal to be carried out into the sea at a minimum depth of twentythree feet and the stone to be fetched from heaven knows where all the money in france wouldnt do it this was addressed by mr damer to m delabordeau whom he had caught after the abrupt flight of mr ingram den we will borrow a leetle from england said m delabordeau precious little i can tell you such stock would not hold its price in our markets for twentyfour hours if it were made the freights would be too heavy to allow of merchandise passing through the heavy goods would all go round and as for passengers and mails you dont expect to get them i suppose while there is a railroad ready made to their hand ve vill carry all your ships through vidout any transportation think of that my friend pshaw you are worse than ingram of all the plans i ever heard of it is the most monstrous the most impracticable the most but here he was interrupted by the entreaties of his wife who had in absolute deed and fact slipped from her donkey and was now calling lustily for her husbands aid whereupon miss dawkins allied herself to the frenchman and listened with an air of strong conviction to those arguments which were so weak in the ears of mr damer m delabordeau was about to ride across the great desert to jerusalem and it might perhaps be quite as well to do that with him as to go up the nile as far as the second cataract with the damers and so m delabordeau you intend really to start for mount sinai yes mees ve intend to make one start on monday week and so on to jerusalem you are quite right it would be a thousand pities to be in these countries and to return without going over such ground as that i shall certainly go to jerusalem myself by that route vot mees you vould you not find it too much fatigante i care nothing for fatigue if i like the party i am withnothing at all literally you will hardly understand me perhaps m delabordeau but i do not see any reason why i as a young woman should not make any journey that is practicable for a young man ah dat is great resolution for you mees i mean as far as fatigue is concerned you are a frenchman and belong to the nation that is at the head of all human civilisation m delabordeau took off his hat and bowed low to the peak of his donkey saddle he dearly loved to hear his country praised as miss dawkins was aware and i am sure you must agree with me continued miss dawkins that the time is gone by for women to consider themselves helpless animals or to be so considered by others mees dawkins vould never be considered not in any times at all to be one helpless animal said m delabordeau civilly i do not at any rate intend to be so regarded said she it suits me to travel alone not that i am averse to society quite the contrary if i meet pleasant people i am always ready to join them but it suits me to travel without any permanent party and i do not see why false shame should prevent my seeing the world as thoroughly as though i belonged to the other sex why should it m delabordeau m delabordeau declared that he did not see any reason why it should i am passionately anxious to stand upon mount sinai continued miss dawkins to press with my feet the earliest spot in sacred history of the identity of which we are certain to feel within me the aweinspiring thrill of that thrice sacred hour the frenchman looked as though he did not quite understand her but he said that it would be magnifique you have already made up your party i suppose m delabordeau m delabordeau gave the names of two frenchmen and one englishman who were going with him upon my word it is a great temptation to join you said miss dawkins only for that horrid englishman vat mr stanley oh i dont mean any disrespect to mr stanley the horridness i speak of does not attach to him personally but to his stiff respectable ungainly wellbehaved irrational and uncivilised country you see i am not very patriotic not quite so moch as my friend mr damer ha ha ha an excellent creature isnt he and so they all are dear creatures but then they are so backward they are most anxious that i should join them up the nile but and then miss dawkins shrugged her shoulders gracefully and as she flattered herself like a frenchwoman after that they rode on in silence for a few moments yes i must see mount sinai said miss dawkins and then sighed deeply m delabordeau notwithstanding that his country does stand at the head of all human civilisation was not courteous enough to declare that if miss dawkins would join his party across the desert nothing would be wanting to make his beatitude in this world perfect their road from the village of the chickenhatching ovens lay up along the left bank of the nile through an immense grove of lofty palmtrees looking out from among which our visitors could ever and anon see the heads of the two great pyramidsthat is such of them could see it as felt any solicitude in the matter it is astonishing how such things lose their great charm as men find themselves in their close neighbourhood to one living in new york or london how ecstatic is the interest inspired by these huge structures one feels that no price would be too high to pay for seeing them as long as time and distance and the worlds inexorable taskwork forbid such a visit how intense would be the delight of climbing over the wondrous handiwork of those wondrous architects so long since dead how thrilling the awe with which one would penetrate down into their interior cavesthose caves in which lay buried the bones of ancient kings whose very names seem to have come to us almost from another world but all these feelings become strangely dim their acute edges wonderfully worn as the subjects which inspired them are brought near to us ah so those are the pyramids are they says the traveller when the first glimpse of them is shown to him from the window of a railway carriage dear me they dont look so very high do they for heavens sake put the blind down or we shall be destroyed by the dust and then the ecstasy and keen delight of the pyramids has vanished for ever our friends therefore who for weeks past had seen from a distance though they had not yet visited them did not seem to have any strong feeling on the subject as they trotted through the grove of palmtrees mr damer had not yet escaped from his wife who was still fretful from the result of her little accident it was all the chattering of that miss dawkins said mrs damer she would not let me attend to what i was doing miss dawkins is an ass said her husband it is a pity she has no one to look after her said mrs damer m delabordeau was still listening to miss dawkinss raptures about mount sinai i wonder whether she has got any money said m delabordeau to himself it cant be much he went on thinking or she would not be left in this way by herself and the result of his thoughts was that miss dawkins if undertaken might probably become more plague than profit as to miss dawkins herself though she was ecstatic about mount sinaiwhich was not presentshe seemed to have forgotten the poor pyramids which were then before her nose the two lads were riding races along the dusty path much to the disgust of their donkeyboys their time for enjoyment was to come there were hampers to be opened and then the absolute climbing of the pyramids would actually be a delight to them as for miss damer and mr ingram it was clear that they had forgotten palmtrees pyramids the nile and all egypt they had escaped to a much fairer paradise could i bear to live among republicans said fanny repeating the last words of her american lover and looking down from her donkey to the ground as she did so i hardly know what republicans are mr ingram let me teach you said he you do talk such nonsense i declare there is that miss dawkins looking at us as though she had twenty eyes could you not teach her mr ingram and so they emerged from the palmtree grove through a village crowded with dirty straggling arab children on to the cultivated plain beyond which the pyramids stood now full before them the two large pyramids a smaller one and the huge sphynxs head all in a group together fanny said bob damer riding up to her mamma wants you so toddle back mamma wants me what can she want me for now said fanny with a look of anything but filial duty in her face to protect her from miss dawkins i think she wants you to ride at her side so that dawkins maynt get at her now mr ingram ill bet you halfacrown im at the top of the big pyramid before you poor fanny she obeyed however doubtless feeling that it would not do as yet to show too plainly that she preferred mr ingram to her mother she arrested her donkey therefore till mrs damer overtook her and mr ingram as he paused for a moment with her while she did so fell into the hands of miss dawkins i cannot think fanny how you get on so quick said mrs damer im always last but then my donkey is such a very nasty one look there now hes always trying to get me off we shall soon be at the pyramids now mamma how on earth i am ever to get back again i cannot think i am so tired now that i can hardly sit youll be better mamma when you get your luncheon and a glass of wine how on earth we are to eat and drink with those nasty arab people around us i cant conceive they tell me we shall be eaten up by them but fanny what has mr ingram been saying to you all the day what has he been saying mamma oh i dont knowa hundred things i dare say but he has not been talking to me all the time i think he has fanny nearly since we crossed the river oh dear oh dear this animal does hurt me so every time he moves he flings his head about and that gives me such a bump and then fanny commiserated her mothers sufferings and in her commiseration contrived to elude any further questionings as to mr ingrams conversation majestic piles are they not said miss dawkins who having changed her companion allowed her mind to revert from mount sinai to the pyramids they were now riding through cultivated ground with the vast extent of the sands of libya before them the two pyramids were standing on the margin of the sand with the head of the recumbent sphynx plainly visible between them but no idea can be formed of the size of this immense figure till it is visited much more closely the body is covered with sand and the head and neck alone stand above the surface of the ground they were still two miles distant and the sphynx as yet was but an obscure mount between the two vast pyramids immense piles said miss dawkins repeating her own words yes they are large said mr ingram who did not choose to indulge in enthusiasm in the presence of miss dawkins enormous what a grand ideaeh mr ingram the human race does not create such things as those nowadays no indeed he answered but perhaps we create better things better you do not mean to say mr ingram that you are an utilitarian i do in truth hope better things of you than that yes steam mills are better no doubt and mechanics institutes and penny newspapers but is nothing to be valued but what is useful and miss dawkins in the height of her enthusiasm switched her donkey severely over the shoulder i might perhaps have said also that we create more beautiful things said mr ingram but we cannot create older things no certainly we cannot do that nor can we imbue what we do create with the grand associations which environ those piles with so intense an interest think of the mighty dead mr ingram and of their great homes when living think of the hands which it took to raise those huge blocks and of the lives which it cost doubtless the tyranny and invincible power of the royal architects add to the grandeur of the idea one would not wish to have back the kings of egypt well no they would be neither useful nor beautiful perhaps not and i do not wish to be picturesque at the expense of my fellowcreatures i doubt even whether they would be picturesque you know what i mean mr ingram but the associations of such names and the presence of the stupendous works with which they are connected fill the soul with awe such at least is the effect with mine i fear that my tendencies miss dawkins are more realistic than your own you belong to a young country mr ingram and are naturally prone to think of material life the necessity of living looms large before you very large indeed miss dawkins whereas with us with some of us at least the material aspect has given place to one in which poetry and enthusiasm prevail to such among us the associations of past times are very dear cheops to me is more than napoleon bonaparte that is more than most of your countrymen can say at any rate just at present i am a woman continued miss dawkins mr ingram took off his hat in acknowledgment both of the announcement and of the fact and to us it is not givennot given as yetto share in the great deeds of the present the envy of your sex has driven us from the paths which lead to honour but the deeds of the past are as much ours as yours oh quite as much tis to your country that we look for enfranchisement from this thraldom yes mr ingram the women of america have that strength of mind which has been wanting to those of europe in the united states woman will at last learn to exercise her proper mission mr ingram expressed a sincere wish that such might be the case and then wondering at the ingenuity with which miss dawkins had travelled round from cheops and his pyramid to the rights of women in america he contrived to fall back under the pretence of asking after the ailments of mrs damer and now at last they were on the sand in the absolute desert making their way up to the very foot of the most northern of the two pyramids they were by this time surrounded by a crowd of arab guides or arabs professing to be guides who had already ascertained that mr damer was the chief of the party and were accordingly driving him almost to madness by the offers of their services and their assurance that he could not possibly see the outside or the inside of either structure or even remain alive upon the ground unless he at once accepted their offers made at their own prices get away will you said he i dont want any of you and i wont have you if you take hold of me ill shoot you this was said to one specially energetic arab who in his efforts to secure his prey had caught hold of mr damer by the leg yes yes i say englishmen always take mememe and then no break him leg yesyesyesi go master say yes only one leetle ten shillings abdallah shouted mr damer why dont you take this man away why dont you make him understand that if all the pyramids depended on it i would not give him sixpence and then abdallah thus invoked came up and explained to the man in arabic that he would gain his object more surely if he would behave himself a little more quietly a hint which the man took for one minute and for one minute only and then poor mrs damer replied to an application for backsheish by the gift of a sixpence unfortunate woman the word backsheish means i believe a gift but it has come in egypt to signify money and is eternally dinned into the ears of strangers by arab suppliants mrs damer ought to have known better as during the last six weeks she had never shown her face out of shepheards hotel without being pestered for backsheish but she was tired and weak and foolishly thought to rid herself of the man who was annoying her no sooner had the coin dropped from her hand into that of the arab than she was surrounded by a cluster of beggars who loudly made their petitions as though they would each of them individually be injured if treated with less liberality than that first comer they took hold of her donkey her bridle her saddle her legs and at last her arms and hands screaming for backsheish in voices that were neither sweet nor mild in her dismay she did give away sundry small coinsall probably that she had about her but this only made the matter worse money was going and each man by sufficient energy might hope to get some of it they were very energetic and so frightened the poor lady that she would certainly have fallen had she not been kept on her seat by the pressure around her oh dear oh dear get away she cried i havent got any more indeed i havent go away i tell you mr damer oh mr damer and then in the excess of her agony she uttered one loud long and continuous shriek up came mr damer up came abdallah up came m delabordeau up came mr ingram and at last she was rescued you shouldnt go away and leave me to the mercy of these nasty people as to that abdallah he is of no use to anybody why you bodder de good lady you dem blackguard said abdallah raising his stick as though he were going to lay them all low with a blow now you get noting you tief the arabs for a moment retired to a little distance like flies driven from a sugarbowl but it was easy to see that like the flies they would return at the first vacant moment and now they had reached the very foot of the pyramids and proceeded to dismount from their donkeys their intention was first to ascend to the top then to come down to their banquet and after that to penetrate into the interior and all this would seem to be easy of performance the pyramid is undoubtedly high but it is so constructed as to admit of climbing without difficulty a lady mounting it would undoubtedly need some assistance but any man possessed of moderate activity would require no aid at all but our friends were at once imbued with the tremendous nature of the task before them a sheikh of the arabs came forth who communicated with them through abdallah the work could be done no doubt he said but a great many men would be wanted to assist each lady must have four arabs and each gentlemen three and then seeing that the work would be peculiarly severe on this special day each of these numerous arabs must be remunerated by some very large number of piastres mr damer who was by no means a close man in his money dealings opened his eyes with surprise and mildly expostulated m delabordeau who was rather a close man in his reckonings immediately buttoned up his breeches pocket and declared that he should decline to mount the pyramid at all at that price and then mr ingram descended to the combat the protestations of the men were fearful they declared with loud voices eager actions and manifold english oaths that an attempt was being made to rob them they had a right to demand the sums which they were charging and it was a shame that english gentlemen should come and take the bread out of their mouths and so they screeched gesticulated and swore and frightened poor mrs damer almost into fits but at last it was settled and away they started the sheikh declaring that the bargain had been made at so low a rate as to leave him not one piastre for himself each man had an arab on each side of him and miss dawkins and miss damer had each in addition one behind mrs damer was so frightened as altogether to have lost all ambition to ascend she sat below on a fragment of stone with the three dragomans standing around her as guards but even with the three dragomans the attacks on her were so frequent and as she declared afterwards she was so bewildered that she never had time to remember that she had come there from england to see the pyramids and that she was now immediately under them the boys utterly ignoring their guides scrambled up quicker than the arabs could follow them mr damer started off at a pace which soon brought him to the end of his tether and from that point was dragged up by the sheer strength of his assistants thereby accomplishing the wishes of the men who induce their victims to start as rapidly as possible in order that they may soon find themselves helpless from want of wind mr ingram endeavoured to attach himself to fanny and she would have been nothing loth to have him at her right hand instead of the hideous brown shrieking oneeyed arab who took hold of her but it was soon found that any such arrangement was impossible each guide felt that if he lost his own peculiar hold he would lose his prey and held on therefore with invincible tenacity miss dawkins looked too as though she had thought to be attended to by some christian cavalier but no christian cavalier was forthcoming m delabordeau was the wisest for he took the matter quietly did as he was bid and allowed the guides nearly to carry him to the top of the edifice ha so this is the top of the pyramid is it said mr damer bringing out his words one by one being terribly out of breath very wonderful very wonderful indeed it is wonderful said miss dawkins whose breath had not failed her in the least very wonderful indeed only think mr damer you might travel on for days and days till days became months through those interminable sands and yet you would never come to the end of them is it not quite stupendous ah yes quitepuff puffsaid mr damer striving to regain his breath mr damer was now at her disposal weak and worn with toil and travel out of breath and with half his manhood gone if ever she might prevail over him so as to procure from his mouth an assent to that nile proposition it would be now and after all that nile proposition was the best one now before her she did not quite like the idea of starting off across the great desert without any lady and was not sure that she was prepared to be fallen in love with by m delabordeau even if there should ultimately be any readiness on the part of that gentleman to perform the rle of lover with mr ingram the matter was different nor was she so diffident of her own charms as to think it altogether impossible that she might succeed in the teeth of that little chit fanny damer that mr ingram would join the party up the nile she had very little doubt and then there would be one place left for her she would thus at any rate become commingled with a most respectable family who might be of material service to her thus actuated she commenced an earnest attack upon mr damer stupendous she said again for she was fond of repeating favourite words what a wondrous race must have been those egyptian kings of old i dare say they were said mr damer wiping his brow as he sat upon a large loose stone a fragment lying on the flat top of the pyramid one of those stones with which the complete apex was once made or was once about to be made a magnificent race so gigantic in their conceptions their ideas altogether overwhelm us poor insignificant latterday mortals they built these vast pyramids but for us it is task enough to climb to their top quite enough ejaculated mr damer but mr damer would not always remain weak and out of breath and it was absolutely necessary for miss dawkins to hurry away from cheops and his tomb to thebes and karnac after seeing this it is impossible for any one with a spark of imagination to leave egypt without going farther afield mr damer merely wiped his brow and grunted this miss dawkins took as a signal of weakness and went on with her task perseveringly for myself i have resolved to go up at any rate as far as asouan and the first cataract i had thought of acceding to the wishes of a party who are going across the great desert by mount sinai to jerusalem but the kindness of yourself and mrs damer is so great and the prospect of joining in your boat is so pleasurable that i have made up my mind to accept your very kind offer this it will be acknowledged was bold on the part of miss dawkins but what will not audacity effect to use the slang of modern language cheek carries everything nowadays and whatever may have been miss dawkinss deficiencies in this virtue she was not deficient i have made up my mind to accept your very kind offer she said shining on mr damer with her blandest smile what was a stout breathless perspiring middleaged gentleman to do under such circumstances mr damer was a man who in most matters had his own way that his wife should have given such an invitation without consulting him was he knew quite impossible she would as soon have thought of asking all those arab guides to accompany them nor was it to be thought of that he should allow himself to be kidnapped into such an arrangement by the impudence of any miss dawkins but there was he felt a difficulty in answering such a proposition from a young lady with a direct negative especially while he was so scant of breath so he wiped his brow again and looked at her but i can only agree to this on one understanding continued miss dawkins and that is that i am allowed to defray my own full share of the expense of the journey upon hearing this mr damer thought that he saw his way out of the wood wherever i go miss dawkins i am always the paymaster myself and this he contrived to say with some sternness palpitating though he still was and the sternness which was deficient in his voice he endeavoured to put into his countenance but he did not know miss dawkins oh mr damer she said and as she spoke her smile became almost blander than it was before oh mr damer i could not think of suffering you to be so liberal i could not indeed but i shall be quite content that you should pay everything and let me settle with you in one sum afterwards mr damers breath was now rather more under his own command i am afraid miss dawkins he said that mrs damers weak state of health will not admit of such an arrangement what about the paying not only as to that but we are a family party miss dawkins and great as would be the benefit of your society to all of us in mrs damers present state of health i am afraidin short you would not find it agreeableand therefore this he added seeing that she was still about to perseverei fear that we must forego the advantage you offer and then looking into his face miss dawkins did perceive that even her audacity would not prevail oh very well she said and moving from the stone on which she had been sitting she walked off carrying her head very high to a corner of the pyramid from which she could look forth alone towards the sands of libya in the mean time another little overture was being made on the top of the same pyramidan overture which was not received quite in the same spirit while mr damer was recovering his breath for the sake of answering miss dawkins miss damer had walked to the further corner of the square platform on which they were placed and there sat herself down with her face turned towards cairo perhaps it was not singular that mr ingram should have followed her this would have been very well if a dozen arabs had not also followed them but as this was the case mr ingram had to play his game under some difficulty he had no sooner seated himself beside her than they came and stood directly in front of the seat shutting out the view and by no means improving the fragrance of the air around them and this then miss damer will be our last excursion together he said in his tenderest softest tone de good englishman will gib de poor arab one little backsheish said an arab putting out his hand and shaking mr ingrams shoulder yes yes yes him gib backsheish said another him berry good man said a third putting up his filthy hand and touching mr ingrams face and young lady berry good too she give backsheish to poor arab yes said a fourth preparing to take a similar liberty with miss damer this was too much for mr ingram he had already used very positive language in his endeavour to assure his tormentors that they would not get a piastre from him but this only changed their soft persuasions into threats upon hearing which and upon seeing what the man attempted to do in his endeavour to get money from miss damer he raised his stick and struck first one and then the other as violently as he could upon their heads any ordinary civilised men would have been stunned by such blows for they fell on the bare foreheads of the arabs but the objects of the americans wrath merely skulked away and the others convinced by the only arguments which they understood followed in pursuit of victims who might be less pugnacious it is hard for a man to be at once tender and pugnaciousto be sentimental while he is putting forth his physical strength with all the violence in his power it is difficult also for him to be gentle instantly after having been in a rage so he changed his tactics at the moment and came to the point at once in a manner befitting his present state of mind those vile wretches have put me in such a heat he said that i hardly know what i am saying but the fact is this miss damer i cannot leave cairo without knowing you understand what i mean miss damer indeed i do not mr ingram except that i am afraid you mean nonsense yes you do you know that i love you i am sure you must know it at any rate you know it now mr ingram you should not talk in such a way why should i not but the truth is fanny i can talk in no other way i do love you dearly can you love me well enough to go and be my wife in a country far away from your own before she left the top of the pyramid fanny damer had said that she would try mr ingram was now a proud and happy man and seemed to think the steps of the pyramid too small for his elastic energy but fanny feared that her troubles were to come there was papathat terrible bugbear on all such occasions what would papa say she was sure her papa would not allow her to marry and go so far away from her own family and country for herself she liked the americansalways had liked them so she saidwould desire nothing better than to live among them but papa and fanny sighed as she felt that all the recognised miseries of a young lady in love were about to fall upon her nevertheless at her lovers instance she promised and declared in twenty different loving phrases that nothing on earth should ever make her false to her love or to her lover fanny where are you why are you not ready to come down shouted mr damer not in the best of tempers he felt that he had almost been unkind to an unprotected female and his heart misgave him and yet it would have misgiven him more had he allowed himself to be entrapped by miss dawkins i am quite ready papa said fanny running up to himfor it may be understood that there is quite room enough for a young lady to run on the top of the pyramid i am sure i dont know where you have been all the time said mr damer and where are those two boys fanny pointed to the top of the other pyramid and there they were conspicuous with their red caps and m delabordeau oh he has gone down i thinkno he is there with miss dawkins and in truth miss dawkins was leaning on his arm most affectionately as she stooped over and looked down upon the ruins below her and where is that fellow ingram said mr damer looking about him he is always out of the way when hes wanted to this fanny said nothing why should she she was not mr ingrams keeper and then they all descended each again with his proper number of arabs to hurry and embarrass him and they found mrs damer at the bottom like a piece of sugar covered with flies she was heard to declare afterwards that she would not go to the pyramids again not if they were to be given to her for herself as ornaments for her garden the picnic lunch among the big stones at the foot of the pyramid was not a very gay affair miss dawkins talked more than any one else being determined to show that she bore her defeat gallantly her conversation however was chiefly addressed to m delabordeau and he seemed to think more of his cold chicken and ham than he did of her wit and attention fanny hardly spoke a word there was her father before her and she could not eat much less talk as she thought of all that she would have to go through what would he say to the idea of having an american for a soninlaw nor was mr ingram very lively a young man when he has been just accepted never is so his happiness under the present circumstances was no doubt intense but it was of a silent nature and then the interior of the building had to be visited to tell the truth none of the party would have cared to perform this feat had it not been for the honour of the thing to have come from paris new york or london to the pyramids and then not to have visited the very tomb of cheops would have shown on the part of all of them an indifference to subjects of interest which would have been altogether fatal to their character as travellers and so a party for the interior was made up miss damer when she saw the aperture through which it was expected that she should descend at once declared for staying with her mother miss dawkins however was enthusiastic for the journey persons with so very little command over their nerves might really as well stay at home she said to mr ingram who glowered at her dreadfully for expressing such an opinion about his fanny this entrance into the pyramids is a terrible task which should be undertaken by no lady those who perform it have to creep down and then to be dragged up through infinite dirt foul smells and bad air and when they have done it they see nothing but they do earn the gratification of saying that they have been inside a pyramid well ive done that once said mr damer coming out and i do not think that any one will catch me doing it again i never was in such a filthy place in my life oh fanny i am so glad you did not go i am sure it is not fit for ladies said poor mrs damer forgetful of her friend miss dawkins i should have been ashamed of myself said miss dawkins bristling up and throwing back her head as she stood if i had allowed any consideration to have prevented my visiting such a spot if it be not improper for men to go there how can it be improper for women i did not say improper my dear said mrs damer apologetically and as for the fatigue what can a woman be worth who is afraid to encounter as much as i have now gone through for the sake of visiting the last restingplace of such a king as cheops and miss dawkins as she pronounced the last words looked round her with disdain upon poor fanny damer but i meant the dirt said mrs damer dirt ejaculated miss dawkins and then walked away why should she now submit her high tone of feeling to the damers or why care longer for their good opinion therefore she scattered contempt around her as she ejaculated the last word dirt and then the return home i know i shall never get there said mrs damer looking piteously up into her husbands face nonsense my dear nonsense you must get there mrs damer groaned and acknowledged in her heart that she musteither dead or alive and jefferson said fanny whisperingfor there had been a moment since their descent in which she had been instructed to call him by his christian namenever mind talking to me going home i will ride by mamma do you go with papa and put him in good humour and if he says anything about the lords and the bishops dont you contradict him you know what will not a man do for love mr ingram promised and in this way they started the two boys led the van then came mr damer and mr ingram unusually and unpatriotically acquiescent as to englands aristocratic propensities then miss dawkins riding alas alone after her m delabordeau also alonethe ungallant frenchman and the rear was brought up by mrs damer and her daughter flanked on each side by a dragoman with a third dragoman behind them and in this order they went back to cairo riding their donkeys and crossing the ferry solemnly and for the most part silently mr ingram did talk as he had an important object in viewthat of putting mr damer into a good humour in this he succeeded so well that by the time they had remounted after crossing the nile mr damer opened his heart to his companion on the subject that was troubling him and told him all about miss dawkins i dont see why we should have a companion that we dont like for eight or ten weeks merely because it seems rude to refuse a lady indeed i agree with you said mr ingram i should call it weakminded to give way in such a case my daughter does not like her at all continued mr damer nor would she be a nice companion for miss damer not according to my way of thinking said mr ingram and as to my having asked her or mrs damer having asked her why god bless my soul it is pure invention on the womans part ha ha ha laughed mr ingrain i must say she plays her game well but then she is an old soldier and has the benefit of experience what would miss dawkins have said had she known that mr ingram called her an old soldier i dont like the kind of thing at all said mr damer who was very serious upon the subject you see the position in which i am placed i am forced to be very rude or i dont call it rude at all disobliging then or else i must have all my comfort invaded and pleasure destroyed by by by and mr damer paused being at a loss for an appropriate name for miss dawkins by an unprotected female suggested mr ingram yes just so i am as fond of pleasant company as anybody but then i like to choose it myself so do i said mr ingram thinking of his own choice now ingram if you would join us we should be delighted upon my word sir the offer is too flattering said ingram hesitatingly for he felt that he could not undertake such a journey until mr damer knew on what terms he stood with fanny you are a terrible democrat said mr damer laughing but then on that matter you know we could agree to differ exactly so said mr ingram who had not collected his thoughts or made up his mind as to what he had better say and do on the spur of the moment well what do you say to it said mr damer encouragingly but ingram paused before he answered for heavens sake my dear fellow dont have the slightest hesitation in refusing if you dont like the plan the fact is mr damer i should like it too well like it too well yes sir and i may as well tell you now as later i had intended this evening to have asked for your permission to address your daughter god bless my soul said mr damer looking as though a totally new idea had now been opened to him and under these circumstances i will now wait and see whether or no you will renew your offer god bless my soul said mr damer again it often does strike an old gentleman as very odd that any man should fall in love with his daughter whom he has not ceased to look upon as a child the case is generally quite different with mothers they seem to think that every young man must fall in love with their girls and have you said anything to fanny about this asked mr damer yes sir i have her permission to speak to you god bless my soul said mr damer and by this time they had arrived at shepheards hotel oh mamma said fanny as soon as she found herself alone with her mother that evening i have something that i must tell you oh fanny dont tell me anything tonight for i am a great deal too tired to listen but oh mamma prayyou must listen to this indeed you must and fanny knelt down at her mothers knee and looked beseechingly up into her face what is it fanny you know that all my bones are sore and i am so tired that i am almost dead mamma mr ingram has has what my dear has he done anything wrong no mamma but he hashe has proposed to me and fanny bursting into tears hid her face in her mothers lap and thus the story was told on both sides of the house on the next day as a matter of course all the difficulties and dangers of such a marriage as that which was now projected were insisted on by both father and mother it was improper it would cause a severing of the family not to be thought of it would be an alliance of a dangerous nature and not at all calculated to insure happiness and in short it was impossible on that day therefore they all went to bed very unhappy but on the next day as was also a matter of course seeing that there were no pecuniary difficulties the mother and father were talked over and mr ingram was accepted as a soninlaw it need hardly be said that the offer of a place in mr damers boat was again made and that on this occasion it was accepted without hesitation there was an american protestant clergyman resident in cairo with whom among other persons miss dawkins had become acquainted upon this gentleman or upon his wife miss dawkins called a few days after the journey to the pyramid and finding him in his study thus performed her duty to her neighbour you know your countryman mr ingram i think said she oh yes very intimately if you have any regard for him mr burton such was the gentlemans name i think you should put him on his guard on his guard against what said mr burton with a serious air for there was something serious in the threat of impending misfortune as conveyed by miss dawkins why said she those damers i fear are dangerous people do you mean that they will borrow money of him oh no not that exactly but they are clearly setting their cap at him setting their cap at him yes there is a daughter you know a little chit of a thing and i fear mr ingram may be caught before he knows where he is it would be such a pity you know he is going up the river with them i hear that in his place is very foolish they asked me but i positively refused mr burton remarked that in such a matter as that mr ingram would be perfectly able to take care of himself well perhaps so but seeing what was going on i thought it my duty to tell you and so miss dawkins took her leave mr ingram did go up the nile with the damers as did an old friend of the damers who arrived from england and a very pleasant trip they had of it and as far as the present historian knows the two lovers were shortly afterwards married in england poor miss dawkins was left in cairo for some time on her beam ends but she was one of those who are not easily vanquished after an interval of ten days she made acquaintance with an irish familyhaving utterly failed in moving the hard heart of m delabordeauand with these she proceeded to constantinople they consisted of two brothers and a sister and were therefore very convenient for matrimonial purposes but nevertheless when i last heard of miss dawkins she was still an unprotected female the chateau of prince polignac few englishmen or englishwomen are intimately acquainted with the little town of le puy it is the capital of the old province of le velay which also is now but little known even to french ears for it is in these days called by the imperial name of the department of the haute loire it is to the southeast of auvergne and is nearly in the centre of the southern half of france but few towns merely as towns can be better worth visiting in the first place the volcanic formation of the ground on which it stands is not only singular in the extreme so as to be interesting to the geologist but it is so picturesque as to be equally gratifying to the general tourist within a narrow valley there stand several rocks rising up from the ground with absolute abruptness round two of these the town clusters and a third stands but a mile distant forming the centre of a faubourg or suburb these rocks appear to be and i believe are the harder particles of volcanic matter which have not been carried away through successive ages by the joint agency of water and air when the tide of lava ran down between the hills the surface left was no doubt on a level with the heads of these rocks but here and there the deposit became harder than elsewhere and these harder points have remained lifting up their steep heads in a line through the valley the highest of these is called the rocher de corneille round this and up its steep sides the town stands on its highest summit there was an old castle and there now is or will be before these pages are printed a colossal figure in bronze of the virgin mary made from the cannon taken at sebastopol halfway down the hill the cathedral is built a singularly gloomy edificeromanesque as it is called in its style but extremely similar in its mode of architecture to what we know of byzantine structures but there has been no surface on the rock side large enough to form a restingplace for the church which has therefore been built out on huge supporting piles which form a porch below the west front so that the approach is by numerous steps laid along the side of the wall below the church forming a wondrous flight of stairs let all men who may find themselves stopping at le puy visit the top of these stairs at the time of the setting sun and look down from thence through the framework of the porch on the town beneath and at the hillside beyond behind the church is the seminary of the priests with its beautiful walks stretching round the rocher de corneille and overlooking the town and valley below next to this rock and within a quarter of a mile of it is the second peak called the rock of the needle it rises narrow sharp and abrupt from the valley allowing of no buildings on its sides but on its very point has been erected a church sacred to st michael that lover of rock summits accessible by stairs cut from the stone this perhapsthis rock i meanis the most wonderful of the wonders which nature has formed at le puy above this at a miles distance is the rock of espailly formed in the same way and almost equally precipitous on its summit is a castle having its own legend and professing to have been the residence of charles vii when little of france belonged to its kings but the provinces of berry auvergne and le velay some three miles farther up there is another volcanic rock larger indeed but equally sudden in its springequally remarkable as rising abruptly from the valleyon which stands the castle and old family residence of the house of polignac it was lost by them at the revolution but was repurchased by the minister of charles x and is still the property of the head of the race le puy itself is a small moderate pleasant french town in which the language of the people has not the pure parisian aroma nor is the glory of the boulevards of the capital emulated in its streets these are crooked narrow steep and intricate forming here and there excellent sketches for a lover of street picturesque beauty but hurtful to the feet with their small roundtopped paving stones and not always as clean as pedestrian ladies might desire and now i would ask my readers to join me at the morning table dhte at the htel des ambassadeurs it will of course be understood that this does not mean a breakfast in the ordinary fashion of england consisting of tea or coffee bread and butter and perhaps a boiled egg it comprises all the requisites for a composite dinner excepting soup and as one gets further south in france this meal is called dinner it is however eaten without any prejudice to another similar and somewhat longer meal at six or seven oclock which when the above name is taken up by the earlier enterprise is styled supper the djener or dinner at the htel des ambassadeurs on the morning in question though very elaborate was not a very gay affair there were some fourteen persons present of whom half were residents in the town men employed in some official capacity who found this to be the cheapest the most luxurious and to them the most comfortable mode of living they clustered together at the head of the table and as they were customary guests at the house they talked their little talk togetherit was very littleand made the most of the good things before them then there were two or three commisvoyageurs a chance traveller or two and an english lady with a young daughter the english lady sat next to one of the accustomed guests but he unlike the others held converse with her rather than with them our story at present has reference only to that lady and to that gentleman place aux dames we will speak first of the lady whose name was mrs thompson she was shall i say a young woman of about thirtysix in so saying i am perhaps creating a prejudice against her in the minds of some readers as they will not unnaturally suppose her after such an announcement to be in truth over forty any such prejudice will be unjust i would have it believed that thirtysix was the outside not the inside of her age she was goodlooking ladylike and considering that she was an englishwoman fairly well dressed she was inclined to be rather full in her person but perhaps not more so than is becoming to ladies at her time of life she had rings on her fingers and a brooch on her bosom which were of some value and on the back of her head she wore a jaunty small lace cap which seemed to tell in conjunction with her other appointments that her circumstances were comfortable the little girl who sat next to her was the youngest of her two daughters and might be about thirteen years of age her name was matilda but infantine circumstances had invested her with the nickname of mimmy by which her mother always called her a nice pretty playful little girl was mimmy thompson wearing two long tails of plaited hair hanging behind her head and inclined occasionally to be rather loud in her sport mrs thompson had another and an elder daughter now some fifteen years old who was at school in le puy and it was with reference to her tuition that mrs thompson had taken up a temporary residence at the htel des ambassadeurs in that town lilian thompson was occasionally invited down to dine or breakfast at the inn and was visited daily at her school by her mother when im sure that shell do i shall leave her there and go back to england mrs thompson had said not in the purest french to the neighbour who always sat next to her at the table dhte the gentleman namely to whom we have above alluded but still she had remained at le puy a month and did not go a circumstance which was considered singular but by no means unpleasant both by the innkeeper and by the gentleman in question the facts as regarded mrs thompson were as followsshe was the widow of a gentleman who had served for many years in the civil service of the east indies and who on dying had left her a comfortable income ofit matters not how many pounds but constituting quite a sufficiency to enable her to live at her ease and educate her daughters her children had been sent home to england before her husbands death and after that event she had followed them but there though she was possessed of moderate wealth she had no friends and few acquaintances and after a little while she had found life to be rather dull her customs were not those of england nor were her propensities english therefore she had gone abroad and having received some recommendation of this school at le puy had made her way thither as it appeared to her that she really enjoyed more consideration at le puy than had been accorded to her either at torquay or leamington there she remained from day to day the total payment required at the htel des ambassadeurs was but six francs daily for herself and three and a half for her little girl and where else could she live with a better junction of economy and comfort and then the gentleman who always sat next to her was so exceedingly civil the gentlemans name was m lacordaire so much she knew and had learned to call him by his name very frequently mimmy too was quite intimate with m lacordaire but nothing more than his name was known of him but m lacordaire carried a general letter of recommendation in his face manner gait dress and tone of voice in all these respects there was nothing left to be desired and in addition to this he was decorated and wore the little red ribbon of the legion of honour ingeniously twisted into the shape of a small flower m lacordaire might be senior in age to mrs thompson by about ten years nor had he about him any of the airs or graces of a wouldbe young man his hair which he wore very short was grizzled as was also the small pretence of a whisker which came down about as far as the middle of his ear but the tuft on his chin was still brown without a gray hair his eyes were bright and tender his voice was low and soft his hands were very white his clothes were always new and well fitting and a betterbrushed hat could not be seen out of paris nor perhaps in it now during the weeks which mrs thompson had passed at le puy the acquaintance which she had formed with m lacordaire had progressed beyond the prolonged meals in the salle manger he had occasionally sat beside her evening table as she took her english cup of tea in her own room her bed being duly screened off in its distant niche by becoming curtains and then he had occasionally walked beside her as he civilly escorted her to the lions of the place and he had once accompanied her sitting on the back seat of a french voiture when she had gone forth to see something of the surrounding country on all such occasions she had been accompanied by one of her daughters and the world of le puy had had nothing material to say against her but still the world of le puy had whispered a little suggesting that m lacordaire knew very well what he was about but might not mrs thompson also know as well what she was about at any rate everything had gone on very pleasantly since the acquaintance had been made and now so much having been explained we will go back to the elaborate breakfast at the htel des ambassadeurs mrs thompson holding mimmy by the hand walked into the room some few minutes after the last bell had been rung and took the place which was now hers by custom the gentlemen who constantly frequented the house all bowed to her but m lacordaire rose from his seat and offered her his hand and how is mees meemy this morning said he for twas thus he always pronounced her name miss mimmy answering for herself declared that she was very well and suggested that m lacordaire should give her a fig from off a dish that was placed immediately before him on the table this m lacordaire did presenting it very elegantly between his two fingers and making a little bow to the little lady as he did so fie mimmy said her mother why do you ask for the things before the waiter brings them round but mamma said mimmy speaking english m lacordaire always gives me a fig every morning m lacordaire always spoils you i think answered mrs thompson in french and then they went thoroughly to work at their breakfast during the whole meal m lacordaire attended assiduously to his neighbour and did so without any evil result except that one frenchman with a black moustache at the head of the table trod on the toe of another frenchman with another black moustachewinking as he made the signjust as m lacordaire having selected a bunch of grapes put it on mrs thompsons plate with infinite grace but who among us all is free from such impertinences as these but madame really must see the chteau of prince polignac before she leaves le puy said m lacordaire the chteau of who asked mimmy to whose young ears the french words were already becoming familiar prince polignac my dear well i really dont know m lacordairei have seen a great deal of the place already and i shall be going now very soon probably in a day or two said mrs thompson but madame must positively see the chteau said m lacordaire very impressively and then after a pause he added if madame will have the complaisance to commission me to procure a carriage for this afternoon and will allow me the honour to be her guide i shall consider myself one of the most fortunate of men oh yes mamma do go said mimmy clapping her hands and it is thursday and lilian can go with us be quiet mimmy do thank you no m lacordaire i could not go today but i am extremely obliged by your politeness m lacordaire still pressed the matter and mrs thompson still declined till it was time to rise from the table she then declared that she did not think it possible that she should visit the chteau before she left le puy but that she would give him an answer at dinner the most tedious time in the day to mrs thompson were the two hours after breakfast at one oclock she daily went to the school taking mimmy who for an hour or two shared her sisters lessons this and her little excursions about the place and her shopping managed to make away with her afternoon then in the evening she generally saw something of m lacordaire but those two hours after breakfast were hard of killing on this occasion when she gained her own room she as usual placed mimmy on the sofa with a needle her custom then was to take up a novel but on this morning she sat herself down in her armchair and resting her head upon her hand and elbow began to turn over certain circumstances in her mind mamma said mimmy why wont you go with m lacordaire to that place belonging to the prince princepolly something wasnt it mind your work my dear said mrs thompson but i do so wish youd go mamma what was the princes name polignac mamma aint princes very great people yes my dear sometimes is prince pollynac like our prince alfred no my dear not at all at least i suppose not is his mother a queen no my dear then his father must be a king no my dear it is quite a different thing here here in france they have a great many princes well at any rate i should like to see a princes chteau so i do hope youll go and then there was a pause mamma could it come to pass here in france that m lacordaire should ever be a prince m lacordaire a prince no dont talk such nonsense but mind your work isnt m lacordaire a very nice man aint you very fond of him to this question mrs thompson made no answer mamma continued mimmy after a moments pause wont you tell me whether you are fond of m lacordaire im quite sure of thisthat hes very fond of you what makes you think that asked mrs thompson who could not bring herself to refrain from the question because he looks at you in that way mamma and squeezes your hand nonsense child said mrs thompson hold your tongue i dont know what can have put such stuff into your head but he does mamma said mimmy who rarely allowed her mother to put her down mrs thompson made no further answer but again sat with her head resting on her hand she also if the truth must be told was thinking of m lacordaire and his fondness for herself he had squeezed her hand and he had looked into her face however much it may have been nonsense on mimmys part to talk of such things they had not the less absolutely occurred was it really the fact that m lacordaire was in love with her and if so what return should she or could she make to such a passion he had looked at her yesterday and squeezed her hand today might it not be probable that he would advance a step further tomorrow if so what answer would she be prepared to make to him she did not thinkso she said to herselfthat she had any particular objection to marrying again thompson had been dead now for four years and neither his friends nor her friends nor the world could say she was wrong on that score and as to marrying a frenchman she could not say she felt within herself any absolute repugnance to doing that of her own country speaking of england as such she in truth knew but littleand perhaps cared less she had gone to india almost as a child and england had not been specially kind to her on her return she had found it dull and cold stiff and almost illnatured people there had not smiled on her and been civil as m lacordaire had done as far as england and englishmen were considered she saw no reason why she should not marry m lacordaire and then as regarded the man could she in her heart say that she was prepared to love honour and obey m lacordaire she certainly knew no reason why she should not do so she did not know much of him she said to herself at first but she knew as much she said afterwards as she had known personally of mr thompson before their marriage she had known to be sure what was mr thompsons profession and what his income or if not some one else had known for her as to both these points she was quite in the dark as regarded m lacordaire personally she certainly did like him as she said to herself more than once there was a courtesy and softness about him which were very gratifying to her and then his appearance was so much in his favour he was not very young she acknowledged but neither was she young herself it was quite evident that he was fond of her children and that he would be a kind and affectionate father to them indeed there was kindness in all that he did should she many againand she put it to herself quite hypotheticallyshe would look for no romance in such a second marriage she would be content to sit down in a quiet home to the tame dull realities of life satisfied with the companionship of a man who would be kind and gentle to her and whom she could respect and esteem where could she find a companion with whom this could be more safely anticipated than with m lacordaire and so she argued the question within her own breast in a manner not unfriendly to that gentleman that there was as yet one great hindrance she at once saw but then that might be remedied by a word she did not know what was his income or his profession the chambermaid whom she had interrogated had told her that he was a marchand to merchants generally she felt that she had no objection the barings and the rothschilds were merchants as was also that wonderful man at bombay sir hommajee bommajee who was worth she did not know how many thousand lacs of rupees that it would behove her on her own account and that of her daughters to take care of her own little fortune in contracting any such connection that she felt strongly she would never so commit herself as to put security in that respect out of her power but then she did not think that m lacordaire would ever ask her to do so at any rate she was determined on this that there should never be any doubt on that matter and as she firmly resolved on this she again took up her book and for a minute or two made an attempt to read mamma said mimmy will m lacordaire go up to the school to see lilian when you go away from this indeed i cannot say my dear if lilian is a good girl perhaps he may do so now and then and will he write to you and tell you how she is lilian can write for herself can she not oh yes i suppose she can but i hope m lacordaire will write too we shall come back here some day shant we mamma i cannot say my dear i do so hope we shall see m lacordaire again do you know what i was thinking mamma little girls like you ought not to think said mrs thompson walking slowly out of the room to the top of the stairs and back again for she had felt the necessity of preventing mimmy from disclosing any more of her thoughts and now my dear get yourself ready and we will go up to the school mrs thompson always dressed herself with care though not in especially fine clothes before she went down to dinner at the table dhte but on this occasion she was more than usually particular she hardly explained to herself why she did this but nevertheless as she stood before the glass she did in a certain manner feel that the circumstances of her future life might perhaps depend on what might be said and done that evening she had not absolutely decided whether or no she would go to the princes chteau but if she did go well if she did what then she had sense enough as she assured herself more than once to regulate her own conduct with propriety in any such emergency during the dinner m lacordaire conversed in his usual manner but said nothing whatever about the visit to polignac he was very kind to mimmy and very courteous to her mother but did not appear to be at all more particular than usual indeed it might be a question whether he was not less so as she had entered the room mrs thompson had said to herself that perhaps after all it would be better that there should be nothing more thought about it but before the four of five courses were over she was beginning to feel a little disappointed and now the fruit was on the table after the consumption of which it was her practice to retire it was certainly open to her to ask m lacordaire to take tea with her that evening as she had done on former occasions but she felt that she must not do this now considering the immediate circumstances of the case if any further steps were to be taken they must be taken by him and not by heror else by mimmy who just as her mother was slowly consuming her last grapes ran round to the back of m lacordaires chair and whispered something into his ear it may be presumed that mrs thompson did not see the intention of the movement in time to arrest it for she did nothing till the whispering had been whispered and then she rebuked the child bade her not to be troublesome and with more than usual austerity in her voice desired her to get herself ready to go up stairs to their chamber as she spoke she herself rose from her chair and made her final little bow to the table and her other final little bow and smile to m lacordaire but this was certain to all who saw it that the smile was not as gracious as usual as she walked forth m lacordaire rose from his chairsuch being his constant practice when she left the table but on this occasion he accompanied her to the door and has madame decided he asked whether she will permit me to accompany her to the chteau well i really dont know said mrs thompson mees meemy continued m lacordaire is very anxious to see the rock and i may perhaps hope that mees lilian would be pleased with such a little excursion as for myself and then m lacordaire put his hand upon his heart in a manner that seemed to speak more plainly than he had ever spoken well if the children would really like it andas you are so very kind said mrs thompson and so the matter was conceded tomorrow afternoon suggested m lacordaire but mrs thompson fixed on saturday thereby showing that she herself was in no hurry for the expedition oh i am so glad said mimmy when they had reentered their own room mamma do let me tell lilian myself when i go up to the school tomorrow but mamma was in no humour to say much to her child on this subject at the present moment she threw herself back on her sofa in perfect silence and began to reflect whether she would like to sign her name in future as fanny lacordaire instead of fanny thompson it certainly seemed as though things were verging towards such a necessity a marchand but a marchand of what she had an instinctive feeling that the people in the hotel were talking about her and m lacordaire and was therefore more than ever averse to asking any one a question as she went up to the school the next afternoon she walked through more of the streets of le puy than was necessary and in every street she looked at the names which she saw over the doors of the more respectable houses of business but she looked in vain it might be that m lacordaire was a marchand of so specially high a quality as to be under no necessity to put up his name at all sir hommajee bommajees name did not appear over any door in bombayat least she thought not and then came the saturday morning we shall be ready at two she said as she left the breakfasttable and perhaps you would not mind calling for lilian on the way m lacordaire would be delighted to call anywhere for anybody on behalf of mrs thompson and then as he got to the door of the salon he offered her his hand he did so with so much french courtesy that she could not refuse it and then she felt that his purpose was more tender than ever it had been and why not if this was the destiny which fate had prepared for her mrs thompson would rather have got into the carriage at any other spot in le puy than at that at which she was forced to do sothe chief entrance namely of the htel des ambassadeurs and what made it worse was this that an appearance of a special fte was given to the occasion m lacordaire was dressed in more than his sunday best he had on new yellow kid gloves his coat if not new was newer than any mrs thompson had yet observed and was lined with silk up to the very collar he had on patent leather boots which glittered as mrs thompson thought much too conspicuously and as for his hat it was quite evident that it was fresh that morning from the makers block in this costume with his hat in his hand he stood under the great gateway of the hotel ready to hand mrs thompson into the carriage this would have been nothing if the landlord and landlady had not been there also as well as the mancook and the four waiters and the fille de chambre two or three other pair of eyes mrs thompson also saw as she glanced round and then mimmy walked across the yard in her best clothes with a fteday air about her for which her mother would have liked to have whipped her but what did it matter if it was written in the book that she should become madame lacordaire of course the world would know that there must have been some preparatory lovemaking let them have their laugh a good husband would not be dearly purchased at so trifling an expense and so they sallied forth with already half the ceremony of a wedding mimmy seated herself opposite to her mother and m lacordaire also sat with his back to the horses leaving the second place of honour for lilian pray make yourself comfortable m lacordaire and dont mind her said mrs thompson but he was firm in his purpose of civility perhaps making up his mind that when he should in truth stand in the place of papa to the young lady then would be his time for having the back seat in the carriage lilian also in her best frock came down the schoolsteps and three of the school teachers came with her it would have added to mrs thompsons happiness at that moment if m lacordaire would have kept his polished boots out of sight and put his yellow gloves into his pocket and then they started the road from le puy to polignac is nearly all up hill and a very steep bill it is so that there was plenty of time for conversation but the girls had it nearly all to themselves mimmy thought that she had never found m lacordaire so stupid and lilian told her sister on the first safe opportunity that occurred that it seemed very much as though they were all going to church and do any of the polignac people ever live at this place asked mrs thompson by way of making conversation in answer to which m lacordaire informed madame that the place was at present only a ruin and then there was again silence till they found themselves under the rock and were informed by the driver that the rest of the ascent must be made on foot the rock now stood abrupt and precipitous above their heads it was larger in its circumference and with much larger space on its summit than those other volcanic rocks in and close to the town but then at the same time it was higher from the ground and quite as inaccessible except by the single path which led up to the chteau m lacordaire with conspicuous gallantry first assisted mrs thompson from the carriage and then handed down the two young ladies no lady could have been so difficult to please as to complain of him and yet mrs thompson thought that he was not as agreeable as usual those horrid boots and those horrid gloves gave him such an air of holiday finery that neither could he be at his ease wearing them nor could she in seeing them worn they were soon taken in hand by the poor woman whose privilege it was to show the ruins for a little distance they walked up the path in single file not that it was too narrow to accommodate two but m lacordaires courage had not yet been screwed to a point which admitted of his offering his arm to the widow for in france it must be remembered that this means more than it does in some other countries mrs thompson felt that all this was silly and useless if they were not to be dear friends this coming out fting together those boots and gloves and new hat were all very foolish and if they were the sooner they understood each other the better so mrs thompson finding that the path was steep and the weather warm stood still for a while leaning against the wall with a look of considerable fatigue in her face will madame permit me the honour of offering her my arm said m lacordaire the road is so extraordinarily steep for madame to climb mrs thompson did permit him the honour and so they went on till they reached the top the view from the summit was both extensive and grand but neither lilian nor mimmy were much pleased with the place the elder sister who had talked over the matter with her school companions expected a fine castle with turrets battlements and romance and the other expected a pretty smiling house such as princes in her mind ought to inhabit instead of this they found an old turret with steps so broken that m lacordaire did not care to ascend them and the ruined walls of a mansion in which nothing was to be seen but the remains of an enormous kitchen chimney it was the kitchen of the family said the guide oh said mrs thompson and this said the woman taking them into the next ruined compartment was the kitchen of monsieur et madame what two kitchens exclaimed lilian upon which m lacordaire explained that the ancestors of the prince de polignac had been very great people and had therefore required culinary performances on a great scale and then the woman began to chatter something about an oracle of apollo there was she said a hole in the rock from which in past times perhaps more than a hundred years ago the oracle used to speak forth mysterious words there she said pointing to a part of the rock at some distance was the hole and if the ladies would follow her to a little outhouse which was just beyond she would show them the huge stone mouth out of which the oracle used to speak lilian and mimmy both declared at once for seeing the oracle but mrs thompson expressed her determination to remain sitting where she was upon the turf so the guide started off with the young ladies and will it be thought surprising that m lacordaire should have remained alone by the side of mrs thompson it must be now or never mrs thompson felt and as regarded m lacordaire he probably entertained some idea of the same kind mrs thompsons inclinations though they had never been very strong in the matter were certainly in favour of the now m lacordaires inclinations were stronger he had fully and firmly made up his mind in favour of matrimony but then he was not so absolutely in favour of the now mrs thompsons mind if one could have read it would have shown a great objection to shillyshallying as she was accustomed to call it but m lacordaire were it not for the danger which might thence arise would have seen no objection to some slight further procrastination his courage was beginning perhaps to ooze out from his fingers ends i declare that those girls have scampered away ever so far said mrs thompson would madame wish that i should call them back said m lacordaire innocently oh no dear children let them enjoy themselves it will be a pleasure to them to run about the rock and i suppose they will be safe with that woman oh yes quite safe said m lacordaire and then there was another little pause mrs thompson was sitting on a broken fragment of a stone just outside the entrance to the old family kitchen and m lacordaire was standing immediately before her he had in his hand a little cane with which he sometimes slapped his boots and sometimes poked about among the rubbish his hat was not quite straight on his head having a little jaunty twist to one side with reference to which bythebye mrs thompson then resolved that she would make a change should ever the gentleman become her own property he still wore his gloves and was very smart but it was clear to see that he was not at his ease i hope the heat does not incommode you he said after a few moments silence mrs thompson declared that it did not that she liked a good deal of heat and that on the whole she was very well where she was she was afraid however that she was detaining m lacordaire who might probably wish to be moving about upon the rock in answer to which m lacordaire declared that he never could be so happy anywhere as in her close vicinity you are too good to me said mrs thompson almost sighing i dont know what my stay here would have been without your great kindness it is madame that has been kind to me said m lacordaire pressing the handle of his cane against his heart there was then another pause after which mrs thompson said that that was all his french politeness that she knew that she had been very troublesome to him but that she would now soon be gone and that then in her own country she would never forget his great goodness ah madame said m lacordaire and as he said it much more was expressed in his face than in his words but then you can neither accept nor reject a gentleman by what he says in his face he blushed too up to his grizzled hair and turning round walked a step or two away from the widows seat and back again mrs thompson the while sat quite still the displaced fragment lying as it did near a corner of the building made not an uncomfortable chair she had only to be careful that she did not injure her hat or crush her clothes and throw in a word here and there to assist the gentleman should occasion permit it madame said m lacordaire on his return from a second little walk monsieur replied mrs thompson perceiving that m lacordaire paused in his speech madame he began again and then as he again paused mrs thompson looked up to him very sweetly madame what i am going to say will i am afraid seem to evince by far too great audacity on my part mrs thompson may perhaps have thought that at the present moment audacity was not his fault she replied however that she was quite sure that monsieur would say nothing that was in any way unbecoming either for him to speak or for her to hear madame may i have ground to hope that such may be your sentiments after i have spoken madameand now he went down absolutely on his knees on the hard stones and mrs thompson looking about into the distance almost thought that she saw the top of the guides capmadame i have looked forward to this opportunity as one in which i may declare for you the greatest passion that i have ever yet felt madame with all my heart and soul i love you madame i offer to you the homage of my heart my hand the happiness of my life and all that i possess in this world and then taking her hand gracefully between his gloves he pressed his lips against the tips of her fingers if the thing was to be done this way of doing it was perhaps as good as any other it was one at any rate which left no doubt whatever as to the gentlemans intentions mrs thompson could she have had her own way would not have allowed her lover of fifty to go down upon his knees and would have spared him much of the romance of his declaration so also would she have spared him his yellow gloves and his polished boots but these were a part of the necessity of the situation and therefore she wisely took them as matters to be passed over with indifference seeing however that m lacordaire still remained on his knees it was necessary that she should take some step toward raising him especially as her two children and the guide would infallibly he upon them before long m lacordaire she said you surprise me greatly but pray get up but will madame vouchsafe to give me some small ground for hope the girls will be here directly m lacordaire pray get up i can talk to you much better if you will stand up or sit down on one of these stones m lacordaire did as he was bid he got up wiped the knees of his pantaloons with his handkerchief sat down beside her and then pressed the handle of his cane to his heart you really have so surprised me that i hardly know how to answer you said mrs thompson indeed i cannot bring myself to imagine that you are in earnest ah madame do not be so cruel how can i have lived with you so long sat beside you for so many days without having received your image into my heart i am in earnest alas i fear too much in earnest and then he looked at her with all his eyes and sighed with all his strength mrs thompsons prudence told her that it would be well to settle the matter in one way or the other as soon as possible long periods of lovemaking were fit for younger people than herself and her future possible husband her object would be to make him comfortable if she could and that he should do the same for her if that also were possible as for lookings and sighings and pressings of the hand she had gone through all that some twenty years since in india when thompson had been young and she was still in her teens but m lacordaire there are so many things to be considered there i hear the children coming let us walk this way for a minute and they turned behind a wall which placed them out of sight and walked on a few paces till they reached a parapet which stood on the uttermost edge of the high rock leaning upon this they continued their conversation there are so many things to be considered said mrs thompson again yes of course said m lacordaire but my one great consideration is thisthat i love madame to distraction i am very much flattered of course any lady would so feel but m lacordaire madame i am all attention but if you would deign to make me happy say that one word i love you m lacordaire as he uttered these words did not look as the saying is at his best but mrs thompson forgave him she knew that elderly gentlemen under such circumstances do not look at their best but if i consented tototo such an arrangement i could only do so on seeing that it would be beneficialor at any rate not injuriousto my children and that it would offer to ourselves a fair promise of future happiness ah madame it would be the dearest wish of my heart to be a second father to those two young ladies except indeed and then m lacordaire stopped the flow of his speech in such matters it is so much the best to be explicit at once said mrs thompson oh yes certainly nothing can be more wise that madame and the happiness of a household depends so much on money madame let me say a word or two monsieur lacordaire i have enough for myself and my children and should i every marry again i should not i hope be felt as a burden by my husband but it would of course be my duty to know what were his circumstances before i accepted him of yourself personally i have seen nothing that i do not like oh madame but as yet i know nothing of your circumstances m lacordaire perhaps did feel that mrs thompsons prudence was of a strong masculine description but he hardly liked her the less on this account to give him his due he was not desirous of marrying her solely for her moneys sake he also wished for a comfortable home and proposed to give as much as he got only he had been anxious to wrap up the solid cake of this business in a casing of sugar of romance mrs thompson would not have the sugar but the cake might not be the worse on that account no madame not as yet but they shall all be made open and at your disposal said m lacordaire and mrs thompson bowed approvingly i am in business continued m lacordaire and my business gives me eight thousand francs a year four times eight are thirtytwo said mrs thompson to herself putting the francs into pounds sterling in the manner that she had always found to be the readiest well so far the statement was satisfactory an income of three hundred and twenty pounds a year from business joined to her own might do very well she did not in the least suspect m lacordaire of being false and so far the matter sounded well and what is the business she asked in a tone of voice intended to be indifferent but which nevertheless showed that she listened anxiously for an answer to her question they were both standing with their arms upon the wall looking down upon the town of le puy but they had so stood that each could see the others countenance as they talked mrs thompson could now perceive that m lacordaire became red in the face as he paused before answering her she was near to him and seeing his emotion gently touched his arm with her hand this she did to reassure him for she saw that he was ashamed of having to declare that he was a tradesman as for herself she had made up her mind to bear with this if she found as she felt sure she would find that the trade was one which would not degrade either him or her hitherto indeedin her early daysshe had looked down on trade but of what benefit had her grand ideas been to her when she had returned to england she had tried her hand at english genteel society and no one had seemed to care for her therefore she touched his arm lightly with her fingers that she might encourage him he paused for a moment as i have said and became red and then feeling that he had shown some symptoms of shameand feeling also probably that it was unmanly in him to do so he shook himself slightly raised his head up somewhat more proudly than was his wont looked her full in the face with more strength of character than she had yet seen him assume and then declared his business madame he said in a very audible but not in a loud voice madameje suis tailleur and having so spoken he turned slightly from her and looked down over the valley towards le puy there was nothing more said upon the subject as they drove down from the rock of polignac back to the town immediately on receiving the announcement mrs thompson found that she had no answer to make she withdrew her handand felt at once that she had received a blow it was not that she was angry with m lacordaire for being a tailor nor was she angry with him in that being a tailor he had so addressed her but she was surprised disappointed and altogether put beyond her ease she had at any rate not expected this she had dreamed of his being a banker thought that perhaps he might have been a wine merchant but her idea had never gone below a jeweller or watchmaker when those words broke upon her ear madame je suis tailleur she had felt herself to be speechless but the words had not been a minute spoken when lilian and mimmy ran up to their mother oh mamma said lilian we thought you were lost we have searched for you all over the chteau we have been sitting very quietly here my dear looking at the view said mrs thompson but mamma i do wish youd see the mouth of the oracle it is so large and so round and so ugly i put my arm into it all the way said mimmy but at the present moment her mamma felt no interest in the mouth of the oracle and so they all walked down together to the carriage and though the way was steep mrs thompson managed to pick her steps without the assistance of an arm nor did m lacordaire presume to offer it the drive back to town was very silent mrs thompson did make one or two attempts at conversation but they were not effectual m lacordaire could not speak at his ease till this matter was settled and he already had begun to perceive that his business was against him why is it that the trade of a tailor should be less honourable than that of a haberdasher or even a grocer they sat next each other at dinner as usual and here as all eyes were upon them they both made a great struggle to behave in their accustomed way but even in this they failed all the world of the htel des ambassadeurs knew that m lacordaire had gone forth to make an offer to mrs thompson and all that world therefore was full of speculation but all the world could make nothing of it m lacordaire did look like a rejected man but mrs thompson did not look like the woman who had rejected him that the offer had been madein that everybody agreed from the senior habitu of the house who always sat at the head of the table down to the junior assistant garon but as to reading the riddle there was no accord among them when the dessert was done mrs thompson as usual withdrew and m lacordaire as usual bowed as he stood behind his own chair he did not however attempt to follow her but when she reached the door she called him he was at her side in a moment and then she whispered in his ear and i alsoi will be of the same business when m lacordaire regained the table the senior habitu the junior garon and all the intermediate ranks of men at the htel des ambassadeurs knew that they might congratulate him mrs thompson had made a great struggle but speaking for myself i am inclined to think that she arrived at last at a wise decision aaron trow i would wish to declare at the beginning of this story that i shall never regard that cluster of islets which we call bermuda as the fortunate islands of the ancients do not let professional geographers take me up and say that no one has so accounted them and that the ancients have never been supposed to have gotten themselves so far westwards what i mean to assert is thisthat had any ancient been carried thither by enterprise or stress of weather he would not have given those islands so good a name that the neapolitan sailors of king alonzo should have been wrecked here i consider to be more likely the vexed bermoothes is a good name for them there is no getting in or out of them without the greatest difficulty and a patient slow navigation which is very heartrending that caliban should have lived here i can imagine that ariel would have been sick of the place is certain and that governor prospero should have been willing to abandon his governorship i conceive to have been only natural when one regards the present state of the place one is tempted to doubt whether any of the governors have been conjurors since his days bermuda as all the world knows is a british colony at which we maintain a convict establishment most of our outlying convict establishments have been sent back upon our hands from our colonies but here one is still maintained there is also in the islands a strong military fortress though not a fortress looking magnificent to the eyes of civilians as do malta and gibraltar there are also here some six thousand white people and some six thousand black people eating drinking sleeping and dying the convict establishment is the most notable feature of bermuda to a stranger but it does not seem to attract much attention from the regular inhabitants of the place there is no intercourse between the prisoners and the bermudians the convicts are rarely seen by them and the convict islands are rarely visited as to the prisoners themselves of course it is not open to themor should not be open to themto have intercourse with any but the prison authorities there have however been instances in which convicts have escaped from their confinement and made their way out among the islands poor wretches as a rule there is but little chance for any that can so escape the whole length of the cluster is but twenty miles and the breadth is under four the prisoners are of course white men and the lower orders of bermuda among whom alone could a runagate have any chance of hiding himself are all negroes so that such a one would be known at once their clothes are all marked their only chance of a permanent escape would be in the hold of an american ship but what captain of an american or other ship would willingly encumber himself with an escaped convict but nevertheless men have escaped and in one instance i believe a convict got away so that of him no further tidings were ever heard for the truth of the following tale i will not by any means vouch if one were to inquire on the spot one might probably find that the ladies all believe it and the old men that all the young men know exactly how much of it is false and how much true and that the steady middleaged welltodo islanders are quite convinced that it is romance from beginning to end my readers may range themselves with the ladies the young men or the steady welltodo middleaged islanders as they please some years ago soon after the prison was first established on its present footing three men did escape from it and among them a certain notorious prisoner named aaron trow trows antecedents in england had not been so villanously bad as those of many of his fellowconvicts though the one offence for which he was punished had been of a deep dye he had shed mans blood at a period of great distress in a manufacturing town he had led men on to riot and with his own hand had slain the first constable who had endeavoured to do his duty against him there had been courage in the doing of the deed and probably no malice but the deed let its moral blackness have been what it might had sent him to bermuda with a sentence against him of penal servitude for life had he been then amenable to prison disciplineeven then with such a sentence against him as thathe might have won his way back after the lapse of years to the children and perhaps to the wife that he had left behind him but he was amenable to no rulesto no discipline his heart was sore to death with an idea of injury and he lashed himself against the bars of his cage with a feeling that it would be well if he could so lash himself till he might perish in his fury and then a day came in which an attempt was made by a large body of convicts under his leadership to get the better of the officers of the prison it is hardly necessary to say that the attempt failed such attempts always fail it failed on this occasion signally and trow with two other men were condemned to be scourged terribly and then kept in solitary confinement for some lengthened term of months before however the day of scourging came trow and his two associates had escaped i have not the space to tell how this was effected nor the power to describe the manner they did escape from the establishment into the islands and though two of them were taken after a single days run at liberty aaron trow had not been yet retaken even when a week was over when a month was over he had not been retaken and the officers of the prison began to say that he had got away from them in a vessel to the states it was impossible they said that he should have remained in the islands and not been discovered it was not impossible that he might have destroyed himself leaving his body where it had not yet been found but he could not have lived on in bermuda during that months search so at least said the officers of the prison there was however a report through the islands that he had been seen from time to time that he had gotten bread from the negroes at night threatening them with death if they told of his whereabouts and that all the clothes of the mate of a vessel had been stolen while the man was bathing including a suit of dark blue cloth in which suit of clothes or in one of such a nature a stranger had been seen skulking about the rocks near st george all this the governor of the prison affected to disbelieve but the opinion was becoming very rife in the islands that aaron trow was still there a vigilant search however is a task of great labour and cannot be kept up for ever by degrees it was relaxed the warders and gaolers ceased to patrol the island roads by night and it was agreed that aaron trow was gone or that he would be starved to death or that he would in time be driven to leave such traces of his whereabouts as must lead to his discovery and this at last did turn out to be the fact there is a sort of prettiness about these islands which though it never rises to the loveliness of romantic scenery is nevertheless attractive in its way the land breaks itself into little knolls and the sea runs up hither and thither in a thousand creeks and inlets and then too when the oleanders are in bloom they give a wonderfully bright colour to the landscape oleanders seem to be the roses of bermuda and are cultivated round all the villages of the better class through the islands there are two towns st george and hamilton and one main highroad which connects them but even this highroad is broken by a ferry over which every vehicle going from st george to hamilton must be conveyed most of the locomotion in these parts is done by boats and the residents look to the sea with its narrow creeks as their best highway from their farms to their best market in those daysand those days were not very long sincethe building of small ships was their chief trade and they valued their land mostly for the small scrubby cedartrees with which this trade was carried on as one goes from st george to hamilton the road runs between two seas that to the right is the ocean that on the left is an inland creek which runs up through a large portion of the islands so that the land on the other side of it is near to the traveller for a considerable portion of the way there are no houses lying near the road and there is one residence some way from the road so secluded that no other house lies within a mile of it by land by water it might probably be reached within half a mile this place was called crump island and here lived and had lived for many years an old gentleman a native of bermuda whose business it had been to buy up cedar wood and sell it to the shipbuilders at hamilton in our story we shall not have very much to do with old mr bergen but it will be necessary to say a word or two about his house it stood upon what would have been an island in the creek had not a narrow causeway barely broad enough for a road joined it to that larger island on which stands the town of st george as the main road approaches the ferry it runs through some rough hilly open ground which on the right side towards the ocean has never been cultivated the distance from the ocean here may perhaps be a quarter of a mile and the ground is for the most part covered with low furze on the left of the road the land is cultivated in patches and here some half mile or more from the ferry a path turns away to crump island the house cannot be seen from the road and indeed can hardly be seen at all except from the sea it lies perhaps three furlongs from the high road and the path to it is but little used as the passage to and from it is chiefly made by water here at the time of our story lived mr bergen and here lived mr bergens daughter miss bergen was well known at st georges as a steady good girl who spent her time in looking after her fathers household matters in managing his two black maidservants and the black gardener and who did her duty in that sphere of life to which she had been called she was a comely wellshaped young woman with a sweet countenance rather large in size and very quiet in demeanour in her earlier years when young girls usually first bud forth into womanly beauty the neighbours had not thought much of anastasia bergen nor had the young men of st george been wont to stay their boats under the window of crump cottage in order that they might listen to her voice or feel the light of her eye but slowly as years went by anastasia bergen became a woman that a man might well love and a man learned to love her who was well worthy of a womans heart this was caleb morton the presbyterian minister of st george and caleb morton had been engaged to marry miss bergen for the last two years past at the period of aaron trows escape from prison caleb morton was not a native of bermuda but had been sent thither by the synod of his church from nova scotia he was a tall handsome man at this time of some thirty years of age of a presence which might almost have been called commanding he was very strong but of a temperament which did not often give him opportunity to put forth his strength and his life had been such that neither he nor others knew of what nature might be his courage the greater part of his life was spent in preaching to some few of the white people around him and in teaching as many of the blacks as he could get to hear him his days were very quiet and had been altogether without excitement until he had met with anastasia bergen it will suffice for us to say that he did meet her and that now for two years past they had been engaged as man and wife old mr bergen when he heard of the engagement was not well pleased at the information in the first place his daughter was very necessary to him and the idea of her marrying and going away had hardly as yet occurred to him and then he was by no means inclined to part with any of his money it must not be presumed that he had amassed a fortune by his trade in cedar wood few tradesmen in bermuda do as i imagine amass fortunes of some few hundred pounds he was possessed and these in the course of nature would go to his daughter when he died but he had no inclination to hand any portion of them over to his daughter before they did go to her in the course of nature now the income which caleb morton earned as a presbyterian clergyman was not large and therefore no day had been fixed as yet for his marriage with anastasia but though the old man had been from the first averse to the match his hostility had not been active he had not forbidden mr morton his house or affected to be in any degree angry because his daughter had a lover he had merely grumbled forth an intimation that those who marry in haste repent at leisurethat love kept nobody warm if the pot did not boil and that as for him it was as much as he could do to keep his own pot boiling at crump cottage in answer to this anastasia said nothing she asked him for no money but still kept his accounts managed his household and looked patiently forward for better days old mr bergen himself spent much of his time at hamilton where he had a woodyard with a couple of rooms attached to it it was his custom to remain here three nights of the week during which anastasia was left alone at the cottage and it happened by no means seldom that she was altogether alone for the negro whom they called the gardener would go to her fathers place at hamilton and the two black girls would crawl away up to the road tired with the monotony of the sea at the cottage caleb had more than once told her that she was too much alone but she had laughed at him saying that solitude in bermuda was not dangerous nor indeed was it for the people are quiet and wellmannered lacking much energy but being in the same degree free from any propensity to violence so you are going she said to her lover one evening as he rose from the chair on which he had been swinging himself at the door of the cottage which looks down over the creek of the sea he had sat there for an hour talking to her as she worked or watching her as she moved about the place it was a beautiful evening and the sun had been falling to rest with almost tropical glory before his feet the bright oleanders were red with their blossoms all around him and he had thoroughly enjoyed his hour of easy rest so you are going she said to him not putting her work out of her hand as he rose to depart yes and it is time for me to go i have still work to do before i can get to bed ah well i suppose the day will come at last when i need not leave you as soon as my hour of rest is over come of course it will come that is if your reverence should choose to wait for it another ten years or so i believe you would not mind waiting twenty years not if a certain friend of mine would come down and see me of evenings when im alone after the day it seems to me that i shouldnt mind waiting as long as i had that to look for you are right not to be impatient he said to her after a pause as he held her hand before he went quite right i only wish i could school myself to be as easy about it i did not say i was easy said anastasia people are seldom easy in this world i take it i said i could be patient do not look in that way as though you pretended that you were dissatisfied with me you know that i am true to you and you ought to be very proud of me i am proud of you anastasia on hearing which she got up and courtesied to him i am proud of you so proud of you that i feel you should not be left here all alone with no one to help you if you were in trouble women dont get into trouble as men do and do not want any one to help them if you were alone in the house you would have to go to bed without your supper because you could not make a basin of boiled milk ready for your own meal now when your reverence has gone i shall go to work and have my tea comfortably and then he did go bidding god bless her as he left her three hours after that he was disturbed in his own lodgings by one of the negro girls from the cottage rushing to his door and begging him in heavens name to come down to the assistance of her mistress when morton left her anastasia did not proceed to do as she had said and seemed to have forgotten her evening meal she had been working sedulously with her needle during all that last conversation but when her lover was gone she allowed the work to fall from her hands and sat motionless for awhile gazing at the last streak of colour left by the setting sun but there was no longer a sign of its glory to be traced in the heavens around her the twilight in bermuda is not long and enduring as it is with us though the daylight does not depart suddenly leaving the darkness of night behind it without any intermediate time of warning as is the case farther south down among the islands of the tropics but the soft sweet light of the evening had waned and gone and night had absolutely come upon her while anastasia was still seated before the cottage with her eyes fixed upon the white streak of motionless sea which was still visible through the gloom she was thinking of him of his ways of life of his happiness and of her duty towards him she had told him with her pretty feminine falseness that she could wait without impatience but now she said to herself that it would not be good for him to wait longer he lived alone and without comfort working very hard for his poor pittance and she could see and feel and understand that a companion in his life was to him almost a necessity she would tell her father that all this must be brought to an end she would not ask him for money but she would make him understand that her services must at any rate in part be transferred why should not she and morton still live at the cottage when they were married and so thinking and at last resolving she sat there till the dark night fell upon her she was at last disturbed by feeling a mans hand upon her shoulder she jumped from her chair and faced himnot screaming for it was especially within her power to control herself and to make no utterance except with forethought perhaps it might have been better for her had she screamed and sent a shrill shriek down the shore of that inland sea she was silent however and with awestruck face and outstretched hands gazed into the face of him who still held her by the shoulder the night was dark but her eyes were now accustomed to the darkness and she could see indistinctly something of his features he was a lowsized man dressed in a suit of sailors blue clothing with a rough cap of hair on his head and a beard that had not been clipped for many weeks his eyes were large and hollow and frightfully bright so that she seemed to see nothing else of him but she felt the strength of his fingers as he grasped her tighter and more tightly by the arm who are you she said after a moments pause do you know me he asked know you no but the words were hardly out of her mouth before it struck her that the man was aaron trow of whom every one in bermuda had been talking come into the house he said and give me food and he still held her with his hand as though he would compel her to follow him she stood for a moment thinking what she would say to him for even then with that terrible man standing close to her in the darkness her presence of mind did not desert her surely she said i will give you food if you are hungry but take your hand from me no man would lay his hands on a woman a woman said the stranger what does the starved wolf care for that a womans blood is as sweet to him as that of a man come into the house i tell you and then she preceded him through the open door into the narrow passage and thence to the kitchen there she saw that the back door leading out on the other side of the house was open and she knew that he had come down from the road and entered on that side she threw her eyes around looking for the negro girls but they were away and she remembered that there was no human being within sound of her voice but this man who had told her that he was as a wolf thirsty after her blood give me food at once he said and will you go if i give it you she asked i will knock out your brains if you do not he replied lifting from the grate a short thick poker which lay there do as i bid you at once you also would be like a tiger if you had fasted for two days as i have done she could see as she moved across the kitchen that he had already searched there for something that he might eat but that he had searched in vain with the close economy common among his class in the islands all comestibles were kept under close lock and key in the house of mr bergen their daily allowance was given day by day to the negro servants and even the fragments were then gathered up and locked away in safety she moved across the kitchen to the accustomed cupboard taking the keys from her pocket and he followed close upon her there was a small oil lamp hanging from the low ceiling which just gave them light to see each other she lifted her hand to this to take it from its hook but he prevented her no by heaven he said you dont touch that till ive done with it theres light enough for you to drag out your scraps she did drag out her scraps and a bowl of milk which might hold perhaps a quart there was a fragment of bread a morsel of cold potatocake and the bone of a leg of kid and is that all said he but as he spoke he fleshed his teeth against the bone as a dog would have done it is the best i have she said i wish it were better and you should have had it without violence as you have suffered so long from hunger bah better yes you would give the best no doubt and set the hell hounds on my track the moment i am gone i know how much i might expect from your charity i would have fed you for pitys sake she answered pity who are you that you should dare to pity me by my young woman it is i that pity you i must cut your throat unless you give me money do you know that money i have got no money ill make you have some before i go come dont move till i have done and as he spoke to her he went on tugging at the bone and swallowing the lumps of stale bread he had already finished the bowl of milk and now said he tell me who i am i suppose you are aaron trow she answered very slowly he said nothing on hearing this but continued his meal standing close to her so that she might not possibly escape from him out into the darkness twice or thrice in those few minutes she made up her mind to make such an attempt feeling that it would be better to leave him in possession of the house and make sure if possible of her own life there was no money there not a dollar what money her father kept in his possession was locked up in his safe at hamilton and might he not keep to his threat and murder her when he found that she could give him nothing she did not tremble outwardly as she stood there watching him as he ate but she thought how probable it might be that her last moments were very near and yet she could scrutinise his features form and garments so as to carry away in her mind a perfect picture of them aaron trowfor of course it was the escaped convictwas not a man of frightful hideous aspect had the world used him well giving him when he was young ample wages and separating him from turbulent spirits he also might have used the world well and then women would have praised the brightness of his eye and the manly vigour of his brow but things had not gone well with him he had been separated from the wife he had loved and the children who had been raised at his kneeseparated by his own violence and now as he had said of himself he was a wolf rather than a man as he stood there satisfying the craving of his appetite breaking up the large morsels of food he was an object very sad to be seen hunger had made him gaunt and yellow he was squalid with the dirt of his hidden lair and he had the look of a beastthat look to which men fall when they live like the brutes of prey as outcasts from their brethren but still there was that about his brow which might have redeemed himwhich might have turned her horror into pity had he been willing that it should be so and now give me some brandy he said there was brandy in the housein the sittingroom which was close at their hand and the key of the little press which held it was in her pocket it was useless she thought to refuse him and so she told him that there was a bottle partly full but that she must go to the next room to fetch it him well go together my darling he said theres nothing like good company and he again put his hand upon her arm as they passed into the family sittingroom i must take the light she said but he unhooked it himself and carried it in his own hand again she went to work without trembling she found the key of the side cupboard and unlocking the door handed him a bottle which might contain about halfapint of spirits and is that all he said there is a full bottle here she answered handing him another but if you drink it you will be drunk and they will catch you by heavens yes and you would be the first to help them would you not look here she answered if you will go now i will not say a word to any one of your coming nor set them on your track to follow you there take the full bottle with you if you will go you shall be safe from me what and go without money i have none to give you you may believe me when i say so i have not a dollar in the house before he spoke again he raised the half empty bottle to his mouth and drank as long as there was a drop to drink there said he putting the bottle down i am better after that as to the other you are right and i will take it with me and now young woman about the money i tell you that i have not a dollar look here said he and he spoke now in a softer voice as though he would be on friendly terms with her give me ten sovereigns and i will go i know you have it and with ten sovereigns it is possible that i may save my life you are good and would not wish that a man should die so horrid a death i know you are good come give me the money and he put his hands up beseeching her and looked into her face with imploring eyes on the word of a christian woman i have not got money to give you she replied nonsense and as he spoke he took her by the arm and shook her he shook her violently so that he hurt her and her breath for a moment was all but gone from her i tell you you must make dollars before i leave you or i will so handle you that it would have been better for you to coin your very blood may god help me at my need she said as i have not above a few penny pieces in the house and you expect me to believe that look here i will shake the teeth out of your head but i will have it from you and he did shake her again using both his hands and striking her against the wall would youmurder me she said hardly able now to utter the words murder you yes why not i cannot be worse than i am were i to murder you ten times over but with money i may possibly be better i have it not then i will do worse than murder you i will make you such an object that all the world shall loathe to look on you and so saying he took her by the arm and dragged her forth from the wall against which she had stood then there came from her a shriek that was heard far down the shore of that silent sea and away across to the solitary houses of those living on the other sidea shriek very sad sharp and prolongedwhich told plainly to those who heard it of womans woe when in her extremest peril that sound was spoken of in bermuda for many a day after that as something which had been terrible to hear but then at that moment as it came wailing through the dark it sounded as though it were not human of those who heard it not one guessed from whence it came nor was the hand of any brother put forward to help that woman at her need did you hear that said the young wife to her husband from the far side of the arm of the sea hear it oh heaven yes whence did it come the young wife could not say from whence it came but clung close to her husbands breast comforting herself with the knowledge that that terrible sorrow was not hers but aid did come at last or rather that which seemed as aid long and terrible was the fight between that human beast of prey and the poor victim which had fallen into his talons anastasia bergen was a strong wellbuilt woman and now that the time had come to her when a struggle was necessary a struggle for life for honour for the happiness of him who was more to her than herself she fought like a tigress attacked in her own lair at such a moment as this she also could become wild and savage as the beast of the forest when he pinioned her arms with one of his as he pressed her down upon the floor she caught the first joint of the forefinger of his other hand between her teeth till he yelled in agony and another sound was heard across the silent water and then when one hand was loosed in the struggle she twisted it through his long hair and dragged back his head till his eyes were nearly starting from their sockets anastasia bergen had hitherto been a sheer woman all feminine in her nature but now the foam came to her mouth and fire sprang from her eyes and the muscles of her body worked as though she had been trained to deeds of violence of violence aaron trow had known much in his rough life but never had he combated with harder antagonist than her whom he now held beneath his breast by i will put an end to you he exclaimed in his wrath as he struck her violently across the face with his elbow his hand was occupied and he could not use it for a blow but nevertheless the violence was so great that the blood gushed from her nostrils while the back of her head was driven with violence against the floor but she did not lose her hold of him her hand was still twined closely through his thick hair and in every move he made she clung to him with all her might leave go my hair he shouted at her but she still kept her hold though he again dashed her head against the floor there was still light in the room for when he first grasped her with both his hands he had put the lamp down on a small table now they were rolling on the floor together and twice he had essayed to kneel on her that he might thus crush the breath from her body and deprive her altogether of her strength but she had been too active for him moving herself along the ground though in doing so she dragged him with her but by degrees he got one hand at liberty and with that he pulled a clasp knife out of his pocket and opened it i will cut your head off if you do not let go my hair he said but still she held fast by him he then stabbed at her arm using his left hand and making short ineffectual blows her dress partly saved her and partly also the continual movement of all her limbs but nevertheless the knife wounded her it wounded her in several places about the arm covering them both with bloodbut still she hung on so close was her grasp in her agony that as she afterwards found she cut the skin of her own hands with her own nails had the mans hair been less thick or strong or her own tenacity less steadfast he would have murdered her before any interruption could have saved her and yet he had not purposed to murder her or even in the first instance to inflict on her any bodily harm but he had been determined to get money with such a sum of money as he had named it might he thought be possible for him to win his way across to america he might bribe men to hide him in the hold of a ship and thus there might be for him at any rate a possibility of escape that there must be money in the house he had still thought when first he laid hands on the poor woman and then when the struggle had once begun when he had felt her muscles contending with his the passion of the beast was aroused within him and he strove against her as he would have striven against a dog but yet when the knife was in his hand he had not driven it against her heart then suddenly while they were yet rolling on the floor there was a sound of footsteps in the passage aaron trow instantly leaped to his feet leaving his victim on the ground with huge lumps of his thick clotted hair in her hand thus and thus only could he have liberated himself from her grasp he rushed at the door and there he came against the two negro servantgirls who had returned down to their kitchen from the road on which they had been straying trow as he half saw them in the dark not knowing how many there might be or whether there was a man among them rushed through them upsetting one scared girl in his passage with the instinct and with the timidity of a beast his impulse now was to escape and he hurried away back to the road and to his lair leaving the three women together in the cottage poor wretch as he crossed the road not skulking in his impotent haste but running at his best another pair of eyes saw him and when the search became hot after him it was known that his hidingplace was not distant it was some time before any of the women were able to act and when some step was taken anastasia was the first to take it she had not absolutely swooned but the reaction after the violence of her efforts was so great that for some minutes she had been unable to speak she had risen from the floor when trow left her and had even followed him to the door but since that she had fallen back into her fathers old armchair and there sat gasping not only for words but for breath also at last she bade one of the girls to run into st george and beg mr morton to come to her aid the girl would not stir without her companion and even then anastasia covered as she was with blood with dishevelled hair and her clothes half torn from her body accompanied them as far as the road there they found a negro lad still hanging about the place and he told them that he had seen the man cross the road and run down over the open ground towards the rocks of the seacoast he must be there said the lad pointing in the direction of a corner of the rocks unless he swim across the mouth of the ferry but the mouth of that ferry is an arm of the sea and it was not probable that a man would do that when he might have taken the narrow water by keeping on the other side of the road at about one that night caleb morton reached the cottage breathless with running and before a word was spoken between them anastasia had fallen on his shoulder and had fainted as soon as she was in the arms of her lover all her power had gone from her the spirit and passion of the tiger had gone and she was again a weak woman shuddering at the thought of what she had suffered she remembered that she had had the mans hand between her teeth and by degrees she found his hair still clinging to her fingers but even then she could hardly call to mind the nature of the struggle she had undergone his hot breath close to her own cheek she did remember and his glaring eyes and even the roughness of his beard as he pressed his face against her own but she could not say whence had come the blood nor till her arm became stiff and motionless did she know that she had been wounded it was all joy with her now as she sat motionless without speaking while he administered to her wants and spoke words of love into her ears she remembered the mans horrid threat and knew that by gods mercy she had been saved and he was there caressing her loving her comforting her as she thought of the fate that had threatened her of the evil that had been so imminent she fell forward on her knees and with incoherent sobs uttered her thanksgivings while her head was still supported on his arms it was almost morning before she could induce herself to leave him and lie down with him she seemed to be so perfectly safe but the moment he was away she could see aaron trows eyes gleaming at her across the room at last however she slept and when he saw that she was at rest he told himself that his work must then begin hitherto caleb morton had lived in all respects the life of a man of peace but now asking himself no questions as to the propriety of what he would do using no inward arguments as to this or that line of conduct he girded the sword on his loins and prepared himself for war the wretch who had thus treated the woman whom he loved should be hunted down like a wild beast as long as he had arms and legs with which to carry on the hunt he would pursue the miscreant with any weapons that might come to his hands and might heaven help him at his need as he dealt forth punishment to that man if he caught him within his grasp those who had hitherto known morton in the island could not recognise the man as he came forth on that day thirsty after blood and desirous to thrust himself into personal conflict with the wild ruffian who had injured him the meek presbyterian minister had been a preacher preaching ways of peace and living in accordance with his own doctrines the world had been very quiet for him and he had walked quietly in his appointed path but now the world was quiet no longer nor was there any preaching of peace his cry was for blood for the blood of the untamed savage brute who had come upon his young doe in her solitude and striven with such brutal violence to tear her heart from her bosom he got to his assistance early in the morning some of the constables from st george and before the day was over he was joined by two or three of the warders from the convict establishment there was with him also a friend or two and thus a party was formed numbering together ten or twelve persons they were of course all armed and therefore it might be thought that there would be but small chance for the wretched man if they should come upon his track at first they all searched together thinking from the tidings which had reached them that he must be near to them but gradually they spread themselves along the rocks between st george and the ferry keeping watchmen on the road so that he should not escape unnoticed into the island ten times during the day did anastasia send from the cottage up to morton begging him to leave the search to others and come down to her but not for a moment would he lose the scent of his prey what should it be said that she had been so treated and that others had avenged her he sent back to say that her father was with her now and that he would come when his work was over and in that job of work the lifeblood of aaron trow was counted up towards evening they were all congregated on the road near to the spot at which the path turns off towards the cottage when a voice was heard hallooing to them from the summit of a little hill which lies between the road and the sea on the side towards the ferry and presently a boy came running down to them full of news danny lund has seen him said the boy he has seen him plainly in among the rocks and then came danny lund himself a small negro lad about fourteen years of age who was known in those parts as the idlest most dishonest and most useless of his race on this occasion however danny lund became important and every one listened to him he had seen he said a pair of eyes moving down in a cave of the rocks which he well knew he had been in the cave often he said and could get there again but not now not while that pair of eyes was moving at the bottom of it and so they all went up over the hill morton leading the way with hot haste in his waistband he held a pistol and his hand grasped a short iron bar with which he had armed himself they ascended the top of the hill and when there the open sea was before them on two sides and on the third was the narrow creek over which the ferry passed immediately beneath their feet were the broken rocks for on that side towards the sea the earth and grass of the hill descended but a little way towards the water down among the rocks they all went silently caleb morton leading the way and danny lund directing him from behind mr morton said an elderly man from st george had you not better let the warders of the gaol go first he is a desperate man and they will best understand his ways in answer to this morton said nothing but he would let no one put a foot before him he still pressed forward among the rocks and at last came to a spot from whence he might have sprung at one leap into the ocean it was a broken cranny on the seashore into which the sea beat and surrounded on every side but the one by huge broken fragments of stone which at first sight seemed as though they would have admitted of a path down among them to the waters edge but which when scanned more closely were seen to be so large in size that no man could climb from one to another it was a singularly romantic spot but now well known to them all there for they had visited it over and over again that morning in there said danny lund keeping well behind mortons body and pointing at the same time to a cavern high up among the rocks but quite on the opposite side of the little inlet of the sea the mouth of the cavern was not twenty yards from where they stood but at the first sight it seemed as though it must be impossible to reach it the precipice on the brink of which they all now stood ran down sheer into the sea and the fall from the mouth of the cavern on the other side was as steep but danny solved the mystery by pointing upwards and showing them how he had been used to climb to a projecting rock over their heads and from thence creep round by certain vantages of the stone till he was able to let himself down into the aperture but now at the present moment he was unwilling to make essay of his prowess as a cragsman he had he said been up on that projecting rock thrice and there had seen the eyes moving in the cavern he was quite sure of that fact of the pair of eyes and declined to ascend the rock again traces soon became visible to them by which they knew that some one had passed in and out of the cavern recently the stone when examined bore those marks of friction which passage and repassage over it will always give at the spot from whence the climber left the platform and commenced his ascent the side of the stone had been rubbed by the close friction of a mans body a light boy like danny lund might find his way in and out without leaving such marks behind him but no heavy man could do so thus before long they all were satisfied that aaron trow was in the cavern before them then there was a long consultation as to what they would do to carry on the hunt and how they would drive the tiger from his lair that he should not again come out except to fall into their hands was to all of them a matter of course they would keep watch and ward there though it might be for days and nights but that was a process which did not satisfy morton and did not indeed well satisfy any of them it was not only that they desired to inflict punishment on the miscreant in accordance with the law but also that they did not desire that the miserable man should die in a hole like a starved dog and that then they should go after him to take out his wretched skeleton there was something in that idea so horrid in every way that all agreed that active steps must be taken the warders of the prison felt that they would all be disgraced if they could not take their prisoner alive yet who would get round that perilous ledge in the face of such an adversary a touch to any man while climbing there would send him headlong down among the waves and then his fancy told to each what might be the nature of an embrace with such an animal as that driven to despair hopeless of life armed as they knew at any rate with a knife if the first adventurous spirit should succeed in crawling round that ledge what would be the reception which he might expect in the terrible depth of that cavern they called to their prisoner bidding him come out and telling him that they would fire in upon him if he did not show himself but not a sound was heard it was indeed possible that they should send their bullets to perhaps every corner of the cavern and if so in that way they might slaughter him but even of this they were not sure who could tell that there might not be some protected nook in which he could lay secure and who could tell when the man was struck or whether he were wounded i will get to him said morton speaking with a low dogged voice and so saying he clambered up to the rock to which danny lund had pointed many voices at once attempted to restrain him and one or two put their hands upon him to keep him back but he was too quick for them and now stood upon the ledge of rock can you see him they asked below i can see nothing within the cavern said morton look down very hard massa said danny very hard indeed down in deep dark hole and then see him big eyes moving morton now crept along the ledge or rather he was beginning to do so having put forward his shoulders and arms to make a first step in advance from the spot on which he was resting when a hand was put forth from one corner of the caverns moutha hand armed with a pistoland a shot was fired there could be no doubt now but that danny lund was right and no doubt now as to the whereabouts of aaron trow a hand was put forth a pistol was fired and caleb morton still clinging to a corner of the rock with both his arms was seen to falter he is wounded said one of the voices from below and then they all expected to see him fall into the sea but he did not fall and after a moment or two he proceeded carefully to pick his steps along the ledge the ball had touched him grazing his cheek and cutting through the light whiskers that he wore but he had not felt it though the blow had nearly knocked him from his perch and then four or five shots were fired from the rocks into the mouth of the cavern the mans arm had been seen and indeed one or two declared that they had traced the dim outline of his figure but no sound was heard to come from the cavern except the sharp crack of the bullets against the rock and the echo of the gunpowder there had been no groan as of a man wounded no sound of a body falling no voice wailing in despair for a few seconds all was dark with the smoke of the gunpowder and then the empty mouth of the cave was again yawning before their eyes morton was now near it still cautiously creeping the first danger to which he was exposed was this that his enemy within the recess might push him down from the rocks with a touch but on the other hand there were three or four men ready to fire the moment that a hand should be put forth and then morton could swimwas known to be a strong swimmerwhereas of aaron trow it was already declared by the prison gaolers that he could not swim two of the warders had now followed morton on the rocks so that in the event of his making good his entrance into the cavern and holding his enemy at bay for a minute he would be joined by aid it was strange to see how those different men conducted themselves as they stood on the opposite platform watching the attack the officers from the prison had no other thought but of their prisoner and were intent on taking him alive or dead to them it was little or nothing what became of morton it was their business to encounter peril and they were ready to do sofeeling however by no means sorry to have such a man as morton in advance of them very little was said by them they had their wits about them and remembered that every word spoken for the guidance of their ally would be heard also by the escaped convict their prey was sure sooner or later and had not morton been so eager in his pursuit they would have waited till some plan had been devised of trapping him without danger but the townsmen from st george of whom some dozen were now standing there were quick and eager and loud in their counsels stay where you are mr mortonstay awhile for the love of godor hell have you down nows your time caleb in on him now and youll have him close with him morton close with him at once its your only chance theres four of us here well fire on him if he as much as shows a limb all of which words as they were heard by that poor wretch within must have sounded to him as the barking of a pack of hounds thirsting for his blood for him at any rate there was no longer any hope in this world my reader when chance has taken you into the huntingfield has it ever been your lot to sit by on horseback and watch the digging out of a fox the operation is not an uncommon one and in some countries it is held to be in accordance with the rules of fair sport for myself i think that when the brute has so far saved himself he should be entitled to the benefit of his cunning but i will not now discuss the propriety or impropriety of that practice in venery i can never however watch the doing of that work without thinking much of the agonising struggles of the poor beast whose last refuge is being torn from over his head there he lies within a few yards of his arch enemy the huntsman the thick breath of the hounds make hot the air within his hole the sound of their voices is close upon his ears his breast is nearly bursting with the violence of that effort which at last has brought him to his retreat and then pickaxe and mattock are plied above his head and nearer and more near to him press his foeshis double foes human and caninetill at last a huge hand grasps him and he is dragged forth among his enemies almost as soon as his eyes have seen the light the eager noses of a dozen hounds have moistened themselves in his entrails ah me i know that he is vermin the vermin after whom i have been risking my neck with a bold ambition that i might ultimately witness his deathstruggles but nevertheless i would fain have saved him that last half hour of gradually diminished hope and aaron trow was now like a hunted fox doomed to be dug out from his last refuge with this addition to his misery that these hounds when they caught their prey would not put him at once out of his misery when first he saw that throng of men coming down from the hill top and resting on the platform he knew that his fate was come when they called to him to surrender himself he was silent but he knew that his silence was of no avail to them who were so eager to be his captors the matter seemed to be still one of considerable difficulty but to his thinking there was no difficulty there were there some score of men fully armed within twenty yards of him if he but showed a trace of his limbs he would become a mark for their bullets and then if he were wounded and no one would come to him if they allowed him to lie there without food till he perished would it not be well for him to yield himself then they called again and he was still silent that idea of yielding is very terrible to the heart of a man and when the worst had come to the worst did not the ocean run deep beneath his caverns mouth but as they yelled at him and hallooed making their preparations for his death his presence of mind deserted the poor wretch he had stolen an old pistol on one of his marauding expeditions of which one barrel had been loaded that in his mad despair he had fired and now as he lay near the mouth of the cavern under the cover of the projecting stone he had no weapon with him but his hands he had had a knife but that had dropped from him during the struggle on the floor of the cottage he had now nothing but his hands and was considering how he might best use them in ridding himself of the first of his pursuers the man was near him armed with all the power and majesty of right on his side whereas on his side aaron trow had nothingnot a hope he raised his head that he might look forth and a dozen voices shouted as his face appeared above the aperture a dozen weapons were levelled at him and he could see the gleaming of the muzzles of the guns and then the foot of his pursuer was already on the corner stone at the caverns mouth now caleb on him at once shouted a voice ah me it was a moment in which to pity even such a man as aaron trow now caleb at him at once shouted the voice no by heavens not so even yet the sound of triumph in those words raised the last burst of energy in the breast of that wretched man and he sprang forth head foremost from his prison house forth he came manifest enough before the eyes of them all and with head well down and hands outstretched but with his wide glaring eyes still turned towards his pursuers as he fell he plunged down into the waves beneath him two of those who stood by almost unconscious of what they did fired at his body as it made its rapid way to the water but as they afterwards found neither of the bullets struck him morton when his prey thus leaped forth escaping him for awhile was already on the verge of the cavernhad even then prepared his foot for that onward spring which should bring him to the throat of his foe but he arrested himself and for a moment stood there watching the body as it struck the water and hid itself at once beneath the ripple he stood there for a moment watching the deed and its effect and then leaving his hold upon the rock he once again followed his quarry down he went head foremost right on to the track in the waves which the other had made and when the two rose to the surface together each was struggling in the grasp of the other it was a foolish nay a mad deed to do the poor wretch who had first fallen could not have escaped he could not even swim and had therefore flung himself to certain destruction when he took that leap from out of the caverns mouth it would have been sad to see him perish beneath the wavesto watch him as he rose gasping for breath and then to see him sinking again to rise again and then to go for ever but his life had been fairly forfeitand why should one so much more precious have been flung after it it was surely with no view of saving that pitiful life that caleb morton had leaped after his enemy but the hound hot with the chase will follow the stag over the precipice and dash himself to pieces against the rocks the beast thirsting for blood will rush in even among the weapons of men morton in his fury had felt but one desire burned with but one passion if the fates would but grant him to fix his clutches in the throat of the man who had illused his love for the rest it might all go as it would in the earlier part of the morning while they were all searching for their victim they had brought a boat up into this very inlet among the rocks and the same boat had been at hand during the whole day unluckily before they had come hither it had been taken round the headland to a place among the rocks at which a government skiff is always moored the sea was still so quiet that there was hardly a ripple on it and the boat had been again sent for when first it was supposed that they had at last traced aaron trow to his hidingplace anxiously now were all eyes turned to the headland but as yet no boat was there the two men rose to the surface each struggling in the arms of the other trow though he was in an element to which he was not used though he had sprung thither as another suicide might spring to certain death beneath a railway engine did not altogether lose his presence of mind prompted by a double instinct he had clutched hold of mortons body when he encountered it beneath the waters he held on to it as to his only protection and he held on to him also as to his only enemy if there was a chance for a life struggle they would share that chance together and if not then together would they meet that other fate caleb morton was a very strong man and though one of his arms was altogether encumbered by his antagonist his other arm and his legs were free with these he seemed to succeed in keeping his head above the water weighted as he was with the body of his foe but trows efforts were also used with the view of keeping himself above the water though he had purposed to destroy himself in taking that leap and now hoped for nothing better than that they might both perish together he yet struggled to keep his head above the waves bodily power he had none left to him except that of holding on to mortons arm and plunging with his legs but he did hold on and thus both their heads remained above the surface but this could not last long it was easy to see that trows strength was nearly spent and that when he went down morton must go with him if indeed they could be separatedif morton could once make himself free from that embrace into which he had been so anxious to leapthen indeed there might be a hope all round that little inlet the rock fell sheer down into the deep sea so that there was no restingplace for a foot but round the headlands on either side even within forty or fifty yards of that spot morton might rest on the rocks till a boat should come to his assistance to him that distance would have been nothing if only his limbs had been at liberty upon the platform of rocks they were all at their wits ends many were anxious to fire at trow but even if they hit him would mortons position have been better would not the wounded man have still clung to him who was not wounded and then there could be no certainty that any one of them would hit the right man the ripple of the waves though it was very slight nevertheless sufficed to keep the bodies in motion and then too there was not among them any marksman peculiar for his skill mortons efforts in the water were too severe to admit of his speaking but he could hear and understand the words which were addressed to him shake him off caleb strike him from you with your foot swim to the right shore swim for it even if you take him with you yes he could hear them all but hearing and obeying were very different it was not easy to shake off that dying man and as for swimming with him that was clearly impossible it was as much as he could do to keep his head above water let alone any attempt to move in one settled direction for some four or five minutes they lay thus battling on the waves before the head of either of them went down trow had been twice below the surface but it was before he had succeeded in supporting himself by mortons arm now it seemed as though he must sink againas though both must sink his mouth was barely kept above the water and as morton shook him with his arm the tide would pass over him it was horrid to watch from the shore the glaring upturned eyes of the dying wretch as his long streaming hair lay back upon the wave now caleb hold him down hold him under was shouted in the voice of some eager friend rising up on the water morton made a last effort to do as he was bid he did press the mans head downwell down below the surfacebut still the hand clung to him and as he struck out against the water he was powerless against that grasp then there came a loud shout along the shore and all those on the platform whose eyes had been fixed so closely on that terrible struggle beneath them rushed towards the rocks on the other coast the sound of oars was heard close to theman eager pressing stroke as of men who knew well that they were rowing for the salvation of a life on they came close under the rocks obeying with every muscle of their bodies the behests of those who called to them from the shore the boat came with such rapiditywas so recklessly urged that it was driven somewhat beyond the inlet but in passing a blow was struck which made caleb morton once more the master of his own life the two men had been carried out in their struggle towards the open sea and as the boat curved in so as to be as close as the rocks would allow the bodies of the men were brought within the sweep of the oars he in the bowfor there were four pulling in the boathad raised his oar as he neared the rockshad raised it high above the water and now as they passed close by the struggling men he let it fall with all its force on the upturned face of the wretched convict it was a terrible frightful thing to dothus striking one who was so stricken but who shall say that the blow was not good and just methinks however that the eyes and face of that dying man will haunt for ever the dreams of him who carried that oar trow never rose again to the surface three days afterwards his body was found at the ferry and then they carried him to the convict island and buried him morton was picked up and taken into the boat his life was saved but it may be a question how the battle might have gone had not that friendly oar been raised in his behalf as it was he lay at the cottage for days before he was able to be moved so as to receive the congratulations of those who had watched that terrible conflict from the shore nor did he feel that there had been anything in that days work of which he could be proudmuch rather of which it behoved him to be thoroughly ashamed some six months after that he obtained the hand of anastasia bergen but they did not remain long in bermuda he went away back to his own country my informant told me because he could not endure to meet the ghost of aaron trow at that point of the road which passes near the cottage that the ghost of aaron trow may be seen there and round the little rocky inlet of the sea is part of the creed of every young woman in bermuda mrs general talboys why mrs general talboys first made up her mind to pass the winter of at rome i never clearly understood to myself she explained her purposes soon after her arrival at the eternal city by declaring in her own enthusiastic manner that she was inspired by a burning desire to drink fresh at the still living fountains of classical poetry and sentiment but i always thought that there was something more than this in it classical poetry and sentiment were doubtless very dear to her but so also i imagine were the substantial comforts of hardover lodge the generals house in berkshire and i do not think that she would have emigrated for the winter had there not been some slight domestic misunderstanding let this however be fully made clearthat such misunderstanding if it existed must have been simply an affair of temper no impropriety of conduct has i am very sure ever been imputed to the lady the general as all the world knows is hot and mrs talboys when the sweet rivers of her enthusiasm are unfed by congenial waters can i believe make herself disagreeable but be this as it may in november mrs talboys came among us english at rome and soon succeeded in obtaining for herself a comfortable footing in our society we all thought her more remarkable for her mental attributes than for physical perfection but nevertheless she was in her own way a sightly woman she had no special brilliance either of eye or complexion such as would produce sudden flames in susceptible hearts nor did she seem to demand instant homage by the form and step of a goddess but we found her to be a goodlooking woman of some thirty or thirtythree years of age with soft peachlike cheeksrather too like those of a cherub with sparkling eyes which were hardly large enough with good teeth a white forehead a dimpled chin and a full bust such outwardly was mrs general talboys the description of the inward woman is the purport to which these few pages will be devoted there are two qualities to which the best of mankind are much subject which are nearly related to each other and as to which the world has not yet decided whether they are to be classed among the good or evil attributes of our nature men and women are under the influence of them both but men oftenest undergo the former and women the latter they are ambition and enthusiasm now mrs talboys was an enthusiastic woman as to ambition generally as the world agrees with mark antony in stigmatising it as a grievous fault i am myself clear that it is a virtue but with ambition at present we have no concern enthusiasm also as i think leans to virtues side or at least if it be a fault of all faults it is the prettiest but then to partake at all of virtue or even to be in any degree pretty the enthusiasm must be true bad coin is known from good by the ring of it and so is bad enthusiasm let the coiner be ever so clever at his art in the coining of enthusiasm the sound of true gold can never be imparted to the fake metal and i doubt whether the cleverest she in the world can make false enthusiasm palatable to the taste of man to the taste of any woman the enthusiasm of another woman is never very palatable we understood at rome that mrs talboys had a considerable familyfour or five children we were told but she brought with her only one daughter a little girl about twelve years of age she had torn herself asunder as she told me from the younger nurslings of her heart and had left them to the care of a devoted female attendant whose love was all but maternal and then she said a word or two about the general in terms which made me almost think that this quasimaternal love extended itself beyond the children the idea however was a mistaken one arising from the strength of her language to which i was then unaccustomed i have since become aware that nothing can be more decorous than old mrs upton the excellent headnurse at hardover lodge and no gentleman more discreet in his conduct than general talboys and i may as well here declare also that there could be no more virtuous woman than the generals wife her marriage vow was to her paramount to all other vows and bonds whatever the generals honour was quite safe when he sent her off to rome by herself and he no doubt knew that it was so illi robur et s triplex of which i believe no weapons of any assailant could get the better but nevertheless we used to fancy that she had no repugnance to impropriety in other womento what the world generally calls impropriety invincibly attached herself to the marriage tie she would constantly speak of it as by no means necessarily binding on others and virtuous herself as any griffin of propriety she constantly patronised at any rate the theory of infidelity in her neighbours she was very eager in denouncing the prejudices of the english world declaring that she had found existence among them to be no longer possible for herself she was hot against the stern unforgiveness of british matrons and equally eager in reprobating the stiff conventionalities of a religion in which she said that none of its votaries had faith though they all allowed themselves to be enslaved we had at that time a small set at rome consisting chiefly of english and americans who habitually met at each others rooms and spent many of our evening hours in discussing italian politics we were most of us painters poets novelists or sculptorsperhaps i should say wouldbe painters poets novelists and sculptorsaspirants hoping to become some day recognised and among us mrs talboys took her place naturally enough on account of a very pretty taste she had for painting i do not know that she ever originated anything that was grand but she made some nice copies and was fond at any rate of art conversation she wrote essays too which she showed in confidence to various gentlemen and had some idea of taking lessons in modelling in all our circle conrad mackinnon an american was perhaps the person most qualified to be styled its leader he was one who absolutely did gain his living and an ample living too by his pen and was regarded on all sides as a literary lion justified by success in roaring at any tone he might please his usual roar was not exactly that of a suckingdove or a nightingale but it was a goodhumoured roar not very offensive to any man and apparently acceptable enough to some ladies he was a big burly man near to fifty as i suppose somewhat awkward in his gait and somewhat loud in his laugh but though nigh to fifty and thus ungainly he liked to be smiled on by pretty women and liked as some said to be flattered by them also if so he should have been happy for the ladies at rome at that time made much of conrad mackinnon of mrs mackinnon no one did make very much and yet she was one of the sweetest dearest quietest little creatures that ever made glad a mans fireside she was exquisitely pretty always in good humour never stupid selfdenying to a fault and yet she was generally in the background she would seldom come forward of her own will but was contented to sit behind her teapot and hear mackinnon do his roaring he was certainly much given to what the world at rome called flirting but this did not in the least annoy her she was twenty years his junior and yet she never flirted with any one women would tell hergoodnatured friendshow mackinnon went on but she received such tidings as an excellent joke observing that he had always done the same and no doubt always would until he was ninety i do believe that she was a happy woman and yet i used to think that she should have been happier there is however no knowing the inside of another mans house or reading the riddles of another mans joy and sorrow we had also there another liona lion cubentitled to roar a little and of him also i must say something charles obrien was a young man about twentyfive years of age who had sent out from his studio in the preceding year a certain bust supposed by his admirers to be unsurpassed by any effort of ancient or modern genius i am no judge of sculpture and will not therefore pronounce an opinion but many who considered themselves to be judges declared that it was a goodish head and shoulders and nothing more i merely mention the fact as it was on the strength of that head and shoulders that obrien separated himself from a throng of others such as himself in rome walked solitary during the days and threw himself at the feet of various ladies when the days were over he had ridden on the shoulders of his bust into a prominent place in our circle and there encountered much feminine admirationfrom mrs general talboys and others some eighteen or twenty of us used to meet every sunday evening in mrs mackinnons drawingroom many of us indeed were in the habit of seeing each other daily and of visiting together the haunts in rome which are best loved by artloving strangers but here in this drawingroom we were sure to come together and here before the end of november mrs talboys might always be found not in any accustomed seat but moving about the room as the different male mental attractions of our society might chance to move themselves she was at first greatly taken by mackinnonwho also was i think a little stirred by her admiration though he stoutly denied the charge she became however very dear to us all before she left us and certainly we owed to her our love for she added infinitely to the joys of our winter i have come here to refresh myself she said to mackinnon one eveningto mackinnon and myself for we were standing together shall i get you tea said i and will you have something to eat mackinnon asked no no no she answered tea yes but for heavens sake let nothing solid dispel the associations of such a meeting as this i thought you might have dined early said mackinnon now mackinnon was a man whose own dinner was very dear to him i have seen him become hasty and unpleasant even under the pillars of the forum when he thought that the party were placing his fish in jeopardy by their desire to linger there too long early yes no i know not when it was one dines and sleeps in obedience to that dull clay which weighs down so generally the particle of our spirit but the clay may sometimes be forgotten here i can always forget it i thought you asked for refreshment i said she only looked at me whose small attempts at prose composition had up to that time been altogether unsuccessful and then addressed herself in reply to mackinnon it is the air which we breathe that fills our lungs and gives us life and light it is that which refreshes us if pure or sinks us into stagnation if it be foul let me for awhile inhale the breath of an invigorating literature sit down mr mackinnon i have a question that i must put to you and then she succeeded in carrying him off into a corner as far as i could see he went willingly enough at that time though he soon became averse to any long retirement in company with mrs talboys we none of us quite understood what were her exact ideas on the subject of revealed religion somebody i think had told her that there were among us one or two whose opinions were not exactly orthodox according to the doctrines of the established english church if so she was determined to show us that she also was advanced beyond the prejudices of an old and dry school of theology i have thrown down all the barriers of religion she said to poor mrs mackinnon and am looking for the sentiments of a pure christianity thrown down all the barriers of religion said mrs mackinnon in a tone of horror which was not appreciated indeed yes said mrs talboys with an exulting voice are not the days for such trammels gone by but yet you hold by christianity a pure christianity unstained by blood and perjury by hypocrisy and verbose genuflection can i not worship and say my prayers among the clouds and she pointed to the lofty ceiling and the handsome chandelier but ida goes to church said mrs mackinnon ida talboys was her daughter now it may be observed that many who throw down the barriers of religion so far as those barriers may affect themselves still maintain them on behalf of their children yes said mrs talboys dear ida her soft spirit is not yet adapted to receive the perfect truth we are obliged to govern children by the strength of their prejudices and then she moved away for it was seldom that mrs talboys remained long in conversation with any lady mackinnon i believe soon became tired of her he liked her flattery and at first declared that she was clever and nice but her niceness was too purely celestial to satisfy his mundane tastes mackinnon himself can revel among the clouds in his own writings and can leave us sometimes in doubt whether he ever means to come back to earth but when his foot is on terra firma he loves to feel the earthly substratum which supports his weight with women he likes a hand that can remain an unnecessary moment within his own an eye that can glisten with the sparkle of champagne a heart weak enough to make its owners arm tremble within his own beneath the moonlight gloom of the coliseum arches a dash of sentiment the while makes all these things the sweeter but the sentiment alone will not suffice for him mrs talboys did i believe drink her glass of champagne as do other ladies but with her it had no such pleasing effect it loosened only her tongue but never her eye her arm i think never trembled and her hand never lingered the general was always safe and happy perhaps in his solitary safety it so happened that we had unfortunately among us two artists who had quarrelled with their wives obrien whom i have before mentioned was one of them in his case i believe him to have been almost as free from blame as a man can be whose marriage was in itself a fault however he had a wife in ireland some ten years older than himself and though he might sometimes almost forget the fact his friends and neighbours were well aware of it in the other case the whole fault probably was with the husband he was an illtempered badhearted man clever enough but without principle and he was continually guilty of the great sin of speaking evil of the woman whose name he should have been anxious to protect in both cases our friend mrs talboys took a warm interest and in each of them she sympathised with the present husband against the absent wife of the consolation which she offered in the latter instance we used to hear something from mackinnon he would repeat to his wife and to me and my wife the conversations which she had with him poor brown she would say i pity him with my very hearts blood you are aware that he has comforted himself in his desolation mackinnon replied i know very well to what you allude i think i may say that i am conversant with all the circumstances of this heartblighting sacrifice mrs talboys was apt to boast of the thorough confidence reposed in her by all those in whom she took an interest yes he has sought such comfort in another love as the hard cruel world would allow him or perhaps something more than that said mackinnon he has a family here in rome you know two little babies i know it i know it she said cherub angels and as she spoke she looked up into the ugly face of marcus aurelius for they were standing at the moment under the figure of the great horseman on the campidoglio i have seen them and they are the children of innocence if all the blood of all the howards ran in their veins it could not make their birth more noble not if the father and mother of all the howards had never been married said mackinnon what that from you mr mackinnon said mrs talboys turning her back with energy upon the equestrian statue and looking up into the faces first of pollux and then of castor as though from them she might gain some inspiration on the subject which marcus aurelius in his coldness had denied to her from you who have so nobly claimed for mankind the divine attributes of free action from you who have taught my mind to soar above the petty bonds which one man in his littleness contrives for the subjection of his brother mackinnon you who are so great and she now looked up into his face mackinnon unsay those words they are illegitimate said he and if there was any landed property landed property and that from an american the children are english you know landed property the time will shortly comeay and i see it comingwhen that hateful word shall be expunged from the calendar when landed property shall be no more what shall the free soul of a godborn man submit itself for ever to such trammels as that shall we never escape from the clay which so long has manacled the subtler particles of the divine spirit ay yes mackinnon and then she took him by the arm and led him to the top of the huge steps which lead down from the campidoglio into the streets of modern rome look down upon that countless multitude mackinnon looked down and saw three groups of french soldiers with three or four little men in each group he saw also a couple of dirty friars and three priests very slowly beginning the side ascent to the church of the ara cli look down upon that countless multitude said mrs talboys and she stretched her arms out over the halfdeserted city they are escaping now from these trammelsnow nownow that i am speaking they have escaped long ago from all such trammels as that of landed property said mackinnon ay and from all terrestrial bonds she continued not exactly remarking the pith of his last observation from bonds quasiterrestrial and quasicelestial the fullformed limbs of the present age running with quick streams of generous blood will no longer bear the ligatures which past times have woven for the decrepit look down upon that multitude mackinnon they shall all be free and then still clutching him by the arm and still standing at the top of those stairs she gave forth her prophecy with the fury of a sybil they shall all be free oh rome thou eternal one thou who hast bowed thy neck to imperial pride and priestly craft thou who hast suffered sorely even to this hour from nero down to pio nonothe days of thine oppression are over gone from thy enfranchised ways for ever is the clang of the prtorian cohorts and the more odious drone of meddling monks and yet as mackinnon observed there still stood the dirty friars and the small french soldiers and there still toiled the slow priests wending their tedious way up to the church of the ara cli but that was the mundane view of the mattera view not regarded by mrs talboys in her ecstasy o italia she continued o italia una one and indivisible in thy rights and indivisible also in thy wrongs to us is it given to see the accomplishment of thy glory a people shall arise around thine altars greater in the annals of the world than thy scipios thy gracchi or thy csars not in torrents of blood or with screams of bereaved mothers shall thy new triumphs be stained but mind shall dominate over matter and doomed together with popes and bourbons with cardinals diplomatists and police spies ignorance and prejudice shall be driven from thy smiling terraces and then rome shall again become the fair capital of the fairest region of europe hither shall flock the artisans of the world crowding into thy marts all that god and man can give wealth beauty and innocence shall meet in thy streets there will be a considerable change before that takes place said mackinnon there shall be a considerable change she answered mackinnon to thee it is given to read the signs of the time and hast thou not read why have the fields of magenta and solferino been piled with the corpses of dying heroes why have the waters of the mincio ran red with the blood of martyrs that italy might be united and rome immortal here standing on the capitolium of the ancient city i say that it shall be so and thou mackinnon who hearest me knowest that my words are true there was not then in romei may almost say there was not in italy an englishman or an american who did not wish well to the cause for which italy was and is still contending as also there is hardly one who does not now regard that cause as wellnigh triumphant but nevertheless it was almost impossible to sympathise with mrs talboys as mackinnon said she flew so high that there was no comfort in flying with her well said he brown and the rest of them are down below shall we go and join them poor brown how was it that in speaking of his troubles we were led on to this heartstirring theme yes i have seen them the sweet angels and i tell you also that i have seen their mother i insisted on going to her when i heard her history from him and what is she like mrs talboys well education has done more for some of us than for others and there are those from whose morals and sentiments we might thankfully draw a lesson whose manners and outward gestures are not such as custom has made agreeable to us you i know can understand that i have seen her and feel sure that she is pure in heart and high in principle has she not sacrificed herself and is not selfsacrifice the surest guarantee for true nobility of character would mrs mackinnon object to my bringing them together mackinnon was obliged to declare that he thought his wife would object and from that time forth he and mrs talboys ceased to be very close in their friendship she still came to the house every sunday evening still refreshed herself at the fountains of his literary rills but her special prophecies from henceforth were poured into other ears and it so happened that obrien now became her chief ally i do not remember that she troubled herself much further with the cherub angels or with their mother and i am inclined to think that taking up warmly as she did the story of obriens matrimonial wrongs she forgot the little history of the browns be that as it may mrs talboys and obrien now became strictly confidential and she would enlarge by the halfhour together on the miseries of her friends position to any one whom she could get to hear her ill tell you what fanny mackinnon said to his wife one dayto his wife and to mine for we were all together we shall have a row in the house if we dont take care obrien will be making love to mrs talboys nonsense said mrs mackinnon you are always thinking that somebody is going to make love to some one somebody always is said he shes old enough to be his mother said mrs mackinnon what does that matter to an irishman said mackinnon besides i doubt if there is more than five years difference between them there must be more than that said my wife ida talboys is twelve i know and i am not quite sure that ida is the eldest if she had a son in the guards it would make no difference said mackinnon there are men who consider themselves bound to make love to a woman under certain circumstances let the age of the lady be what it may obrien is such a one and if she sympathises with him much oftener he will mistake the matter and go down on his knees you ought to put him on his guard he said addressing himself to his wife indeed i shall do no such thing said she if they are two fools they must like other fools pay the price of their folly as a rule there could be no softer creature than mrs mackinnon but it seemed to me that her tenderness never extended itself in the direction of mrs talboys just at this time towards the end that is of november we made a party to visit the tombs which lie along the appian way beyond that most beautiful of all sepulchres the tomb of cecilia metella it was a delicious day and we had driven along this road for a couple of miles beyond the walls of the city enjoying the most lovely view which the neighbourhood of rome affordslooking over the wondrous ruins of the old aqueducts up towards tivoli and palestrina of all the environs of rome this is on a fair clear day the most enchanting and here perhaps among a world of tombs thoughts and almost memories of the old old days come upon one with the greatest force the grandeur of rome is best seen and understood from beneath the walls of the coliseum and its beauty among the pillars of the forum and the arches of the sacred way but its history and fall become more palpable to the mind and more clearly realised out here among the tombs where the eyes rest upon the mountains whose shades were cool to the old romans as to usthan anywhere within the walls of the city here we look out at the same tivoli and the same prneste glittering in the sunshine embowered among the faroff valleys which were dear to them and the blue mountains have not crumbled away into ruins within rome itself we can see nothing as they saw it our party consisted of some dozen or fifteen persons and as a hamper with luncheon in it had been left on the grassy slope at the base of the tomb of cecilia metella the expedition had in it something of the nature of a picnic mrs talboys was of course with us and ida talboys obrien also was there the hamper had been prepared in mrs mackinnons room under the immediate eye of mackinnon himself and they therefore were regarded as the dominant spirits of the party my wife was leagued with mrs mackinnon as was usually the case and there seemed to be a general opinion among those who were closely in confidence together that something would happen in the obrientalboys matter the two had been inseparable on the previous evening for mrs talboys had been urging on the young irishman her counsels respecting his domestic troubles sir cresswell cresswell she had told him was his refuge why should his soul submit to bonds which the world had now declared to be intolerable divorce was not now the privilege of the dissolute rich spirits which were incompatible need no longer be compelled to fret beneath the same couples in short she had recommended him to go to england and get rid of his wife as she would with a little encouragement have recommended any man to get rid of anything i am sure that had she been skilfully brought on to the subject she might have been induced to pronounce a verdict against such ligatures for the body as coats waistcoats and trowsers her aspirations for freedom ignored all bounds and in theory there were no barriers which she was not willing to demolish poor obrien as we all now began to see had taken the matter amiss he had offered to make a bust of mrs talboys and she had consented expressing a wish that it might find a place among those who had devoted themselves to the enfranchisement of their fellowcreatures i really think she had but little of a womans customary personal vanity i know she had an idea that her eye was lighted up in her warmer moments by some special fire that sparks of liberty shone round her brow and that her bosom heaved with glorious aspirations but all these feelings had reference to her inner genius not to any outward beauty but obrien misunderstood the woman and thought it necessary to gaze into her face and sigh as though his heart were breaking indeed he declared to a young friend that mrs talboys was perfect in her style of beauty and began the bust with this idea it was gradually becoming clear to us all that he would bring himself to grief but in such a matter who can caution a man mrs mackinnon had contrived to separate them in making the carriage arrangements on this day but this only added fuel to the fire which was now burning within obriens bosom i believe that he really did love her in his easy eager susceptible irish way that he would get over the little episode without any serious injury to his heart no one doubted but then what would occur when the declaration was made how would mrs talboys bear it she deserves it said mrs mackinnon and twice as much my wife added why is it that women are so spiteful to each other early in the day mrs talboys clambered up to the top of a tomb and made a little speech holding a parasol over her head beneath her feet she said reposed the ashes of some bloated senator some glutton of the empire who had swallowed into his maw the provision necessary for a tribe old rome had fallen through such selfishness as that but new rome would not forget the lesson all this was very well and then obrien helped her down but after this there was no separating them for her own part she would sooner have had mackinnon at her elbow but mackinnon now had found some other elbow enough of that was as good as a feast he had said to his wife and therefore mrs talboys quite unconscious of evil allowed herself to be engrossed by obrien and then about three oclock we returned to the hamper luncheon under such circumstances always means dinner and we arranged ourselves for a very comfortable meal to those who know the tomb of cecilia metella no description of the scene is necessary and to those who do not no description will convey a fair idea of its reality it is itself a large low tower of great diameter but of beautiful proportion standing far outside the city close on to the side of the old roman way it has been embattled on the top by some latterday baron in order that it might be used for protection to the castle which has been built on and attached to it if i remember rightly this was done by one of the frangipani and a very lovely ruin he has made of it i know no castellated old tumbledown residence in italy more picturesque than this baronial adjunct to the old roman tomb or which better tallies with the ideas engendered within our minds by mrs radcliffe and the mysteries of udolpho it lies along the road protected on the side of the city by the proud sepulchre of the roman matron and up to the long ruined walls of the back of the building stretches a grassy slope at the bottom of which are the remains of an old roman circus beyond that is the long thin graceful line of the claudian aqueduct with soracte in the distance to the left and tivoli palestine and frascati lying among the hills which bound the view that frangipani baron was in the right of it and i hope he got the value of his money out of the residence which he built for himself i doubt however that he did but little good to those who lived in his close neighbourhood we had a very comfortable little banquet seated on the broken lumps of stone which lie about under the walls of the tomb i wonder whether the shade of cecilia metella was looking down upon us we have heard much of her in these latter days and yet we know nothing about her nor can conceive why she was honoured with a bigger tomb than any other roman matron there were those then among our party who believed that she might still come back among us and with due assistance from some cognate susceptible spirit explain to us the cause of her widowed husbands liberality alas alas if we may judge of the romans by ourselves the true reason for such sepulchral grandeur would redound little to the credit of the lady cecilia metella herself or to that of crassus her bereaved and desolate lord she did not come among us on the occasion of this banquet possibly because we had no tables there to turn in preparation for her presence but had she done so she could not have been more eloquent of things of the other world than was mrs talboys i have said that mrs talboys eye never glanced more brightly after a glass of champagne but i am inclined to think that on this occasion it may have done so obrien enacted ganymede and was perhaps more liberal than other latterday ganymedes to whose services mrs talboys had been accustomed let it not however be suspected by any one that she exceeded the limits of a discreet joyousness by no means the generous wine penetrated perhaps to some inner cells of her heart and brought forth thoughts in sparkling words which otherwise might have remained concealed but there was nothing in what she thought or spoke calculated to give umbrage either to an anchorite or to a vestal a word or two she said or sung about the flowing bowl and once she called for falernian but beyond this her converse was chiefly of the rights of man and the weakness of women of the iron ages that were past and of the golden time that was to come she called a toast and drank to the hopes of the latter historians of the nineteenth century then it was that she bade obrien fill high the bowl with samian wine the irishman took her at her word and she raised the bumper and waved it over her head before she put it to her lips i am bound to declare that she did not spill a drop the true falernian grape she said as she deposited the empty beaker on the grass beneath her elbow viler champagne i do not think i ever swallowed but it was the theory of the wine not its palpable body present there as it were in the flesh which inspired her there was really something grand about her on that occasion and her enthusiasm almost amounted to reality mackinnon was amused and encouraged her as i must confess did i also mrs mackinnon made useless little signs to her husband really fearing that the falernian would do its good offices too thoroughly my wife getting me apart as i walked round the circle distributing viands remarked that the woman was a fool and would disgrace herself but i observed that after the disposal of that bumper she worshipped the rosy god in theory only and therefore saw no occasion to interfere come bacchus she said and come silenus if thou wilt i know that ye are hovering round the graves of your departed favourites and ye too nymphs of egeria and she pointed to the classic grove which was all but close to us as we sat there in olden days ye did not always despise the abodes of men but why should we invoke the presence of the godswe who can become godlike ourselves we ourselves are the deities of the present age for us shall the tables be spread with ambrosia for us shall the nectar flow upon the whole it was very good foolingfor awhile and as soon as we were tired of it we arose from our seats and began to stroll about the place it was beginning to be a little dusk and somewhat cool but the evening air was pleasant and the ladies putting on their shawls did not seem inclined at once to get into the carriages at any rate mrs talboys was not so inclined for she started down the hill towards the long low wall of the old roman circus at the bottom and obrien close at her elbow started with her ida my dear you had better remain here she said to her daughter you will be tired if you come as far as we are going oh no mamma i shall not said ida you get tired much quicker than i do oh yes you will besides i do not wish you to come there was an end of it for ida and mrs talboys and obrien walked off together while we all looked into each others faces it would be a charity to go with them said mackinnon do you be charitable then said his wife it should be a lady said he it is a pity that the mother of the spotless cherubim is not here for the occasion said she i hardly think that any one less gifted will undertake such a self sacrifice any attempt of the kind would however now have been too late for they were already at the bottom of the hill obrien had certainly drunk freely of the pernicious contents of those longnecked bottles and though no one could fairly accuse him of being tipsy nevertheless that which might have made others drunk had made him bold and he dared to doperhaps more than might become a man if under any circumstances he could be fool enough to make an avowal of love to mrs talboys he might be expected as we all thought to do it now we watched them as they made for a gap in the wall which led through into the large enclosed space of the old circus it had been an arena for chariot games and they had gone down with the avowed purpose of searching where might have been the meta and ascertaining how the drivers could have turned when at their full speed for awhile we had heard their voicesor rather her voice especially the heart of a man obrien should suffice for all emergencies we had heard her say she had assumed a strange habit of calling men by their simple names as men address each other when she did this to mackinnon who was much older than herself we had been all amused by it and other ladies of our party had taken to call him mackinnon when mrs talboys was not by but we had felt the comedy to be less safe with obrien especially when on one occasion we heard him address her as arabella she did not seem to be in any way struck by his doing so and we supposed therefore that it had become frequent between them what reply he made at the moment about the heart of a man i do not knowand then in a few minutes they disappeared through the gap in the wall none of us followed them though it would have seemed the most natural thing in the world to do so had nothing out of the way been expected as it was we remained there round the tomb quizzing the little foibles of our dear friend and hoping that obrien would be quick in what he was doing that he would undoubtedly get a slap in the facemetaphoricallywe all felt certain for none of us doubted the rigid propriety of the ladys intentions some of us strolled into the buildings and some of us got out on to the road but we all of us were thinking that obrien was very slow a considerable time before we saw mrs talboys reappear through the gap at last however she was there and we at once saw that she was alone she came on breasting the hill with quick steps and when she drew near we could see that there was a frown as of injured majesty on her brow mackinnon and his wife went forward to meet her if she were really in trouble it would be fitting in some way to assist her and of all women mrs mackinnon was the last to see another woman suffer from illusage without attempting to aid her i certainly never liked her mrs mackinnon said afterwards but i was bound to go and hear her tale when she really had a tale to tell and mrs talboys now had a tale to tellif she chose to tell it the ladies of our party declared afterwards that she would have acted more wisely had she kept to herself both obriens words to her and her answer she was well able to take care of herself mrs mackinnon said and after all the silly man had taken an answer when he got it not however that obrien had taken his answer quite immediately as far as i could understand from what we heard of the matter afterwards at the present moment mrs talboys came up the rising ground all alone and at a quick pace the man has insulted me she said aloud as well as her panting breath would allow her and as soon as she was near enough to mrs mackinnon to speak to her i am sorry for that said mrs mackinnon i suppose he has taken a little too much wine no it was a premeditated insult the basehearted churl has failed to understand the meaning of true honest sympathy he will forget all about it when he is sober said mackinnon meaning to comfort her what care i what he remembers or what he forgets she said turning upon poor mackinnon indignantly you men grovel so in your ideas and yet as mackinnon said afterwards she had been telling me that i was a fool for the last three weeksyou men grovel so in your ideas that you cannot understand the feelings of a truehearted woman what can his forgetfulness or his remembrance be to me must not i remember this insult is it possible that i should forget it mr and mrs mackinnon only had gone forward to meet her but nevertheless she spoke so loud that all heard her who were still clustered round the spot on which we had dined what has become of mr obrien a lady whispered to me i had a fieldglass with me and looking round i saw his hat as he was walking inside the walls of the circus in the direction towards the city and very foolish he must feel said the lady no doubt he is used to it said another but considering her age you know said the first who might have been perhaps three years younger than mrs talboys and who was not herself averse to the excitement of a moderate flirtation but then why should she have been averse seeing that she had not as yet become subject to the will of any imperial lord he would have felt much more foolish said the third if she had listened to what he said to her well i dont know said the second nobody would have known anything about it then and in a few weeks they would have gradually become tired of each other in the ordinary way but in the meantime mrs talboys was among us there had been no attempt at secresy and she was still loudly inveighing against the grovelling propensities of men thats quite true mrs talboys said one of the elder ladies but then women are not always so careful as they should be of course i do not mean to say that there has been any fault on your part fault on my part of course there has been fault on my part no one can make any mistake without fault to some extent i took him to be a man of sense and he is a fool go to naples indeed did he want you to go to naples asked mrs mackinnon yes that was what he suggested we were to leave by the train for civita vecchia at six tomorrow morning and catch the steamer which leaves leghorn tonight dont tell me of wine he was prepared for it and she looked round about on us with an air of injured majesty in her face which was almost insupportable i wonder whether he took the tickets overnight said mackinnon naples she said as though now speaking exclusively to herself the only ground in italy which has as yet made no struggle on behalf of freedoma fitting residence for such a dastard you would have found it very pleasant at this season said the unmarried lady who was three years her junior my wife had taken ida out of the way when the first complaining note from mrs talboys had been heard ascending the hill but now when matters began gradually to become quiescent she brought her back suggesting as she did so that they might begin to think of returning it is getting very cold ida dear is it not said she but where is mr obrien said ida he has fledas poltroons always fly said mrs talboys i believe in my heart that she would have been glad to have had him there in the middle of the circle and to have triumphed over him publicly among us all no feeling of shame would have kept her silent for a moment fled said ida looking up into her mothers face yes fled my child and she seized her daughter in her arms and pressed her closely to her bosom cowards always fly is mr obrien a coward ida asked yes a coward a very coward and he has fled before the glance of an honest womans eye come mrs mackinnon shall we go back to the city i am sorry that the amusement of the day should have received this check and she walked forward to the carriage and took her place in it with an air that showed that she was proud of the way in which she had conducted herself she is a little conceited about it after all said that unmarried lady if poor mr obrien had not shown so much premature anxiety with reference to that little journey to naples things might have gone quietly after all but the unmarried lady was wrong in her judgment mrs talboys was proud and conceited in the matterbut not proud of having excited the admiration of her irish lover she was proud of her own subsequent conduct and gave herself credit for coming out strongly as a nobleminded matron i believe she thinks said mrs mackinnon that her virtue is quite spartan and unique and if she remains in rome shell boast of it through the whole winter if she does she may be certain that obrien will do the same said mackinnon and in spite of his having fled from the field it is upon the cards that he may get the best of it mrs talboys is a very excellent woman she has proved her excellence beyond a doubt but nevertheless she is susceptible of ridicule we all felt a little anxiety to hear obriens account of the matter and after having deposited the ladies at their homes mackinnon and i went off to his lodgings at first he was denied to us but after awhile we got his servant to acknowledge that he was at home and then we made our way up to his studio we found him seated behind a halfformed model or rather a mere lump of clay punched into something resembling the shape of a head with a pipe in his mouth and a bit of stick in his hand he was pretending to work though we both knew that it was out of the question that he should do anything in his present frame of mind i think i heard my servant tell you that i was not at home said he yes he did said mackinnon and would have sworn to it too if we would have let him come dont pretend to be surly i am very busy mr mackinnon completing your head of mrs talboys i suppose before you start for naples you dont mean to say that she has told you all about it and he turned away from his work and looked up into our faces with a comical expression half of fun and half of despair every word of it said i when you want a lady to travel with you never ask her to get up so early in winter but obrien how could you be such an ass said mackinnon as it has turned out there is no very great harm done you have insulted a respectable middleaged woman the mother of a family and the wife of a general officer and there is an end of itunless indeed the general officer should come out from england to call you to account he is welcome said obrien haughtily no doubt my dear fellow said mackinnon that would be a dignified and pleasant ending to the affair but what i want to know is thiswhat would you have done if she had agreed to go he never calculated on the possibility of such a contingency said i by heavens then i thought she would like it said he and to oblige her you were content to sacrifice yourself said mackinnon well that was just it what the deuce is a fellow to do when a woman goes on in that way she told me down there upon the old race course you know that matrimonial bonds were made for fools and slaves what was i to suppose that she meant by that but to make all sure i asked her what sort of a fellow the general was dear old man she said clasping her hands together he might you know have been my father i wish he were said i because then youd be free i am free said she stamping on the ground and looking up at me as much as to say that she cared for no one then said i accept all that is left of the heart of wenceslaus obrien and i threw myself before her in her path hand said i i have none to give but the blood which runs red through my veins is descended from a double line of kings i said that because she is always fond of riding a high horse i had gotten close under the wall so that none of you should see me from the tower and what answer did she make said mackinnon why she was pleased as punchgave me both her hands and declared that we would be friends for ever it is my belief mackinnon that that woman never heard anything of the kind before the general no doubt did it by letter and how was it that she changed her mind why i got up put my arm round her waist and told her that we would be off to naples im blest if she didnt give me a knock in the ribs that nearly sent me backwards she took my breath away so that i couldnt speak to her and then oh there was nothing more of course i saw how it was so she walked off one way and i the other on the whole i consider that i am well out of it and so do i said mackinnon very gravely but if you will allow me to give you my advice i would suggest that it would be well to avoid such mistakes in future upon my word said obrien excusing himself i dont know what a man is to do under such circumstances i give you my honour that i did it all to oblige her we then decided that mackinnon should convey to the injured lady the humble apology of her late admirer it was settled that no detailed excuses should be made it should be left to her to consider whether the deed which had been done might have been occasioned by wine or by the folly of a momentor by her own indiscreet enthusiasm no one but the two were present when the message was given and therefore we were obliged to trust to mackinnons accuracy for an account of it she stood on very high ground indeed he said at first refusing to hear anything that he had to say on the matter the foolish young man she declared was below her anger and below her contempt he is not the first irishman that has been made indiscreet by beauty said mackinnon a truce to that she replied waving her hand with an air of assumed majesty the incident contemptible as it is has been unpleasant to me it will necessitate my withdrawal from rome oh no mrs talboys that will be making too much of him the greatest hero that lives she answered may have his house made uninhabitable by a very small insect mackinnon swore that those were her own words consequently a sobriquet was attached to obrien of which he by no means approved and from that day we always called mrs talboys the hero mackinnon prevailed at last with her and she did not leave rome she was even induced to send a message to obrien conveying her forgiveness they shook hands together with great clat in mrs mackinnons drawingroom but i do not suppose that she ever again offered to him sympathy on the score of his matrimonial troubles the parsons daughter of oxney colne the prettiest scenery in all englandand if i am contradicted in that assertion i will say in all europeis in devonshire on the southern and southeastern skirts of dartmoor where the rivers dart and avon and teign form themselves and where the broken moor is half cultivated and the wildlooking upland fields are half moor in making this assertion i am often met with much doubt but it is by persons who do not really know the locality men and women talk to me on the matter who have travelled down the line of railway from exeter to plymouth who have spent a fortnight at torquay and perhaps made an excursion from tavistock to the convict prison on dartmoor but who knows the glories of chagford who has walked through the parish of manaton who is conversant with lustleigh cleeves and withycombe in the moor who has explored holne chase gentle reader believe me that you will be rash in contradicting me unless you have done these things there or thereaboutsi will not say by the waters of which little river it is washedis the parish of oxney colne and for those who wish to see all the beauties of this lovely country a sojourn in oxney colne would be most desirable seeing that the sojourner would then be brought nearer to all that he would wish to visit than at any other spot in the country but there is an objection to any such arrangement there are only two decent houses in the whole parish and these areor were when i knew the localitysmall and fully occupied by their possessors the larger and better is the parsonage in which lived the parson and his daughter and the smaller is a freehold residence of a certain miss le smyrger who owned a farm of a hundred acres which was rented by one farmer cloysey and who also possessed some thirty acres round her own house which she managed herself regarding herself to be quite as great in cream as mr cloysey and altogether superior to him in the article of cyder but yeu has to pay no rent miss farmer cloysey would say when miss le smyrger expressed this opinion of her art in a manner too defiant yeu pays no rent or yeu couldnt do it miss le smyrger was an old maid with a pedigree and blood of her own a hundred and thirty acres of feesimple land on the borders of dartmoor fifty years of age a constitution of iron and an opinion of her own on every subject under the sun and now for the parson and his daughter the parsons name was woolsworthyor woolathy as it was pronounced by all those who lived around himthe rev saul woolsworthy and his daughter was patience woolsworthy or miss patty as she was known to the devonshire world of those parts that name of patience had not been well chosen for her for she was a hottempered damsel warm in her convictions and inclined to express them freely she had but two closely intimate friends in the world and by both of them this freedom of expression had now been fully permitted to her since she was a child miss le smyrger and her father were well accustomed to her ways and on the whole well satisfied with them the former was equally free and equally warmtempered as herself and as mr woolsworthy was allowed by his daughter to be quite paramount on his own subjectfor he had a subjecthe did not object to his daughter being paramount on all others a pretty girl was patience woolsworthy at the time of which i am writing and one who possessed much that was worthy of remark and admiration had she lived where beauty meets with admiration or where force of character is remarked but at oxney colne on the borders of dartmoor there were few to appreciate her and it seemed as though she herself had but little idea of carrying her talent further afield so that it might not remain for ever wrapped in a blanket she was a pretty girl tall and slender with dark eyes and black hair her eyes were perhaps too round for regular beauty and her hair was perhaps too crisp her mouth was large and expressive her nose was finely formed though a critic in female form might have declared it to be somewhat broad but her countenance altogether was wonderfully attractiveif only it might be seen without that resolution for dominion which occasionally marred it though sometimes it even added to her attractions it must be confessed on behalf of patience woolsworthy that the circumstances of her life had peremptorily called upon her to exercise dominion she had lost her mother when she was sixteen and had had neither brother nor sister she had no neighbours near her fit either from education or rank to interfere in the conduct of her life excepting always miss le smyrger miss le smyrger would have done anything for her including the whole management of her morals and of the parsonage household had patience been content with such an arrangement but much as patience had ever loved miss le smyrger she was not content with this and therefore she had been called on to put forth a strong hand of her own she had put forth this strong hand early and hence had come the character which i am attempting to describe but i must say on behalf of this girl that it was not only over others that she thus exercised dominion in acquiring that power she had also acquired the much greater power of exercising rule over herself but why should her father have been ignored in these family arrangements perhaps it may almost suffice to say that of all living men her father was the man best conversant with the antiquities of the county in which he lived he was the jonathan oldbuck of devonshire and especially of dartmoor without that decision of character which enabled oldbuck to keep his womenkind in some kind of subjection and probably enabled him also to see that his weekly bills did not pass their proper limits our mr oldbuck of oxney colne was sadly deficient in these a a parish pastor with but a small cure he did his duty with sufficient energy to keep him at any rate from reproach he was kind and charitable to the poor punctual in his services forbearing with the farmers around him mild with his brother clergymen and indifferent to aught that bishop or archdeacon might think or say of him i do not name this latter attribute as a virtue but as a fact but all these points were as nothing in the known character of mr woolsworthy of oxney colne he was the antiquarian of dartmoor that was his line of life it was in that capacity that he was known to the devonshire world it was as such that he journeyed about with his humble carpetbag staying away from his parsonage a night or two at a time it was in that character that he received now and again stray visitors in the single spare bedroomnot friends asked to see him and his girl because of their friendshipbut men who knew something as to this buried stone or that old landmark in all these things his daughter let him have his own way assisting and encouraging him that was his line of life and therefore she respected it but in all other matters she chose to be paramount at the parsonage mr woolsworthy was a little man who always wore except on sundays grey clothesclothes of so light a grey that they would hardly have been regarded as clerical in a district less remote he had now reached a goodly age being full seventy years old but still he was wiry and active and showed but few symptoms of decay his head was bald and the few remaining locks that surrounded it were nearly white but there was a look of energy about his mouth and a humour in his light grey eye which forbade those who knew him to regard him altogether as an old man as it was he could walk from oxney colne to priestown fifteen long devonshire miles across the moor and he who could do that could hardly be regarded as too old for work but our present story will have more to do with his daughter than with him a pretty girl i have said was patience woolsworthy and one too in many ways remarkable she had taken her outlook into life weighing the things which she had and those which she had not in a manner very unusual and as a rule not always desirable for a young lady the things which she had not were very many she had not society she had not a fortune she had not any assurance of future means of livelihood she had not high hope of procuring for herself a position in life by marriage she had not that excitement and pleasure in life which she read of in such books as found their way down to oxney colne parsonage it would be easy to add to the list of the things which she had not and this list against herself she made out with the utmost vigour the things which she had or those rather which she assured herself of having were much more easily counted she had the birth and education of a lady the strength of a healthy woman and a will of her own such was the list as she made it out for herself and i protest that i assert no more than the truth in saying that she never added to it either beauty wit or talent i began these descriptions by saying that oxney colne would of all places be the best spot from which a tourist could visit those parts of devonshire but for the fact that he could obtain there none of the accommodation which tourists require a brother antiquarian might perhaps in those days have done so seeing that there was as i have said a spare bedroom at the parsonage any intimate friend of miss le smyrgers might be as fortunate for she was equally well provided at oxney combe by which name her house was known but miss le smyrger was not given to extensive hospitality and it was only to those who were bound to her either by ties of blood or of very old friendship that she delighted to open her doors as her old friends were very few in number as those few lived at a distance and as her nearest relations were higher in the world than she was and were said by herself to look down upon her the visits made to oxney combe were few and far between but now at the period of which i am writing such a visit was about to be made miss le smyrger had a younger sister who had inherited a property in the parish of oxney colne equal to that of the lady who now lived there but this the younger sister had inherited beauty also and she therefore in early life had found sundry lovers one of whom became her husband she had married a man even then well to do in the world but now rich and almost mighty a member of parliament a lord of this and that board a man who had a house in eaton square and a park in the north of england and in this way her course of life had been very much divided from that of our miss le smyrger but the lord of the government board had been blessed with various children and perhaps it was now thought expedient to look after aunt penelopes devonshire acres aunt penelope was empowered to leave them to whom she pleased and though it was thought in eaton square that she must as a matter of course leave them to one of the family nevertheless a little cousinly intercourse might make the thing more certain i will not say that this was the sole cause of such a visit but in these days a visit was to be made by captain broughton to his aunt now captain john broughton was the second son of alfonso broughton of clapham park and eaton square member of parliament and lord of the aforesaid government board and what do you mean to do with him patience woolsworthy asked of miss le smyrger when that lady walked over from the combe to say that her nephew john was to arrive on the following morning do with him why i shall bring him over here to talk to your father hell be too fashionable for that and papa wont trouble his head about him if he finds that he doesnt care for dartmoor then he may fall in love with you my dear well yes theres that resource at any rate and for your sake i dare say i should be more civil to him than papa but hell soon get tired of making love and what youll do then i cannot imagine that miss woolsworthy felt no interest in the coming of the captain i will not pretend to say the advent of any stranger with whom she would be called on to associate must be matter of interest to her in that secluded place and she was not so absolutely unlike other young ladies that the arrival of an unmarried young man would be the same to her as the advent of some patriarchal paterfamilias in taking that outlook into life of which i have spoken she had never said to herself that she despised those things from which other girls received the excitement the joys and the disappointment of their lives she had simply given herself to understand that very little of such things would come her way and that it behoved her to liveto live happily if such might be possiblewithout experiencing the need of them she had heard when there was no thought of any such visit to oxney colne that john broughton was a handsome clever manone who thought much of himself and was thought much of by othersthat there had been some talk of his marrying a great heiress which marriage however had not taken place through unwillingness on his part and that he was on the whole a man of more mark in the world than the ordinary captain of ordinary regiments captain broughton came to oxney combe stayed there a fortnightthe intended period for his projected visit having been fixed at three or four daysand then went his way he went his way back to his london haunts the time of the year then being the close of the easter holidays but as he did so he told his aunt that he should assuredly return to her in the autumn and assuredly i shall be happy to see you johnif you come with a certain purpose if you have no such purpose you had better remain away i shall assuredly come the captain had replied and then he had gone on his journey the summer passed rapidly by and very little was said between miss le smyrger and miss woolsworthy about captain broughton in many respectsnay i may say as to all ordinary matters no two women could well be more intimate with each other than they wereand more than that they had the courage each to talk to the other with absolute truth as to things concerning themselvesa courage in which dear friends often fail but nevertheless very little was said between them about captain john broughton all that was said may be here repeated john says that he shall return here in august miss le smyrger said as patience was sitting with her in the parlour at oxney combe on the morning after that gentlemans departure he told me so himself said patience and as she spoke her round dark eyes assumed a look of more than ordinary selfwill if miss le smyrger had intended to carry the conversation any further she changed her mind as she looked at her companion then as i said the summer ran by and towards the close of the warm days of july miss le smyrger sitting in the same chair in the same room again took up the conversation i got a letter from john this morning he says that he shall be here on the third does he he is very punctual to the time he named yes i fancy that he is a punctual man said patience i hope that you will be glad to see him said miss le smyrger very glad to see him said patience with a bold clear voice and then the conversation was again dropped and nothing further was said till after captain broughtons second arrival in the parish four months had then passed since his departure and during that time miss woolsworthy had performed all her usual daily duties in their accustomed course no one could discover that she had been less careful in her household matters than had been her wont less willing to go among her poor neighbours or less assiduous in her attentions to her father but not the less was there a feeling in the minds of those around her that some great change had come upon her she would sit during the long summer evenings on a certain spot outside the parsonage orchard at the top of a small sloping field in which their solitary cow was always pastured with a book on her knees before her but rarely reading there she would sit with the beautiful view down to the winding river below her watching the setting sun and thinking thinking thinkingthinking of something of which she had never spoken often would miss le smyrger come upon her there and sometimes would pass by her even without a word but nevernever once did she dare to ask her of the matter of her thoughts but she knew the matter well enough no confession was necessary to inform her that patience woolsworthy was in love with john broughtonay in love to the full and entire loss of her whole heart on one evening she was so sitting till the july sun had fallen and hidden himself for the night when her father came upon her as he returned from one of his rambles on the moor patty he said you are always sitting there now is it not late will you not be cold no papa said she i shall not be cold but wont you come to the house i miss you when you come in so late that theres no time to say a word before we go to bed she got up and followed him into the parsonage and when they were in the sittingroom together and the door was closed she came up to him and kissed him papa she said would it make you very unhappy if i were to leave you leave me he said startled by the serious and almost solemn tone of her voice do you mean for always if i were to marry papa oh marry no that would not make me unhappy it would make me very happy patty to see you married to a man you would lovevery very happy though my days would be desolate without you that is it papa what would you do if i went from you what would it matter patty i should be free at any rate from a load which often presses heavy on me now what will you do when i shall leave you a few more years and all will be over with me but who is it love has anybody said anything to you it was only an idea papa i dont often think of such a thing but i did think of it then and so the subject was allowed to pass by this had happened before the day of the second arrival had been absolutely fixed and made known to miss woolsworthy and then that second arrival took place the reader may have understood from the words with which miss le smyrger authorised her nephew to make his second visit to oxney combe that miss woolsworthys passion was not altogether unauthorised captain broughton had been told that he was not to come unless he came with a certain purpose and having been so told he still persisted in coming there can be no doubt but that he well understood the purport to which his aunt alluded i shall assuredly come he had said and true to his word he was now there patience knew exactly the hour at which he must arrive at the station at newton abbot and the time also which it would take to travel over those twelve uphill miles from the station to oxney it need hardly be said that she paid no visit to miss le smyrgers house on that afternoon but she might have known something of captain broughtons approach without going thither his road to the combe passed by the parsonagegate and had patience sat even at her bedroom window she must have seen him but on such a morning she would not sit at her bedroom windowshe would do nothing which would force her to accuse herself of a restless longing for her lovers coming it was for him to seek her if he chose to do so he knew the way to the parsonage miss le smyrgergood dear honest hearty miss le smyrger was in a fever of anxiety on behalf of her friend it was not that she wished her nephew to marry patienceor rather that she had entertained any such wish when he first came among them she was not given to matchmaking and moreover thought or had thought within herself that they of oxney colne could do very well without any admixture from eaton square her plan of life had been that when old mr woolsworthy was taken away from dartmoor patience should live with her and that when she also shuffled off her coil then patience woolsworthy should be the maiden mistress of oxney combeof oxney combe and mr cloyseys farmto the utter detriment of all the broughtons such had been her plan before nephew john had come among thema plan not to be spoken of till the coming of that dark day which should make patience an orphan but now her nephew had been there and all was to be altered miss le smyrgers plan would have provided a companion for her old age but that had not been her chief object she had thought more of patience than of herself and now it seemed that a prospect of a higher happiness was opening for her friend john she said as soon as the first greetings were over do you remember the last words that i said to you before you went away now for myself i much admire miss le smyrgers heartiness but i do not think much of her discretion it would have been better perhaps had she allowed things to take their course i cant say that i do said the captain at the same time the captain did remember very well what those last words had been i am so glad to see you so delighted to see you ififif and then she paused for with all her courage she hardly dared to ask her nephew whether he had come there with the express purpose of asking miss woolsworthy to marry him to tell the truth for there is no room for mystery within the limits of this short storyto tell i say at a word the plain and simple truth captain broughton had already asked that question on the day before he left oxney colne he had in set terms proposed to the parsons daughter and indeed the words the hot and frequent words which previously to that had fallen like sweetest honey into the ears of patience woolsworthy had made it imperative on him to do so when a man in such a place as that has talked to a girl of love day after day must not he talk of it to some definite purpose on the day on which he leaves her or if he do not must he not submit to be regarded as false selfish and almost fraudulent captain broughton however had asked the question honestly and truly he had done so honestly and truly but in words or perhaps simply with a tone that had hardly sufficed to satisfy the proud spirit of the girl he loved she by that time had confessed to herself that she loved him with all her heart but she had made no such confession to him to him she had spoken no word granted no favour that any lover might rightfully regard as a token of love returned she had listened to him as he spoke and bade him keep such sayings for the drawingrooms of his fashionable friends then he had spoken out and had asked for that handnot perhaps as a suitor tremulous with hopebut as a rich man who knows that he can command that which he desires to purchase you should think more of this she had said to him at last if you would really have me for your wife it will not be much to you to return here again when time for thinking of it shall have passed by with these words she had dismissed him and now he had again come back to oxney colne but still she would not place herself at the window to look for him nor dress herself in other than her simple morning country dress nor omit one item of her daily work if he wished to take her at all he should wish to take her as she really was in her plain country life but he should take her also with full observance of all those privileges which maidens are allowed to claim from their lovers he should contract no ceremonious observance because she was the daughter of a poor country parson who would come to him without a shilling whereas he stood high in the worlds books he had asked her to give him all that she had and that all she was ready to give without stint but the gift must be valued before it could be given or received he also was to give her as much and she would accept it as beyond all price but she would not allow that that which was offered to her was in any degree the more precious because of his outward worldly standing she would not pretend to herself that she thought he would come to her that day and therefore she busied herself in the kitchen and about the house giving directions to her two maids as though the afternoon would pass as all other days did pass in that household they usually dined at four and she rarely in these summer months went far from the house before that hour at four precisely she sat down with her father and then said that she was going up as far as helpholme after dinner helpholme was a solitary farmhouse in another parish on the border of the moor and mr woolsworthy asked her whether he should accompany her do papa she said if you are not too tired and yet she had thought how probable it might be that she should meet john broughton on her walk and so it was arranged but just as dinner was over mr woolsworthy remembered himself gracious me he said how my memory is going gribbles from ivybridge and old john poulter from bovey are coming to meet here by appointment you cant put helpholme off till tomorrow patience however never put off anything and therefore at six oclock when her father had finished his slender modicum of toddy she tied on her hat and went on her walk she started with a quick step and left no word to say by which route she would go as she passed up along the little lane which led towards oxney combe she would not even look to see if he was coming towards her and when she left the road passing over a stone stile into a little path which ran first through the upland fields and then across the moor ground towards helpholme she did not look back once or listen for his coming step she paid her visit remaining upwards of an hour with the old bedridden mother of the tenant of helpholme god bless you my darling said the old woman as she left her and send you some one to make your own path bright and happy through the world these words were still ringing in her ears with all their significance as she saw john broughton waiting for her at the first stile which she had to pass after leaving the farmers haggard patty he said as he took her hand and held it close within both his own what a chase i have had after you and who asked you captain broughton she answered smiling if the journey was too much for your poor london strength could you not have waited till tomorrow morning when you would have found me at the parsonage but she did not draw her hand away from him or in any way pretend that he had not a right to accost her as a lover no i could not wait i am more eager to see those i love than you seem to be how do you know whom i love or how eager i might be to see them there is an old woman there whom i love and i have thought nothing of this walk with the object of seeing her and now slowly drawing her hand away from him she pointed to the farmhouse which she had left patty he said after a minutes pause during which she had looked full into his face with all the force of her bright eyes i have come from london today straight down here to oxney and from my aunts house close upon your footsteps after you to ask you that one questiondo you love me what a hercules she said again laughing do you really mean that you left london only this morning why you must have been five hours in a railway carriage and two in a postchaise not to talk of the walk afterwards you ought to take more care of yourself captain broughton he would have been angry with herfor he did not like to be quizzedhad she not put her hand on his arm as she spoke and the softness of her touch had redeemed the offence of her words all that i have done said he that i may hear one word from you that any word of mine should have such potency but let us walk on or my father will take us for some of the standing stones of the moor how have you found your aunt if you only knew the cares that have sat on her dear shoulders for the last week past in order that your high mightiness might have a sufficiency to eat and drink in these desolate halfstarved regions she might have saved herself such anxiety no one can care less for such things than i do and yet i think i have heard you boast of the cook of your club and then again there was silence for a minute or two patty said he stopping again in the path answer my question i have a right to demand an answer do you love me and what if i do what if i have been so silly as to allow your perfections to be too many for my weak heart what then captain broughton it cannot be that you love me or you would not joke now perhaps not indeed she said it seemed as though she were resolved not to yield an inch in her own humour and then again they walked on patty he said once more i shall get an answer from you tonightthis evening now during this walk or i shall return tomorrow and never revisit this spot again oh captain broughton how should we ever manage to live without you very well he said up to the end of this walk i can bear it alland one word spoken then will mend it all during the whole of this time she felt that she was illusing him she knew that she loved him with all her heart that it would nearly kill her to part with him that she had heard his renewed offer with an ecstacy of joy she acknowledged to herself that he was giving proof of his devotion as strong as any which a girl could receive from her lover and yet she could hardly bring herself to say the word he longed to hear that word once said and then she knew that she must succumb to her love for ever that word once said and there would be nothing for her but to spoil him with her idolatry that word once said and she must continue to repeat it into his ears till perhaps he might be tired of hearing it and now he had threatened her and how could she speak after that she certainly would not speak it unless he asked her again without such threat and so they walked on in silence patty he said at last by the heavens above us you shall answer me do you love me she now stood still and almost trembled as she looked up into his face she stood opposite to him for a moment and then placing her two hands on his shoulders she answered him i do i do i do she said with all my heart with all my heartwith all my heart and strength and then her head fell upon his breast captain broughton was almost as much surprised as delighted by the warmth of the acknowledgment made by the eagerhearted passionate girl whom he now held within his arms she had said it now the words had been spoken and there was nothing for her but to swear to him over and over again with her sweetest oaths that those words were truetrue as her soul and very sweet was the walk down from thence to the parsonage gate he spoke no more of the distance of the ground or the length of his days journey but he stopped her at every turn that he might press her arm the closer to his own that he might look into the brightness of her eyes and prolong his hour of delight there were no more gibes now on her tongue no raillery at his london finery no laughing comments on his coming and going with downright honesty she told him everything how she had loved him before her heart was warranted in such a passion how with much thinking she had resolved that it would be unwise to take him at his first word and had thought it better that he should return to london and then think over it how she had almost repented of her courage when she had feared during those long summer days that he would forget her and how her heart had leapt for joy when her old friend had told her that he was coming and yet said he you were not glad to see me oh was i not glad you cannot understand the feelings of a girl who has lived secluded as i have done glad is no word for the joy i felt but it was not seeing you that i cared for so much it was the knowledge that you were near me once again i almost wish now that i had not seen you till tomorrow but as she spoke she pressed his arm and this caress gave the lie to her last words no do not come in tonight she said when she reached the little wicket that led up to the parsonage indeed you shall not i could not behave myself properly if you did but i dont want you to behave properly oh i am to keep that for london am i but nevertheless captain broughton i will not invite you either to tea or to supper tonight surely i may shake hands with your father not tonightnot till john i may tell him may i not i must tell him at once certainly said he and then you shall see him tomorrow let me seeat what hour shall i bid you come to breakfast no indeed what on earth would your aunt do with her broiled turkey and the cold pie i have got no cold pie for you i hate cold pie what a pity but john i should be forced to leave you directly after breakfast come downcome down at two or three and then i will go back with you to aunt penelope i must see her tomorrow and so at last the matter was settled and the happy captain as he left her was hardly resisted in his attempt to press her lips to his own when she entered the parlour in which her father was sitting there still were gribbles and poulter discussing some knotty point of devon lore so patience took off her hat and sat herself down waiting till they should go for full an hour she had to wait and then gribbles and poulter did go but it was not in such matters as this that patience woolsworthy was impatient she could wait and wait and wait curbing herself for weeks and months while the thing waited for was in her eyes good but she could not curb her hot thoughts or her hot words when things came to be discussed which she did not think to be good papa she said when gribbles longdrawn last word had been spoken at the door do you remember how i asked you the other day what you would say if i were to leave you yes surely he replied looking up at her in astonishment i am going to leave you now she said dear dearest father how am i to go from you going to leave me said he thinking of her visit to helpholme and thinking of nothing else now there had been a story about helpholme that bedridden old lady there had a stalwart son who was now the owner of the helpholme pastures but though owner in fee of all those wild acres and of the cattle which they supported he was not much above the farmers around him either in manners or education he had his merits however for he was honest welltodo in the world and modest withal how strong love had grown up springing from neighbourly kindness between our patience and his mother it needs not here to tell but rising from it had come another loveor an ambition which might have grown to love the young man after much thought had not dared to speak to miss woolsworthy but he had sent a message by miss le smyrger if there could be any hope for him he would present himself as a suitoron trial he did not owe a shilling in the world and had money by himsaved he wouldnt ask the parson for a shilling of fortune such had been the tenor of his message and miss le smyrger had delivered it faithfully he does not mean it patience had said with her stern voice indeed he does my dear you may be sure he is in earnest miss le smyrger had replied and there is not an honester man in these parts tell him said patience not attending to the latter portion of her friends last speech that it cannot bemake him understand you knowand tell him also that the matter shall be thought of no more the matter had at any rate been spoken of no more but the young farmer still remained a bachelor and helpholme still wanted a mistress but all this came back upon the parsons mind when his daughter told him that she was about to leave him yes dearest she said and as she spoke she now knelt at his knees i have been asked in marriage and i have given myself away well my love if you will be happy i hope i shall i think i shall but you papa you will not be far from us oh yes in london in london captain broughton lives in london generally and has captain broughton asked you to marry him yes papawho else is he not good will you not love him oh papa do not say that i am wrong to love him he never told her his mistake or explained to her that he had not thought it possible that the highplaced son of the london great man should have fallen in love with his undowered daughter but he embraced her and told her with all his enthusiasm that he rejoiced in her joy and would be happy in her happiness my own patty he said i have ever known that you were too good for this life of ours here and then the evening wore away into the night with many tears but still with much happiness captain broughton as he walked back to oxney combe made up his mind that he would say nothing on the matter to his aunt till the next morning he wanted to think over it all and to think it over if possible by himself he had taken a step in life the most important that a man is ever called on to take and he had to reflect whether or no he had taken it with wisdom have you seen her said miss le smyrger very anxiously when he came into the drawingroom miss woolsworthy you mean said he yes ive seen her as i found her out i took a long walk and happened to meet her do you know aunt i think ill go to bed i was up at five this morning and have been on the move ever since miss le smyrger perceived that she was to hear nothing that evening so she handed him his candlestick and allowed him to go to his room but captain broughton did not immediately retire to bed nor when he did so was he able to sleep at once had this step that he had taken been a wise one he was not a man who in worldly matters had allowed things to arrange themselves for him as is the case with so many men he had formed views for himself and had a theory of life money for moneys sake he had declared to himself to be bad money as a concomitant to things which were in themselves good he had declared to himself to be good also that concomitant in this affair of his marriage he had now missed well he had made up his mind to that and would put up with the loss he had means of living of his own the means not so extensive as might have been desirable that it would be well for him to become a married man looking merely to the state of life as opposed to his present state he had fully resolved on that point therefore there was nothing to repent that patty woolsworthy was good affectionate clever and beautiful he was sufficiently satisfied it would be odd indeed if he were not so satisfied now seeing that for the last four months he had so declared to himself daily with many inward asseverations and yet though he repeated now again that he was satisfied i do not think that he was so fully satisfied of it as he had been throughout the whole of those four months it is sad to say so but i feari fear that such was the case when you have your plaything how much of the anticipated pleasure vanishes especially if it be won easily he had told none of his family what were his intentions in this second visit to devonshire and now he had to bethink himself whether they would be satisfied what would his sister say she who had married the honourable augustus gumbleton goldstickinwaiting to her majestys privy council would she receive patience with open arms and make much of her about london and then how far would london suit patience or would patience suit london there would be much for him to do in teaching her and it would be well for him to set about the lesson without loss of time so far he got that night but when the morning came he went a step further and began mentally to criticise her manner to himself it had been very sweet that warm that full that ready declaration of love yes it had been very sweet butbut when after her little jokes she did confess her love had she not been a little too free for feminine excellence a man likes to be told that he is loved but he hardly wishes that the girl he is to marry should fling herself at his head ah me yes it was thus he argued to himself as on that morning he went through the arrangements of his toilet then he was a brute you say my pretty reader i have never said that he was not a brute but this i remark that many such brutes are to be met with in the beaten paths of the worlds highway when patience woolsworthy had answered him coldly bidding him go back to london and think over his love while it seemed from her manner that at any rate as yet she did not care for him while he was absent from her and therefore longing for her the possession of her charms her talent and bright honesty of purpose had seemed to him a thing most desirable now they were his own they had in fact been his own from the first the heart of this countrybred girl had fallen at the first word from his mouth had she not so confessed to him she was very nicevery nice indeed he loved her dearly but had he not sold himself too cheaply i by no means say that he was not a brute but whether brute or no he was an honest man and had no remotest dream either then on that morning or during the following days on which such thoughts pressed more quickly on his mindof breaking away from his pledged word at breakfast on that morning he told all to miss le smyrger and that lady with warm and gracious intentions confided to him her purpose regarding her property i have always regarded patience as my heir she said and shall do so still oh indeed said captain broughton but it is a great great pleasure to me to think that she will give back the little property to my sisters child you will have your mothers and thus it will all come together again ah said captain broughton he had his own ideas about property and did not even under existing circumstances like to hear that his aunt considered herself at liberty to leave the acres away to one who was by blood quite a stranger to the family does patience know of this he asked not a word said miss le smyrger and then nothing more was said upon the subject on that afternoon he went down and received the parsons benediction and congratulations with a good grace patience said very little on the occasion and indeed was absent during the greater part of the interview the two lovers then walked up to oxney combe and there were more benedictions and more congratulations all went merry as a marriage bell at any rate as far as patience was concerned not a word had yet fallen from that dear mouth not a look had yet come over that handsome face which tended in any way to mar her bliss her first day of acknowledged love was a day altogether happy and when she prayed for him as she knelt beside her bed there was no feeling in her mind that any fear need disturb her joy i will pass over the next three or four days very quickly merely saying that patience did not find them so pleasant as that first day after her engagement there was something in her lovers mannersomething which at first she could not definewhich by degrees seemed to grate against her feelings he was sufficiently affectionate that being a matter on which she did not require much demonstration but joined to his affection there seemed to be she hardly liked to suggest to herself a harsh word but could it be possible that he was beginning to think that she was not good enough for him and then she asked herself the questionwas she good enough for him if there were doubt about that the match should be broken off though she tore her own heart out in the struggle the truth however was thisthat he had begun that teaching which he had already found to be so necessary now had any one essayed to teach patience german or mathematics with that young ladys free consent i believe that she would have been found a meek scholar but it was not probable that she would be meek when she found a selfappointed tutor teaching her manners and conduct without her consent so matters went on for four or five days and on the evening of the fifth day captain broughton and his aunt drank tea at the parsonage nothing very especial occurred but as the parson and miss le smyrger insisted on playing backgammon with devoted perseverance during the whole evening broughton had a good opportunity of saying a word or two about those changes in his ladylove which a life in london would requireand some word he said alsosome single slight word as to the higher station in life to which he would exalt his bride patience bore itfor her father and miss le smyrger were in the roomshe bore it well speaking no syllable of anger and enduring for the moment the implied scorn of the old parsonage then the evening broke up and captain broughton walked back to oxney combe with his aunt patty her father said to her before they went to bed he seems to me to be a most excellent young man dear papa she answered kissing him and terribly deep in love said mr woolsworthy oh i dont know about that she answered as she left him with her sweetest smile but though she could thus smile at her fathers joke she had already made up her mind that there was still something to be learned as to her promised husband before she could place herself altogether in his hands she would ask him whether he thought himself liable to injury from this proposed marriage and though he should deny any such thought she would know from the manner of his denial what his true feelings were and he too on that night during his silent walk with miss le smyrger had entertained some similar thoughts i fear she is obstinate he said to himself and then he had half accused her of being sullen also if that be her temper what a life of misery i have before me have you fixed a day yet his aunt asked him as they came near to her house no not yet i dont know whether it will suit me to fix it before i leave why it was but the other day you were in such a hurry ahyesi have thought more about it since then i should have imagined that this would depend on what patty thinks said miss le smyrger standing up for the privileges of her sex it is presumed that the gentleman is always ready as soon as the lady will consent yes in ordinary cases it is so but when a girl is taken out of her own sphere her own sphere let me caution you master john not to talk to patty about her own sphere aunt penelope as patience is to be my wife and not yours i must claim permission to speak to her on such subjects as may seem suitable to me and then they partednot in the best humour with each other on the following day captain broughton and miss woolsworthy did not meet till the evening she had said before those few illomened words had passed her lovers lips that she would probably be at miss le smyrgers house on the following morning those illomened words did pass her lovers lips and then she remained at home this did not come from sullenness nor even from anger but from a conviction that it would be well that she should think much before she met him again nor was he anxious to hurry a meeting his thoughthis base thoughtwas this that she would be sure to come up to the combe after him but she did not come and therefore in the evening he went down to her and asked her to walk with him they went away by the path that led to helpholme and little was said between them till they had walked some mile together patience as she went along the path remembered almost to the letter the sweet words which had greeted her ears as she came down that way with him on the night of his arrival but he remembered nothing of that sweetness then had he not made an ass of himself during these last six months that was the thought which very much had possession of his mind patience he said at last having hitherto spoken only an indifferent word now and again since they had left the parsonage patience i hope you realise the importance of the step which you and i are about to take of course i do she answered what an odd question that is for you to ask because said he sometimes i almost doubt it it seems to me as though you thought you could remove yourself from here to your new home with no more trouble than when you go from home up to the combe is that meant for a reproach john no not for a reproach but for advice certainly not for a reproach i am glad of that but i should wish to make you think how great is the leap in the world which you are about to take then again they walked on for many steps before she answered him tell me then john she said when she had sufficiently considered what words she should speak and as she spoke a bright colour suffused her face and her eyes flashed almost with anger what leap do you mean do you mean a leap upwards well yes i hope it will be so in one sense certainly it would be a leap upwards to be the wife of the man i loved to have the privilege of holding his happiness in my hand to know that i was his ownthe companion whom he had chosen out of all the worldthat would indeed be a leap upwards a leap almost to heaven it all that were so but if you mean upwards in any other sense i was thinking of the social scale then captain broughton your thoughts were doing me dishonour doing you dishonour yes doing me dishonour that your father is in the worlds esteem a greater man than mine is doubtless true enough that you as a man are richer than i am as a woman is doubtless also true but you dishonour me and yourself also if these things can weigh with you now patiencei think you can hardly know what words you are saying to me pardon me but i think i do nothing that you can give meno gifts of that descriptioncan weigh aught against that which i am giving you if you had all the wealth and rank of the greatest lord in the land it would count as nothing in such a scale ifas i have not doubtedif in return for my heart you have given me yours thenthenthen you have paid me fully but when gifts such as those are going nothing else can count even as a makeweight i do not quite understand you he answered after a pause i fear you are a little highflown and then while the evening was still early they walked back to the parsonage almost without another word captain broughton at this time had only one full day more to remain at oxney colne on the afternoon following that he was to go as far as exeter and thence return to london of course it was to be expected that the wedding day would be fixed before he went and much had been said about it during the first day or two of his engagement then he had pressed for an early time and patience with a girls usual diffidence had asked for some little delay but now nothing was said on the subject and how was it probable that such a matter could be settled after such a conversation as that which i have related that evening miss le smyrger asked whether the day had been fixed no said captain broughton harshly nothing has been fixed but it will be arranged before you go probably not he said and then the subject was dropped for the time john she said just before she went to bed if there be anything wrong between you and patience i conjure you to tell me you had better ask her he replied i can tell you nothing on the following morning he was much surprised by seeing patience on the gravel path before miss le smyrgers gate immediately after breakfast he went to the door to open it for her and she as she gave him her hand told him that she came up to speak to him there was no hesitation in her manner nor any look of anger in her face but there was in her gait and form in her voice and countenance a fixedness of purpose which he had never seen before or at any rate had never acknowledged certainly said he shall i come out with you or will you come up stairs we can sit down in the summerhouse she said and thither they both went captain broughton she saidand she began her task the moment that they were both seatedyou and i have engaged ourselves as man and wife but perhaps we have been over rash how so said he it may beand indeed i will say moreit is the case that we have made this engagement without knowing enough of each others character i have not thought so the time will perhaps come when you will so think but for the sake of all that we most value let it come before it is too late what would be our fatehow terrible would be our miseryif such a thought should come to either of us after we have linked our lots together there was a solemnity about her as she thus spoke which almost repressed himwhich for a time did prevent him from taking that tone of authority which on such a subject he would choose to adopt but he recovered himself i hardly think that this comes well from you he said from whom else should it come who else can fight my battle for me and john who else can fight that same battle on your behalf i tell you this that with your mind standing towards me as it does stand at present you could not give me your hand at the altar with true words and a happy conscience am i not true you have half repented of your bargain already is it not so he did not answer her but getting up from his seat walked to the front of the summerhouse and stood there with his back turned upon her it was not that he meant to be ungracious but in truth he did not know how to answer her he had half repented of his bargain john she said getting up and following him so that she could put her hand upon his arm i have been very angry with you angry with me he said turning sharp upon her yes angry with you you would have treated me like a child but that feeling has gone now i am not angry now there is my handthe hand of a friend let the words that have been spoken between us be as though they had not been spoken let us both be free do you mean it certainly i mean it as she spoke these words her eyes filled with tears in spite of all the efforts she could make but he was not looking at her and her efforts had sufficed to prevent any sob from being audible with all my heart he said and it was manifest from his tone that he had no thought of her happiness as he spoke it was true that she had been angry with himangry as she had herself declared but nevertheless in what she had said and what she had done she had thought more of his happiness than of her own now she was angry once again with all your heart captain broughton well so be it if with all your heart then is the necessity so much the greater you go tomorrow shall we say farewell now patience i am not going to be lectured certainly not by me shall we say farewell now yes if you are determined i am determined farewell captain broughton you have all my wishes for your happiness and she held out her hand to him patience he said and he looked at her with a dark frown as though he would strive to frighten her into submission if so he might have saved himself any such attempt farewell captain broughton give me your hand for i cannot stay he gave her his hand hardly knowing why he did so she lifted it to her lips and kissed it and then leaving him passed from the summerhouse down through the wicketgate and straight home to the parsonage during the whole of that day she said no word to any one of what had occurred when she was once more at home she went about her household affairs as she had done on that day of his arrival when she sat down to dinner with her father he observed nothing to make him think that she was unhappy nor during the evening was there any expression in her face or any tone in her voice which excited his attention on the following morning captain broughton called at the parsonage and the servantgirl brought word to her mistress that he was in the parlour but she would not see him laws miss you aint a quarrelled with your beau the poor girl said no not quarrelled she said but give him that it was a scrap of paper containing a word or two in pencil it is better that we should not meet again god bless you and from that day to this now more than ten years they never have met papa she said to her father that afternoon dear papa do not be angry with me it is all over between me and john broughton dearest you and i will not be separated it would be useless here to tell how great was the old mans surprise and how true his sorrow as the tale was told to him no cause was given for anger with any one not a word was spoken against the suitor who had on that day returned to london with a full conviction that now at least he was relieved from his engagement patty my darling child he said may god grant that it be for the best it is for the best she answered stoutly for this place i am fit and i much doubt whether i am fit for any other on that day she did not see miss le smyrger but on the following morning knowing that captain broughton had gone off having heard the wheels of the carriage as they passed by the parsonage gate on his way to the stationshe walked up to the combe he has told you i suppose said she yes said miss le smyrger and i will never see him again unless he asks your pardon on his knees i have told him so i would not even give him my hand as he went but why so thou kindest one the fault was mine more than his i understand i have eyes in my head said the old maid i have watched him for the last four or five days if you could have kept the truth to yourself and bade him keep off from you he would have been at your feet now licking the dust from your shoes but dear friend i do not want a man to lick dust from my shoes ah you are a fool you do not know the value of your own wealth true i have been a fool i was a fool to think that one coming from such a life as he has led could be happy with such as i am i know the truth now i have bought the lesson dearlybut perhaps not too dearly seeing that it will never be forgotten there was but little more said about the matter between our three friends at oxney colne what indeed could be said miss le smyrger for a year or two still expected that her nephew would return and claim his bride but he has never done so nor has there been any correspondence between them patience woolsworthy had learned her lesson dearly she had given her whole heart to the man and though she so bore herself that no one was aware of the violence of the struggle nevertheless the struggle within her bosom was very violent she never told herself that she had done wrong she never regretted her loss but yetyetthe loss was very hard to bear he also had loved her but he was not capable of a love which could much injure his daily peace her daily peace was gone for many a day to come her father is still living but there is a curate now in the parish in conjunction with him and with miss le smyrger she spends her time in the concerns of the parish in her own eyes she is a confirmed old maid and such is my opinion also the romance of her life was played out in that summer she never sits now lonely on the hillside thinking how much she might do for one whom she really loved but with a large heart she loves many and with no romance she works hard to lighten the burdens of those she loves as for captain broughton all the world know that he did marry that great heiress with whom his name was once before connected and that he is now a useful member of parliament working on committees three or four days a week with a zeal that is indefatigable sometimes not often as he thinks of patience woolsworthy a gratified smile comes across his face george walker at suez of all the spots on the worlds surface that i george walker of friday street london have ever visited suez in egypt at the head of the red sea is by far the vilest the most unpleasant and the least interesting there are no women there no water and no vegetation it is surrounded and indeed often filled by a world of sand a scorching sun is always overhead and one is domiciled in a huge cavernous hotel which seems to have been made purposely destitute of all the comforts of civilised life nevertheless in looking back upon the week of my life which i spent there i always enjoy a certain sort of triumphor rather upon one day of that week which lends a sort of halo not only to my sojourn at suez but to the whole period of my residence in egypt i am free to confess that i am not a great man and that at any rate in the earlier part of my career i had a hankering after the homage which is paid to greatness i would fain have been a popular orator feeding myself on the incense tendered to me by thousands or failing that a man born to power whom those around him were compelled to respect and perhaps to fear i am not ashamed to acknowledge this and i believe that most of my neighbours in friday street would own as much were they as candid and openhearted as myself it is now some time since i was recommended to pass the first four months of the year in cairo because i had a sorethroat the doctor may have been right but i shall never divest myself of the idea that my partners wished to be rid of me while they made certain changes in the management of the firm they would not otherwise have shown such interest every time i blew my nose or relieved my huskiness by a slight coughthey would not have been so intimate with that surgeon from st bartholomews who dined with them twice at the albion nor would they have gone to work directly that my back was turned and have done those very things which they could not have done had i remained at home be that as it may i was frightened and went to cairo and while there i made a trip to suez for a week i was not happy at cairo for i knew nobody there and the people at the hotel were as i thought uncivil it seemed to me as though i were allowed to go in and out merely by sufferance and yet i paid my bill regularly every week the house was full of company but the company was made up of parties of twos and threes and they all seemed to have their own friends i did make attempts to overcome that terrible british exclusiveness that noli me tangere with which an englishman arms himself and in which he thinks it necessary to envelop his wife but it was in vain and i found myself sitting down to breakfast and dinner day after day as much alone as i should do if i called for a chop at a separate table in the cathedral coffeehouse and yet at breakfast and dinner i made one of an assemblage of thirty or forty people that i thought dull but as i stood one morning on the steps before the hotel bethinking myself that my throat was as well as ever i remembered it to be i was suddenly slapped on the back never in my life did i feel a more pleasant sensation or turn round with more unaffected delight to return a friends greeting it was as though a cup of water had been handed to me in the desert i knew that a cargo of passengers for australia had reached cairo that morning and were to be passed on to suez as soon as the railway would take them and did not therefore expect that the greeting had come from any sojourner in egypt i should perhaps have explained that the even tenor of our life at the hotel was disturbed some four times a month by a flight through cairo of a flock of travellers who like locusts eat up all that there was eatable at the inn for the day they sat down at the same tables with us never mixing with us having their separate interests and hopes and being often as i thought somewhat loud and almost selfish in the expression of them these flocks consisted of passengers passing and repassing by the overland route to and from india and australia and had i nothing else to tell i should delight to describe all that i watched of their habits and mannersthe outward bound being so different in their traits from their brethren on their return but i have to tell of my own triumph at suez and must therefore hasten on to say that on turning round quickly with my outstretched hand i found it clasped by john robinson well robinson is this you holloa walker what are you doing here that of course was the style of greeting elsewhere i should not have cared much to meet john robinson for he was a man who had never done well in the world he had been in business and connected with a fairly good house in sise lane but he had married early and things had not exactly gone well with him i dont think the house broke but he did and so he was driven to take himself and five children off to australia elsewhere i should not have cared to come across him but i was positively glad to be slapped on the back by anybody on that landingplace in front of shepheards hotel at cairo i soon learned that robinson with his wife and children and indeed with all the rest of the australian cargo were to be passed on to suez that afternoon and after a while i agreed to accompany their party i had made up my mind on coming out from england that i would see all the wonders of egypt and hitherto i had seen nothing i did ride on one day some fifteen miles on a donkey to see the petrified forest but the guide who called himself a dragoman took me wrong or cheated me in some way we rode half the day over a stony sandy plain seeing nothing with a terrible wind that filled my mouth with grit and at last the dragoman got off dere said he picking up a small bit of stone dis is de forest made of stone carry that home then we turned round and rode back to cairo my chief observation as to the country was thisthat whichever way we went the wind blew into our teeth the days work cost me fiveandtwenty shillings and since that i had not as yet made any other expedition i was therefore glad of an opportunity of going to suez and of making the journey in company with an acquaintance at that time the railway was open as far as i remember nearly half the way from cairo to suez it did not run four or five times a day as railways do in other countries but four or five times a month in fact it only carried passengers on the arrival of these flocks passing between england and her eastern possessions there were trains passing backwards and forwards constantly as i perceived in walking to and from the station but as i learned they carried nothing but the labourers working on the line and the water sent into the desert for their use it struck me forcibly at the time that i should not have liked to have money in that investment well i went with robinson to suez the journey like everything else in egypt was sandy hot and unpleasant the railway carriages were pretty fair and we had room enough but even in them the dust was a great nuisance we travelled about ten miles an hour and stopped about an hour at every ten miles this was tedious but we had cigars with us and a trifle of brandy and water and in this manner the railway journey wore itself away in the middle of the night however we were moved from the railway carriages into omnibuses as they were called and then i was not comfortable these omnibuses were wooden boxes placed each upon a pair of wheels and supposed to be capable of carrying six passengers i was thrust into one with robinson his wife and five children and immediately began to repent of my goodnature in accompanying them to each vehicle were attached four horses or mules and i must acknowledge that as on the railway they went as slow as possible so now in these conveyances dragged through the sand they went as fast as the beasts could be made to gallop i remember the fox tallyho coach on the birmingham road when boyce drove it but as regards pace the fox tallyho was nothing to these machines in egypt on the first going off i was jolted right on to mrs r and her infant and for a long time that lady thought that the child had been squeezed out of its proper shape but at last we arrived at suez and the baby seemed to me to be all right when it was handed down into the boat at suez the robinsons were allowed time to breakfast at that cavernous hotelwhich looked to me like a scheme to save the expense of the passengers meal on board the shipand then they were off i shook hands with him heartily as i parted with him at the quay and wished him well through all his troubles a man who takes a wife and five young children out into a colony and that with his pockets but indifferently lined certainly has his trouble before him so he has at home no doubt but judging for myself i should always prefer sticking to the old ship as long as there is a bag of biscuits in the locker poor robinson i have never heard a word of him or his since that day and sincerely trust that the baby was none the worse for the little accident in the box and now i had the prospect of a week before me at suez and the robinsons had not been gone half an hour before i began to feel that i should have been better off even at cairo i secured a bedroom at the hoteli might have secured sixty bedrooms had i wanted themand then went out and stood at the front door or gate it is a large house built round a quadrangle looking with one front towards the head of the red sea and with the other into and on a sandy deadlooking open square there i stood for ten minutes and finding that it was too hot to go forth returned to the long cavernous room in which we had breakfasted in that long cavernous room i was destined to eat all my meals for the next six days now at cairo i could at any rate see my fellowcreatures at their food so i lit a cigar and began to wonder whether i could survive the week it was now clear to me that i had done a very rash thing in coming to suez with the robinsons somebody about the place had asked me my name and i had told it plainlygeorge walker i never was ashamed of my name yet and never had cause to be i believe at this day it will go as far in friday street as any other a man may be popular or he may not that depends mostly on circumstances which are in themselves trifling but the value of his name depends on the way in which he is known at his bank i have never dealt in tea spoons or gravy spoons but my name will go as far as another name george walker i answered therefore in a tone of some little authority to the man who asked me and who sat inside the gate of the hotel in an old dressinggown and slippers that was a melancholy day with me and twenty times before dinner did i wish myself back at cairo i had been travelling all night and therefore hoped that i might get through some little time in sleeping but the mosquitoes attacked me the moment i laid myself down in other places mosquitoes torment you only at night but at suez they buzz around you without ceasing at all hours a scorching sun was blazing overhead and absolutely forbade me to leave the house i stood for a while in the verandah looking down at the few small vessels which were moored to the quay but there was no life in them not a sail was set not a boatman or a sailor was to be seen and the very water looked as though it were hot i could fancy the glare of the sun was cracking the paint on the gunwales of the boats i was the only visitor in the house and during all the long hours of the morning it seemed as though the servants had deserted it i dined at four not that i chose that hour but because no choice was given to me at the hotels in egypt one has to dine at an hour fixed by the landlord and no entreaties will suffice to obtain a meal at any other so at four i dined and after dinner was again reduced to despair i was sitting in the cavernous chamber almost mad at the prospect of the week before me when i heard a noise as of various feet in the passage leading from the quadrangle was it possible that other human beings were coming into the hotelchristian human beings at whom i could look whose voices i could hear whose words i could understand and with whom i might possibly associate i did not move however for i was still hot and i knew that my chances might be better if i did not show myself over eager for companionship at the first moment the door however was soon opened and i saw that at least in one respect i was destined to be disappointed the strangers who were entering the room were not christiansif i might judge by the nature of the garments in which they were clothed the door had been opened by the man in an old dressinggown and slippers whom i had seen sitting inside the gate he was the arab porter of the hotel and as he marshalled the new visitors into the room i heard him pronounce some sound similar to my own name and perceived that he pointed me out to the most prominent person of those who then entered the apartment this was a stout portly man dressed from head to foot in eastern costume of the brightest colours he wore not only the red fez cap which everybody wearseven i had accustomed myself to a fez capbut a turban round it of which the voluminous folds were snowy white his face was fat but not the less grave and the lower part of it was enveloped in a magnificent beard which projected round it on all sides and touched his breast as he walked it was a grand grizzled beard and i acknowledged at a moment that it added a singular dignity to the appearance of the stranger his flowing robe was of bright colours and the under garment which fitted close round his breast and then descended becoming beneath his sash a pair of the loosest pantaloonsi might perhaps better describe them as bagswas a rich tawny silk these loose pantaloons were tied close round his legs above the ankle and over a pair of scrupulously white stockings and on his feet he wore a pair of yellow slippers it was manifest to me at a glance that the arab gentleman was got up in his best raiment and that no expense had been spared on his suit and here i cannot but make a remark on the personal bearing of these arabs whether they be arabs or turks or copts it is always the same they are a mean false cowardly race i believe they will bear blows and respect the man who gives them fear goes further with them than love and between man and man they understand nothing of forbearance he who does not exact from them all that he can exact is simply a fool in their estimation to the extent of that which he loses in all this they are immeasurably inferior to us who have had christian teaching but in one thing they beat us they always know how to maintain their personal dignity look at my friend and partner judkins as he stands with his hands in his trousers pockets at the door of our house in friday street what can be meaner than his appearance he is a stumpy short podgy man but then so also was my arab friend at suez judkins is always dressed from head to foot in a decent black cloth suit his coat is ever a dress coat and is neither old nor shabby on his head he carries a shining new silk hat such as fashion in our metropolis demands judkins is rather a dandy than otherwise piquing himself somewhat on his apparel and yet how mean is his appearance as compared with the appearance of that arabhow mean also is his gait how ignoble his step judkins could buy that arab out four times over and hardly feel the loss and yet were they to enter a room together judkins would know and acknowledge by his look that he was the inferior personage not the less should a personal quarrel arise between them would judkins punch the arabs head ay and reduce him to utter ignominy at his feet judkins would break his heart in despair rather than not return a blow whereas the arab would put up with any indignity of that sort nevertheless judkins is altogether deficient in personal dignity i often thought as the hours hung in egypt whether it might not be practicable to introduce an oriental costume in friday street at this moment as the arab gentleman entered the cavernous coffeeroom i felt that i was greatly the inferior personage he was followed by four or five others dressed somewhat as himself though by no means in such magnificent colours and by one gentleman in a coat and trousers the gentleman in the coat and trousers came last and i could see that he was one of the least of the number as for myself i felt almost overawed by the dignity of the stout party in the turban and seeing that he came directly across the room to the place where i was seated i got upon my legs and made him some sign of christian obeisance i am a little man and not podgy as is judkins and i flatter myself that i showed more deportment at any rate than he would have exhibited i made as i have said some christian obeisance i bobbed my head that is rubbing my hands together the while and expressed an opinion that it was a fine day but if i was civil as i hope i was the arab was much more so he advanced till he was about six paces from me then placed his right hand open upon his silken breast and inclining forward with his whole body made to me a bow which judkins never could accomplish the turban and the flowing robe might be possible in friday street but of what avail would be the outer garments and mere symbols if the inner sentiment of personal dignity were wanting i have often since tried it when alone but i could never accomplish anything like that bow the arab with the flowing robe bowed and the other arabs all bowed also and after that the christian gentleman with the coat and trousers made a leg i made a leg also rubbing my hands again and added to my former remarks that it was rather hot dat berry true said the porter in the dirty dressinggown who stood by i could see at a glance that the manner of that porter towards me was greatly altered and i began to feel comforted in my wretchedness perhaps a christian from friday street with plenty of money in his pockets would stand in higher esteem at suez than at cairo if so that alone would go far to atone for the apparent wretchedness of the place at cairo i had not received that attention which had certainly been due to me as the second partner in the flourishing manchester house of grimes walker and judkins but now as my friend with the beard again bowed to me i felt that this deficiency was to be made up it was clear however that this new acquaintance though i liked the manner of it would be attended with considerable inconvenience for the arab gentleman commenced an address to me in french it has always been to me a source of sorrow that my parents did not teach me the french language and this deficiency on my part has given rise to an incredible amount of supercilious overbearing pretension on the part of judkinswho after all can hardly do more than translate a correspondents letter i do not believe that he could have understood that arabs oration but at any rate i did not he went on to the end however speaking for some three or four minutes and then again he bowed if i could only have learned that bow i might still have been greater than judkins with all his french i am very sorry said i but i dont exactly follow the french language when it is spoken ah no french said the arab in very broken english dat is one sorrow how is it that these fellows learn all languages under the sun i afterwards found that this man could talk italian and turkish and armenian fluently and say a few words in german as he could also in english i could not ask for my dinner in any other language than english if it were to save me from starvation then he called to the christian gentleman in the pantaloons and as far as i could understand made over to him the duty of interpreting between us there seemed however to be one difficulty in the way of this being carried on with efficiency the christian gentleman could not speak english himself he knew of it perhaps something more than did the arab but by no means enough to enable us to have a fluent conversation and had the interpreterwho turned out to be an italian from trieste attached to the austrian consulate at alexandriahad the interpreter spoken english with the greatest ease i should have had considerable difficulty in understanding and digesting in all its bearings the proposition made to me but before i proceed to the proposition i must describe a ceremony which took place previous to its discussion i had hardly observed when first the procession entered the room that one of my friends followersmy friends name as i learned afterwards was mahmoud al ackbar and i will therefore call him mahmoudthat one of mahmouds followers bore in his arms a bundle of long sticks and that another carried an iron pot and a tray such was the case and these two followers came forward to perform their services while i having been literally pressed down on to the sofa by mahmoud watched them in their progress mahmoud also sat down and not a word was spoken while the ceremony went on the man with the sticks first placed on the ground two little pansone at my feet and then one at the feet of his master after that he loosed an ornamented bag which he carried round his neck and producing from it tobacco proceeded to fill two pipes this he did with the utmost gravity and apparently with very peculiar care the pipes had been already fixed at one end of the stick and to the other end the man had fastened two large yellow balls these as i afterwards perceived were mouthpieces made of amber then he lit the pipes drawing up the difficult smoke by long painful suckings at the mouthpiece and then when the work had become apparently easy he handed one pipe to me and the other to his master the bowls he had first placed in the little pans on the ground during all this time no word was spoken and i was left altogether in the dark as to the cause which had produced this extraordinary courtesy there was a stationary sofathey called it there a divanwhich was fixed into the corner of the room and on one side of the angle sat mahmoud al ackbar with his feet tucked under him while i sat on the other the remainder of the party stood around and i felt so little master of the occasion that i did not know whether it would become me to bid them be seated i was not master of the entertainment they were not my pipes nor was it my coffee which i saw one of the followers preparing in a distant part of the room and indeed i was much confused as to the management of the stick and amber mouthpiece with which i had been presented with a cigar i am as much at home as any man in the city i can nibble off the end of it and smoke it to the last ash when i am three parts asleep but i had never before been invited to regale myself with such an instrument as this what was i to do with that huge yellow ball so i watched my new friend closely it had manifestly been a part of his urbanity not to commence till i had done so but seeing my difficulty he at last raised the ball to his mouth and sucked at it i looked at him and envied the gravity of his countenance and the dignity of his demeanour i sucked also but i made a sputtering noise and must confess that i did not enjoy it the smoke curled gracefully from his mouth and nostrils as he sat there in mute composure i was mute as regarded speech but i coughed as the smoke came from me in convulsive puffs and then the attendant brought us coffee in little tin cupsblack coffee without sugar and full of grit of which the berries had been only bruised not ground i took the cup and swallowed the mixture for i could not refuse but i wish that i might have asked for some milk and sugar nevertheless there was something very pleasing in the whole ceremony and at last i began to find myself more at home with my pipe when mahmoud had exhausted his tobacco and perceived that i also had ceased to puff forth smoke he spoke in italian to the interpreter and the interpreter forthwith proceeded to explain to me the purport of this visit this was done with much difficulty for the interpreters stock of english was very scantybut after awhile i understood or thought i understood as followsat some previous period of my existence i had done some deed which had given infinite satisfaction to mahmoud al ackbar whether however i had done it myself or whether my father had done it was not quite clear to me my father then some time deceased had been a wharfinger at liverpool and it was quite possible that mahmoud might have found himself at that port mahmoud had heard of my arrival in egypt and had been given to understand that i was coming to suezto carry myself away in the ship as the interpreter phrased it this i could not understand but i let it pass having heard these agreeable tidingsand mahmoud sitting in the corner bowed low to me as this was saidhe had prepared for my acceptance a slight refection for the morrow hoping that i would not carry myself away in the ship till this had been eaten on this subject i soon made him quite at ease and he then proceeded to explain that as there was a point of interest at suez mahmoud was anxious that i should partake of the refection somewhat in the guise of a picnic at the well of moses over in asia on the other side of the head of the red sea mahmoud would provide a boat to take across the party in the morning and camels on which we would return after sunset or else we would go and return on camels or go on camels and return in the boat indeed any arrangement would be made that i preferred if i was afraid of the heat and disliked the open boat i could be carried round in a litter the provisions had already been sent over to the well of moses in the anticipation that i would not refuse this little request i did not refuse it nothing could have been more agreeable to me than this plan of seeing something of the sights and wonders of this landand of this seeing them in good company i had not heard of the well of moses before but now that i learned that it was in asiain another quarter of the globe to be reached by a transit of the red sea to be returned from by a journey on camels backsi burned with anxiety to visit its waters what a story would this be for judkins this was no doubt the point at which the israelites had passed of those waters had they drunk i almost felt that i had already found one of pharaohs chariot wheels i readily gave my assent and then with much ceremony and many low salaams mahmoud and his attendant left me i am very glad that i came to suez said i to myself i did not sleep much that night for the mosquitoes of suez are very persevering but i was saved from the agonising despair which these animals so frequently produce by my agreeable thoughts as to mahmoud al ackbar i will put it to any of my readers who have travelled whether it is not a painful thing to find onesself regarded among strangers without any kindness or ceremonious courtesy i had on this account been wretched at cairo but all this was to be made up to me at suez nothing could be more pleasant than the whole conduct of mahmoud al ackbar and i determined to take full advantage of it not caring overmuch what might be the nature of those previous favours to which he had alluded that was his lookout and if he was satisfied why should not i be so also on the following morning i was dressed at six and looking out of my bedroom i saw the boat in which we were to be wafted into asia being brought up to the quay close under my window it had been arranged that we should start early so as to avoid the midday sun breakfast in the boatmahmoud in this way engaged to provide me with two refectionstake our rest at noon in a pavilion which had been built close upon the well of the patriarch and then eat our dinner and return riding upon camels in the cool of the evening nothing could sound more pleasant than such a plan and knowing as i did that the hampers of provisions had already been sent over i did not doubt that the table arrangements would be excellent even now standing at my window i could see a basket laden with longnecked bottles going into the boat and became aware that we should not depend altogether for our morning repast on that gritty coffee which my friend mahmouds followers prepared i had promised to be ready at six and having carefully completed my toilet and put a clean collar and comb into my pocket ready for dinner i descended to the great gateway and walked slowly round to the quay as i passed out the porter greeted me with a low obeisance and walking on i felt that i stepped the ground with a sort of dignity of which i had before been ignorant it is not as a rule the man who gives grace and honour to the position but the position which confers the grace and honour upon the man i have often envied the solemn gravity and grand demeanour of the lord chancellor as i have seen him on the bench but i almost think that even judkins would look grave and dignified under such a wig mahmoud al ackbar had called upon me and done me honour and i felt myself personally capable of sustaining before the people of suez the honour which he had done me as i walked forth with a proud step from beneath the portal i perceived looking down from the square along the street that there was already some commotion in the town i saw the flowing robes of many arabs with their backs turned towards me and i thought that i observed the identical gown and turban of my friend mahmoud on the back and head of a stout short man who was hurrying round a corner in the distance i felt sure that it was mahmoud some of his servants had failed in their preparations i said to myself as i made my way round to the waters edge this was only another testimony how anxious he was to do me honour i stood for a while on the edge of the quay looking into the boat and admiring the comfortable cushions which were luxuriously arranged around the seats the men who were at work did not know me and i was unnoticed but i should soon take my place upon the softest of those cushions i walked slowly backwards and forwards on the quay listening to a hum of voices that came to me from a distance there was clearly something stirring in the town and i felt certain that all the movement and all those distant voices were connected in some way with my expedition to the well of moses at last there came a lad upon the walk dressed in frank costume and i asked him what was in the wind he was a clerk attached to an english warehouse and he told me that there had been an arrival from cairo he knew no more than that but he had heard that the omnibuses had just come in could it be possible that mahmoud al ackbar had heard of another old acquaintance and had gone to welcome him also at first my ideas on the subject were altogether pleasant i by no means wished to monopolise the delights of all those cushions nor would it be to me a cause of sorrow that there should be some one to share with me the conversational powers of that interpreter should another guest be found he might also be an englishman and i might thus form an acquaintance which would be desirable thinking of these things i walked the quay for some minutes in a happy state of mind but by degrees i became impatient and by degrees also disturbed in my spirit i observed that one of the arab boatmen walked round from the vessel to the front of the hotel and that on his return he looked at meas i thought not with courteous eyes then also i saw or rather heard some one in the verandah of the hotel above me and was conscious that i was being viewed from thence i walked and walked and nobody came to me and i perceived by my watch that it was seven oclock the noise too had come nearer and nearer and i was now aware that wheels had been drawn up before the front door of the hotel and that many voices were speaking there it might be that mahmoud should wait for some other friend but why did he not send some one to inform me and then as i made a sudden turn at the end of the quay i caught sight of the retreating legs of the austrian interpreter and i became aware that he had been sent down and had gone away afraid to speak to me what can i do said i to myself i can but keep my ground i owned that i feared to go round to the front of the hotel so i still walked slowly up and down the length of the quay and began to whistle to show that i was not uneasy the arab sailors looked at me uncomfortably and from time to time some one peered at me round the corner it was now fully halfpast seven and the sun was becoming hot in the heavens why did we not hasten to place ourselves beneath the awning in that boat i had just made up my mind that i would go round to the front and penetrate this mystery when on turning i saw approaching to me a man dressed at any rate like an english gentleman as he came near to me he raised his hat and accosted me in our own language mr george walker i believe said he yes said i with some little attempt at a high demeanour of the firm of grimes walker and judkins friday street london a most respectable house i am sure said he i am afraid there has been a little mistake here no mistake as to the respectability of that house said i i felt that i was again alone in the world and that it was necessary that i should support myself mahmoud al ackbar had separated himself from me for ever of that i had no longer a doubt oh none at all said he but about this little expedition over the water and he pointed contemptuously to the boat there has been a mistake about that mr walker i happen to be the english viceconsul here i took off my hat and bowed it was the first time i had ever been addressed civilly by any english consular authority and they have made me get out of bed to come down here and explain all this to you all what said i you are a man of the world i know and ill just tell it you plainly my old friend mahmoud al ackbar has mistaken you for sir george walker the new lieutenantgovernor of pegu sir george walker is here now he has come this morning and mahmoud is ashamed to face you after what has occurred if you wont object to withdraw with me into the hotel ill explain it all i felt as though a thunderbolt had fallen and i must say that even up to this day i think that the consul might have been a little less abrupt we can get in here said he evidently in a hurry and pointing to a small door which opened out from one corner of the house to the quay what could i do but follow him i did follow him and in a few words learned the remainder of the story when he had once withdrawn me from the public walk he seemed but little anxious about the rest and soon left me again alone the facts as far as i could learn them were simply these sir george walker who was now going out to pegu as governor had been in india before commanding an army there i had never heard of him before and had made no attempt to pass myself off as his relative nobody could have been more innocent than i wasor have received worse usage i have as much right to the name as he has well when he was in india before he had taken the city of begum after a terrible siegebegum i think the consul called it and mahmoud had been there having been it seems a great man at begum and sir george had spared him and his money and in this way the whole thing had come to pass there was no further explanation than that the rest of it was all transparent mahmoud having heard my name from the porter had hurried down to invite me to his party so far so good but why had he been afraid to face me in the morning and seeing that the fault had all been his why had he not asked me to join the expedition sir george and i may after all be cousins but coward as he was he had been afraid of me when they found that i was on the quay they had been afraid of me not knowing how to get rid of me i wish that i had kept the quay all day and stared them down one by one as they entered the boat but i was down in the mouth and when the consul left me i crept wearily back to my bedroom and the consul did leave me almost immediately a faint hope had at one time come upon me that he would have asked me to breakfast had he done so i should have felt it as a full compensation for all that i had suffered i am not an exacting man but i own that i like civility in friday street i can command it and in friday street for the rest of my life will i remain from this consul i received no civility as soon as he had got me out of the way and spoken the few words which he had to say he again raised his hat and left me i also again raised mine and then crept up to my bedroom from my window standing a little behind the white curtain i could see the whole embarkation there was mahmoud al ackbar looking indeed a little hot but still going through his work with all that excellence of deportment which had graced him on the preceding evening had his foot slipped and had he fallen backwards into that shallow water my spirit would i confess have been relieved but on the contrary everything went well with him there was the real sir george my namesake and perhaps my cousin as fresh as paint cool from the bath which he had been taking while i had been walking on that terrace how is it that these governors and commandersinchief go through such a deal of work without fagging it was not yet two hours since he was jolting about in that omnibusbox and there he had been all night i could not have gone off to the well of moses immediately on my arrival its the dignity of the position that does it i have long known that the head of a firm must never count on a mere clerk to get through as much work as he could do himself its the interest in the matter that supports the man they went and sir george as i was well assured had never heard a word about me had he done so is it probable that he would have requested my attendance but mahmoud and his followers no doubt kept their own counsel as to that little mistake there they went and the gentle rippling breeze filled their sail pleasantly as the boat moved away into the bay i felt no spite against any of them but mahmoud why had he avoided me with such cowardice i could still see them when the morning tchibouk was handed to sir george and though i wished him no harm i did envy him as he lay there reclining luxuriously upon the cushions a more wretched day than that i never spent in my life as i went in and out the porter at the gate absolutely scoffed at me once i made up my mind to complain within the house but what could i have said of the dirty arab they would have told me that it was his religion or a national observance or meant for a courtesy what can a man do in a strange country when he is told that a native spits in his face by way of civility i bore it i bore itlike a man and sighed for the comforts of friday street as to one matter i made up my mind on that day and i fully carried out my purpose on the next i would go across to the well of moses in a boat i would visit the coasts of asia and i would ride back into africa on a camel though i did it alone i would have my days pleasuring i had money in my pocket and though it might cost me i would see all that my namesake had seen it did cost me the best part of and as for the pleasuring i cannot say much for it i went to bed early that night having concluded my bargain for the morrow with a rapacious arab who spoke english i went to bed early in order to escape the returning party and was again on the quay at six the next morning on this occasion i stepped boldly into the boat the very moment that i came along the shore there is nothing in the world like paying for what you use i saw myself to the bottle of brandy and the cold meat and acknowledged that a cigar out of my own case would suit me better than that long stick the long stick might do very well for a governor of pegu but would be highly inconvenient in friday street well i am not going to give an account of my days journey here though perhaps i may do so some day i did go to the well of mosesif a small dirty pool of salt water lying high above the sands can be called a well i did eat my dinner in the miserable ruined cottage which they graced by the name of a pavilion and alas for my poor bones i did ride home upon a camel if sir george did so early and started for pegu the next morningand i was informed such was the facthe must have been made of iron i laid in bed the whole day suffering greviously but i was told that on such a journey i should have slakened my throat with oranges and not with brandy i survived those four terrible days which remained to me at suez and after another month was once again in friday street i suffered greatly on the occasion but it is some consolation to me to reflect that i smoked a pipe of peace with mahmoud al ackbar that i saw the hero of begum while journeying out to new triumphs at pegu that i sailed into asia in my own yachthired for the occasion and that i rode back into africa on a camel nor can judkins with all his illnature rob me of these remembrances the mistletoe bough let the boys have it if they like it said mrs garrow pleading to her only daughter on behalf of her two sons pray dont mamma said elizabeth garrow it only means romping to me all that is detestable and i am sure it is not the sort of thing that miss holmes would like we always had it at christmas when we were young but mamma the world is so changed the point in dispute was one very delicate in its nature hardly to be discussed in all its bearings even in fiction and the very mention of which between mother and daughter showed a great amount of close confidence between them it was no less than this should that branch of mistletoe which frank garrow had brought home with him out of the lowther woods be hung up on christmas eve in the diningroom at thwaite hall according to his wishes or should permission for such hanging be positively refused it was clearly a thing not to be done after such a discussion and therefore the decision given by mrs garrow was against it i am inclined to think that miss garrow was right in saying that the world is changed as touching misletoe boughs kissing i fear is less innocent now than it used to be when our grandmothers were alive and we have become more fastidious in our amusements nevertheless i think that she made herself fairly open to the raillery with which her brothers attacked her honi soit qui mal y pense said frank who was eighteen nobody will want to kiss you my lady fineairs said harry who was just a year younger because you choose to be a puritan there are to be no more cakes and ale in the house said frank still waters run deep we all know that said harry the boys had not been present when the matter was decided between mrs garrow and her daughter nor had the mother been present when these little amenities had passed between the brothers and sister only that mamma has said it and i wouldnt seem to go against her said frank id ask my father he wouldnt give way to such nonsense i know elizabeth turned away without answering and left the room her eyes were full of tears but she would not let them see that they had vexed her they were only two days home from school and for the last week before their coming all her thoughts had been to prepare for their christmas pleasures she had arranged their rooms making everything warm and pretty out of her own pocket she had bought a shotbelt for one and skates for the other she had told the old groom that her pony was to belong exclusively to master harry for the holidays and now harry told her that still waters ran deep she had been driven to the use of all her eloquence in inducing her father to purchase that gun for frank and now frank called her a puritan and why she did not choose that a mistletoe bough should be hung in her fathers hall when godfrey holmes was coming to visit him she could not explain this to frank but frank might have had the wit to understand it but frank was thinking only of patty coverdale a blueeyed little romp of sixteen who with her sister kate was coming from penrith to spend the christmas at thwaite hall elizabeth left the room with her slow graceful step hiding her tearshiding all emotion as latterly she had taught herself that it was feminine to do there goes my lady fineairs said harry sending his shrill voice after her thwaite hall was not a place of much pretension it was a moderatesized house surrounded by pretty gardens and shrubberies close down upon the river eamont on the westmoreland side of the river looking over to a lovely wooded bank in cumberland all the world knows that the eamont runs out of ulleswater dividing the two counties passing under penrith bridge and by the old ruins of brougham castle below which it joins the eden thwaite hall nestled down close upon the clear rocky stream about half way between ulleswater and penrith and had been built just at a bend of the river the windows of the diningparlour and of the drawingroom stood at right angles to each other and yet each commanded a reach of the stream immediately from a side of the house steps were cut down through the red rock to the waters edge and here a small boat was always moored to a chain the chain was stretched across the river fixed to the staples driven into the rock on either side and the boat was pulled backwards and forwards over the stream without aid from oars or paddles from the opposite side a path led through the woods and across the fields to penrith and this was the route commonly used between thwaite hall and the town major garrow was a retired officer of engineers who had seen service in all parts of the world and who was now spending the evening of his days on a small property which had come to him from his father he held in his own hands about twenty acres of land and he was the owner of one small farm close by which was let to a tenant that together with his halfpay and the interest of his wifes thousand pounds sufficed to educate his children and keep the wolf at a comfortable distance from his door he himself was a spare thin man with quiet lazy literary habits he had done the work of life but had so done it as to permit of his enjoying that which was left to him his sole remaining care was the establishment of his children and as far as he could see he had no ground for anticipating disappointment they were clever goodlooking welldisposed young people and upon the whole it may be said that the sun shone brightly on thwaite hall of mrs garrow it may suffice to say that she always deserved such sunshine for years past it had been the practice of the family to have some sort of gathering at thwaite hall during christmas godfrey holmes had been left under the guardianship of major garrow and as he had always spent his christmas holidays with his guardian this perhaps had given rise to the practice then the coverdales were cousins of the garrows and they had usually been there as children at the christmas last past the custom had been broken for young holmes had been abroad previous to that they had all been children excepting him but now that they were to meet again they were no longer children elizabeth at any rate was not so for she had already counted nineteen winters and isabella holmes was coming now isabella was two years older than elizabeth and had been educated in brussels moreover she was comparatively a stranger at thwaite hall never having been at those early christmas meetings and now i must take permission to begin my story by telling a ladys secret elizabeth garrow had already been in love with godfrey holmes or perhaps it might be more becoming to say that godfrey holmes had already been in love with her they had already been engaged and alas they had already agreed that that engagement should be broken off young holmes was now twentyseven years of age and was employed in a bank at liverpool not as a clerk but as assistantmanager with a large salary he was a man well to do in the world who had money also of his own and who might well afford to marry some two years since on the eve of leaving thwaite hall he had with low doubting whisper told elizabeth that he loved her and she had flown trembling to her mother godfrey my boy the father said to him as he parted with him the next morning bessy is only a child and too young to think of this yet at the next christmas godfrey was in italy and the thing was gone byso at least the father and mother said to each other but the young people had met in the summer and one joyful letter had come from the girl home to her mother i have accepted him dearest dearest mamma i do love him but dont tell papa yet for i have not quite accepted him i think i am sure but i am not quite sure i am not quite sure about him and then two days after that there had come a letter that was not at all joyful dearest mammait is not to be it is not written in the book we have both agreed that it will not do i am so glad that you have not told dear papa for i could never make him understand you will understand for i shall tell you everything down to his very words but we have agreed that there shall be no quarrel it shall be exactly as it was and he will come at christmas all the same it would never do that he and papa should be separated nor could we now put off isabella it is better so in every way for there is and need be no quarrel we still like each other i am sure i like him but i know that i should not make him happy as his wife he says it is my fault i at any rate have never told him that i thought it his from all which it will be seen that the confidence between the mother and daughter was very close elizabeth garrow was a very good girl but it might almost be a question whether she was not too good she had learned or thought that she had learned that most girls are vapid silly and uselessgiven chiefly to pleasureseeking and a hankering after lovers and she had resolved that she would not be such a one industry selfdenial and a religious purpose in life were the tasks which she set herself and she went about the performance of them with much courage but such tasks though they are excellently well adapted to fit a young lady for the work of living may also be carried too far and thus have the effect of unfitting her for that work when elizabeth garrow made up her mind that the finding of a husband was not the only purpose of life she did very well it is very well that a young lady should feel herself capable of going through the world happily without one but in teaching herself this she also taught herself to think that there was a certain merit in refusing herself the natural delight of a lover even though the possession of the lover were compatible with all her duties to herself her father and mother and the world at large it was not that she had determined to have no lover she made no such resolve and when the proper lover came he was admitted to her heart but she declared to herself unconsciously that she must put a guard upon herself lest she should be betrayed into weakness by her own happiness she had resolved that in loving her lord she would not worship him and that in giving her heart she would only so give it as it should be given to a human creature like herself she had acted on these high resolves and hence it had come to passnot unnaturallythat mr godfrey holmes had told her that it was her fault she was a pretty fair girl with soft darkbrown hair and soft long dark eyelashes her grey eyes though quiet in their tone were tender and lustrous her face was oval and the lines of her cheek and chin perfect in their symmetry she was generally quiet in her demeanour but when moved she could rouse herself to great energy and speak with feeling and almost with fire her fault was a reverence for martyrdom in general and a feeling of which she was unconscious that it became a young woman to be unhappy in secretthat it became a young woman i might rather say to have a source of unhappiness hidden from the world in general and endured without any detriment to her outward cheerfulness we know the story of the spartan boy who held the fox under his tunic the fox was biting into himinto the very entrails but the young hero spake never a word now bessy garrow was inclined to think that it was a good thing to have a fox always biting so that the torment caused no ruining to her outward smiles now at this moment the fox within her bosom was biting her sore enough but she bore it without flinching if you would rather that he should not come i will have it arranged her mother had said to her not for worlds she had answered i should never think well of myself again her mother had changed her own mind more than once as to the conduct in this matter which might be best for her to follow thinking solely of her daughters welfare if he comes they will be reconciled and she will be happy had been her first idea but then there was a stern fixedness of purpose in bessys words when she spoke of mr holmes which had expelled this hope and mrs garrow had for a while thought it better that the young man should not come but bessy would not permit this it would vex her father put out of course the arrangements of other people and display weakness on her own part he should come and she would endure without flinching while the fox gnawed at her that battle of the mistletoe had been fought on the morning before christmasday and the holmeses came on christmaseve isabella was comparatively a stranger and therefore received at first the greater share of attention she and elizabeth had once seen each other and for the last year or two had corresponded but personally they had never been intimate unfortunately for the latter that story of godfreys offer and acceptance had been communicated to isabella as had of course the immediately subsequent story of their separation but now it would be almost impossible to avoid the subject in conversation dearest isabella let it be as though it had never been she had said in one of her letters but sometimes it is very difficult to let things be as though they had never been the first evening passed over very well the two coverdale girls were there and there had been much talking and merry laughter rather juvenile in its nature but on the whole none the worse for that isabella holmes was a fine tall handsome girl goodhumoured and well disposed to be pleased rather frenchified in her manners and quite able to take care of herself but she was not above round games and did not turn up her nose at the boys godfrey behaved himself excellently talking much to the major but by no means avoiding miss garrow mrs garrow though she had known him since he was a boy had taken an aversion to him since he had quarrelled with her daughter but there was no room on this first night for showing such aversion and everything went off well godfrey is very much improved the major said to his wife that night do you think so indeed i do he has filled out and become a fine man in personal appearance you mean yes he is welllooking enough and in his manner too he is doing uncommonly well in liverpool i can tell you and if he should think of bessy there is nothing of that sort said mrs garrow he did speak to me you knowtwo years ago bessy was too young then and so indeed was he but if she likes him i dont think she does then theres an end of it and so they went to bed frank said the sister to her elder brother knocking at his door when they had all gone up stairs may i come inif you are not in bed in bed said he looking up with some little pride from his greek book ive one hundred and fifty lines to do before i can get to bed itll be two i suppose ive got to mug uncommon hard these holidays i have only one more half you know and then dont overdo it frank no i wont overdo it i mean to take one day a week and work eight hours a day on the other five that will be forty hours a week and will give me just two hundred hours for the holidays i have got it all down here on a table that will be a hundred and five for greek play forty for algebra and so he explained to her the exact destiny of all his long hours of proposed labour he had as yet been home a day and a half and had succeeded in drawing out with red lines and blue figures the table which he showed her if i can do that it will be pretty well wont it but frank you have come home for your holidaysto enjoy yourself but a fellow must work nowadays dont overdo it dear thats all but frank i could not rest if i went to bed without speaking to you you made me unhappy today did i bessy you called me a puritan and then you quoted that illnatured french proverb at me do you really believe your sister thinks evil frank and as she spoke she put her arm caressingly round his neck of course i dont then why say so harry is so much younger and so thoughtless that i can bear what he says without so much suffering but if you and i are not friends i shall be very wretched if you knew how i have looked forward to your coming home i did not mean to vex you and i wont say such things again thats my own frank what i said to mamma i said because i thought it right but you must not say that i am a puritan i would do anything in my power to make your holidays bright and pleasant i know that boys require so much more to amuse them than girls do good night dearest pray dont overdo yourself with work and do take care of your eyes so saying she kissed him and went her way in twenty minutes after that he had gone to sleep over his book and when he woke up to find the candle guttering down he resolved that he would not begin his measured hours till christmasday was fairly over the morning of christmasday passed very quietly they all went to church and then sat round the fire chatting until the four oclock dinner was ready the coverdale girls thought it was rather more dull than former thwaite hall festivities and frank was seen to yawn but then everybody knows that the real fun of christmas never begins till the day itself be passed the beef and pudding are ponderous and unless there be absolute children in the party there is a difficulty in grafting any special afternoon amusements on the sunday pursuits of the morning in the evening they were to have a dance that had been distinctly promised to patty coverdale but the dance would not commence till eight the beef and pudding were ponderous but with due efforts they were overcome and disappeared the glass of port was sipped the almonds and raisins were nibbled and then the ladies left the room ten minutes after that elizabeth found herself seated with isabella holmes over the fire in her fathers little bookroom it was not by her that this meeting was arranged for she dreaded such a constrained confidence but of course it could not be avoided and perhaps it might be as well now as hereafter bessy said the elder girl i am dying to be alone with you for a moment well you shall not die that is if being alone with me will save you i have so much to say to you and if you have any true friendship in you you also will have so much to say to me miss garrow perhaps had no true friendship in her at that moment for she would gladly have avoided saying anything had that been possible but in order to prove that she was not deficient in friendship she gave her friend her hand and now tell me everything about godfrey said isabella dear bella i have nothing to tellliterally nothing that is nonsense stop a moment dear and understand that i do not mean to offend you it cannot be that you have nothing to tell if you choose to tell it you are not the girl to have accepted godfrey without loving him nor is he the man to have asked you without loving you when you write me word that you have changed your mind as you might about a dress of course i know you have not told me all now i insist upon knowing itthat is if we are to be friends i would not speak a word to godfrey till i had seen you in order that i might hear your story first indeed bella there is no story to tell then i must ask him if you wish to play the part of a true friend to me you will let the matter pass by and say nothing you must understand that circumstanced as we are your brothers visit herewhat i mean is that it is very difficult for me to act and speak exactly as i should do and a few unfortunate words spoken may make my position unendurable will you answer me one question i cannot tell i think i will do you love him for a moment or two bessy remained silent striving to arrange her words so that they should contain no falsehood and yet betray no truth ah i see you do continued miss holmes but of course you do why else did you accept him i fancied that i did as young ladies do sometimes fancy and will you say that you do not now again bessy was silent and then her friend rose from her seat i see it all she said what a pity it was that you both had not some friend like me by you at the time but perhaps it may not be too late i need not repeat at length all the protestations which upon this were poured forth with hot energy by poor bessy she endeavoured to explain how great had been the difficulty of her position this christmas visit had been arranged before that unhappy affair at liverpool had occurred isabellas visit had been partly one of business it being necessary that certain money affairs should be arranged between her her brother and the major i determined said bessy not to let my feelings stand in the way and hoped that things might settle down to their former friendly footing i already fear that i have been wrong but it will be ungenerous in you to punish me then she went on to say that if anybody attempted to interfere with her she should at once go away to her mothers sister who lived at hexham in northumberland then came the dance and the hearts of kate and patty coverdale were at last happy but here again poor bessy was made to understand how terribly difficult was this experiment of entertaining on a footing of friendship a lover with whom she had quarrelled only a month or two before that she must as a necessity become the partner of godfrey holmes she had already calculated and so much she was prepared to endure her brothers would of course dance with the coverdale girls and her father would of course stand up with isabella there was no other possible arrangement at any rate as a beginning she had schooled herself too as to the way in which she would speak to him on the occasion and how she would remain mistress of herself and of her thoughts but when the time came the difficulty was almost too much for her you do not care much for dancing if i remember said he oh yes i do not as patty coverdale does its a passion with her but then i am older than patty coverdale after that he was silent for a minute or two it seems so odd to me to be here again he said it was oddshe felt that it was odd but he ought not to have said so two years make a great difference the boys have grown so much yes and there are other things said he bella was never here before at least not with you no but i did not exactly mean that all that would not make the place so strange but your mother seems altered to me she used to be almost like my own mother i suppose she finds that you are a more formidable person as you grow older it was all very well scolding you when you were a clerk in the bank but it does not do to scold the manager these are the penalties men pay for becoming great it is not my greatness that stands in my way but then im sure i cannot say what it is but patty will scold you if you do not mind the figure though you were the whole board of directors packed into one she wont respect you if you neglect your present work when bessy went to bed that night she began to feel that she had attempted too much mamma she said could i not make some excuse and go away to aunt mary what now yes mamma now tomorrow i need not say that it will make me very unhappy to be away at such a time but i begin to think that it will be better what will papa say you must tell him all and aunt mary must be told also you would not like that has he said anything no nothingvery little that is but bella has spoken to me oh mamma i think we have been very wrong in this that is i have been wrong i feel as though i should disgrace myself and turn the whole party here into a misfortune it would be dreadful that telling of the story to her father and to her aunt and such a necessity must if possible be avoided should such a necessity actually come the former task would no doubt be done by her mother but that would not lighten the load materially after a fortnight she would again meet her father and would be forced to discuss it i will remain if it be possible she said but mamma if i wish to go you will not stop me her mother promised that she would not stop her but strongly advised her to stand her ground on the following morning when she came down stairs before breakfast she found frank standing in the hall with his gun of which he was trying the lock it is not loaded is it frank said she oh dear no no one thinks of loading nowadays till he has got out of the house directly after breakfast i am going across with godfrey to the back of greystock to see after some moorfowl he asked me to go and i couldnt well refuse of course not why should you it will be deuced hard work to make up the time i was to have been up at four this morning but that alarum went off and never woke me however i shall be able to do something tonight dont make a slavery of your holidays frank whats the good of having a new gun if youre not to use it its not the new gun im not such a child as that comes to but you see godfrey is here and one ought to be civil to him ill tell you what i want you girls to do bessy you must come and meet us on our way home come over in the boat and along the path to the patterdale road well be there under the hill about five and if you are not we are to wait in the snow dont make difficulties bessy i tell you we will be there we are to go in the cart and so shall have plenty of time and how do you know the other girls will go why to tell you the truth patty coverdale has promised as for miss holmes if she wont why you must leave her at home with mamma but kate and patty cant come without you your discretion has found that out has it they say so but you will come wont you bessy as for waiting its all nonsense of course you can walk on but well be at the stile by five ive got my watch you know and then bessy promised him what would she not have done for him that was in her power to do go of course ill go said miss holmes im up to anything id have gone with them this morning and have taken a gun if theyd asked me but bythebye id better not why not said patty who was hardly yet without fear lest something should mar the expedition what will three gentlemen do with four ladies oh i forgot said patty innocently im sure i dont care said kate you may have harry if you like thank you for nothing said miss holmes i want one for myself its all very well for you to make the offer but what should i do if harry wouldnt have me there are two sides you know to every bargain im sure he isnt anything to me said kate why hes not quite seventeen years old yet poor boy what a shame to dispose of him so soon well let him off for a year or two wont we miss coverdale but as there seems by acknowledgment to be one beau with unappropriated services im sure i have appropriated nobody said patty and didnt intend godfrey then is the only knight whose services are claimed said miss holmes looking at bessy bessy made no immediate answer with either her eyes or tongue but when the coverdales were gone she took her new friend to task how can you fill those young girls heads with such nonsense nature has done that my dear but nature should be trained should it not you will make them think that those foolish boys are in love with them the foolish boys as you call them will look after that themselves it seems to me that the foolish boys know what they are about better than some of their elders and then after a moments pause she added as for my brother i have no patience with him pray do not discuss your brother said bessy and bella unless you wish to drive me away pray do not speak of him and me together as you did just now are you so bad as thatthat the slightest commonplace joke upsets you would not his services be due to you as a matter of course if you are so sore about it you will betray your own secret i have no secretnone at least from you or from mamma and indeed none from him we were both very foolish thinking that we knew each other and our own hearts when we knew neither i hate to hear people talk of knowing their hearts my idea is that if you like a young man and he asks you to marry him you ought to have him that is if there is enough to live on i dont know what more is wanted but girls are getting to talk and think as though they were to send their hearts through some fiery furnace of trial before they may give them up to a husbands keeping i am not at all sure that the french fashion is not the best and that these things shouldnt be managed by the fathers and mothers or perhaps by the family lawyers girls who are so intent upon knowing their own hearts generally end by knowing nobodys heart but their own and then they die old maids better that than give themselves to the keeping of those they dont know and cannot esteem thats a matter of taste i mean to take the first that comes so long as he looks like a gentleman and has not less than eight hundred a year now godfrey does look like a gentleman and has double that if i had such a chance i shouldnt think twice about it but i have no such chance thats the way the wind blows is it no no oh bella pray pray leave me alone pray do not interfere there is no wind blowing in any way all that i want is your silence and your sympathy very well i will be silent and sympathetic as the grave only dont imagine that i am cold as the grave also i dont exactly appreciate your ideas but if i can do no good i will at any rate endeavour to do no harm after lunch at about three they started on their walk and managed to ferry themselves over the river oh do let me bessy said kate coverdale i understand all about it look here miss holmes you pull the chain through your hands and inevitably tear your gloves to pieces said miss holmes kate certainly had done so and did not seem to be particularly well pleased with the accident theres a nasty nail in the chain she said i wonder those stupid boys did not tell us of course they reached the trystingplace much too soon and were very tired of walking up and down to keep their feet warm before the sportsmen came up but this was their own fault seeing that they had reached the stile half an hour before the time fixed i never will go anywhere to meet gentlemen again said miss holmes it is most preposterous that ladies should be left in the snow for an hour well young men what sport have you had i shot the big black cock said harry did you indeed said kate coverdale and here are the feathers out of his tail for you he dropped them in the water and i had to go in after them up to my middle but i told you that i would so i was determined to get them oh you silly silly boy said kate but ill keep them for ever i will indeed this was said a little apart for harry had managed to draw the young lady aside before he presented the feathers frank had also his trophies for patty and the tale to tell of his own prowess in that he was a year older than his brother he was by a years growth less ready to tender his present to his ladylove openly in the presence of them all but he found his opportunity and then he and patty went on a little in advance kate also was deep in her consolations to harry for his ducking and therefore the four disposed of themselves in the manner previously suggested by miss holmes miss holmes therefore and her brother and bessy garrow were left together in the path and discussed the performances of the day in a manner that elicited no very ecstatic interest so they walked for a mile and by degrees the conversation between them dwindled down almost to nothing there is nothing i dislike so much as coming out with people younger than myself said miss holmes one always feels so old and dull listen to those children there they make me feel as though i were an old maiden aunt brought out with them to do propriety patty wont at all approve if she hears you call her a child nor shall i approve if she treats me like an old woman and then she stepped on and joined the children i wouldnt spoil even their sport if i could help it she said to herself but with them i shall only be a temporary nuisance if i remain behind i shall become a permanent evil and thus bessy and her old lover were left by themselves i hope you will get on well with bella said godfrey when they had remained silent for a minute or two oh yes she is so goodnatured and lightspirited that everybody must like her she has been used to so much amusement and active life that i know she must find it very dull here she is never dull anywhereeven at liverpool which for a young lady i sometimes think the dullest place on earth i know it is for a man a man who has work to do can never be dull can he indeed he can as dull as death i am so often enough i have never been very bright there bessy since you left us there was nothing in his calling her bessy for it had become a habit with him since they were children and they had formerly agreed that everything between them should be as it had been before that foolish whisper of love had been spoken and received indeed provision had been made by them specially on this point so that there need be no awkwardness in this mode of addressing each other such provision had seemed to be very prudent but it hardly had the desired effect on the present occasion i hardly know what you mean by brightness she said after a pause perhaps it is not intended that peoples lives should be what you call bright life ought to be as bright as we can make it it all depends on the meaning of the word i suppose we are not very bright here at thwaite hall but yet we think ourselves very happy i am sure you are said godfrey i very often think of you here we always think of places where we have been when we were young said bessy and then again they walked on for some way in silence and bessy began to increase her pace with the view of catching the children the present walk to her was anything but bright and she bethought herself with dismay that there were still two miles before she reached the ferry bessy godfrey said at last and then he stopped as though he were doubtful how to proceed she however did not say a word but walked on quickly as though her only hope was in catching the party before her but they also were walking quickly for bella was determined that she would not be caught bessy i must speak to you once of what passed between us at liverpool must you said she unless you positively forbid it stop godfrey she said and they did stop in the path for now she no longer thought of putting an end to her embarrassment by overtaking her companions if any such words are necessary for your comfort it would hardly become me to forbid them were i to speak so harshly you would accuse me afterwards in your own heart it must be for you to judge whether it is well to reopen a wound that is nearly healed but with me it is not nearly healed the wound is open always there are some hurts she said which do not admit of an absolute and perfect cure unless after long years as she said so she could not but think how much better was his chance of such perfect cure than her own with herso she said to herselfsuch curing was all but impossible whereas with him it was as impossible that the injury should last bessy he said and he again stopped her on the narrow path standing immediately before her on the way you remember all the circumstances that made us part yes i think i remember them and you still think that we were right to part she paused for a moment before she answered him but it was only for a moment and then she spoke quite firmly yes godfrey i do i have thought about it much since then i have thought i fear to no good purpose about aught else but i have never thought that we had been unwise in that and yet i think you loved me i am bound to confess i did so as otherwise i must confess myself a liar i told you at the time that i loved you and i told you so truly but it is better ten times better that those who love should part even though they still should love than that two should be joined together who are incapable of making each other happy remember what you told me i do remember you found yourself unhappy in your engagement and you said it was my fault bessy there is my hand if you have ceased to love me there is an end of it but if you love me still let all that be forgotten forgotten godfrey how can it be forgotten you were unhappy and it was my fault my fault as it would be if i tried to solace a sick child with arithmetic or feed a dog with grass i had no right to love you knowing you as i did and knowing also that my ways would not be your ways my punishment i understand and it is not more than i can bear but i had hoped that your punishment would have been soon over you are too proud bessy that is very likely frank says that i am a puritan and pride was the worst of their sins too proud and unbending in marriage should not the man and woman adapt themselves to each other when they are married yes and every girl who thinks of marrying should know that in very much she must adapt herself to her husband but i do not think that a woman should be the ivy to take the direction of every branch of the tree to which she clings if she does so what can be her own character but we must go on or we shall be too late and you will give me no other answer none other godfrey have you not just now at this very moment told me that i was too proud can it be possible that you should wish to tie yourself for life to female pride and if you tell me that now at such a moment as this what would you tell me in the close intimacy of married life when the trifles of every day would have worn away the courtesies of guest and lover there was a sharpness of rebuke in this which godfrey holmes could not at the moment overcome nevertheless he knew the girl and understood the workings of her heart and mind now in her present state she could be unbending proud and almost rough in that she had much to lose in declining the renewed offer which he made her she would as it were continually prompt herself to be harsh and inflexible had he been poor had she not loved him had not all good things seemed to have attended the promise of such a marriage she would have been less suspicious of herself in receiving the offer and more gracious in replying to it had he lost all his money before he came back to her she would have taken him at once or had he been deprived of an eye or become crippled in his legs she would have done so but circumstanced as he was she had no motive to tenderness there was an organic defect in her character which no doubt was plainly marked by its own bump in her craniumthe bump of philomartyrdom it might properly be called she had shipwrecked her own happiness in rejecting godfrey holmes but it seemed to her to be the proper thing that a wellbehaved young lady should shipwreck her own happiness for the last month or two she had been tossed about by the waters and was nearly drowned now there was beautiful land again close to her and a strong pleasant hand stretched out to save her but though she had suffered terribly among the waves she still thought it wrong to be saved it would be so pleasant to take that hand so sweet so joyous that it surely must be wrong that was her doctrine and godfrey holmes though he hardly analysed the matter partly understood that it was so and yet if once she were landed on that green island she would be so happy she spoke with scorn of a woman clinging to a tree like ivy and yet were she once married no woman would cling to her husband with sweeter feminine tenacity than bessy garrow he spoke no further word to her as he walked home but in handing her down to the ferryboat he pressed her hand for a second it seemed as though she had returned this pressure if so the action was involuntary and her hand instantly resumed its stiffness to his touch it was late that night when major garrow went to his bedroom but his wife was still up waiting for him well said she what has he said to you he has been with you above an hour such stories are not very quickly told and in this case it was necessary to understand him very accurately at length i think i do understand him it is not necessary to repeat at length all that was said on that night between major and mrs garrow as to the offer which had now for a third time been made to their daughter on that evening after the ladies had gone and when the two boys had taken themselves off godfrey holmes told his tale to his host and had honestly explained to him what he believed to be the state of his daughters feelings now you know all said he i do believe that she loves me and if she does perhaps she may still listen to you major garrow did not feel sure that he knew it all but when he had fully discussed the matter that night with his wife then he thought that perhaps he had arrived at that knowledge on the following morning bessy learned from the maid at an early hour that godfrey holmes had left thwaite hall and gone back to liverpool to the girl she said nothing on the subject but she felt obliged to say a word or two to bella it is his coming that i regret she saidthat he should have had the trouble and annoyance for nothing i acknowledge that it was my fault and i am very sorry it cannot be helped said miss holmes somewhat gravely as to his misfortunes i presume that his journeys between here and liverpool are not the worst of them after breakfast on that day bessy was summoned into her fathers bookroom and found him there and her mother also bessy said he sit down my dear you know why godfrey has left us this morning bessy walked round the room so that in sitting she might be close to her mother and take her mothers hand in her own i suppose i do papa she said he was with me late last night bessy and when he told me what had passed between you i agreed with him that he had better go it was better that he should go papa but he has left a message for you a message papa yes bessy and your mother agrees with me that it had better be given to you it is thisthat if you will send him word to come again he will be here by twelfthnight he came before on my invitation but if he returns it must be on yours oh papa i cannot i do not say that you can but think of it calmly before you altogether refuse you shall give me your answer on new years morning mamma knows that it would be impossible said bessy not impossible dearest in such a matter you should do what you believe to be right said her father if i were to ask him here again it would be telling him that i would exactly bessy it would be telling him that you would be his wife he would understand it so and so would your mother and i it must be so understood altogether but papa when we were at liverpool i have told him everything dearest said mrs garrow i think i understand the whole said the major and in such a matter as this i will not give you counsel on either side but you must remember that in making up your mind you must think of him as well as of yourself if you do not love himif you feel that as his wife you should not love him there is not another word to be said i need not explain to my daughter that under such circumstances she would be wrong to encourage the visits of a suitor but your mother says you do love him oh mamma i will not ask you but if you doif you have so told him and allowed him to build up an idea of his lifehappiness on such telling you will i think sin greatly against him by allowing a false feminine pride to mar his happiness when once a girl has confessed to a man that she loves him the confession and the love together put upon her the burden of a duty towards him which she cannot with impunity throw aside then he kissed her and bidding her give him a reply on the morning of the new year left her with her mother she had four days for consideration and they went past her by no means easily could she have been alone with her mother the struggle would not have been so painful but there was the necessity that she should talk to isabella holmes and the necessity also that she should not neglect the coverdales nothing could have been kinder than bella she did not speak on the subject till the morning of the last day and then only in a very few words bessy she said as you are great be merciful but i am not great and it would not be mercy as to that said bella he has surely a right to his own opinion on that evening she was sitting alone in her room when her mother came to her and her eyes were red with weeping pen and paper were before her as though she were resolved to write but hitherto no word had been written well bessy said her mother sitting down close beside her is the deed done what deed mamma who says that i am to do it the deed is not the writing but the resolution to write five words will be sufficientif only those five words may be written it is for ones whole life mamma for his life as well as my own true bessythat is quite true but equally true whether you bid him come or allow him to remain away that task of making up ones mind for life must at last be done in some special moment of that life mamma mamma tell me what i should do but this mrs garrow would not do i will write the words for you if you like she said but it is you who must resolve that they shall be written i cannot bid my darling go away and leave me for another homei can only say that in my heart i do believe that home would be a happy one it was morning before the note was written but when the morning came bessy had written it and brought it to her mother you must take it to papa she said then she went and hid herself from all eyes till the noon had passed dear godfrey the letter ran papa says that you will return on wednesday if i write to ask you do come back to usif you wish it yours always bessy it is as good as though she had filled the sheet said the major but in sending it to godfrey holmes he did not omit a few accompanying remarks of his own an answer came from godfrey by return of post and on the afternoon of the sixth of january frank garrow drove over to the station at penrith to meet him on their way back to thwaite hall there grew up a very close confidence between the two future brothersinlaw and frank explained with great perspicuity a little plan which he had arranged himself as soon as it is dark so that she wont see it harry will hang it up in the diningroom he said and mind you go in there before you go anywhere else i am very glad you have come back godfrey said the major meeting him in the hall god bless you dear godfrey said mrs garrow you will find bessy in the diningroom she whispered but in so whispering she was quite unconscious of the mistletoe bough and so also was bessy nor do i think that she was much more conscious when that introduction was over godfrey had made all manner of promises to frank but when the moment arrived he had found the moment too important for any special reference to the little bough above his head not so however patty coverdale its a shame said she bursting out of the room and if id known what you had done nothing on earth should have induced me to go in i wont enter the room till i know that you have taken it out nevertheless her sister kate was bold enough to solve the mystery before the evening was over returning home it is generally supposed that people who live at homegood domestic people who love tea and their armchairs and who keep the parlour hearthrug ever warmit is generally supposed that these are the people who value home the most and best appreciate all the comforts of that cherished institution i am inclined to doubt this it is i think to those who live farthest away from home to those who find the greatest difficulty in visiting home that the word conveys the sweetest idea in some distant parts of the world it may be that an englishman acknowledges his permanent resting place but there are many others in which he will not call his daily house his home he would in his own idea desecrate the word by doing so his home is across the blue waters in the little northern island which perhaps he may visit no more which he has left at any rate for half his life from which circumstances and the necessity of living have banished him his home is still in england and when he speaks of home his thoughts are there no one can understand the intensity of this feeling who has not seen or felt the absence of interest in life which falls to the lot of many who have to eat their bread on distant soils we are all apt to think that a life in strange countries will be a life of excitement of stirring enterprise and varied scenesthat in abandoning the comforts of home we shall receive in exchange more of movement and of adventure than would come in our way in our own tame country and this feeling has i am sure sent many a young man roaming take any spirited fellow of twenty and ask him whether he would like to go to mexico for the next ten years prudence and his father may ultimately save him from such banishment but he will not refuse without a pang of regret alas it is a mistake bread may be earned and fortunes perhaps made in such countries and as it is the destiny of our race to spread itself over the wide face of the globe it is well that there should be something to gild and paint the outward face of that lot which so many are called upon to choose but for a life of daily excitement there is no life like life in england and the farther that one goes from england the more stagnant i think do the waters of existence become but if it be so for men it is ten times more so for women an englishman if he be at guatemala or belize must work for his bread and that work will find him in thought and excitement but what of his wife where will she find excitement by what pursuit will she repay herself for all that she has left behind her at her mothers fireside she will love her husband yes that at least if there be not that there will be a hell indeed then she will nurse her children and talk of herhome when the time shall come that her promised return thither is within a year or two of its accomplishment her thoughts will all be fixed on that coming pleasure as are the thoughts of a young girl on her first ball for the fortnight before that event comes off on the central plain of that portion of central america which is called costa rica stands the city of san jos it is the capital of the republicfor costa rica is a republicand for central america is a town of some importance it is in the middle of the coffee district surrounded by rich soil on which the sugarcane is produced is blessed with a climate only moderately hot and the native inhabitants are neither cutthroats nor cannibals it may be said therefore that by comparison with some other spots to which englishmen and others are congregated for the gathering together of money san jos may be considered as a happy region but nevertheless a life there is not in every way desirable it is a dull place with little to interest either the eye or the ear although the heat of the tropics is but little felt there on account of its altitude men and women become too lifeless for much enterprise there is no society there are a few germans and a few englishmen in the place who see each other on matters of business during the day but sombre as life generally is they seem to care little for each others company on any other footing i know not to what point the aspirations of the germans may stretch themselves but to the english the one idea that gives salt to life is the idea of home on some day however distant it may be they will once more turn their faces towards the little northern island and then all will be well with them to a certain englishman there and to his dear little wife this prospect came some few years since somewhat suddenly events and tidings it matters not which or what brought it about that they resolved between themselves that they would start immediatelyalmost immediately they would pack up and leave san jos within four months of the day on which their purpose was first formed at san jos a period of only four months for such a purpose was immediately it creates a feeling of instant excitement a necessity for instant doing a consciousness that there was in those few weeks ample work both for the hands and thoughtswork almost more than ample the dear little wife who for the last two years had been so listless felt herself flurried harry she said to her husband how shall we ever be ready and her pretty face was lighted up with unusual brightness at the happy thought of so much haste with such an object and babys things too she said as she thought of all the various little articles of dress that would be needed a journey from san jos to southampton cannot in truth be made as easily as one from london to liverpool let us think of a month to be passed without any aid from the washerwoman and the greatest part of that month amidst the sweltering heats of the west indian tropics in the first month of her hurry and flurry mrs arkwright was a happy woman she would see her mother again and her sisters it was now four years since she had left them on the quay at southampton while all their hearts were broken at the parting she was a young bride then going forth with her new lord to meet the stern world he had then been home to look for a wife and he had found what he looked for in the younger sister of his partner for he henry arkwright and his wifes brother abel ring had established themselves together in san jos and now she thought how there would be another meeting on those quays at which there should be no broken hearts at which there should be love without sorrow and kisses sweet with the sweetness of welcome not bitter with the bitterness of parting and people told herthe few neighbours around herhow happy how fortunate she was to get home thus early in her life they had been out some tensome twenty years and still the day of their return was distant and then she pressed her living baby to her breast and wiped away a tear as she thought of the other darling whom she would leave beneath that distant sod and then came the question as to the route home san jos stands in the middle of the high plain of costa rica half way between the pacific and the atlantic the journey thence down to the pacific is by comparison easy there is a road and the mules on which the travellers must ride go steadily and easily down to punta arenas the port on that ocean there are inns too on the wayplaces of public entertainment at which refreshment may be obtained and beds or fair substitutes for beds but then by this route the traveller must take a long additional sea voyage he must convey himself and his weary baggage down to that wretched place on the pacific there wait for a steamer to take him to panam cross the isthmus and reship himself in the other waters for his long journey home that terrible unshipping and reshipping is a sore burden to the unaccustomed traveller when it is absolutely necessarythen indeed it is done without much thought but in the case of the arkwrights it was not absolutely necessary and there was another reason which turned mrs arkwrights heart against that journey by punt arenas the place is unhealthy having at certain seasons a very bad nameand here on their outward journey her husband had been taken ill she had never ceased to think of the fortnight she had spent there among uncouth strangers during a portion of which his life had trembled in the balance early therefore in those four months she begged that she might not be taken round by punt arenas there was another route harry if you love me let me go by the serapiqui as to harrys loving her there was no doubt about that as she well knew there was this other route by the serapiqui river and by greytown greytown it is true is quite as unhealthy as punt arenas and by that route ones baggage must be shipped and unshipped into small boats there are all manner of difficulties attached to it perhaps no direct road to and from any city on the worlds surface is subject to sharper fatigue while it lasts journeying by this route also the traveller leaves san jos mounted on his mule and so mounted he makes his way through the vast primeval forests down to the banks of the serapiqui river that there is a track for him is of course true but it is simply a track and during nine months of the twelve is so deep in mud that the mules sink in it to their bellies then when the river has been reached the traveller seats him in his canoe and for two days is paddled downdown along the serapiqui into the san juan river and down along the san juan till he reaches greytown passing one night at some hut on the river side at greytown he waits for the steamer which will carry him his first stage on his road towards southampton he must be a connoisseur in disagreeables of every kind who can say with any precision whether greytown or punt arenas is the better place for a weeks sojourn for a full month mr arkwright would not give way to his wife at first he all but conquered her by declaring that the serapiqui journey would be dangerous for the baby but she heard from some one that it could be made less fatiguing for the baby than the other route a baby had been carried down in a litter strapped on to a mules back a guide at the mules head would be necessary and that was all when once in her boat the baby would be as well as in her cradle what purpose cannot a woman gain by perseverance her purpose in this instance mrs arkwright did at last gain by persevering and then their preparations for the journey went on with much flurrying and hot haste to us at home who live and feel our life every day the manufacture of endless babylinen and the packing of mountains of clothes does not give an idea of much pleasurable excitement but at san jos where there was scarcely motion enough in existence to prevent its waters from becoming foul with stagnation this packing of babylinen was delightful and for a month or so the days went by with happy wings but by degrees reports began to reach both arkwright and his wife as to this new route which made them uneasy the wet season had been prolonged and even though they might not be deluged by rain themselves the path would be in such a state of mud as to render the labour incessant one or two people declared that the road was unfit at any time for a womanand then the river would be much swollen these tidings did not reach arkwright and his wife together or at any rate not till late amidst their preparations or a change might still have been made as it was after all her entreaties mrs arkwright did not like to ask him again to alter his plans and he having altered them once was averse to change them again so things went on till the mules and the boats had been hired and things had gone so far that no change could then be made without much cost and trouble during the last ten days of their sojourn at san jos mrs arkwright had lost all that appearance of joy which had cheered up her sweet face during the last few months terror at that terrible journey obliterated in her mind all the happiness which had arisen from the hope of being soon at home she was thoroughly cowed by the danger to be encountered and would gladly have gone down to punt arenas had it been now possible that she could so arrange it it rained and rained and still rained when there was now only a week from the time they started oh if they could only wait for another month but this she said to no one after what had passed between her and her husband she had not the heart to say such words to him arkwright himself was a man not given to much talking a silent thoughtful man stern withal in his outward bearing but tenderhearted and loving in his nature the sweet young wife who had left all and come with him out to that dull distant place was very dear to himdearer than she herself was aware and in these days he was thinking much of her coming troubles why had he given way to her foolish prayers ah why indeed and thus the last few days of their sojourn in san jos passed away from them once or twice during these days she did speak out expressing her fears her feelings were too much for her and she could not restrain herself poor mamma she said i shall never see her and then again harry i know i shall never reach home alive fanny my darling that is nonsense but in order that his spoken word might not sound stern to her he took her in his arms and kissed her you must behave well fanny he said to her the day before they started though her heart was then very low within her she promised him that she would do her best and then she made a great resolution though she should be dying on the road she would not complain beyond the absolute necessity of her nature she fully recognised his thoughtful tender kindness for though he thus cautioned her he never told her that the dangers which she feared were the result of her own choice he never threw in her teeth those prayers which she had made in yielding to which he knew that he had been weak then came the morning of their departure the party of travellers consisted of four besides the baby there was mr arkwright his wife and an english nurse who was going to england with them and her brother abel king who was to accompany them as far as the serapiqui river when they had reached that the real labour of the journey would be over they had eight mules four for the four travellers one for the baby a spare mule laden simply with blankets so that mrs arkwright might change in order that she should not be fatigued by the fatigue of her beast and two for their luggage the heavier portion of their baggage had already been sent off by punt arenas and would meet them at the other side of the isthmus of panam for the last four days the rain had ceasedhad ceased at any rate at san jos those who knew the country well would know that it might still be raining over those vast forests but now as the matter was settled they would hope for the best on that morning on which they started the sun shone fairly and they accepted this as an omen of good baby seemed to lay comfortably on her pile of blankets on the mules back and the face of the tall indian guide who took his place at that mules head pleased the anxious mother not leave him ever he said in spanish laying his hand on the cord which was fastened to the beasts head and not for one moment did he leave his charge though the labour of sticking close to him was very great they had four attendants or guides all of whom made the journey on foot that they were all men of mixed race was probable but three of them would have been called spaniards spaniards that is of costa rica and the other would be called an indian one of the spaniards was the leader or chief man of the party but the others seemed to stand on an equal footing with each other and indeed the place of greatest care had been given to the indian for the first four or five miles their route lay along the high road which leads from san jos to punt arenas and so far a group of acquaintances followed them all mounted on mules here where the ways forked their road leading through the great forests to the atlantic they separated and many tears were shed on each side what might be the future life of the arkwrights had not been absolutely fixed but there was a strong hope on their part that they might never be forced to return to costa rica those from whom they now parted had not seemed to be dear to them in any especial degree while they all lived together in the same small town seeing each other day by day but nownow that they might never meet again a certain love sprang up for the old familiar faces and women kissed each other who hitherto had hardly cared to enter each others houses and then the party of the arkwrights again started and its steady work began in the whole of the first day the way beneath their feet was tolerably good and the weather continued fine it was one long gradual ascent from the plain where the roads parted but there was no real labour in travelling mrs arkwright rode beside her babys mule at the head of which the indian always walked and the two men went together in front the husband had found that his wife would prefer this as long as the road allowed of such an arrangement her heart was too full to admit of much speaking and so they went on in silence the first night was passed in a hut by the roadside which seemed to be deserteda hut or rancho as it is called in that country their food they had of course brought with them and here by common consent they endeavoured in some sort to make themselves merry fanny arkwright said to her it is not so bad after all eh my darling no she answered only that the mule tires one so will all the days be as long as that he had not the heart to tell her that as regarded hours of work that first day must of necessity be the shortest they had risen to a considerable altitude and the night was very cold but baby was enveloped among a pile of coloured blankets and things did not go very badly with them only this that when fanny arkwright rose from her hard bed her limbs were more weary and much more stiff than they had been when arkwright had lifted her from her mule on the second morning they mounted before the day had quite broken in order that they might breakfast on the summit of the ridge which separates the two oceans at this spot the good road comes to an end and the forest track begins and here also they would in truth enter the forest though their path had for some time been among straggling trees and bushes and now again they rode two and two up to this place of halting arkwright and ring well knowing that from hence their labours would in truth commence poor mrs arkwright when she reached this restingplace would fain have remained there for the rest of the day one word in her low plaintive voice she said asking whether they might not sleep in the large shed which stands there but this was manifestly impossible at such a pace they would never reach greytown and she spoke no further word when he told her that they must go on at about noon that day the file of travellers formed itself into the line which it afterwards kept during the whole of the journey and then started by the narrowpath into the forest first walked the leader of the guides then another man following him abel ring came next and behind him the maidservant then the babys mule with the indian ever at its head close at his heels followed mrs arkwright so that the mothers eye might be always on her child and after her her husband then another guide on foot completed the number of the travellers in this way they went on and on day after day till they reached the banks of the serapiqui never once varying their places in the procession as they started in the morning so they went on till their noondays rest and so again they made their evening march in that journey there was no idea of variety no searching after the pleasures of scenery no attempts at conversation with any object of interest or amusement what words were spoken were those simply needful or produced by sympathy for suffering so they journeyed always in the same places with one exception they began their work with two guides leading them but before the first day was over one of them had fallen back to the side of mrs arkwright for she was unable to sit on her mule without support their daily work was divided into two stages so as to give some hours for rest in the middle of the day it had been arranged that the distance for each day should not be longshould be very short as was thought by them all when they talked it over at san jos but now the hours which they passed in the saddle seemed to be endless their descent began from that ridge of which i have spoken and they had no sooner turned their faces down upon the mountain slopes looking towards the atlantic than that passage of mud began to which there was no cessation till they found themselves on the banks of the serapiqui river i doubt whether it be possible to convey in words an adequate idea of the labour of riding over such a path it is not that any active exertion is necessarythat there is anything which requires doing the traveller has before him the simple task of sitting on his mule from hour to hour and of seeing that his knees do not get themselves jammed against the trees but at every step the beast he rides has to drag his legs out from the deep clinging mud and the body of the rider never knows one moment of ease why the mules do not die on the road i cannot say they live through it and do not appear to suffer they have their own way in everything for no exertion on the riders part will make them walk either faster or slower than is their wont on the day on which they entered the forestthat being the second of their journeymrs arkwright had asked for mercy for permission to escape that second stage on the next she allowed herself to be lifted into her saddle after her midday rest without a word she had tried to sleep but in vain and had sat within a little hut looking out upon the desolate scene before her with her baby in her lap she had this one comfort that of all the travellers she the baby suffered the least they had now left the high grounds and the heat was becoming great though not as yet intense and then the indian guide looking out slowly over the forest saw that the rain was not yet over he spoke a word or two to one of his companions in a low voice and in a patois which mrs arkwright did not understand and then going after the husband told him that the heavens were threatening we have only two leagues said arkwright and it may perhaps hold up it will begin in an hour said the indian and the two leagues are four hours and tomorrow asked arkwright tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow it will still rain said the guide looking as he spoke up over the huge primeval forest then we had better start at once said arkwright before the first falling drops frighten the women so the mules were brought out and he lifted his uncomplaining wife on to the blankets which formed her pillion the file again formed itself and slowly they wound their way out from the small enclosure by which the hut was surroundedout from the enclosure on to a rough scrap of undrained pasture ground from which the trees had been cleared in a few minutes they were once more struggling through the mud the name of the spot which our travellers had just left is carablanco there they found a woman living all alone her husband was away she told them at san jos but would be back to her when the dry weather came to look up the young cattle which were straying in the forest what a life for a woman nevertheless in talking with mrs arkwright she made no complaint of her own lot but had done what little she could to comfort the poor lady who was so little able to bear the fatigues of her journey is the road very bad mrs arkwright asked her in a whisper ah yes it is a bad road and when shall we be at the river it took me four days said the woman then i shall never see my mother again and as she spoke mrs arkwright pressed her baby to her bosom immediately after that her husband came in and they started their path now led away across the slope of a mountain which seemed to fall from the very top of that central ridge in an unbroken descent down to the valley at its foot hitherto since they had entered the forest they had had nothing before their eyes but the trees and bushes which grew close around them but now a prospect of unrivalled grandeur was opened before them if only had they been able to enjoy it at the bottom of the valley ran a river which so great was the depth looked like a moving silver cord and on the other side of this there arose another mountain steep but unbroken like that which they were passingunbroken so that the eye could stretch from the river up to the very summit not a spot on that mountain side or on their side either was left uncovered by thick forest which had stood there untouched by man since nature first produced it but all this was nothing to our travellers nor was the clang of the macaws anything or the roaring of the little congo ape nothing was gained by them from beautiful scenery nor was there any fear from the beasts of prey the immediate pain of each step of the journey drove all other feelings from them and their thoughts were bounded by an intense desire for the evening halt and then as the guide had prophesied the rain began at first it came in such small soft drops that it was found to be refreshing but the clouds soon gathered and poured forth their collected waters as though it had not rained for months among those mountains not that it came in big drops or with the violence which wind can give it beating hither and thither breaking branches from the trees and rising up again as it pattered against the ground there was no violence in the rain it fell softly in a long continuous noiseless stream sinking into everything that it touched converting the deep rich earth on all sides into mud not a word was said by any of them as it came on the indian covered the baby with her blanket closer than she was covered before and the guide who walked by mrs arkwrights side drew her cloak around her knees but such efforts were in vain there is a rain that will penetrate everything and such was the rain which fell upon them now nevertheless as i have said hardly a word was spoken the poor woman finding that the heat of her cloak increased her sufferings threw it open again fanny said her husband you had better let him protect you as well as he can she answered him merely by an impatient wave of her hand intending to signify that she could not speak but that in this matter she must have her way after that her husband made no further attempt to control her he could see however that ever and again she would have slipped forward from her mule and fallen had not the man by her side steadied her with his hand at every tree he protected her knees and feet though there was hardly room for him to move between the beast and the bank against which he was thrust and then at last that days work was also over and fanny arkwright slipped from her pillion down into her husbands arms at the door of another rancho in the forest here there lived a large family adding from year to year to the patch of ground which they had rescued from the wood and valiantly doing their part in the extension of civilisation our party was but a few steps from the door when they left their mules but mrs arkwright did not now as heretofore hasten to receive her baby in her arms when placed upon the ground she still leaned against the mule and her husband saw that he must carry her into the hut this he did and then wet mudladen dishevelled as she was she laid herself down upon the planks that were to form her bed and there stretched out her arms for her infant on that evening they undressed and tended her like a child and then when she was alone with her husband she repeated to him her sad foreboding harry she said i shall never see my mother again oh yes fanny you will see her and talk over all these troubles with pleasure it is very bad i know but we shall live through it yet you will of course and you will take baby home to her and face her without you no my darling three more days riding or rather two and a half will bring us to the river and then your trouble will be over all will be easy after that ah harry you do not know i do know that it is very bad my girl but you must cheer up we shall be laughing at all this in a months time on the following morning she allowed herself to be lifted up speaking no word of remonstrance indeed she was like a child in their hands having dropped all the dignity and authority of a womans demeanour it rained again during the whole of this day and the heat was becoming oppressive as every hour they were descending nearer and nearer to the sea level during this first stage hardly a word was spoken by any one but when she was again taken from her mule she was in tears the poor servantgirl too was almost prostrate with fatigue and absolutely unable to wait upon her mistress or even to do anything for herself nevertheless they did make the second stage seeing that their midday resting place had been under the trees of the forest had there been any hut there they would have remained for the night on the following day they rested altogether though the place at which they remained had but few attractions it was another forest hut inhabited by an old spanish couple who were by no means willing to give them room although they paid for their accommodation at exorbitant rates it is one singularity of places strange and out of the way like such forest tracks as these that money in small sums is hardly valued dollars there were not appreciated as sixpences are in this rich country but there they stayed for a day and the guides employed themselves in making a litter with long poles so that they might carry mrs arkwright over a portion of the ground poor fellows when once she had thus changed her mode of conveyance she never again was lifted on to the mule there was strong reason against this days delay they were to go down the serapiqui along with the post which would overtake them on its banks but if the post should pass them before they got there it could not wait and then they would be deprived of the best canoe on the water then also it was possible if they encountered further delay that the steamer might sail from greytown without them and a months residence at that frightful place be thus made necessary the days rest apparently did little to relieve mrs arkwrights sufferings on the following day she allowed herself to be put upon the mule but after the first hour the beasts were stopped and she was taken off it during that hour they had travelled hardly over half a league at that time she so sobbed and moaned that arkwright absolutely feared that she would perish in the forest and he implored the guides to use the poles which they had prepared she had declared to him over and over again that she felt sure that she should die and halfdelirious with weariness and suffering had begged him to leave her at the last hut they had not yet come to the flat ground over which a litter might be carried with comparative ease but nevertheless the men yielded and she was placed in a recumbent position upon blankets supported by boughs of trees in this way she went through that day with somewhat less of suffering than before and without that necessity for selfexertion which had been worse to her than any suffering there were places between that and the river at which one would have said that it was impossible that a litter should be carried or even impossible that a mule should walk with a load on his back but still they went on and the men carried their burden without complaining not a word was said about money or extra paynot a word at least by them and when arkwright was profuse in his offer their leader told him that they would not have done it for money but for the poor suffering seora they would make exertions which no money would have bought from them on the next day about noon the post did pass them consisting of three strong men carrying great weights on their backs suspended by bands from their foreheads they travelled much quicker than our friends and would reach the banks of the river that evening in their ordinary course they would start down the river close upon daybreak on the following day but after some consultation with the guides they agreed to wait till noon poor mrs arkwright knew nothing of hours or of any such arrangements now but her husband greatly doubted their power of catching this mail despatch however it did not much depend on their exertions that afternoon their restingplace was marked out for them and they could not go beyond it unless indeed they could make the whole journey which was impossible but towards evening matters seemed to improve with them they had now got on to ground which was more open and the men who carried the litter could walk with greater ease mrs arkwright also complained less and when they reached their restingplace on that night said nothing of a wish to be left there to her fate this was a place called padregal a cacao plantation which had been cleared in the forest with much labour there was a house here containing three rooms and some forty or fifty acres round it had been stripped of the forest trees but nevertheless the adventure had not been a prosperous one for the place was at that time deserted there were the cacao plants but there was no one to pick the cacao there was a certain melancholy beauty about the place a few grand trees had been left standing near the house and the grass around was rich and parklike but it was deserted and nothing was heard but the roaring of the congos ah me indeed it was a melancholy place as it was seen by some of that party afterwards on the following morning they were astir very early and mrs arkwright was so much better that she offered to sit again upon her mule the men however declared that they would finish their task and she was placed again upon the litter and then with slow and weary step they did make their way to the river bank it was not yet noon when they saw the mud fort which stands there and as they drew into the enclosure round a small house which stands close by the river side they saw the three postmen still busy about their packages thank god said arkwright thank god indeed said his brother all will be right with you now well fanny said her husband as he took her very gently from the litter and seated her on a bench which stood outside the door it is all over nowis it not she answered him by a shower of tears but they were tears which brought her relief he was aware of this and therefore stood by her still holding her by both her hands while her head rested against his side you will find the motion of the boat very gentle he said indeed there will be no motion and you and baby will sleep all the way down to greytown she did not answer him in words but she looked up into his face and he could see that her spirit was recovering itself there was almost a crowd of people collected on the spot preparatory to the departure of the canoes in the first place there was the commandant of the fort to whom the small house belonged he was looking to the passports of our friends and with due diligence endeavouring to make something of the occasion by discovering fatal legal impediments to the further prosecution of their voyage which impediments would disappear on the payment of certain dollars and then there were half a dozen costa rican soldiers men with coloured caps and old muskets ready to support the dignity and authority of the commandant there were the guides taking payment from abel ring for their past work and the postmen preparing their boats for the further journey and then there was a certain german there with a german servant to whom the boats belonged he also was very busy preparing for the river voyage he was not going down with them but it was his business to see them well started a singular looking man was he with a huge shaggy beard and shaggy uncombed hair but with bright blue eyes which gave to his face a remarkable look of sweetness he was an uncouth man to the eye and yet a child would have trusted herself with him in a forest at this place they remained some two hours coffee was prepared here and mrs arkwright refreshed herself and her child they washed and arranged their clothes and when she stepped down the steep bank clinging to her husbands arm as she made her way towards the boat she smiled upon him as he looked at her it is all over nowis it not my girlhe said encouraging her oh harry do not talk about it she answered shuddering but i want you to say a word to me to let me know that you are better i am bettermuch better and you will see your mother again will you not and give baby to her yourself to this she made no immediate answer for she was on a level with the river and the canoe was close at her feet and then she had to bid farewell to her brother he was now the unfortunate one of the party for his destiny required that he should go back to san jos alonego back and remain there perhaps some ten years longer before he might look for the happiness of home god bless you dearest abel she said kissing him and sobbing as she spoke goodbye fanny he said and do not let them forget me in england it is a great comfort to think that the worst of your troubles are over ohshes all right now said arkwright goodbye old boyand the two brothersinlaw grasped each others hands heartily keep up your spirits and well have you home before long oh im all right said the other but from the tone of the voices it was clear that poor ring was despondent at the thoughts of his coming solitude and that arkwright was already triumphing in his emancipation and then with much care fanny arkwright was stowed away in the boat there was a great contest about the baby but at last it was arranged that at any rate for the first few hours she should be placed in the boat with the servant the mother was told that by this plan she would feel herself at liberty to sleep during the heat of the day and then she might hope to have strength to look to the child when they should be on shore during the night in this way therefore they prepared to start while abel ring stood on the bank looking at them with wishful eyes in the first boat were two indians paddling and a third man steering with another paddle in the middle there was much luggage and near the luggage so as to be under shade was the babys soft bed if nothing evil happened to the boat the child could not be more safe in the best cradle that was ever rocked with her was the maidservant and some stranger who was also going down to greytown in the second boat were the same number of men to paddle the indian guide being one of them and there were the mails placed then there was a seat arranged with blankets cloaks and cushions for mrs arkwright so that she might lean back and sleep without fatigue and immediately opposite to her her husband placed himself you all look very comfortable said poor abel from the bank we shall do very well now said arkwright and i do think i shall see mamma again said his wife thats right old girlof course you will see her now thenwe are all ready and with some little assistance from the german on the bank the first boat was pushed off into the stream the river in this place is rapid because the full course of the water is somewhat impeded by a bank of earth jutting out from the opposite side of the river into the stream but it is not so rapid as to make any recognised danger in the embarkation below this bank which is opposite to the spot at which the boats were entered there were four or five broken trees in the water some of the shattered boughs of which showed themselves above the surface these are called snags and are very dangerous if they are met with in the course of the stream but in this instance no danger was apprehended from them as they lay considerably to the left of the passage which the boats would take the first canoe was pushed off by the german and went rapidly away the waters were strong with rain and it was pretty to see with what velocity the boat was carried on some hundred of yards in advance of the other by the force of the first effort of the paddle the german however from the bank holloaed to the first men in spanish bidding them relax their efforts for a while and then he said a word or two of caution to those who were now on the point of starting the boat then was pushed steadily forward the man at the stern keeping it with his paddle a little farther away from the bank at which they had embarked it was close under the land that the stream ran the fastest and in obedience to the directions given to him he made his course somewhat nearer to the sunken trees it was but one turn of his hand that gave the light boat its direction but that turn of the hand was too strong had the anxious master of the canoes been but a thought less anxious all might have been well but as it was the prow of the boat was caught by some slight hidden branch which impeded its course and turned it round in the rapid river the whole length of the canoe was thus brought against the sunken tree and in half a minute the five occupants of the boat were struggling in the stream abel ring and the german were both standing on the bank close to the water when this happened and each for a moment looked into the others face stand where you are shouted the german so that you may assist them from the shore i will go in and then throwing from him his boots and coat he plunged into the river the canoe had been swept round so as to be brought by the force of the waters absolutely in among the upturned roots and broken stumps of the trees which impeded the river and thus when the party was upset they were at first to be seen scrambling among the branches but unfortunately there was much more wood below the water than above it and the force of the stream was so great that those who caught hold of the timber were not able to support themselves by it above the surface arkwright was soon to be seen some forty yards down having been carried clear of the trees and here he got out of the river on the further bank the distance to him was not above forty yards but from the nature of the ground he could not get up towards his wife unless he could have forced his way against the stream the indian who had had charge of the baby rose quickly to the surface was carried once round in the eddy with his head high above the water and then was seen to throw himself among the broken wood he had seen the dress of the poor woman and made his effort to save her the other two men were so caught by the fragments of the boughs that they could not extricate themselves so as to make any exertions ultimately however they also got out on the further bank mrs arkwright had sunk at once on being precipitated into the water but the buoyancy of her clothes had brought her for a moment again to the surface she had risen for a moment and then had again gone down immediately below the forked trunk of a huge treehad gone down alas alas never to rise again with life within her bosom the poor indian made two attempts to save her and then came up himself incapable of further effort it was then that the german the owner of the canoes who had fought his way with great efforts across the violence of the waters and indeed up against the stream for some few yards made his effort to save the life of that poor frail creature he had watched the spot at which she had gone down and even while struggling across the river had seen how the indian had followed her and had failed it was now his turn his life was in his hand and he was prepared to throw it away in that attempt having succeeded in placing himself a little above the large tree he turned his face towards the bottom of the river and dived down among the branches and he also after that was never again seen with the lifeblood flowing round his heart when the sun set that night the two swollen corpses were lying in the commandants hut and abel ring and arkwright were sitting beside them arkwright had his baby sleeping in his arms but he sat there for hoursinto the middle of the long nightwithout speaking a word to any one harry said his brother at last come away and lay down it will be good for you to sleep nothing ever will be good again for me said he you must bear up against your sorrow as other men do said ring why am i not sleeping with her as the poor german sleeps why did i let another man take my place in dying for her and then he walked away that the other might not see the tears on his face it was a sad nightthat at the commandants hut and a sad morning followed upon it it must be remembered that they had there none of those appurtenances which are so necessary to make woe decent and misfortune comfortable they sat through the night in the small hut and in the morning they came forth with their clothes still wet and dirty with their haggard faces and weary stiff limbs encumbered with the horrid task of burying that loved body among the forest trees and then to keep life in them till it was done the brandy flask passed from hand to hand and after that with slow but resolute efforts they reformed the litter on which the living woman had been carried thither and took her body back to the wild plantation at padregal there they dug for her her grave and repeating over her some portion of the service for the dead left her to sleep the sleep of death but before they left her they erected a pallisade of timber round the grave so that the beasts of the forest should not tear the body from its restingplace when that was done arkwright and his brother made their slow journey back to san jos the widowed husband could not face his darlings mother with such a tale upon his tongue as that a ride across palestine circumstances took me to the holy land without a companion and compelled me to visit bethany the mount of olives and the church of the sepulchre alone i acknowledge myself to be a gregarious animal or perhaps rather one of those which nature has intended to go in pairs at any rate i dislike solitude and especially travelling solitude and was therefore rather sad at heart as i sat one night at zs hotel in jerusalem thinking over my proposed wanderings for the next few days early on the following morning i intended to start of course on horseback for the dead sea the banks of jordan jericho and those mountains of the wilderness through which it is supposed that our saviour wandered for the forty days when the devil tempted him i would then return to the holy city and remaining only long enough to refresh my horse and wipe the dust from my hands and feet i would start again for jaffa and there catch a certain austrian steamer which would take me to egypt such was my programme and i confess that i was but ill contented with it seeing that i was to be alone during the time i had already made all my arrangements and though i had no reason for any doubt as to my personal security during the trip i did not feel altogether satisfied with them i intended to take a french guide or dragoman who had been with me for some days and to put myself under the peculiar guardianship of two bedouin arabs who were to accompany me as long as i should remain east of jerusalem this travelling through the desert under the protection of bedouins was in idea pleasant enough and i must here declare that i did not at all begrudge the forty shillings which i was told by our british consul that i must pay them for their trouble in accordance with the established tariff but i did begrudge the fact of the tariff i would rather have fallen in with my friendly arabs as it were by chance and have rewarded their fidelity at the end of our joint journeyings by a donation of piastres to be settled by myself and which under such circumstances would certainly have been as agreeable to them as the stipulated sum in the same way i dislike having waiters put down in my bill i find that i pay them twice over and thus lose money and as they do not expect to be so treated i never have the advantage of their civility the world i fear is becoming too fond of tariffs a tariff said i to the consul feeling that the whole romance of my expedition would be dissipated by such an arrangement then ill go alone ill take a revolver with me you cant do it sir said the consul in a dry and somewhat angry tone you have no more right to ride through that country without paying the regular price for protection than you have to stop in z s hotel without settling the bill i could not contest the point so i ordered my bedouins for the appointed day exactly as i would send for a ticketporter at home and determined to make the best of it the wild unlimited sands the desolation of the dead sea the rushing waters of jordan the outlines of the mountains of moabthose things the consular tariff could not alter nor deprive them of the glories of their association i had submitted and the arrangements had been made joseph my dragoman was to come to me with the horses and an arab groom at five in the morning and we were to encounter our bedouins outside the gate of st stephen down the hill where the road turns close to the tomb of the virgin i was sitting alone in the public room at the hotel filling my flask with brandyfor matters of primary importance i never leave to servant dragoman or guidewhen the waiter entered and said that a gentleman wished to speak with me the gentleman had not sent in his card or name but any gentleman was welcome to me in my solitude and i requested that the gentleman might enter in appearance the gentleman certainly was a gentleman for i thought that i had never before seen a young man whose looks were more in his favour or whose face and gait and outward bearing seemed to betoken better breeding he might be some twenty or twentyone years of age was slight and well made with very black hair which he wore rather long very dark long bright eyes a straight nose and teeth that were perfectly white he was dressed throughout in grey tweed clothing having coat waistcoat and trousers of the same and in his hand he carried a very broadbrimmed straw hat mr jones i believe he said as he bowed to me jones is a good travelling name and if the reader will allow me i will call myself jones on the present occasion yes i said pausing with the brandybottle in one hand and the flask in the other thats my name im jones can i do anything for you sir why yes you can said he my name is smithjohn smith pray sit down mr smith i said pointing to a chair will you do anything in this way and i proposed to hand the bottle to him as far as i can judge from a short stay you wont find much like that in jerusalem he declined the cognac however and immediately began his story i hear mr jones said he that you are going to moab tomorrow well i replied i dont know whether i shall cross the water its not very easy i take it at all times but i shall certainly get as far as jordan can i do anything for you in those parts and then he explained to me what was the object of his visit he was quite alone in jerusalem as i was myself and was staying at hs hotel he had heard that i was starting for the dead sea and had called to ask if i objected to his joining me he had found himself he said very lonely and as he had heard that i also was alone he had ventured to call and make his proposition he seemed to be very bashful and half ashamed of what he was doing and when he had done speaking he declared himself conscious that he was intruding and expressed a hope that i would not hesitate to say so if his suggestion were from any cause disagreeable to me as a rule i am rather shy of chance travelling english friends it has so frequently happened to me that i have had to blush for the acquaintances whom i have selected that i seldom indulge in any close intimacies of this kind but nevertheless i was taken with john smith in spite of his name there was so much about him that was pleasant both to the eye and to the understanding one meets constantly with men from contact with whom one revolts without knowing the cause of such dislike the cut of their beard is displeasing or the mode in which they walk or speak but on the other hand there are men who are attractive and i must confess that i was attracted by john smith at first sight i hesitated however for a minute for there are sundry things of which it behoves a traveller to think before he can join a companion for such a journey as that which i was about to make could the young man rise early and remain in the saddle for ten hours together could he live upon hardboiled eggs and brandyandwater could he take his chance of a tent under which to sleep and make himself happy with the bare fact of being in the desert he saw my hesitation and attributed it to a cause which was not present in my mind at the moment though the subject was one of the greatest importance when strangers consent to join themselves together for a time and agree to become no strangers on the spur of the moment of course i will take half the expense said he absolutely blushing as he mentioned the matter as to that there will be very little you have your own horse of course oh yes my dragoman and groomboy will do for both but youll have to pay forty shillings to the arabs theres no getting over that the consul wont even look after your dead body if you get murdered without going through that ceremony mr smith immediately produced his purse which he tendered to me if you will manage it all said he it will make it so much the easier and i shall be infinitely obliged to you this of course i declined to do i had no business with his purse and explained to him that if we went together we could settle that on our return to jerusalem but could he go through really hard work i asked he answered me with an assurance that he would and could do anything in that way that it was possible for man to perform as for eating and drinking he cared nothing about it and would undertake to be astir at any hour of the morning that might be named as for sleeping accommodation he did not care if he kept his clothes on for a week together he looked slight and weak but he spoke so well and that without boasting that i ultimately agreed to his proposal and in a few minutes he took his leave of me promising to be at zs door with his horse at five oclock on the following morning i wish youd allow me to leave my purse with you he said again i cannot think of it there is no possible occasion for it i said again if there is anything to pay ill ask you for it when the journey is over that forty shillings you must fork out its a law of the medes and persians id better give it you at once he said again offering me money but i would not have it it would be quite time enough for that when the arabs were leaving us because he added strangers i know are sometimes suspicious about money and i would not for worlds have you think that i would put you to expense i assured him that i did not think so and then the subject was dropped he was at any rate up to his time for when i came down on the following morning i found him in the narrow street the first on horseback joseph the frenchman was strapping on to a rough pony our belongings and was staring at mr smith my new friend unfortunately could not speak a word of french and therefore i had to explain to the dragoman how it had come to pass that our party was to be enlarged but the bedouins will expect full pay for both said he alarmed men in that class and especially orientals always think that every arrangement of life let it be made in what way it will is made with the intention of saving some expense or cheating somebody out of some money they do not understand that men can have any other object and are ever on their guard lest the saving should be made at their cost or lest they should be the victims of the fraud all right said i i shall be responsible monsieur said the dragoman piteously it shall be all right said i again if that does not satisfy you you may remain behind if monsieur says it is all right of course it is so and then he completed his strapping we took blankets with us of which i had to borrow two out of the hotel for my friend smith a small hamper of provisions a sack containing forage for the horses and a large empty jar so that we might supply ourselves with water when leaving the neighbourhood of wells for any considerable time i ought to have brought these things for myself said smith quite unhappy at finding that he had thrown on me the necessity of catering for him but i laughed at him saying that it was nothing he should do as much for me another time i am prepared to own that i do not willingly rush upstairs and load myself with blankets out of strange rooms for men whom i do not know nor as a rule do i make all the smiths of the world free of my canteen but with reference to this fellow i did feel more than ordinarily goodnatured and unselfish there was something in the tone of his voice which was satisfactory and i should really have felt vexed had anything occurred at the last moment to prevent his going with me let it be a rule with every man to carry an english saddle with him when travelling in the east of what material is formed the nether man of a turk i have never been informed but i am sure that it is not flesh and blood no flesh and bloodsimply flesh and bloodcould withstand the wear and tear of a turkish saddle this being the case and the consequences being well known to me i was grieved to find that smith was not properly provided he was seated on one of those hard red highpointed machines in which the shovels intended to act as stirrups are attached in such a manner and hang at such an angle as to be absolutely destructive to the leg of a christian there is no part of the christian body with which the turkish saddle comes in contact that does not become more or less macerated i have sat in one for days but i left it a flayed man and therefore i was sorry for smith i explained this to him taking hold of his leg by the calf to show how the leather would chafe him but it seemed to me that he did not quite like my interference never mind said he twitching his leg away i have ridden in this way before then you must have suffered the very mischief only a little and i shall be used to it now you will not hear me complain by heavens you might have heard me complain a mile off when i came to the end of a journey i once took i roared like a bull when i began to cool joseph could you not get a european saddle for mr smith but joseph did not seem to like mr smith and declared such a thing to be impossible no european in jerusalem would think of lending so precious an article except to a very dear friend joseph himself was on an english saddle and i made up my mind that after the first stage we would bribe him to make an exchange and then we started the bedouins were not with us but we were to meet them as i have said before outside st stephens gate and if they are not there said joseph we shall be sure to come across them on the road not there said i how about the consuls tariff if they dont keep their part of the engagement but joseph explained to me that their part of the engagement really amounted to thisthat we should ride into their country without molestation provided that such and such payments were made it was the period of easter and jerusalem was full of pilgrims even at that early hour of the morning we could hardly make our way through the narrow streets it must be understood that there is no accommodation in the town for the fourteen or fifteen thousand strangers who flock to the holy sepulchre at this period of the year many of them sleep out in the open air lying on low benches which run along the outside walls of the houses or even on the ground wrapped in their thick hoods and cloaks slumberers such as these are easily disturbed nor are they detained long at their toilets they shake themselves like dogs and growl and stretch themselves and then they are ready for the day we rode out of the town in a long file first went the groomboy i forget his proper syrian appellation but we used to call him mucherry that sound being in some sort like the name then followed the horse with the forage and blankets and next to him my friend smith in the turkish saddle i was behind him and joseph brought up the rear we moved slowly down the via dolorosa noting the spot at which our saviour is said to have fallen while bearing his cross we passed by pilates house and paused at the gate of the templethe gate which once was beautifullooking down into the hole of the pool in which the maimed and halt were healed whenever the waters moved what names they are and yet there at jerusalem they are bandied to and fro with as little reverence as are the fanciful appellations given by guides to rocks and stones and little lakes in all countries overrun by tourists for those who would still fain believelet them stay at home said my friend smith for those who cannot divide the wheat from the chaff let them stay at home i answered and then we rode out through st stephens gate having the mountain of the men of galileo directly before us and the mount of olives a little to our right and the valley of jehoshaphat lying between us and it of course you know all these places now said smith i answered that i did know them well and was it not better for you when you knew them only in holy writ he asked no by jove said i the mountains stand where they ever stood the same valleys are still green with the morning dew and the watercourses are unchanged the children of mahomet may build their tawdry temple on the threshingfloor which david bought that there might stand the lords house man may undo what man did even though the doer was solomon but here we have gods handiwork and his own evidences at the bottom of the steep descent from the city gate we came to the tomb of the virgin and by special agreement made with joseph we left our horses here for a few moments in order that we might descend into the subterranean chapel under the tomb in which mass was at this moment being said there is something awful in that chapel when as at the present moment it is crowded with eastern worshippers from the very altar up to the top of the dark steps by which the descent is made it must be remembered that eastern worshippers are not like the churchgoers of london or even of rome or cologne they are wild men of various nations and racesmaronites from lebanon roumelians candiotes copts from upper egypt russians from the crimea armenians and abyssinians they savour strongly of oriental life and of oriental dirt they are clad in skins or hairy cloaks with huge hoods their heads are shaved and their faces covered with short grisly fierce beards they are silent mostly looking out of their eyes ferociously as though murder were in their thoughts and rapine but they never slouch or cringe in their bodies or shuffle in their gait dirty fiercelooking uncouth repellent as they are there is always about them a something of personal dignity which is not compatible with an englishmans ordinary hat and pantaloons as we were about to descend preparing to make our way through the crowd smith took hold of my arm that will never do my dear fellow said i the job will be tough enough for a single file but we should never cut our way two and two im broadshouldered and will go first so i did and gradually we worked our way into the body of the chapel how is it that englishmen can push themselves anywhere these men were fiercelooking and had murder and rapine as i have said almost in their eyes one would have supposed that they were not lambs or doves capable of being thrust here or there without anger on their part and they too were all anxious to descend and approach the altar yet we did win our way through them and apparently no man was angry with us i doubt after all whether a ferocious eye and a strong smell and dirt are so efficacious in creating awe and obedience in others as an open brow and traces of soap and water i know this at leastthat a dirty maronite would make very little progress if he attempted to shove his way unfairly through a crowd of englishmen at the door of a london theatre we did shove unfairly and we did make progress till we found ourselves in the centre of the dense crowd collected in the body of the chapel having got so far our next object was to get out again the place was dark mysterious and full of strange odours but darkness mystery and strange odours soon lose their charms when men have much work before them joseph had made a point of being allowed to attend mass before the altar of the virgin but a very few minutes sufficed for his prayers so we again turned round and pushed our way back again smith still following in my wake the men who had let us pass once let us pass again without opposition or show of anger to them the occasion was very holy they were stretching out their hands in every direction with long tapers in order that they might obtain a spark of the sacred fire which was burning on one of the altars as we made our way out we passed many who with dumb motions begged us to assist them in their object and we did assist them getting lights for their tapers handing them to and fro and using the authority with which we seemed to be invested but smith i observed was much more courteous in this way to the women than to the men as i did not forget to remind him when we were afterwards on our road together remounting our horses we rode slowly up the winding ascent of the mount of olives turning round at the brow of the hill to look back over jerusalem sometimes i think that of all spots in the world this one should be the spot most cherished in the memory of christians it was there that he stood when he wept over the city so much we do know though we are ignorant and ever shall be so of the site of his cross and of the tomb and then we descended on the eastern side of the hill passing through bethany the town of lazarus and his sisters and turned our faces steadily towards the mountains of moab hitherto we had met no bedouins and i interrogated my dragoman about them more than once but he always told me that it did not signify we should meet them he said before any danger could arise as for danger said i i think more of this than i do of the arabs and i put my hand on my revolver but as they agreed to be here here they ought to be dont you carry a revolver smith smith said that he never had done so but that he would take the charge of mine if i liked to this however i demurred i never part with my pistol to any one i said rather drily but he explained that he only intended to signify that if there were danger to be encountered he would be glad to encounter it and i fully believed him we shant have much fighting i replied but if there be any the tool will come readiest to the hand of its master but if you mean to remain here long i would advise you to get one these orientals are a people with whom appearances go a long way and as a rule fear and respect mean the same thing with them a pistol hanging over your loins is no great trouble to you and looks as though you could bite many a dog goes through the world well by merely showing his teeth and then my companion began to talk of himself he did not he said mean to remain in syria very long nor i either said i i have done with this part of the world for the present and shall take the next steamer from jaffa for alexandria i shall only have one night in jerusalem on my return after this he remained silent for a few moments and then declared that that also had been his intention he was almost ashamed to say so however because it looked as though he had resolved to hook himself on to me so he answered expressing almost regret at the circumstance dont let that trouble you said i i shall be delighted to have your company when you know me better as i hope you will do you will find that if such were not the case i should tell you so as frankly i shall remain in cairo some little time so that beyond our arrival in egypt i can answer for nothing he said that he expected letters at alexandria which would govern his future movements i thought he seemed sad as he said so and imagined from his manner that he did not expect very happy tidings indeed i had made up my mind that he was by no means free from care or sorrow he had not the air of a man who could say of himself that he was totus teres atque rotundus but i had no wish to inquire and the matter would have dropped had he not himself addedi fear that i shall meet acquaintances in egypt whom it will give me no pleasure to see then said i if i were you i would go to constantinople insteadindeed anywhere rather than fall among friends who are not friendly and the nearer the friend is the more one feels that sort of thing to my way of thinking there is nothing on earth so pleasant as a pleasant wife but then what is there so damnable as one that is unpleasant are you a married man he inquired all his questions were put in a low tone of voice which seemed to give to them an air of special interest and made one almost feel that they were asked with some special view to ones individual welfare now the fact is that i am a married man with a family but i am not much given to talk to strangers about my domestic concerns and therefore though i had no particular object in view i denied my obligations in this respect no said i i have not come to that promotion yet i am too frequently on the move to write myself down as paterfamilias then you know nothing about that pleasantness of which you spoke just now nor of the unpleasantness thank god my personal experiences are all to comeas also are yours i presume it was possible that he had hampered himself with some woman and that she was to meet him at alexandria poor fellow thought i but his unhappiness was not of that kind no said he i am not married i am all alone in the world then i certainly would not allow myself to be troubled by unpleasant acquaintances it was now four hours since we had left jerusalem and we had arrived at the place at which it was proposed that we should breakfast there was a large well there and shade afforded by a rock under which the water sprung and the arabs had constructed a tank out of which the horses could drink so that the place was ordinarily known as the first stage out of jerusalem smith had said not a word about his saddle or complained in any way of discomfort so that i had in truth forgotten the subject other matters had continually presented themselves and i had never even asked him how he had fared i now jumped from my horse but i perceived at once that he was unable to do so he smiled faintly as his eye caught mine but i knew that he wanted assistance ah said i that confounded turkish saddle has already galled your skin i see how it is i shall have to doctor you with a little brandyexternally applied my friend but i lent him my shoulder and with that assistance he got down very gently and slowly we ate our breakfast with a good will bread and cold fowl and brandyandwater with a hardboiled egg by way of a final delicacy and then i began to bargain with joseph for the loan of his english saddle i saw that smith could not get through the journey with that monstrous turkish affair and that he would go on without complaining till he fainted or came to some other signal grief but the frenchman seeing the plight in which we were was disposed to drive a very hard bargain he wanted forty shillings the price of a pair of live bedouins for the accommodation and declared that even then he should make the sacrifice only out of consideration to me very well said i im tolerably tough myself and ill change with the gentleman the chances are that i shall not be in a very liberal humour when i reach jaffa with stiff limbs and a sore skin i have a very good memory joseph ill take thirty shillings mr jones though i shall have to groan all the way like a condemned devil i struck a bargain with him at last for fiveandtwenty and set him to work to make the necessary change on the horses it will be just the same thing to him i said to smith i find that he is as much used to one as to the other but how much money are you to pay him he asked oh nothing i replied give him a few piastres when you part with him at jaffa i do not know why i should have felt thus inclined to pay money out of my pocket for this smitha man whom i had only seen for the first time on the preceding evening and whose temperament was so essentially different from my own but so i did i would have done almost anything in reason for his comfort and yet he was a melancholy fellow with good inward pluck as i believed but without that outward show of dash and hardihood which i confess i love to see pray tell him that ill pay him for it said he well make that all right i answered and then we remountednot without some difficulty on his part you should have let me rub in that brandy i said you cant conceive how efficaciously i would have done it but he made me no answer at noon we met a caravan of pilgrims coming up from jordan there might be some three or four hundred but the number seemed to be treble that from the loose and straggling line in which they journeyed it was a very singular sight as they moved slowly along the narrow path through the sand coming out of a defile among the hills which was perhaps a quarter of a mile in front of us passing us as we stood still by the wayside and then winding again out of sight on the track over which we had come some rode on camelsa whole family in many cases being perched on the same animal i observed a very old man and a very old woman slung in panniers over a camels backnot such panniers as might be befitting such a purpose but square baskets so that the heads and heels of each of the old couple hung out of the rear and front surely the journey will be their death i said to joseph yes it will he replied quite coolly but what matter how soon they die now that they have bathed in jordan very many rode on donkeys two generally on each donkey others who had command of money on horses but the greater number walked toiling painfully from jerusalem to jericho on the first day sleeping there in tents and going to bathe on the second day and then returning from jericho to jerusalem on the third the pilgrimage is made throughout in accordance with fixed rules and there is a tariff for the tent accommodation at jerichoso much per head per night including the use of hot water standing there close by the wayside we could see not only the garments and faces of these strange people but we could watch their gestures and form some opinion of what was going on within their thoughts they were much quietertamer as it werethan englishmen would be under such circumstances those who were carried seemed to sit on their beasts in passive tranquillity neither enjoying nor suffering anything their object had been to wash in jordanto do that once in their livesand they had washed in jordan the benefit expected was not to be immediately spiritual no earnest prayerfulness was considered necessary after the ceremony to these members of the greek christian church it had been handed down from father to son that washing in jordan once during life was efficacious towards salvation and therefore the journey had been made at terrible cost and terrible risk for these people had come from afar and were from their habits but little capable of long journeys many die under the toil but this matters not if they do not die before they have reached jordan some few there are undoubtedly more ecstatic in this great deed of their religion one man i especially noticed on this day he had bound himself to make the pilgrimage from jerusalem to the river with one foot bare he was of a better class and was even nobly dressed as though it were a part of his vow to show to all men that he did this deed wealthy and great though he was he was a fine man perhaps thirty years of age with a wellgrown beard descending on his breast and at his girdle he carried a brace of pistols but never in my life had i seen bodily pain so plainly written in a mans face the sweat was falling from his brow and his eyes were strained and bloodshot with agony he had no stick his vow i presume debarring him from such assistance and he limped along putting to the ground the heel of the unprotected foot i could see it and it was a mass of blood and sores and broken skin an irish girl would walk from jerusalem to jericho without shoes and be not a penny the worse for it this poor fellow clearly suffered so much that i was almost inclined to think that in the performance of his penance he had done something to aggravate his pain those around him paid no attention to him and the dragoman seemed to think nothing of the affair whatever those fools of greeks do not understand the christian religion he said being himself a latin or roman catholic at the tail of the line we encountered two bedouins who were in charge of the caravan and joseph at once addressed them the men were mounted one on a very sorrylooking jade but the other on a good stout arab barb they had guns slung behind their backs coloured handkerchiefs on their heads and they wore the striped bernouse the parley went on for about ten minutes during which the procession of pilgrims wound out of sight and it ended in our being accompanied by the two arabs who thus left their greater charge to take care of itself back to the city i understood afterwards that they had endeavoured to persuade joseph that we might just as well go on alone merely satisfying the demand of the tariff but he had pointed out that i was a particular man and that under such circumstances the final settlement might be doubtful so they turned and accompanied us but as a matter of fact we should have been as well without them the sun was beginning to fall in the heavens when we reached the actual margin of the dead sea we had seen the glitter of its still waters for a long time previously shining under the sun as though it were not real we have often heard and some of us have seen how effects of light and shade together will produce so vivid an appearance of water where there is no water as to deceive the most experienced but the reverse was the case here there was the lake and there it had been before our eyes for the last two hours and yet it looked then and now as though it were an image of a lake and not real water i had long since made up my mind to bathe in it feeling well convinced that i could do so without harm to myself and i had been endeavouring to persuade smith to accompany me but he positively refused he would bathe he said neither in the dead sea nor in the river jordan he did not like bathing and preferred to do his washing in his own room of course i had nothing further to say and begged that under these circumstances he would take charge of my purse and pistols while i was in the water this he agreed to do but even in this he was strange and almost uncivil i was to bathe from the farthest point of a little island into which there was a rough causeway from the land made of stones and broken pieces of wood and i exhorted him to go with me thither but he insisted on remaining with his horse on the mainland at some little distance from the island he did not feel inclined to go down to the waters edge he said i confess that at this moment i almost suspected that he was going to play me foul and i hesitated he saw in an instant what was passing through my mind you had better take your pistol and money with you they will be quite safe on your clothes but to have kept the things now would have shown suspicion too plainly and as i could not bring myself to do that i gave them up i have sometimes thought that i was a fool to do so i went away by myself to the end of the island and then i did bathe it is impossible to conceive anything more desolate than the appearance of the place the land shelves very gradually away to the water and the whole margin to the breadth of some twenty or thirty feet is strewn with the dbris of rushes bits of timber and old white withered reeds whence these bits of timber have come it seems difficult to say the appearance is as though the water had receded and left them there i have heard it said that there is no vegetation near the dead sea but such is not the case for these rushes do grow on the bank i found it difficult enough to get into the water for the ground shelves down very slowly and is rough with stones and large pieces of halfrotten wood moreover when i was in nearly up to my hips the water knocked me down indeed it did so when i had gone as far as my knees but i recovered myself and by perseverance did proceed somewhat farther it must not be imagined that this knocking down was effected by the movement of the water there is no such movement everything is perfectly still and the fluid seems hardly to be displaced by the entrance of the body but the effect is that ones feet are tripped up and that one falls prostrate on to the surface the water is so strong and buoyant that when above a few feet in depth has to be encountered the strength and weight of the bather are not sufficient to keep down his feet and legs i then essayed to swim but i could not do this in the ordinary way as i was unable to keep enough of my body below the surface so that my head and face seemed to be propelled down upon it i turned round and floated but the glare of the sun was so powerful that i could not remain long in that position however i had bathed in the dead sea and was so far satisfied anything more abominable to the palate than this water if it be water i never had inside my mouth i expected it to be extremely salt and no doubt if it were analysed such would be the result but there is a flavour in it which kills the salt no attempt can be made at describing this taste it may be imagined that i did not drink heartily merely taking up a drop or two with my tongue from the palm of my hand but it seemed to me as though i had been drenched with it even brandy would not relieve me from it and then my whole body was in a mess and i felt as though i had been rubbed with pitch looking at my limbs i saw no sign on them of the fluid they seemed to dry from this as they usually do from any other water but still the feeling remained however i was to ride from hence to a spot on the banks of jordan which i should reach in an hour and at which i would wash so i clothed myself and prepared for my departure seated in my position in the island i was unable to see what was going on among the remainder of the party and therefore could not tell whether my pistols and money was safe i dressed therefore rather hurriedly and on getting again to the shore found that mr john smith had not levanted he was seated on his horse at some distance from joseph and the arabs and had no appearance of being in league with those no doubt worthy guides i certainly had suspected a ruse and now was angry with myself that i had done so and yet in london one would not trust ones money to a stranger whom one had met twentyfour hours since in a coffeeroom why then do it with a stranger whom one chanced to meet in a desert thanks i said as he handed me my belongings i wish i could have induced you to come in also the dead sea is now at your elbow and therefore you think nothing of it but in ten or fifteen years time you would be glad to be able to tell your children that you had bathed in it i shall never have any children to care for such tidings he replied the river jordan for some miles above the point at which it joins the dead sea runs through very steep banksbanks which are almost precipitousand is as it were guarded by the thick trees and bushes which grow upon its sides this is so much the case that one may ride as we did for a considerable distance along the margin and not be able even to approach the water i had a fancy for bathing in some spot of my own selection instead of going to the open shore frequented by all the pilgrims but i was baffled in this when i did force my way down to the river side i found that the water ran so rapidly and that the bushes and boughs of trees grew so far over and into the stream as to make it impossible for me to bathe i could not have got in without my clothes and having got in i could not have got out again i was therefore obliged to put up with the open muddy shore to which the bathers descend and at which we may presume that joshua passed when he came over as one of the twelve spies to spy out the land and even here i could not go full into the stream as i would fain have done lest i should be carried down and so have assisted to whiten the shores of the dead sea with my bones as to getting over to the moabitish side of the river that was plainly impossible and indeed it seemed to be the prevailing opinion that the passage of the river was not practicable without going up as far as samaria and yet we know that there or thereabouts the israelites did cross it i jumped from my horse the moment i got to the place and once more gave my purse and pistols to my friend you are going to bathe again he said certainly said i you dont suppose that i would come to jordan and not wash there even if i were not foul with the foulness of the dead sea youll kill yourself in your present state of heat he said remonstrating just as ones mother or wife might do but even had it been my mother or wife i could not have attended to such remonstrance then and before he had done looking at me with those big eyes of his my coat and waistcoat and cravat were on the ground and i was at work at my braces whereupon he turned from me slowly and strolled away into the wood on this occasion i had no base fears about my money and then i did bathevery uncomfortably the shore was muddy with the feet of the pilgrims and the river so rapid that i hardly dared to get beyond the mud i did manage to take a plunge in headforemost but i was forced to wade out through the dirt and slush so that i found it difficult to make my feet and legs clean enough for my shoes and stockings and then moreover the flies plagued me most unmercifully i should have thought that the filthy flavour from the dead sea would have saved me from that nuisance but the mosquitoes thereabouts are probably used to it finding this process of bathing to be so difficult i inquired as to the practice of the pilgrims i found that with them bathing in jordan has come to be much the same as baptism has with us it does not mean immersion no doubt they do take off their shoes and stockings but they do not strip and go bodily into the water as soon as i was dressed i found that smith was again at my side with purse and pistols we then went up a little above the wood and sat down together on the long sandy grass it was now quite evening so that the short syrian twilight had commenced and the sun was no longer hot in the heavens it would be night as we rode on to the tents at jericho but there was no difficulty as to the way and therefore we did not hurry the horses who were feeding on the grass we sat down together on a spot from which we could see the streamclose together so that when i stretched myself out in my weariness as i did before we started my head rested on his legs ah me one does not take such liberties with new friends in england it was a place which led one on to some special thoughts the mountains of moab were before us very plain in their outline moab is my washpot and over edom will i cast out my shoe there they were before us very visible to the eye and we began naturally to ask questions of each other why was moab the washpot and edom thus cursed with indignity why had the right bank of the river been selected for such great purposes whereas the left was thus condemned was there at that time any special fertility in this land of promise which has since departed from it we are told of a bunch of grapes which took two men to carry it but now there is not a vine in the whole country side nowadays the sandy plain round jericho is as dry and arid as are any of the valleys of moab the jordan was running beneath our feetthe jordan in which the leprous king had washed though the bright rivers of his own damascus were so much nearer to his hand it was but a humble stream to which he was sent but the spot probably was higher up above the sea of galilee where the river is narrow but another also had come down to this river perhaps to this very spot on its shores and submitted himself to its watersas to whom perhaps it will be better that i should not speak much in this light story the dead sea was on our right still glittering in the distance and behind us lay the plains of jericho and the wretched collection of huts which still bears the name of the ancient city beyond that but still seemingly within easy distance of us were the mountains of the wilderness the wilderness in truth the spot was one which did lead to many thoughts we talked of these things as to many of which i found that my friend was much more free in his doubts and questionings than myself and then our words came back to ourselves the natural centre of all mens thoughts and words from what you say i said i gather that you have had enough of this land quite enough he said why seek such spots as these if they only dispel the associations and veneration of ones childhood but with me such associations and veneration are riveted the stronger by seeing the places and putting my hand upon the spots i do not speak of that fictitious marble slab up there but here among the sandhills by this river and at the mount of olives over which we passed i do believe he paused a moment and then replied to me it is all nothingabsolutely nothing but then do we not know that our thoughts are formed and our beliefs modelled not on the outward signs or intrinsic evidences of thingsas would be the case were we always rationalbut by the inner workings of the mind itself at the present turn of my life i can believe in nothing that is gracious ah you mean that you are unhappy you have come to grief in some of your doings or belongings and therefore find that all things are bitter to the taste i have had my palate out of order too but the proper appreciation of flavours has come back to me bahhow noisome was that dead sea water the dead sea waters are noisome he said and i have been drinking of them by long draughts long draughts i answered thinking to console him draughts have not been long which can have been swallowed in your years your disease may be acute but it cannot yet have become chronic a man always thinks at the moment of each misfortune that that special misery will last his lifetime but god is too good for that i do not know what ails you but this day twelvemonth will see you again as sound as a roach we then sat silent for a while during which i was puffing at a cigar smith among his accomplishments did not reckon that of smokingwhich was a grief to me for a man enjoys the tobacco doubly when another is enjoying it with him no you do not know what ails me he said at last and therefore cannot judge perhaps not my dear fellow but my experience tells me that early wounds are generally capable of cure and therefore i surmise that yours may be so the heart at your time of life is not worn out and has strength and soundness left wherewith to throw off its maladies i hope it may be so with you god knows i do not mean to say that there are none more to be pitied than i am but at the present moment i am notnot lighthearted i wish i could ease your burden my dear fellow it is most preposterous in me thus to force myself upon you and then trouble you with my cares but i had been alone so long and i was so weary of it by jove and so had i make no apology and let me tell you thisthough perhaps you will not credit methat i would sooner laugh with a comrade than cry with him is true enough but if occasion demands i can do the latter also he then put out his hand to me and i pressed it in token of my friendship my own hand was hot and rough with the heat and sand but his was soft and cool almost as a womans i thoroughly hate an effeminate man but in spite of a certain womanly softness about this fellow i could not hate him yes i continued though somewhat unused to the melting mood i also sometimes give forth my medicinal gums i dont want to ask you any questions and as a rule i hate to be told secrets but if i can be of any service to you in any matter i will do my best i dont say this with reference to the present moment but think of it before we part i looked round at him and saw that he was in tears i know that you will think that i am a weak fool he said pressing his handkerchief to his eyes by no means there are moments in a mans life when it becomes him to weep like a woman but the older he grows the more seldom those moments come to him as far as i can see of men they never cry at that which disgraces them it is left for women to do that he answered oh women a woman cries for everything and for nothing it is the sharpest arrow she has in her quiverthe best card in her hand when a woman cries what can you do but give her all she asks for do youdislike women no by jove i am never really happy unless one is near me or more than one a man as a rule has an amount of energy within him which he cannot turn to profit on himself alone it is good for him to have a woman by him that he may work for her and thus have exercise for his limbs and faculties i am very fond of women but i always like those best who are most helpless we were silent again for a while and it was during this time that i found myself lying with my head in his lap i had slept but it could have been but for a few minutes and when i woke i found his hand upon my brow as i started up he said that the flies had been annoying me and that he had not chosen to waken me as i seemed weary it has been that double bathing i said apologetically for i always feel ashamed when i am detected sleeping in the day in hot weather the water does make one drowsy by jove its getting dark we had better have the horses stay half a moment he said speaking very softly and laying his hand upon my arm i will not detain you a minute there is no hurry in life i said you promised me just now you would assist me if it be in my power i will before we part at alexandria i will endeavour to tell you you the story of my troubles and then if you can aid me it struck me as he paused that i had made a rash promise but nevertheless i must stand by it nowwith one or two provisoes the chances were that the young man was short of money or else that he had got into a scrape about a girl in either case i might give him some slight assistance but then it behoved me to make him understand that i would not consent to become a participator in mischief i was too old to get my head willingly into a scrape and this i must endeavour to make him understand i will if it be in my power i said i will ask no questions now but if your trouble be about some lady it is not said he well so be it of all troubles those are the most troublesome if you are short of cash no i am not short of cash you are not thats well too for want of money is a sore trouble also and then i paused before i came to the point i do not suspect anything bad of you smith had i done so i should not have spoken as i have done and if there be nothing bad there is nothing disgraceful he said that is just what i mean and in that case i will do anything for you that may be within my power now let us look for joseph and the mucherryboy for it is time that we were at jericho i cannot describe at length the whole of our journey from thence to our tents at jericho nor back to jerusalem nor even from jerusalem to jaffa at jericho we did sleep in tents paying so much per night according to the tariff we wandered out at night and drank coffee with a family of arabs in the desert sitting in a ring round their coffeekettle and we saw a turkish soldier punished with the bastinadoa sight which did not do me any good and which made smith very sick indeed after the first blow he walked away jericho is a remarkable spot in that pilgrim week and i wish i had space to describe it but i have not for i must hurry on back to jerusalem and thence to jaffa i had much to tell also of those bedouins how they were essentially true to us but teased us almost to frenzy by their continual begging they begged for our food and our drink for our cigars and our gunpowder for the clothes off our backs and the handkerchiefs out of our pockets as to gunpowder i had none to give them for my charges were all made up in cartridges and i learned that the guns behind their backs were a mere pretence for they had not a grain of powder among them we slept one night in jerusalem and started early on the following morning smith came to my hotel so that we might be ready together for the move we still carried with us joseph and the mucherryboy but for our bedouins who had duly received their forty shillings a piece we had no further use on our road down to jerusalem we had much chat together but only one adventure those pilgrims of whom i have spoken journey to jerusalem in the greatest number by the route which we were now taking from it and they come in long droves reaching jaffa in crowds by the french and austrian steamers from smyrna damascus and constantinople as their number confers security in that somewhat insecure country many travellers from the west of europe make arrangements to travel with them on our way down we met the last of these caravans for the year and we were passing it for more than two hours on this occasion i rode first and smith was immediately behind me but of a sudden i observed him to wheel his horse round and to clamber downwards among bushes and stones towards a river that ran below us hallo smith i cried you will destroy your horse and yourself too but he would not answer me and all i could do was to draw up in the path and wait my confusion was made the worse as at that moment a long string of pilgrims was passing by good morning sir said an old man to me in good english i looked up as i answered him and saw a greyhaired gentleman of very solemn and sad aspect he might be seventy years of age and i could see that he was attended by three or four servants i shall never forget the severe and sorrowful expression of his eyes over which his heavy eyebrows hung low are there many english in jerusalem he asked a good many i replied there always are at easter can you tell me anything of any of them he asked not a word said i for i knew no one but our consul can and then we bowed to each other and he passed on i got off my horse and scrambled down on foot after smith i found him gathering berries and bushes as though his very soul were mad with botany but as i had seen nothing of this in him before i asked what strange freak had taken him you were talking to that old man he said well yes i was that is the relation of whom i have spoken to you the d he is and i would avoid him if it be possible i then learned that the old gentleman was his uncle he had no living father or mother and he now supposed that his relative was going to jerusalem in quest of him if so said i you will undoubtedly give him leg bail unless the austrian boat is more than ordinarily late it is as much as we shall do to catch it and you may be half over africa or far gone on your way to india before he can be on your track again i will tell you all about it at alexandria he replied and then he scrambled up again with his horse and we went on that night we slept at the armenian convent at ramlath or ramath this place is supposed to stand on the site of arimathea and is marked as such in many of the maps the monks at this time of the year are very busy as the pilgrims all stay here for one night on their routes backwards and forwards and the place on such occasions is terribly crowded on the night of our visit it was nearly empty as a caravan had left it that morning and thus we were indulged with separate cells a point on which my companion seemed to lay considerable stress on the following day at about noon we entered jaffa and put up at an inn there which is kept by a pole the boat from beyrout which touches at jaffa on its way to alexandria was not yet in nor even sighted we were therefore amply in time shall we sail tonight i asked of the agent yes in all probability he replied if the signal be seen before three we shall do so if not then not and so i returned to the hotel smith had involuntarily shown signs of fatigue during the journey but yet he had borne up well against it i had never felt called on to grant any extra indulgence as to time because the work was too much for him but now he was a good deal knocked up and i was a little frightened fearing that i had overdriven him under the heat of the sun i was alarmed lest he should have fever and proposed to send for the jaffa doctor but this he utterly refused he would shut himself for an hour or two in his room he said and by that time he trusted the boat would be in sight it was clear to me that he was very anxious on the subject fearing that his uncle would be back upon his heels before he had started i ordered a serious breakfast for myself for with me on such occasions my appetite demands more immediate attention than my limbs i also acknowledge that i become fatigued and can lay myself at length during such idle days and sleep from hour to hour but the desire to do so never comes till i have well eaten and drunken a bottle of french wine three or four cutlets of goats flesh an omelet made out of the freshest eggs and an enormous dish of oranges was the banquet set before me and though i might have found fault with it in paris or london i thought that it did well enough in jaffa my poor friend could not join me but had a cup of coffee in his room at any rate take a little brandy in it i said to him as i stood over his bed i could not swallow it said he looking at me with almost beseeching eyes beshrew the fellow i said to myself as i left him carefully closing the door so that the sound should not shake him he is little better than a woman and yet i have become as fond of him as though he were my brother i went out at three but up to that time the boat had not been signalled and we shall not get out tonight no not tonight said the agent and what time tomorrow if she comes in this evening you will start by daylight but they so manage her departure from beyrout that she seldom is here in the evening it will be noon tomorrow then yes the man said noon tomorrow i calculated however that the old gentleman could not possibly be on our track by that time he would not have reached jerusalem till late in the day on which we saw him and it would take him some time to obtain tidings of his nephew but it might be possible that messengers sent by him should reach jaffa by four or five on the day after his arrival that would be this very day which we were now wasting at jaffa having thus made my calculations i returned to smith to give him such consolation as it might be in my power to afford he seemed to be dreadfully afflicted by all this he will have traced me to jerusalem and then again away and will follow me immediately that is all very well i said but let even a young man do the best he can and he will not get from jerusalem to jaffa in less than twelve hours your uncle is not a young man and could not possibly do the journey under two days but he will send he will not mind what money he spends and if he does send take off your hat to his messengers and bid them carry your complaints back you are not a felon whom he can arrest no he cannot arrest me but ah you do not understand and then he sat up on the bed and seemed as though he were going to wring his hands in despair i waited for some half hour in his room thinking that he would tell me this story of his if he required that i should give him my aid in the presence either of his uncle or of his uncles myrmidons i must at any rate know what was likely to be the dispute between them but as he said nothing i suggested that he should stroll out with me among the orangegroves by which the town is surrounded in answer to this he looked up piteously into my face as though begging me to be merciful to him you are strong said he and cannot understand what it is to feel fatigue as i do and yet he had declared on commencing his journey that he would not be found to complain nor had he complained by a single word till after that encounter with his uncle nay he had borne up well till this news had reached us of the boat being late i felt convinced that if the boat were at this moment lying in the harbour all that appearance of excessive weakness would soon vanish what it was that he feared i could not guess but it was manifest to me that some great terror almost overwhelmed him my idea is said iand i suppose that i spoke with something less of goodnature in my tone than i had assumed for the last day or two that no man should under any circumstances be so afraid of another man as to tremble at his presenceeither at his presence or his expected presence ah now you are angry with me now you despise me neither the one nor the other but if i may take the liberty of a friend with you i should advise you to combat this feeling of horror if you do not it will unman you after all what can your uncle do to you he cannot rob you of your heart and soul he cannot touch your inner self you do not know he said ah but smith i do know that whatever may be this quarrel between you and him you should not tremble at the thought of him unless indeed unless what unless you had done aught that should make you tremble before every honest man i own i had begun to have my doubts of him and to fear that he had absolutely disgraced himself even in such case ii individuallydid not wish to be severe on him but i should be annoyed to find that i had opened my heart to a swindler or a practised knave i will tell you all tomorrow said he but i have been guilty of nothing of that sort in the evening he did come out and sat with me as i smoked my cigar the boat he was told would almost undoubtedly come in by daybreak on the following morning and be off at nine whereas it was very improbable that any arrival from jerusalem would be so early as that beside i reminded him your uncle will hardly hurry down to jaffa because he will have no reason to think but what you have already started there are no telegraphs here you know in the evening he was still very sad though the paroxysm of his terror seemed to have passed away i would not bother him as he had himself chosen the following morning for the telling of his story so i sat and smoked and talked to him about our past journey and by degrees the power of speech came back to him and i again felt that i loved him yes loved him i have not taken many such fancies into my head at so short a notice but i did love him as though he were a younger brother i felt a delight in serving him and though i was almost old enough to be his father i ministered to him as though he had been an old man or a woman on the following morning we were stirring at daybreak and found that the vessel was in sight she would be in the roads off the town in two hours time they said and would start at eleven or twelve and then we walked round by the gate of the town and sauntered a quarter of a mile or so along the way that leads towards jerusalem i could see that his eye was anxiously turned down the road but he said nothing we saw no cloud of dust and then we returned to breakfast the steamer has come to anchor said our dirty polish host to us in execrable english and we may be off on board said smith not yet he said they must put their cargo out first i saw however that smith was uneasy and i made up my mind to go off to the vessel at once when they should see an english portmanteau making an offer to come up the gangway the austrian sailors would not stop it so i called for the bill and ordered that the things should be taken down to the wretched broken heap of rotten timber which they called a quay smith had not told me his story but no doubt he would as soon as he was on board i was in the act of squabbling with the pole over the last demand for piastres when we heard a noise in the gateway of the inn and i saw smiths countenance become pale it was an englishmans voice asking if there were any strangers there so i went into the courtyard closing the door behind me and turning the key upon the landlord and smith smith said i to myself will keep the pole quiet if he have any wit left the man who had asked the question had the air of an upper english servant and i thought that i recognised one of those whom i had seen with the old gentleman on the road but the matter was soon put at rest by the appearance of that gentleman himself he walked up into the courtyard looked hard at me from under those bushy eyebrows just raised his hat and then said i believe i am speaking to mr jones yes said i i am mr jones can i have the honour of serving you there was something peculiarly unpleasant about this mans face at the present moment i examined it closely and could understand the great aversion which his nephew felt towards him he looked like a gentleman and like a man of talent nor was there anything of meanness in his face neither was he illlooking in the usual acceptation of the word but one could see that he was solemn austere and overbearing that he would be incapable of any light enjoyment and unforgiving towards all offences i took him to be a man who being old himself could never remember that he had been young and who therefore hated the levities of youth to me such a character is specially odious for i would fain if it be possible be young even to my grave smith if he were clever might escape from the window of the room which opened out upon a terrace and still get down to the steamer i would keep the old man in play for some time and even though i lost my passage would be true to my friend there lay our joint luggage at my feet in the yard if smith would venture away without his portion of it all might yet be right my name sir is sir william weston he began i had heard of the name before and knew him to be a man of wealth and family and note i took off my hat and said that i had much honour in meeting sir william weston and i presume you know the object with which i am now here he continued not exactly said i nor do i understand how i possibly should know it seeing that up to this moment i did not even know your name and have heard nothing concerning either your movements or your affairs sir said he i have hitherto believed that i might at any rate expect from you the truth sir said i i am bold to think that you will not dare to tell me either now or at any other time that you have received or expect to receive from me anything that is not true he then stood still looking at me for a moment or two and i beg to assert that i looked as fully at him there was at any rate no cause why i should tremble before him i was not his nephew nor was i responsible for his nephews doings towards him two of his servants were behind him and on my side there stood a boy and girl belonging to the inn they however could not understand a word of english i saw that he was hesitating but at last he spoke out i confess now that his words when they were spoken did at the first moment make me tremble i have to charge you said he with eloping with my niece and i demand of you to inform me where she is you are perfectly aware that i am her guardian by law i did tremblenot that i cared much for sir williams guardianship but i saw before me so terrible an embarrassment and then i felt so thoroughly abashed in that i had allowed myself to be so deceived it all came back upon me in a moment and covered me with a shame that even made me blush i had travelled through the desert with a woman for days and had not discovered her though she had given me a thousand signs all those signs i remembered now and i blushed painfully when her hand was on my forehead i still thought that she was a man i declare that at this moment i felt a stronger disinclination to face my late companion than i did to encounter her angry uncle your niece i said speaking with a sheepish bewilderment which should have convinced him at once of my innocence she had asked me too whether i was a married man and i had denied it how was i to escape from such a mess of misfortunes i declare that i began to forget her troubles in my own yes my niecemiss julia weston the disgrace which you have brought upon me must be wiped out but my first duty is to save that unfortunate young woman from further misery if it be as you say i exclaimed by the honour of a gentleman i care nothing for the honour of a gentleman till i see it proved be good enough to inform me sir whether miss weston is in this house for a moment i hesitated but i saw at once that i should make myself responsible for certain mischief of which i was at any rate hitherto in truth innocent if i allowed myself to become a party to concealing a young lady up to this period i could at any rate defend myself whether my defence were believed or not believed i still had a hope that the charming julia might have escaped through the window and a feeling that if she had done so i was not responsible when i turned the lock i turned it on smith for a moment i hesitated and then walked slowly across the yard and opened the door sir william i said as i did so i travelled here with a companion dressed as a man and i believed him to be what he seemed till this minute sir said sir william with a look of scorn in his face which gave me the lie in my teeth as plainly as any words could do and then he entered the room the pole was standing in one corner apparently amazed at what was going on and smithi may as well call her miss weston at once for the baronets statement was truewas sitting on a sort of divan in the corner of the chamber hiding her face in her hands she had made no attempt at an escape and a full explanation was therefore indispensable for myself i own that i felt ashamed of my part in the playashamed even of my own innocency had i been less innocent i should certainly have contrived to appear much less guilty had it occurred to me on the banks of the jordan that smith was a lady i should not have travelled with her in her gentlemans habiliments from jerusalem to jaffa had she consented to remain under my protection she must have done so without a masquerade the uncle stood still and looked at his niece he probably understood how thoroughly stern and disagreeable was his own face and considered that he could punish the crime of his relative in no severer way than by looking at her in this i think he was right but at last there was a necessity for speaking unfortunate young woman he said and then paused we had better get rid of the landlord i said before we come to any explanation and i motioned to the man to leave the room this he did very unwillingly but at last he was gone i fear that it is needless to care on her account who may hear the story of her shame said sir william i looked at miss weston but she still sat hiding her face however if she did not defend herself it was necessary that i should defend both her and me i do not know how far i may be at liberty to speak with reference to the private matters of yourself or of youryour niece sir william weston i would not willingly interfere sir said he your interference has already taken place will you have the goodness to explain to me what are your intentions with regard to that lady my intentions heaven help me my intentions of course were to leave her in her uncles hands indeed i could hardly be said to have formed any intention since i had learned that i had been honoured by a ladys presence at this moment i deeply regretted that i had thoughtlessly stated to her that i was an unmarried man in doing so i had had no object but at that time smith had been quite a stranger to me and i had not thought it necessary to declare my own private concerns since that i had talked so little of myself that the fact of my family at home had not been mentioned will you have the goodness to explain what are your intentions with regard to that lady said the baronet oh uncle william exclaimed miss weston now at length raising her head from her hands hold your peace madam said he when called upon to speak you will find your words with difficulty enough sir i am waiting for an answer from you but uncle he is nothing to methe gentleman is nothing to me by the heavens above us he shall be something or i will know the reason why what he has gone off with you he has travelled through the country with you hiding you from your only natural friend he has been your companion for weeks six days sir said i sir said the baronet again giving me the lie and now he continued addressing his niece you tell me that he is nothing to you he shall give me his promise that he will make you his wife at the consulate at alexandria or i will destroy him i know who he is if you know who i am said i you must know but he would not listen to me and as for you madam unless he makes me that promise and then he paused in his threat and turning round looked me in the face i saw that she also was looking at me though not openly as he did and some flattering devil that was at work round my heart would have persuaded that she also would have heard a certain answer given without dismaywould even have received comfort in her agony from such an answer but the reader knows how completely that answer was out of my power i have not the slightest ground for supposing said i that the lady would accede to such an arrangementif it were possible my acquaintance with her has been altogether confined to to tell the truth i have not been in miss westons confidence and have only taken her for that which she has seemed to be sir said the baronet again looking at me as though he would wither me on the spot for my falsehood it is true said julia getting up from her seat and appealing with clasped hands to her uncleas true as heaven madam said he do you both take me for a fool that you should take me for one said i would be very natural the facts are as we state to you miss westonas i now learn that she isdid me the honour of calling at my hotel having heard and then it seemed to me as though i were attempting to screen myself by telling the story against her so i was again silent never in my life had i been in a position of such extraordinary difficulty the duty which i owed to julia as a woman and to sir william as a guardian and to myself as the father of a family all clashed with each other i was anxious to be generous honest and prudent but it was impossible so i made up my mind to say nothing further mr jones said the baronet i have explained to you the only arrangement which under the present circumstances i can permit to pass without open exposure and condign punishment that you are a gentleman by birth education and position i am awarewhereupon i raised my hat and then he continued that lady has three hundred a year of her own and attractions personal and mental which are worth ten times the money said i and i bowed to my fair friend who looked at me the while with sad beseeching eyes i confess that the mistress of my bosom had she known my thoughts at that one moment might have had cause for anger very well continued he then the proposal which i name cannot i imagine but be satisfactory if you will make to her and to me the only amends which it is in your power as a gentleman to afford i will forgive all tell me that you will make her your wife on your arrival in egypt i would have given anything not to have looked at miss weston at this moment but i could not help it i did turn my face half round to her before i answered and then felt that i had been cruel in doing so sir william said i i have at home already a wife and family of my own it is not true said he retreating a step and staring at me with amazement there is something sir i replied in the unprecedented circumstances of this meeting and in your position with regard to that lady which joined to your advanced age will enable me to regard that useless insult as unspoken i am a married man there is the signature of my wifes last letter and i handed him one which i had received as i was leaving jerusalem but the coarse violent contradiction which sir william had given me was nothing compared with the reproach conveyed in miss westons countenance she looked at me as though all her anger were now turned against me and yet methought there was more of sorrow than of resentment in her countenance but what cause was there for either why should i be reproached even by her look she did not remember at the moment that when i answered her chance question as to my domestic affairs i had answered it as to a man who was a stranger to me and not as to a beautiful woman with whom i was about to pass certain days in close and intimate society to her at the moment it seemed as though i had cruelly deceived her in truth the one person really deceived had been myself and here i must explain on behalf of the lady that when she first joined me she had no other view than that of seeing the banks of the jordan in that guise which she had chosen to assume in order to escape from the solemnity and austerity of a disagreeable relative she had been very foolish and that was all i take it that she had first left her uncle at constantinople but on this point i never got certain information afterwards while we were travelling together the idea had come upon her that she might go on as far as alexandria with me and then i know nothing further of the ladys intentions but i am certain that her wishes were good and pure her uncle had been intolerable to her and she had fled from him such had been her offence and no more then sir said the baronet giving me back my letter you must be a doubledyed villain and you sir said i but here julia weston interrupted me uncle you altogether wrong this gentleman she said he has been kind to me beyond my power of words to express but till told by you he knew nothing of my secret nor would he have known it she added looking down upon the ground as to that latter assertion i was at liberty to believe as much as i pleased the pole now came to the door informing us that any who wished to start by the packet must go on board and therefore as the unreasonable old gentleman perceived it was necessary that we should all make our arrangements i cannot say that they were such as enable me to look back on them with satisfaction he did seem now at last to believe that i had been an unconscious agent in his nieces stratagem but he hardly on that account became civil to me it was absolutely necessary he said that he and that unfortunate young woman as he would call her should depart at onceby this ship now going to this proposition of course i made no opposition and you mr jones he continued will at once perceive that you as a gentleman should allow us to proceed on our journey without the honour of your company this was very dreadful but what could i say or indeed what could i do my most earnest desire in the matter was to save miss weston from annoyance and under existing circumstances my presence on board could not but be a burden to her and then if i wentif i did go in opposition to the wishes of the baronet could i trust my own prudence it was better for all parties that i should remain sir william said i after a minutes consideration if you will apologise to me for the gross insults you have offered me it shall be as you say mr jones said sir william i do apologise for the words which i used to you while i was labouring under a very natural misconception of the circumstances i do not know that i was much the better for the apology but at the moment i regarded it sufficient their things were then hurried down to the strand and i accompanied them to the ruined quay i took off my hat to sir william as he was first let down into the boat he descended first so that he might receive his niecefor all jaffa now knew that it was a ladyand then i gave her my hand for the last time god bless you miss weston i said pressing it closely god bless you mr jones she replied and from that day to this i have neither spoken to her nor seen her i waited a fortnight at jaffa for the french boat eating cutlets of goats flesh and wandering among the orange groves i certainly look back on that fortnight as the most miserable period of my life i had been deceived and had failed to discover the deceit even though the deceiver had perhaps wished that i should do so for that blindness i have never forgiven myself the house of heine brothers in munich the house of heine brothers in munich was of good repute at the time of which i am about to tella time not long ago and is so still i trust it was of good repute in its own way seeing that no man doubted the word or solvency of heine brothers but they did not possess as bankers what would in england be considered a large or profitable business the operations of english bankers are bewildering in their magnitude legions of clerks are employed the senior bookkeepers though only salaried servants are themselves great men while the real partners are inscrutable mysterious opulent beyond measure and altogether unknown to their customers take any firm at randombrown jones and cox let us saythe probability is that jones has been dead these fifty years that brown is a cabinet minister and that cox is master of a pack of hounds in leicestershire but it was by no means so with the house of heine brothers of munich there they were the two elderly men daily to be seen at their dingy office in the schrannen platz and if any business was to be transacted requiring the interchange of more than a word or two it was the younger brother with whom the customer was as a matter of course brought into contact there were three clerks in the establishment an old man namely who sat with the elder brother and had no personal dealings with the public a young englishman of whom we shall anon hear more and a boy who ran messages put the wood on to the stoves and swept out the bank truly the house of heine brothers was of no great importance but nevertheless it was of good repute the office i have said was in the schrannen platz or old marketplace munich as every one knows is chiefly to be noted as a new townso new that many of the streets and most of the palaces look as though they had been sent home last night from the builders and had only just been taken out of their bandboxes it is angular methodical unfinished and palatial but there is an old town and though the old town be not of surpassing interest it is as dingy crooked intricate and dark as other old towns in germany here in the old marketplace up one long broad staircase were situated the two rooms in which was held the bank of heine brothers of the elder member of the firm we shall have something to say before this story be completed he was an old bachelor and was possessed of a bachelors dwelling somewhere out in the suburbs of the city the junior brother was a married man with a wife some twenty years younger than himself with two daughters the elder of whom was now oneandtwenty and one son his name was ernest heine whereas the senior brother was known as uncle hatto ernest heine and his wife inhabited a portion of one of those new palatial residences at the further end of the ludwigs strasse but not because they thus lived must it be considered that they were palatial people by no means let it be so thought as such an idea would altogether militate against whatever truth of character painting there may be in this tale they were not palatial people but the very reverse living in homely guise pursuing homely duties and satisfied with homely pleasures up two pairs of stairs however in that street of palaces they lived having there a commodious suite of large rooms furnished after the manner of the germans somewhat gaudily as regarded their best salon and with somewhat meagre comfort as regarded their other rooms but whether in respect of that which was meagre or whether in respect of that which was gaudy they were as well off as their neighbours and this as i take it is the point of excellence which is desirable ernest heine was at this time over sixty his wife was past forty and his eldest daughter as i have said was twentyone years of age his second child also a girl was six years younger and their third child a boy had not been born till another similar interval had elapsed he was named hatto after his uncle and the two girls had been christened isa and agnes such in number and mode of life was the family of the heines we english folk are apt to imagine that we are nearer akin to germans than to our other continental neighbours this may be so in blood but nevertheless the difference in manners is so striking that it could hardly be enhanced an englishman moving himself off to a city in the middle of central america will find the customs to which he must adapt himself less strange to him there than he would in many a german town but in no degree of life is the difference more remarkable than among unmarried but marriageable young women it is not my purpose at the present moment to attribute a superiority in this matter to either nationality each has its own charm its own excellence its own heavengiven grace whereby men are led up to purer thoughts and sweet desires and each may possibly have its own defect i will not here describe the excellence or defect of either but will if it be in my power say a word as to this difference the german girl of oneandtwentyour isas ageis more sedate more womanly more meditative than her english sister the worlds work is more in her thoughts and the worlds amusements less so she probably knows less of those things which women learn than the english girl but that which she does know is nearer to her hand for use she is not so much accustomed to society but nevertheless she is more mistress of her own manner she is not taught to think so much of those things which flurry and disturb the mind and therefore she is seldom flurried and disturbed to both of them lovethe idea of lovemust be the thought of all the most absorbing for is it not fated for them that the joys and sorrows of their future life must depend upon it but the idea of the german girl is the more realistic and the less romantic poetry and fiction she may have read though of the latter sparingly but they will not have imbued her with that hope for some transcendental paradise of affection which so often fills and exalts the hearts of our daughters here at home she is moderate in her aspirations requiring less excitement than an english girl and never forgetting the solid necessities of lifeas they are so often forgotten here in england in associating with young men an english girl will always remember that in each one she so meets she may find an admirer whom she may possibly love or an admirer whom she may probably be called on to repel she is ever conscious of the fact of this position and a romance is thus engendered which if it may at times be dangerous is at any rate always charming but the german girl in her simplicity has no such consciousness as you and i my reader might probably become dear friends were we to meet and know each other so may the german girl learn to love the fairhaired youth with whom chance has for a time associated her but to her mind there occurs no suggestive reason why it should be sono probability that the youth may regard her in such light because that chance has come to pass she can therefore give him her hand without trepidation and talk with him for half an hour when called on to do so as calmly as she might do with his sister such a one was isa heine at the time of which i am writing we english in our passion for daily excitement might call her phlegmatic but we should call her so unjustly life to her was a serious matter of which the daily duties and daily wants were sufficient to occupy her thoughts she was her mothers companion the instructress of both her brother and her sister and the charm of her fathers vacant hours with such calls upon her time and so many realities around her her imagination did not teach her to look for joys beyond those of her present life and home when love and marriage should come to her as come they probably might she would endeavour to attune herself to a new happiness and a new sphere of duties in the meantime she was contented to keep her mothers accounts and look after her brother and sister up two pair of stairs in the ludwigs strasse but change would certainly come we may prophesy for isa heine was a beautiful girl tall and graceful comely to the eye and fit in every way to be loved and cherished as the partner of a mans home i have said that an english clerk made a part of that small establishment in the dingy bankingoffice in the schrannen platz and i must say a word or two of herbert onslow in his early career he had not been fortunate his father with means sufficiently moderate and with a family more than sufficiently large had sent him to a public school at which he had been very idle and then to one of the universities at which he had run into debt and had therefore left without a degree when this occurred a family council of war had been held among the onslows and it was decided that herbert should be sent off to the bankinghouse of heines at munich there being a cousinship between the families and some existing connections of business it was therefore so settled and herbert willing enough to see the worldas he considered he should do by going to munichstarted for his german home with injunctions very tender from his mother and very solemn from his aggrieved father but there was nothing bad at the heart about young onslow and if the solemn father had well considered it he might perhaps have felt that those debts at cambridge reflected more fault on him than on his son when herbert arrived at munich his cousins the heinesfaraway cousins though they werebehaved kindly to him they established him at first in lodgings where he was boarded with many others having heard somewhat of his early youth but when madame heine at the end of twelve months perceived that he was punctual at the bank and that his allowances which though moderate in england were handsome in munich carried him on without debt she opened her motherly arms and suggested to his mother and to himself that he should live with them in this way he also was domiciled up two pairs of stairs in the palatial residence in the ludwigs strasse but all this happened long ago isa heine had been only seventeen when her cousin had first come to munich and had made acquaintance with him rather as a child than as a woman and when as she ripened into womanhood this young man came more closely among them it did not strike her that the change would affect her more powerfully than it would the others her uncle and father she knew had approved of herbert at the bank and herbert had shown that he could be steady therefore he was to be taken into their family paying his annual subsidy instead of being left with strangers at the boardinghouse all this was very simple to her she assisted in mending his linen as she did her fathers she visited his room daily as she visited all the others she took notice of his likings and dislikings as touching their table arrangementsbut by no means such notice as she did of her fathers and without any flutter inwardly in her imagination or outwardly as regarded the world she made him one of the family so things went on for a yearnay so things went on for two years with her after herbert onslow had come to the ludwigs strasse but the matter had been regarded in a very different light by herbert himself when the proposition had been made to him his first idea had been that so close a connection with a girl so very pretty would be delightful he had blushed as he had given in his adhesion but madame heine when she saw the blush had attributed it to anything but the true cause when isa had asked him as to his wants and wishes he had blushed again but she had been as ignorant as her mother the father had merely stipulated that as the young englishman paid for his board he should have the full value of his money so that isa and agnes gave up their pretty front room going into one that was inferior and hatto was put to sleep in the little closet that had been papas own peculiar property but nobody complained of this for it was understood that the money was of service for the first year herbert found that nothing especial happened he always fancied that he was in love with isa and wrote some poetry about her but the poetry was in english and isa could not read it even had he dared to show it to her during the second year he went home to england for three months and by confessing a passion to one of his sisters really brought himself to feel one he returned to munich resolved to tell isa that the possibility of his remaining there depended upon her acceptance of his heart but for months he did not find himself able to put his resolution in force she was so sedate so womanly so attentive as regarded cousinly friendship and so cold as regarded everything else that he did not know how to speak to her with an english girl whom he had met three times at a ball he might have been much more able to make progress he was alone with isa frequently for neither father mother nor isa herself objected to such communion but yet things so went between them that he could not take her by the hand and tell her that he loved her and thus the third year of his life in munich and the second of his residence in the ludwigs strasse went by him so the years went by and isa was now past twenty to herbert in his reveries it seemed as though life and the joys of life were slipping away from him but no such feeling disturbed any of the heines life of course was slipping away but then is it not the destiny of man that life should slip away their wants were all satisfied and for them that together with their close family affection was happiness enough at last however herbert so spoke or so looked that both isa and her mother that his heart was touched he still declared to himself that he had made no sign and that he was an oaf an ass a coward in that he had not done so but he had made some sign and the sign had been read there was no secretno necessity for a secret on the subject between the mother and daughter but yet it was not spoken of all at once there was some little increase of caution between them as herberts name was mentioned so that gradually each knew what the other thought but for weeks that was all then at last the mother spoke out isa she said i think that herbert onslow is becoming attached to you he has never said so mamma no i am sure he has not had he done so you would have told me nevertheless is it not true well mamma i cannot say it may be so such an idea has occurred to me but i have abandoned it as needless if he has anything to say he will say it and if he were to speak how should you answer him i should take time to think i do not at all know what means he has for a separate establishment then the subject was dropped between them for that time and isa in her communications with her cousin was somewhat more reserved than she had been isa are you in love with herbert agnes asked her as they were together in their room one night in love with him no why should i be in love with him i think he is in love with you said agnes that is quite another thing said isa laughing but if so he has not taken me into his confidence perhaps he has you oh no he would not do that i think not but what we are great friends and i love him dearly would it not be nice for you and him to be betrothed that depends on many things my dear oh yes i know perhaps he has not got money enough but you could live here you know and he has got some money because he so often rides on horseback and then the matter was dropped between the two sisters herbert had given english lessons to the two girls but the lessons had been found tedious and had dwindled away isa nevertheless had kept up her exercises duly translating german into english and english into german and occasionally she had shown them to her cousin now however she altogether gave over such showing of them but nevertheless worked at the task with more energy than before isa he said to her one dayhaving with some difficulty found her alone in the parlour isa why should not we go on with our english because it is troublesometo you i mean troublesome well yes it is troublesome nothing good is to be had without trouble but i should like it if you would not mind you know how sick you were of it beforebesides i shall never be able to speak it i shall not get sick of it now isa oh yes you wouldin two days and i want you to speak it i desire it especially why especially asked isa and even she with all her tranquillity of demeanour could hardly preserve her even tone and quiet look as she asked the necessary question i will tell you why said herbert and as he spoke he got up from his seat and took a step or two over towards her where she was sitting near the window isa as she saw him still continued her work and strove hard to give to the stitches all that attention which they required i will tell you why i would wish you to talk my language because i love you isa and would have you for my wifeif that be possible she still continued her work and the stitches if not quite as perfect as usual sufficed for their purpose that is why i wish it now will you consent to learn from me again if i did herbert that consent would include another yes certainly it would that is what i intend and now will you learn from me again that isyou mean to ask will i marry you will you love me can you learn to love me oh isa i have thought of this so long but you have seemed so cold that i have not dared to speak isa can you love me and he sat himself close beside her now that the ice was broken he was quite prepared to become an ardent loverif she would allow of such ardour but as he sat down she rose i cannot answer such a question on the sudden she said give me till tomorrow herbert and then i will make you a reply whereupon she left him and he stood alone in the room having done the deed on which he had been meditating for the last two years about half an hour afterwards he met her on the stairs as he was going to his chamber may i speak to your father about this he said hardly stopping her as he asked the question oh yes surely she answered and then again they parted to him this lastaccorded permission sounded as though it carried with it more weight than it in truth possessed in his own country a reference to the ladys father is taken as indicating a full consent on the ladys part should the stern paterfamilias raise no objection but isa had no such meaning she had told him that she could not give her answer till the morrow if however he chose to consult her father on the subject she had no objection it would probably be necessary that she should discuss the whole matter in family conclave before she could bring herself to give any reply on that night before he went to bed he did speak to her father and isa also before she went to rest spoke to her mother it was singular to him that there should appear to be so little privacy on the subject that there should be held to be so little necessity for a secret had he made a suggestion that an extra room should be allotted to him at so much per annum the proposition could not have been discussed with simpler ease at last after a three days debate the matter ended thuswith by no means a sufficiency of romance for his taste isa had agreed to become his betrothed if certain pecuniary conditions should or could be fulfilled it appeared now that herberts father had promised that some small modicum of capital should be forthcoming after a term of years and that heine brothers had agreed that the englishman should have a proportionate share in the bank when that promise should be brought to bear let it not be supposed that herbert would thus become a millionaire if all went well the best would be that some three hundred a year would accrue to him from the bank instead of the quarter of that income which he at present received but three hundred a year goes a long way at munich and isas parents were willing that she should be herberts wife if such an income should be forthcoming but even of this there was much doubt application to herberts father could not be judiciously made for some months the earliest period at which in accordance with old hatto heines agreement young onslow might be admitted to the bank was still distant by four years and the present moment was thought to be inopportune for applying to him for any act of grace let them wait said papa and mamma heineat any rate till new years day then ten months distant isa quietly said that she would wait till new years day herbert fretted fumed and declared that he was illtreated but in the end he also agreed to wait what else could he do but we shall see each other daily and be close to each other he said to isa looking tenderly into her eyes yes she replied we shall see each other dailyof course but herbert herbert looked up at her and paused for her to go on i have promised mamma that there shall be no change between usin our manner to each other i mean we are not betrothed as yet you know and perhaps we may never be so isa it may not be possible you know and therefore we will go on as before of course we shall see each other and of course we shall be friends herbert onslow again fretted and again fumed but he did not have his way he had looked forward to the ecstasies of a lovers life but very few of those ecstasies were awarded to him he rarely found himself alone with isa and when he did do so her coldness overawed him he could dare to scold her and sometimes did do so but he could not dare to take the slightest liberty once on that night when the qualified consent of papa and mamma heine had first been given he had been allowed to touch her lips with his own but since that day there had been for him no such delight as that she would not even allow her hand to remain in his when they all passed their evenings together in the beergarden she would studiously manage that his chair should not be close to her own occasionally she would walk with him but not more frequently now than of yore very few indeed of a lovers privileges did he enjoy and in this way the long year wore itself out and isa heine was oneandtwenty all those family details which had made it inexpedient to apply either to old hatto or to herberts father before the end of the year need not be specially explained old hatto who had by far the greater share in the business was a tyrant somewhat feared both by his brother and sisterinlaw and the elder onslow as was known to them all was a man straitened in circumstances but soon after new years day the proposition was made in the schrannen platz and the letter was written on this occasion madame heine went down to the bank and together with her husband was closeted for an hour with old hatto uncle hattos verdict was not favourable as to the young peoples marriage that was his brothers affair not his but as to the partnership that was a serious matter who ever heard of a partnership being given away merely because a man wanted to marry he would keep to his promise and if the stipulated moneys were forthcoming herbert onslow should become a partnerin four years nor was the reply from england more favourable the alliance was regarded by all the onslows very favourably nothing could be nicer than such a marriage they already knew dear isa so well by description but as for the moneythat could not in any way be forthcoming till the end of the stipulated period and what shall we do said herbert to papa heine you must wait said he for four years asked herbert you must waitas i did said papa heine i was forty before i could marry papa heine however should not have forgotten to say that his bride was only twenty and that if he had waited she had not isa herbert said to her when all this had been fully explained to her what do you say now of course it is all over said she very calmly oh isa is that your love no herbert that is not my love that is my discretion and she even laughed with her mild low laughter as she answered him you know you are too impatient to wait four years and what else therefore can i say i wonder whether you love me said herbert with a grand look of injured sentiment well in your sense of the word i do not think i do i do not love you so that i need make every one around us unhappy because circumstances forbid me to marry you that sort of love would be baneful ah no you do not know what love means not your boisterous heartbreaking english love herbert and herbert sometimes i think you had better go home and look for a bride there though you fancy that you love me in your heart you hardly approve of me fancy that i love you do you think isa that a man can carry his heart round to one customer after another as the huckster carries his wares yes i think he can i know that men do what did your hero waverley do with his heart in that grand english novel which you gave me to read i am not flora mac ivor but you may find a rose bradwardine and you really wish me to do so look here herbert it is bad to boast but i will make this boast i am so little selfish that i desire above all that you should do that which may make you most happy and contented i will be quite frank with you i love you well enough to wait these four years with the hope of becoming your wife when they are over but you will think but little of my love when i tell you that this waiting would not make me unhappy i should go on as i do now and be contented oh heavens sighed herbert but as i know that this would not suit youas i feel sure that such delay would gall you every day as i doubt whether it would not make you sick of me long before the four years be overmy advice is that we should let this matter drop he now walked up to her and took her hand and as he did so there was something in his gait and look and tone of voice that stirred her heart more sharply than it had yet been stirred and even that would not make you unhappy he said she paused before she replied leaving her hand in his for he was contented to hold it without peculiar pressure i will not say so she replied but herbert i think that you press me too hard is it not enough that i leave you to be the arbiter of my destiny i would learn the very truth of your heart he replied i cannot tell you that truth more plainly methinks i have told it too plainly already if you wish it i will hold myself as engaged to youto be married to you when those four years are past but remember i do not advise it if you wish it you shall have back your troth and that i think will be the wiser course but neither alternative contented herbert onslow and at the time he did not resolve on either he had some little present income from home some fifty pounds a year or so and he would be satisfied to marry on that and on his salary as a clerk but to this papa and mamma heine would not consentneither would isa you are not a saving close man she said to him when he boasted of his economies no englishmen are you could not live comfortably in two small rooms and with bad dinners i do not care a straw about my dinners not now that you are a lover but you would do when you were a husband and you change your linen almost every day bah yes bah if you please but i know what these things cost you had better go to england and fetch a rich wife then you will become a partner at once and uncle hatto wont snub you and you will be a grand man and have a horse to ride on whereupon herbert went away in disgust nothing in all this made him so unhappy as the feeling that isa under all their joint privations would not be unhappy herself as far as he could see all this made no difference in isa but in truth he had not yet read isas character very thoroughly she had spoken truly in saying that she knew nothing of that boisterous love which was now tormenting him and making him gloomy but nevertheless she loved him she in her short life had learnt many lessons of selfdenial and now with reference to this halfpromised husband she would again have practised such a lesson had he agreed at once to go from her she would have balanced her own account within her own breast and have kept to herself all her sufferings there would have been no outward show of baffled lovenone even in the colour of her cheeks for such was the nature of her temperament but she did suffer for him day by day she began to think that his love though boisterous as she had at first called it was more deepseated than she had believed he made no slightest sign that he would accept any of those proffers which she had made him of release though he said so loudly that this waiting for four years was an impossibility he spoke of no course that would be more possibleexcept that evidently impossible course of an early marriage and thus while he with redoubled vehemence charged her with coldness and want of love her love waxed warmer and warmer and his happiness became the chief object of her thoughts what could she do that he might no longer suffer and then he took a step which was very strange to them all he banished himself altogether from the house going away again into lodgings no he said on the morning of his departure i do not release you i will never release you you are mine and i have a right so to call you if you choose to release yourself i cannot help it but in doing so you will be forsworn nay but herbert i have sworn to nothing said she meaning that she had not been formally betrothed to him you can do as you please it is a matter of conscience but i tell you what are my feelings here i cannot stay for i should go mad but i shall see you occasionallyperhaps on sundays oh herbert well what would you have if you really care to see me it would not be thus all i ask of you now is this that if you decideabsolutely decide on throwing me over you will tell me at once then i shall leave munich herbert i will never throw you over so they parted and onslow went forth to his new lodgings her promise that she would never throw him over was the warmest word of love that she had ever spoken but even that was said in her own quiet unimpassioned way there was in it but very little show of love though there might be an assurance of constancy but her constancy he did not in truth much doubt four yearsfourteenor twentyfour would be the same to her he said as he seated himself in the dull cold room which he had chosen while living in the ludwigs strasse he did not know how much had been daily done for his comfort by that hand which he had been so seldom allowed to press but he knew that he was now cold and comfortless and he wished himself back in the ludwigs strasse mamma said isa when they were alone is not uncle hatto rather hard on us papa said that he would ask this as a favour from his brother so he did my dear and offered to give up more of his own time but your uncle hatto is hard he is rich is he not well your father says not your father says that he spends all his income though he is hard and obstinate he is not selfish he is very good to the poor but i believe he thinks that early marriages are very foolish mamma said isa again when they had sat for some minutes in silence over their work well my love have you spoken to uncle hatto about this no dear not since that day when your papa and i first went to him to tell the truth i am almost afraid to speak to him but if you wish it i will do so i do wish it mamma but you must not think that i am discontented or impatient i do not know that i have any right to ask my uncle for his moneyfor it comes to that i suppose it does my dear and as for myself i am happy here with you and papa i do not think so much of these four years you would still be young isaquite young enough and what if i were not young what does it matter but mamma there has been that between herbert and me which makes me feel myself bound to think of him as you and papa have sanctioned it you are bound to think of him also i know that he is unhappy living there all alone but why did he go dear i think he was right to go i could understand his doing that he is not like us and would have been fretful here wanting that which i could not give him he became worse from day to day and was silent and morose i am glad he went but mamma for his sake i wish that this could be shortened madame heine told her daughter that she would if isa wished it herself go to the schrannen platz and see what could be done by talking to uncle hatto but she added i fear that no good will come of it can harm come mamma no i do not think harm can come ill tell you what mamma i will go to uncle hatto myself if you will let me he is cross i know but i shall not be afraid of him i feel that i ought to do something and so the matter was settled madame heine being by no means averse to escape a further personal visit to the head of the banking establishment madame heine well understood what her daughter meant when she said she ought to do something though isa feared that she had imperfectly expressed her meaning when he herbert was willing to do so much to prove his lovewhen he was ready to sacrifice all the little comforts of comparative wealth to which he had been accustomed in order that she might be his companion and wifedid it not behove her to give some proof of her love also she could not be demonstrative as he was such exhibition of feeling would be quite contrary to her ideas of female delicacy and to her very nature but if called on to work for him that she could do as long as strength remained to her but there was no sacrifice which would be of service nor any work which would avail therefore she was driven to think what she might do on his behalf and at last she resolved to make her personal appeal to uncle hatto shall i tell papa isa asked of her mother i will do so said madame heine and then the younger member of the firm was informed as to the step which was to be taken and he though he said nothing to forbid the attempt held out no hope that it would be successful uncle hatto was a little snuffy man now full seventy years of age who passed seven hours of every weekday of his life in the dark back chamber behind the bankingroom of the firm and he had so passed every weekday of his life for more years than any of the family could now remember he had made the house what it was and had taken his brother into partnership when that brother married all the family were somewhat afraid of him including even his partner he rarely came to the apartments in the ludwigs strasse as he himself lived in one of the older and shabbier suburbs on the other side of the town thither he always walked starting punctually from the bank at four oclock and from thence he always walked in the morning reaching the bank punctually at nine his two nieces knew him well for on certain stated days they were wont to attend on him at his lodgings where they would be regaled with cakes and afterwards go with him to some oldfashioned beergarden in his neighbourhood but these festivities were of a sombre kind and if on any occasion circumstances prevented the fulfilment of the ceremony neither of the girls would be loud in their lamentations in london a visit paid by a niece to her uncle would in all probability be made at the uncles private residence but at munich private and public matters were not so effectually divided isa therefore having put on her hat and shawl walked off by herself to the schrannen platz is uncle hatto inside she asked and the answer was given to her by her own lover yes he was within but the old clerk was with him isa however signified her wish to see her uncle alone and in a few minutes the ancient greyhaired servant of the house came out into the larger room you can go in now miss isa he said and isa found herself in the presence of her uncle before she had been two minutes under the roof in the mean time ernest heine her father had said not a word and herbert knew that something very special must be about to occur well my bonny bird said uncle hatto and what do you want at the bank cheery words such as these were by no means uncommon with uncle hatto but isa knew very well that no presage could be drawn from them of any special good nature or temporary weakness on his part uncle hatto she began rushing at once into the middle of her affair you know i believe that i am engaged to marry herbert onslow i know no such thing said he i thought i understood your father specially to say that there had been no betrothal no uncle hatto there has been no betrothal that certainly is true but nevertheless we are engaged to each other well said uncle hatto very sourly and now there was no longer any cheery tone or any calling of pretty names perhaps you may think all this very foolish said isa who in spite of her resolves to do so was hardly able to look up gallantly into her uncles face as she thus talked of her own love affairs yes i do said uncle hatto i do think it foolish for young people to hold themselves betrothed before they have got anything to live on and so i have told your father he answered me by saying that you were not betrothed nor are we papa is quite right in that then my dear i would advise you to tell the young man that as neither of you have means of your own the thing must be at an end it is the only step for you to take if you agreed to wait one of you might die or his money might never be forthcoming or you might see somebody else that you liked better i dont think i shall do that you cant tell and if you dont the chances are ten to one that he will this little blow which was intended to be severe did not hit isa at all hard that plan of a rose bradwardine she herself had proposed in good faith thinking that she could endure such a termination to the affair without flinching she was probably wrong in this estimate of her power but nevertheless her present object was his release from unhappiness and doubt not her own it might be so she said take my word for it it would look all around there was adelaide schropnerbut that was before your time and you would not remember considering that adelaide schropner had been for many years a grandmother it was probable that isa would not remember but uncle hatto you have not heard me i want to say something to you if it will not take too much of your time in answer to which uncle hatto muttered something which was unheeded to signify that isa might speak i also think that a long engagement is a foolish thing and so does herbert but he wants to marry at once yes he wants to marryperhaps not at once but soon and i suppose you have come to say that you want the same thing isa blushed ever so faintly as she commenced her answer yes uncle i do wish the same thing what he wishes i wish very likelyvery likely dont be scornful to me uncle when two people love each other it is natural that each should wish that which the other earnestly desires oh very natural my dear that you should wish to get married uncle hatto i did not think that you would be unkind to me though i knew that you would be stern well go on what have you to say i am not stern but i have no doubt you will think me unkind people are always unkind who do not do what they are asked papa says that herbert onslow is some day to become a partner in the bank that depends on certain circumstances neither i nor your papa can say whether he will or no but isa went on as though she had not heard the last reply i have come to ask you to admit him as a partner at once ah i supposed sojust as you might ask me to give you a new ribbon but uncle i never did ask you to give me a new ribbon i never asked you to give me anything for myself nor do i ask this for myself do you think that if i could do itwhich of course i canti would not sooner do it for you who are my own flesh and blood than for him who is a stranger nay he is no stranger he has sat at your desk and obeyed your orders for nearly four years papa says that he has done well in the bank humph if every clerk that does wellpretty well that iswanted a partnership where should we be my dear no my dear go home and tell him when you see him in the evening that all this must be at an end mens places in the world are not given away so easily as that they must either be earned or purchased herbert onslow has as yet done neither and therefore he is not entitled to take a wife i should have been glad to have had a wife at his ageat least i suppose i should but at any rate i could not afford it but isa had by no means as yet done so far the interview had progressed exactly as she had anticipated she had never supposed it possible that her uncle would grant her so important a request as soon as she opened her mouth to ask it she had not for a moment expected that things would go so easily with her indeed she had never expected that any success would attend her efforts but if any success were possible the work which must achieve that success must now commence it was necessary that she should first state her request plainly before she began to urge it with such eloquence as she had at her command i can understand what you say uncle hatto i am glad of that at any rate and i know that i have no right to ask you for anything i do not say that anything in reason that a girl like you should ask of her old uncle i would give you i have no such reasonable request to make uncle i have never wanted new ribbons from you or gay toys even from my own mother i have not wanted themnot wanted them faster than they seemed to come without any asking no no you have been a good girl i have been a happy girl and quite happy with those i loved and with what providence had given me i had nothing to ask for but now i am no longer happy nor can i be unless you do for me this which i ask of you i have wanted nothing till now and now in my need i come to you and now you want a husband with a fortune no and that single word she spoke not loudly for her voice was low and soft but with an accent which carried it sharply to his ear and to his brain and then she rose from her seat as she went on your scorn uncle is unjustunjust and untrue i have ever acted maidenly as has become my mothers daughter yes yes yesi believe that and i can say more than that for myself my thoughts have been the same nor have my wishes even ever gone beyond them and when this young man came to me telling me of his feelings i gave him no answer till i had consulted my mother she should have bade you not to think of him ah you are not a mother and cannot know why should i not think of him when he was good and kind honest and hardworking and then he had thought of me first why should i not think of him did not mamma listen to my father when he came to her but your father was forty years old and had a business you gave it him uncle hatto i have heard him say so and therefore i am to do as much for you and then next year agnes will come to me and so before i die i shall see you all in want with large families no isa i will not scorn you but this thing i cannot do but i have not told you all yet you say that i want a husband well well i did not mean to say it harshly i do wantto be married and here her courage failed her a little and for a moment her eye fell to the ground it is true uncle he has asked me whether i could love him and i have told him i could he has asked me whether i would be his wife and i have given him a promise after that must not his happiness be my happiness and his misery my misery am i not his wife already before god no no said uncle hatto loudly ah but i am none feel the strength of the bonds but those who are themselves bound i know my duty to my father and mother and with gods help i will do it but i am not the less bound to him without their approval i will not stand with him at the altar but not the less is my lot joined to his for this world nothing could release me from that but his wish and he will wish it in a month or two excuse me uncle hatto but in that i can only judge for myself as best i may he has loved me now for two years psha and whether it be wise or foolish i have sanctioned it i cannot now go back with honour even if my own heart would let me his welfare must be my welfare and his sorrow my sorrow therefore i am bound to do for him anything that a girl may do for the man she loves and as i knew of no other resource i come to you to help me and he sitting out there knows what you are saying most certainly not he knows no more than that he has seen me enter this room i am glad of that because i would not wish that he should be disappointed in this matter my dear i cannot do anything for you and that is your last answer uncle yes indeed when you come to think over this some twenty years hence you will know then that i am right and that your request was unreasonable it may be so she replied but i do not think it it will be so such favours as you now ask are not granted in this world for light reasons light reasons well uncle i have had my say and will not take up your time longer goodbye my dear i am sorry that i cannot oblige youthat it is quite out of my power to oblige you then she went giving him her hand as she parted from him and he as she left the room looked anxiously at her watching her countenance and her gait and listening to the very fall of her footstep ah he said to himself when he was alone the young people have the best of it the sun shines for them but why should they have all poor as he is he is a happy doga happy dog but she is twice too good for him why did she not take to one of her own country isa as she passed through the bank smiled sweetly on her father and then smiled sweetly at her lover nodding to him with a pleasant kindly nod if he could have heard all that had passed at that interview how much more he would have known of her than he now knew and how proud he would have been of her love no word was spoken as she went out and then she walked home with even step as she had walked thither it can hardly be said that she was disappointed as she had expected nothing but people hope who do not expect and though her step was even and her face calm yet her heart was sad mamma she said there is no hope from uncle hatto so i feared my dear but i thought it right to tryfor herberts sake i hope it will not do him an injury in the bank oh mamma do not put that into my head if that were added to it all i should indeed be wretched no he is too just for that poor young man sometimes i almost think it would be better that he should go back to england mamma if he did i shouldbreak my heart isa well mamma but do not suppose that i mean to complain whatever happens but i had been so sure that you had constrained your feelings so i hadtill i knew myself mamma i could wait for years if he were contented to wait by my side if i could see him happy i could watch him and love him and be happy also i do not want to have him kneeling to me and making sweet speeches but it has gone too far nowand i could not bear to lose him and thus to her mother she confessed the truth there was nothing more said between isa and her mother on the subject and for two days the matter remained as it then stood madame heine had been deeply grieved at hearing those last words which her daughter had spoken to her also that state of quiescence which isa had so long affected seemed to be the proper state at which a maidens heart should stand till after her marriage vows had been pronounced she had watched her isa and had approved of everythingof everything till this last avowal had been made but now though she could not approve she expressed no disapproval in words she pressed her daughters hand and sighed and then the two said no more upon the matter in this way for two days there was silence in the apartments in the ludwigs strasse for even when the father returned from his work the whole circle felt that their old family mirth was for the present necessarily laid aside on the morning of the third day about noon madame heine returned home from the market with isa and as they reached the landing agnes met them with a packet fritz brought it from the bank said agnes now fritz was the boy who ran messages and swept out the office and madame heine put out her hand for the parcel thinking not unnaturally that it was for her but agnes would not give it to her mother it is for you isa she said then isa looking at the address recognised the handwriting of her uncle mamma she said i will come to you directly and then she passed quickly away into her own room the parcel was soon opened and contained a note from her uncle and a stiff large document looking as though it had come from the hands of a lawyer isa glanced at the document and read some few of the words on the outer fold but they did not carry home to her mind any clear perception of their meaning she was flurried at the moment and the words perhaps were not very plain then she took up her note and that was plain enough it was very short and ran as follows my dear niece you told me on monday that i was stern and harsh and unjust perhaps i was if so i hope the enclosed will make amends and that you will not think me such an old fool as i think myself your affectionate uncle hatto heine i have told nobody yet and the enclosed will require my brothers signature but i suppose he will not object but he does not know it mamma said isa who is to tell him oh mamma you must tell him nay my dear but it must be your own present to him i could not give it him it is uncle hattos present mamma when i left him i thought that his eye was kind to me his heart at any rate has been very kind and then again they looked over the document and talked of the wedding which must now be near at hand but still they had not as yet decided how herbert should be informed at last isa resolved that she herself would write to him she did write and this was her letter dear herbert mamma and i wish to see you and beg that you will come up to us this evening we have tidings for you which i hope you will receive with joy i may as well tell you at once as i do not wish to flurry you uncle hatto has sent to us a document which admits you as a partner into the bank if therefore you wish to go on with our engagement i suppose there is nothing now to cause any very great delay isa the letter was very simple and isa when she had written it subsided into all her customary quiescence indeed when herbert came to the ludwigs strasse not in the evening as he was bidden to do but instantly leaving his own dinner uneaten and coming upon the heines in the midst of their dinner she was more than usually tranquil but his love was as she had told him boisterous he could not contain himself and embraced them all and then scolded isa because she was so calm why should i not be calm said she now that i know you are happy the house in the schrannen platz still goes by the name of heine brothers but the mercantile world in bavaria and in some cities out of bavaria is well aware that the real pith and marrow of the business is derived from the energy of the young english partner the man who kept his money in a box i first saw the man who kept his money in a box in the midst of the ravine of the via mala i interchanged a few words with him or with his wife at the hospice at the top of the splugen and i became acquainted with him in the courtyard of conradis hotel at chiavenna it was however afterwards at bellaggio on the lake of como that that acquaintance ripened into intimacy a good many years have rolled by since then and i believe this little episode in his life may be told without pain to the feelings of any one his name was let us for the present say that his name was greene how he learned that my name was robinson i do not know but i remember well that he addressed me by my name at chiavenna to go back however for a moment to the via malai had been staying for a few days at the golden eagle at tusiswhich bythebye i hold to be the best small inn in all switzerland and its hostess to be or to have been certainly the prettiest landladyand on the day of my departure southwards i had walked on into the via mala so that the diligence might pick me up in the gorge this pass i regard as one of the grandest spots to which my wandering steps have ever carried me and though i had already lingered about it for many hours i now walked thither again to take my last farewell of its dark towering rocks its narrow causeway and roaring river trusting to my friend the landlady to see that my luggage was duly packed upon the diligence i need hardly say that my friend did not betray her trust as one goes out from switzerland towards italy the road through the via mala ascends somewhat steeply and passengers by the diligence may walk from the inn at tusis into the gorge and make their way through the greater part of the ravine before the vehicle will overtake them this however mr greene with his wife and daughter had omitted to do when the diligence passed me in the defile the horses trotting for a few yards over some level portion of the road i saw a mans nose pressed close against the glass of the coup window i saw more of his nose than of any other part of his face but yet i could perceive that his neck was twisted and his eye upturned and that he was making a painful effort to look upwards to the summit of the rocks from his position inside the carriage there was such a roar of wind and waters at the spot that it was not practicable to speak to him but i beckoned with my finger and then pointed to the road indicating that he should have walked he understood me though i did not at the moment understand his answering gesture it was subsequently when i knew somewhat of his habits that he explained to me that on pointing to his open mouth he had intended to signify that he would be afraid of sore throat in exposing himself to the air of that damp and narrow passage i got up into the conductors covered seat at the back of the diligence and in this position encountered the drifting snow of the splugen i think it is coldest of all the passes near the top of the pass the diligence stops for awhile and it is here if i remember that the austrian officials demand the travellers passports at least in those days they did so these officials have now retreated behind the quadrilatresoon as we hope to make a further retreatand the district belongs to the kingdom of united italy there is a place of refreshment or hospice here into which we all went for a few moments and i then saw that my friend with the weak throat was accompanied by two ladies you should not have missed the via mala i said to him as he stood warming his toes at the huge covered stove we miss everything said the elder of the two ladies who however was very much younger than the gentleman and not very much older than her companion i saw it beautifully mamma said the younger one whereupon mamma gave her head a toss and made up her mind as i thought to take some little vengeance before long upon her stepdaughter i observed that miss greene always called her stepmother mamma on the first approach of any stranger so that the nature of the connection between them might be understood and i observed also that the elder lady always gave her head a toss when she was so addressed we dont mean to enjoy ourselves till we get down to the lake of como said mr greene as i looked at him cowering over the stove and saw how oppressed he was with great coats and warm wrappings for his throat i quite agreed with him that he had not begun to enjoy himself as yet then we all got into our places again and i saw no more of the greenes till we were standing huddled together in the large courtyard of conradis hotel at chiavenna chiavenna is the first italian town which the tourist reaches by this route and i know no town in the north of italy which is so closely surrounded by beautiful scenery the traveller as he falls down to it from the splugen road is bewildered by the loveliness of the valleysthat is to say if he so arranges that he can see them without pressing his nose against the glass of a coach window and then from the town itself there are walks of two three and four hours which i think are unsurpassed for wild and sometimes startling beauties one gets into little valleys green as emeralds and surrounded on all sides by grey broken rocks in which italian rasselases might have lived in perfect bliss and then again one comes upon distant views up the river courses bounded far away by the spurs of the alps which are perfectto which the fancy can add no additional charm conradis hotel also is by no means bad or was not in those days for my part i am inclined to think that italian hotels have received a worse name than they deserve and i must profess that looking merely to creature comforts i would much sooner stay a week at the golden key at chiavenna than with mine host of the kings head in the thriving commercial town of muddleboro on the borders of yorkshire and lancashire i am always rather keen about my room in travelling and having secured a chamber looking out upon the mountains had returned to the courtyard to collect my baggage before mr greene had succeeded in realising his position or understanding that he had to take upon himself the duties of settling his family for the night in the hotel by which he was surrounded when i descended he was stripping off the outermost of three great coats and four waiters around him were beseeching him to tell them what accommodation he would require mr greene was giving sundry very urgent instructions to the conductor respecting his boxes but as these were given in english i was not surprised to find that they were not accurately followed the man however was much too courteous to say in any language that he did not understand every word that was said to him miss greene was standing apart doing nothing as she was only eighteen years of age it was of course her business to do nothing and a very pretty little girl she was by no means ignorant of her own beauty and possessed of quite sufficient wit to enable her to make the most of it mr greene was very leisurely in his proceedings and the four waiters were almost reduced to despair i want two bedrooms a dressingroom and some dinner he said at last speaking very slowly and in his own vernacular i could not in the least assist him by translating it into italian for i did not speak a word of the language myself but i suggested that the man would understand french the waiter however had understood english waiters do understand all languages with a facility that is marvellous and this one now suggested that mrs greene should follow him upstairs mrs greene however would not move till she had seen that her boxes were all right and as mrs greene was also a pretty woman i found myself bound to apply myself to her assistance oh thank you said she the people are so stupid that one can really do nothing with them and as for mr greene he is of no use at all you see that box the smaller one i have four hundred pounds worth of jewellery in that and therefore i am obliged to look after it indeed said i rather startled at this amount of confidence on rather a short acquaintance in that case i do not wonder at your being careful but is it not rather rash perhaps i know what you are going to say well perhaps it is rash but when you are going to foreign courts what are you to do if you have got those sort of things you must wear them as i was not myself possessed of anything of that sort and had no intention of going to any foreign court i could not argue the matter with her but i assisted her in getting together an enormous pile of luggage among which there were seven large boxes covered with canvas such as ladies not uncommonly carry with them when travelling that one which she represented as being smaller than the others and as holding jewellery might be about a yard long by a foot and a half deep being ignorant in those matters i should have thought it sufficient to carry all a ladys wardrobe for twelve months when the boxes were collected together she sat down upon the jewelcase and looked up into my face she was a pretty woman perhaps thirty years of age with long light yellow hair which she allowed to escape from her bonnet knowing perhaps that it was not unbecoming to her when thus dishevelled her skin was very delicate and her complexion good indeed her face would have been altogether prepossessing had there not been a want of gentleness in her eyes her hands too were soft and small and on the whole she may be said to have been possessed of a strong battery of feminine attractions she also well knew how to use them whisper she said to me with a peculiar but very proper aspiration on the hwhhisper and both by the aspiration and the use of the word i knew at once from what island she had come mr greene keeps all his money in this box also so i never let it go out of my sight for a moment but whatever you do dont tell him that i told you so i laid my hand on my heart and made a solemn asseveration that i would not divulge her secret i need not however have troubled myself much on that head for as i walked up stairs keeping my eye upon the precious trunk mr greene addressed me you are an englishman mr robinson said he i acknowledged that i was i am another my wife however is irish my daughterby a former marriageis english also you see that box there oh yes said i i see it i began to be so fascinated by the box that i could not keep my eyes off it i dont know whether or no it is prudent but i keep all my money there my money for travelling i mean if i were you then i answered i would not say anything about it to any one oh no of course not said he i should not think of mentioning it but those brigands in italy always take away what you have about your person but they dont meddle with the heavy luggage bills of exchange or circular notes i suggested ah yes and if you cant identify yourself or happen to have a headache you cant get them changed i asked an old friend of mine who has been connected with the bank of england for the last fifty years and he assured me that there was nothing like sovereigns but you never get the value for them well not quite one loses a franc or a franc and a half but still theres the certainty and thats the great matter an english sovereign will go anywhere and he spoke these words with considerable triumph undoubtedly if you consent to lose a shilling on each sovereign at any rate i have got three hundred and fifty in that box he said i have them done up in rolls of twentyfive pounds each i again recommended him to keep this arrangement of his as private as possiblea piece of counsel which i confess seemed to me to be much neededand then i went away to my own room having first accepted an invitation from mrs greene to join their party at dinner do said she we have been so dull and it will be so pleasant i did not require to be much pressed to join myself to a party in which there was so pretty a girl as miss greene and so attractive a woman as mrs greene i therefore accepted the invitation readily and went away to make my toilet as i did so i passed the door of mr greenes room and saw the long file of boxes being borne into the centre of it i spent a pleasant evening with however one or two slight drawbacks as to old greene himself he was all that was amiable but then he was nervous full of cares and somewhat apt to be a bore he wanted information on a thousand points and did not seem to understand that a young man might prefer the conversation of his daughter to his own not that he showed any solicitude to prevent conversation on the part of his daughter i should have been perfectly at liberty to talk to either of the ladies had he not wished to engross all my attention to himself he also had found it dull to be alone with his wife and daughter for the last six weeks he was a small spare man probably over fifty years of age who gave me to understand that he had lived in london all his life and had made his own fortune in the city what he had done in the city to make his fortune he did not say had i come across him there i should no doubt have found him to be a sharp man of business quite competent to teach me many a useful lesson of which i was as ignorant as an infant had he caught me on the exchange or at lloyds or in the big room of the bank of england i should have been compelled to ask him everything now in this little town under the alps he was as much lost as i should have been in lombard street and was ready enough to look to me for information i was by no means chary in giving him my counsel and imparting to him my ideas on things in general in that part of the worldonly i should have preferred to be allowed to make myself civil to his daughter in the course of conversation it was mentioned by him that they intended to stay a few days at bellaggio which as all the world knows is a central spot on the lake of como and a favourite restingplace for travellers there are three lakes which all meet here and to all of which we give the name of como they are properly called the lakes of como colico and lecco and bellaggio is the spot at which their waters join each other i had half made up my mind to sleep there one night on my road into italy and now on hearing their purpose i declared that such was my intention how very pleasant said mrs greene it will be quite delightful to have some one to show us how to settle ourselves for really my dear im sure you cant say that you ever have much trouble and who does then mr greene i am sure sophonisba does not do much to help me you wont let me said sophonisba whose name i had not before heard her papa had called her sophy in the yard of the inn sophonisba greene sophonisba robinson did not sound so badly in my ears and i confess that i had tried the names together her papa had mentioned to me that he had no other child and had mentioned also that he had made his fortune and then there was a little family contest as to the amount of travelling labour which fell to the lot of each of the party during which i retired to one of the windows of the big front room in which we were sitting and how much of this labour there is incidental to a tourists pursuits and how often these little contests do arise upon a journey who has ever travelled and not known them i had taken up such a position at the window as might i thought have removed me out of hearing but nevertheless from time to time a word would catch my ear about that precious box i have never taken my eyes off it since i left england said mrs greene speaking quick and with a considerable brogue superinduced by her energy where would it have been at basle if i had not been looking afther it quite safe said sophonisba those large things always are safe are they miss thats all you know about it i suppose your bonnetbox was quite safe when i found it on the platform atati forget the name of the place freidrichshafen said sophonisba with almost an unnecessary amount of teutonic skill in her pronunciation well mamma you have told me of that at least twenty times soon after that the ladies took them to their own rooms weary with the travelling of two days and a night and mr greene went fast asleep in the very comfortless chair in which he was seated at four oclock on the next morning we started on our journey early to bed and early to rise is the way to be healthy and wealthy and wise we all know that lesson and many of us believe in it but if the lesson be true the italians ought to be the healthiest and wealthiest and wisest of all men and women three or four oclock seems to them quite a natural hour for commencing the days work why we should have started from chiavenna at four oclock in order that we might be kept waiting for the boat an hour and a half on the little quay at colico i dont know but such was our destiny there we remained an hour and a half mrs greene sitting pertinaciously on the one important box she had designated it as being smaller than the others and as all the seven were now ranged in a row i had an opportunity of comparing them it was something smallerperhaps an inch less high and an inch and a half shorter she was a sharp woman and observed my scrutiny i always know it she said in a loud whisper by this little hole in the canvas and she put her finger on a slight rent on one of the ends as for greene if one of those italian brigands were to walk off with it on his shoulders before his eyes he wouldnt be the wiser how helpless you men are mr robinson it is well for us that we have women to look after us but you have got no one to look after youor perhaps you have left her behind no indeed im all alone in the world as yet but its not my own fault i have asked half a dozen now mr robinson and in this way the time passed on the quay at colico till the boat came and took us away i should have preferred to pass my time in making myself agreeable to the younger lady but the younger lady stood aloof turning up her nose as i thought at her mamma i will not attempt to describe the scenery about colico the little town itself is one of the vilest places under the sun having no accommodation for travellers and being excessively unhealthy but there is very little either north or south of the alpsand perhaps i may add very little elsewhereto beat the beauty of the mountains which cluster round the head of the lake when we had sat upon those boxes that hour and a half we were taken on board the steamer which had been lying off a little way from the shore and then we commenced our journey of course there was a good deal of exertion and care necessary in getting the packages off from the shore on to the boat and i observed that any one with half an eye in his head might have seen that the mental anxiety expended on that one box which was marked by the small hole in the canvas far exceeded that which was extended to all the other six boxes they deserve that it should be stolen i said to myself for being such fools and then we went down to breakfast in the cabin i suppose it must be safe said mrs greene to me ignoring the fact that the cabin waiter understood english although she had just ordered some veal cutlets in that language as safe as a church i replied not wishing to give much apparent importance to the subject they cant carry it off here said mr greene but he was innocent of any attempt at a joke and was looking at me with all his eyes they might throw it overboard said sophonisba i at once made up my mind that she could not be a goodnatured girl the moment that breakfast was over mrs greene returned again upstairs and i found her seated on one of the benches near the funnel from which she could keep her eyes fixed upon the box when one is obliged to carry about ones jewels with one one must be careful mr robinson she said to me apologetically but i was becoming tired of the box and the funnel was hot and unpleasant therefore i left her i had made up my mind that sophonisba was illnatured but nevertheless she was pretty and i now went through some little manuvres with the object of getting into conversation with her this i soon did and was surprised by her frankness how tired you must be of mamma and her box she said to me to this i made some answer declaring that i was rather interested than otherwise in the safety of the precious trunk it makes me sick said sophonisba to hear her go on in that way to a perfect stranger i heard what she said about her jewellery it is natural she should be anxious i said seeing that it contains so much that is valuable why did she bring them said sophonisba she managed to live very well without jewels till papa married her about a year since and now she cant travel about for a month without lugging them with her everywhere i should be so glad if some one would steal them but all mr greenes money is there also i dont want papa to be bothered but i declare i wish the box might be lost for a day or so she is such a fool dont you think so mr robinson at this time it was just fourteen hours since i first had made their acquaintance in the yard of conradis hotel and of those fourteen hours more than half had been passed in bed i must confess that i looked upon sophonisba as being almost more indiscreet than her motherinlaw nevertheless she was not stupid and i continued my conversation with her the greatest part of the way down the lake towards bellaggio these steamers which run up and down the lake of como and the lago maggiore put out their passengers at the towns on the banks of the water by means of small rowingboats and the persons who are about to disembark generally have their own articles ready to their hands when their turn comes for leaving the steamer as we came near to bellaggio i looked up my own portmanteau and pointing to the beautiful woodcovered hill that stands at the fork of the waters told my friend greene that he was near his destination i am very glad to hear it said he complacently but he did not at the moment busy himself about the boxes then the small boat ran up alongside the steamer and the passengers for como and milan crowded up the side we have to go in that boat i said to greene nonsense he exclaimed oh but we have what put our boxes into that boat said mrs greene oh dear here boatman there are seven of these boxes all in white like this and she pointed to the one that had the hole in the canvas make haste and there are two bags and my dressing case and mr greenes portmanteau mr greene where is your portmanteau the boatman whom she addressed no doubt did not understand a word of english but nevertheless he knew what she meant and being well accustomed to the work got all the luggage together in an incredibly small number of moments if you will get down into the boat i said i will see that the luggage follows you before i leave the deck i wont stir she said till i see that box lifted down take care youll let it fall into the lake i know you will i wish they would sophonisba whispered into my ear mr greene said nothing but i could see that his eyes were as anxiously fixed on what was going on as were those of his wife at last however the three greenes were in the boat as also were all the packages then i followed them my portmanteau having gone down before me and we pushed off for bellaggio up to this period most of the attendants around us had understood a word or two of english but now it would be well if we could find some one to whose ears french would not be unfamiliar as regarded mr greene and his wife they i found must give up all conversation as they knew nothing of any language but their own sophonisba could make herself understood in french and was quite at home as she assured me in german and then the boat was beached on the shore at bellaggio and we all had to go again to work with the object of getting ourselves lodged at the hotel which overlooks the water i had learned before that the greenes were quite free from any trouble in this respect for their rooms had been taken for them before they left england trusting to this mrs greene gave herself no inconsiderable airs the moment her foot was on the shore and ordered the people about as though she were the lady paramount of bellaggio italians however are used to this from travellers of a certain description they never resent such conduct but simply put it down in the bill with the other articles mrs greenes words on this occasion were innocent enough seeing that they were english but had i been that head waiter who came down to the beach with his nice black shiny hair and his napkin under his arm i should have thought her manner very insolent indeed as it was i did think so and was inclined to be angry with her she was to remain for some time at bellaggio and therefore it behoved her as she thought to assume the character of the grand lady at once hitherto she had been willing enough to do the work but now she began to order about mr greene and sophonisba and as it appeared to me to order me about also i did not quite enjoy this so leaving her still among her luggage and satellites i walked up to the hotel to see about my own bedroom i had some seltzer water stood at the window for three or four minutes and then walked up and down the room but still the greenes were not there as i had put in at bellaggio solely with the object of seeing something more of sophonisba it would not do for me to quarrel with them or to allow them so to settle themselves in their private sittingroom that i should be excluded therefore i returned again to the road by which they must come up and met the procession near the house mrs greene was leading it with great majesty the waiter with the shiny hair walking by her side to point out to her the way then came all the luggageeach porter carrying a white canvascovered box that which was so valuable no doubt was carried next to mrs greene so that she might at a moments notice put her eye upon the wellknown valuable rent i confess that i did not observe the hole as the train passed by me nor did i count the number of the boxes seven boxes all alike are very many and then they were followed by three other men with the inferior articlesmr greenes portmanteau the carpetbag c c at the tail of the line i found mr greene and behind him sophonisba all your fatigues will be over now i said to the gentleman thinking it well not to be too particular in my attentions to his daughter he was panting beneath a terrible greatcoat having forgotten that the shores of an italian lake are not so cold as the summits of the alps and did not answer me im sure i hope so said sophonisba and i shall advise papa not to go any farther unless he can persuade mrs greene to send her jewels home sophy my dear he said for heavens sake let us have a little peace since we are here from all which i gathered that mr green had not been fortunate in his second matrimonial adventure we then made our way slowly up to the hotel having been altogether distanced by the porters and when we reached the house we found that the different packages were already being carried away through the house some this way and some that mrs green the meanwhile was talking loudly at the door of her own sittingroom mr greene she said as soon as she saw her heavily oppressed spousefor the noonday sun was upmr greene where are you here my dear and mr greene threw himself panting into the corner of a sofa a little seltzer water and brandy i suggested mr greenes inmost heart leaped at the hint and nothing that his remonstrant wife could say would induce him to move until he had enjoyed the delicious draught in the mean time the box with the hole in the canvas had been lost yes when we came to look into matters to count the packages and to find out where we were the box with the hole in the canvas was not there or at any rate mrs greene said it was not there i worked hard to look it up and even went into sophonisbas bedroom in my search in sophonisbas bedroom there was but one canvascovered box that is my own said she and it is all that i have except this bag where on earth can it be said i sitting down on the trunk in question at the moment i almost thought that she had been instrumental in hiding it how am i to know she answered and i fancied that even she was dismayed what a fool that woman is the box must be in the house i said do find it for papas sake theres a good fellow he will be so wretched without his money i heard him say that he had only two pounds in his purse oh i can let him have money to go on with i answered grandly and then i went off to prove that i was a good fellow and searched throughout the house two white boxes had by order been left downstairs as they would not be needed and these two were in a large cupboard of the hall which was used expressly for stowing away luggage and then there were three in mrs greenes bedroom which had been taken there as containing the wardrobe which she would require while remaining at bellaggio i searched every one of these myself to see if i could find the hole in the canvas but the hole in the canvas was not there and let me count as i would i could make out only six now there certainly had been seven on board the steamer though i could not swear that i had seen the seven put into the small boat mr greene said the lady standing in the middle of her remaining treasures all of which were now open you are worth nothing when travelling were you not behind but mr greenes mind was full and he did not answer it has been stolen before your very eyes she continued nonsense mamma said sophonisba if ever it came out of the steamer it certainly came into the house i saw it out of the steamer said mrs greene and it certainly is not in the house mr robinson may i trouble you to send for the policeat once if you please sir i had been at bellaggio twice before but nevertheless i was ignorant of their system of police and then again i did not know what was the italian for the word i will speak to the landlord i said if you will have the goodness to send for the police at once i will be obliged to you and as she thus reiterated her command she stamped with her foot upon the floor there are no police at bellaggio said sophonisba what on earth shall i do for money to go on with said mr greene looking piteously up to the ceiling and shaking both his hands and now the whole house was in an uproar including not only the landlord his wife and daughters and all the servants but also every other visitor at the hotel mrs greene was not a lady who hid either her glories or her griefs under a bushel and though she spoke only in english she soon made her protestations sufficiently audible she protested loudly that she had been robbed and that she had been robbed since she left the steamer the box had come on shore of that she was quite certain if the landlord had any regard either for his own character or for that of his house he would ascertain before an hour was over where it was and who had been the thief she would give him an hour and then she sat herself down but in two minutes she was up again vociferating her wrongs as loudly as ever all this was filtered through me and sophonisba to the waiter in french and from the waiter to the landlord but the ladys gestures required no translation to make them intelligible and the state of her mind on the matter was i believe perfectly well understood mr greene i really did pity his feelings of dismay seemed to be quite as deep but his sorrow and solicitude were repressed into more decorum what am i to do for money he said i have not a shilling to go on with and he still looked up at the ceiling you must send to england said sophonisba it will take a month he replied mr robinson will let you have what you want at present added sophonisba now i certainly had said so and had meant it at the time but my whole travelling store did not exceed forty or fifty pounds with which i was going on to venice and then back to england through the tyrol waiting a month for mr greenes money from england might be even more inconvenient to me than to him then it occurred to me that the wants of the greene family would be numerous and expensive and that my small stock would go but a little way among so many and what also if there had been no money and no jewels in that accursed box i confess that at the moment such an idea did strike my mind one hears of sharpers on every side committing depredations by means of most singular intrigues and contrivances might it not be possible that the whole batch of greenes belonged to this order of society it was a base idea i own but i confess that i entertained it for a moment i retired to my own room for a while that i might think over all the circumstances there certainly had been seven boxes and one had had a hole in the canvas all the seven had certainly been on board the steamer to so much i felt that i might safely swear i had not counted the seven into the small boat but on leaving the larger vessel i had looked about the deck to see that none of the greene trappings were forgotten if left on the steamer it had been so left through an intent on the part of some one there employed it was quite possible that the contents of the box had been ascertained through the imprudence of mrs greene and that it had been conveyed away so that it might be rifled at como as to mrs greenes assertion that all the boxes had been put into the small boat i thought nothing of it the people at bellaggio could not have known which box to steal nor had there been time to concoct the plan in carrying the boxes up to the hotel i came at last to this conclusion that the missing trunk had either been purloined and carried on to comoin which case it would be necessary to lose no time in going after it or that it had been put out of sight in some uncommonly clever way by the greenes themselves as an excuse for borrowing as much money as they could raise and living without payment of their bills with reference to the latter hypothesis i declared to myself that greene did not look like a swindler but as to mrs greene i confess that i did not feel so confident in regard to her charity begins at home so i proceeded to make myself comfortable in my room feeling almost certain that i should not be able to leave bellaggio on the following morning i had opened my portmanteau when i first arrived leaving it open on the floor as is my wont some people are always being robbed and are always locking up everything while others wander safe over the world and never lock up anything for myself i never turn a key anywhere and no one ever purloins from me even a handkerchief cantabit vacuus and i am always sufficiently vacuus perhaps it is that i have not a handkerchief worth the stealing it is your heavyladen suspicious maladroit greenes that the thieves attack i now found out that the accommodating boots who already knew my ways had taken my travelling gear into a dark recess which was intended to do for a dressingroom and had there spread my portmanteau open upon some table or stool in the corner it was a convenient arrangement and there i left it during the whole period of my sojourn mrs greene had given the landlord an hour to find the box and during that time the landlord the landlady their three daughters and all the servants in the house certainly did exert themselves to the utmost half a dozen times they came to my door but i was luxuriating in a washingtub making up for that fouroclock start from chiavenna i assured them however that the box was not there and so the search passed by at the end of the hour i went back to the greenes according to promise having resolved that some one must be sent on to como to look after the missing article there was no necessity to knock at their sittingroom door for it was wide open i walked in and found mrs greene still engaged in attacking the landlord while all the porters who had carried the luggage up to the house were standing round her voice was loud above the others but luckily for them all she was speaking english the landlord i saw was becoming sulky he spoke in italian and we none of us understood him but i gathered that he was declining to do anything further the box he was certain had never come out of the steamer the boots stood by interpreting into french and acting as second interpreter i put it into english mr greene who was seated on the sofa groaned audibly but said nothing sophonisba who was sitting by him beat upon the floor with both her feet do you hear mr greene said she turning to him do you mean to allow that vast amount of property to be lost without an effort are you prepared to replace my jewels her jewels said sophonisba looking up into my face papa had to pay the bill for every stitch she had when he married her these last words were so spoken as to be audible only by me but her first exclamation was loud enough were they people for whom it would be worth my while to delay my journey and put myself to serious inconvenience with reference to money a few minutes afterwards i found myself with greene on the terrace before the house what ought i to do said he go to como said i and look after your box i will remain here and go on board the return steamer it may perhaps be there but i cant speak a word of italian said he take the boots said i but i cant speak a word of french and then it ended in my undertaking to go to como i swear that the thought struck me that i might as well take my portmanteau with me and cut and run when i got there the greenes were nothing to me i did not however do this i made the poor man a promise and i kept it i took merely a dressingbag for i knew that i must sleep at como and thus resolving to disarrange all my plans i started i was in the midst of beautiful scenery but i found it quite impossible to draw any enjoyment from itfrom that or from anything around me my whole mind was given up to anathemas against this odious box as to which i had undoubtedly heavy cause of complaint what was the box to me i went to como by the afternoon steamer and spent a long dreary evening down on the steamboat quays searching everywhere and searching in vain the boat by which we had left colico had gone back to colico but the people swore that nothing had been left on board it it was just possible that such a box might have gone on to milan with the luggage of other passengers i slept at como and on the following morning i went on to milan there was no trace of the box to be found in that city i went round to every hotel and travelling office but could hear nothing of it parties had gone to venice and florence and bologna and any of them might have taken the box no one however remembered it and i returned back to como and thence to bellaggio reaching the latter place at nine in the evening disappointed weary and cross has monsieur found the accursed trunk said the bellaggio boots meeting me on the quay in the name of the no has it not turned up here monsieur said the boots we shall all be mad soon the poor master he is mad already and then i went up to the house my jewels shouted mrs greene rushing to me with her arms stretched out as soon as she heard my step in the corridor i am sure that she would have embraced me had i found the box i had not however earned any such reward i can hear nothing of the box either at como or milan i said then what on earth am i to do for my money said mr greene i had had neither dinner nor supper but the elder greenes did not care for that mr greene sat silent in despair and mrs greene stormed about the room in her anger i am afraid you are very tired said sophonisba i am tired and hungry and thirsty said i i was beginning to get angry and to think myself ill used and that idea as to a family of swindlers became strong again greene had borrowed ten napoleons from me before i started for como and i had spent above four in my fruitless journey to that place and milan i was beginning to fear that my whole purpose as to venice and the tyrol would be destroyed and i had promised to meet friends at innspruck whowho were very much preferable to the greenes as events turned out i did meet them had i failed in this the present mrs robinson would not have been sitting opposite to me i went to my room and dressed myself and then sophonisba presided over the teatable for me what are we to do she asked me in a confidential whisper wait for money from england but they will think we are all sharpers she said and upon my word i do not wonder at it from the way in which that woman goes on she then leaned forward resting her elbow on the table and her face on her hand and told me a long history of all their family discomforts her papa was a very good sort of man only he had been made a fool of by that intriguing woman who had been left without a sixpence with which to bless herself and now they had nothing but quarrels and misery papa did not always got the worst of itpapa could rouse himself sometimes only now he was beaten down and cowed by the loss of his money this whispering confidence was very nice in its way seeing that sophonisba was a pretty girl but the whole matter seemed to be full of suspicion if they did not want to take you in in one way they did in another said the present mrs robinson when i told the story to her at innspruck i beg that it may be understood that at the time of my meeting the greenes i was not engaged to the present mrs robinson and was open to make any matrimonial engagement that might have been pleasing to me on the next morning after breakfast we held a council of war i had been informed that mr greene had made a fortune and was justified in presuming him to be a rich man it seemed to me therefore that his course was easy let him wait at bellaggio for more money and when he returned home let him buy mrs greene more jewels a poor man always presumes that a rich man is indifferent about his money but in truth a rich man never is indifferent about his money and poor greene looked very blank at my proposition do you mean to say that its gone for ever he asked ill not leave the country without knowing more about it said mrs greene it certainly is very odd said sophonisba even sophonisba seemed to think that i was too offhand it will be a month before i can get money and my bill here will be something tremendous said greene i wouldnt pay them a farthing till i got my box said mrs greene thats nonsense said sophonisba and so it was hold your tongue miss said the stepmother indeed i shall not hold my tongue said the stepdaughter poor greene he had lost more than his box within the last twelve months for as i had learned in that whispered conversation over the teatable with sophonisba this was in reality her papas marriage trip another day was now gone and we all went to bed had i not been very foolish i should have had myself called at five in the morning and have gone away by the early boat leaving my ten napoleons behind me but unfortunately sophonisba had exacted a promise from me that i would not do this and thus all chance of spending a day or two in venice was lost to me moreover i was thoroughly fatigued and almost glad of any excuse which would allow me to lie in bed on the following morning i did lie in bed till nine oclock and then found the greenes at breakfast let us go and look at the serbelloni gardens said i as soon as the silent meal was over or take a boat over to the sommariva villa i should like it so much said sophonisba we will do nothing of the kind till i have found my property said mrs greene mr robinson what arrangement did you make yesterday with the police at como the police at como i said i did not go to the police not go to the police and do you mean to say that i am to be robbed of my jewels and no efforts made for redress is there no such thing as a constable in this wretched country mr greene i do insist upon it that you at once go to the nearest british consul i suppose i had better write home for money said he and do you mean to say that you havent written yet said i probably with some acrimony in my voice you neednt scold papa said sophonisba i dont know what i am to do said mr greene and he began walking up and down the room but still he did not call for pen and ink and i began again to feel that he was a swindler was it possible that a man of business who had made his fortune in london should allow his wife to keep all her jewels in a box and carry about his own money in the same i dont see why you need be so very unhappy papa said sophonisba mr robinson im sure will let you have whatever money you may want at present this was pleasant and will mr robinson return me my jewels which were lost i must say in a great measure through his carelessness said mrs greene this was pleasanter upon my word mrs greene i must deny that said i jumping up what on earth could i have done more than i did do i have been to milan and nearly fagged myself to death why didnt you bring a policeman back with you you would tell everybody on board the boat what there was in it said i i told nobody but you she answered i suppose you mean to imply that ive taken the box i rejoined so that on this the third or fourth day of our acquaintance we did not go on together quite pleasantly but what annoyed me perhaps the most was the confidence with which it seemed to be mr greenes intention to lean upon my resources he certainly had not written home yet and had taken my ten napoleons as one friend may take a few shillings from another when he finds that he has left his own silver on his dressingtable what could he have wanted of ten napoleons he had alleged the necessity of paying the porters but the few francs he had had in his pocket would have been enough for that and now sophonisba was ever and again prompt in her assurances that he need not annoy himself about money because i was at his right hand i went upstairs into my own room and counting all my treasures found that thirtysix pounds and some odd silver was the extent of my wealth with that i had to go at any rate as far as innspruck and from thence back to london it was quite impossible that i should make myself responsible for the greenes bill at bellaggio we dined early and after dinner according to a promise made in the morning sophonisba ascended with me into the serbelloni gardens and walked round the terraces on that beautiful hill which commands the view of the three lakes when we started i confess that i would sooner have gone alone for i was sick of the greenes in my very soul we had had a terrible day the landlord had been sent for so often that he refused to show himself again the landladythough italians of that class are always courteoushad been so driven that she snapped her fingers in mrs greenes face the three girls would not show themselves the waiters kept out of the way as much as possible and the boots in confidence abused them to me behind their back monsieur said the boots do you think there ever was such a box perhaps not said i and yet i knew that i had seen it i would therefore have preferred to walk without sophonisba but that now was impossible so i determined that i would utilise the occasion by telling her of my present purpose i had resolved to start on the following day and it was now necessary to make my friends understand that it was not in my power to extend to them any further pecuniary assistance sophonisba when we were on the hill seemed to have forgotten the box and to be willing that i should forget it also but this was impossible when therefore she told me how sweet it was to escape from that terrible woman and leaned on my arm with all the freedom of old acquaintance i was obliged to cut short the pleasure of the moment i hope your father has written that letter said i he means to write it from milan we know you want to get on so we purpose to leave here the day after tomorrow oh said i thinking of the bill immediately and remembering that mrs greene had insisted on having champagne for dinner and if anything more is to be done about the nasty box it may be done there continued sophonisba but i must go tomorrow said i at am nonsense said sophonisba go tomorrow when ii mean weare going on the next day and i might as well explain said i gently dropping the hand that was on my arm that i findi find it will be impossible for metoto to what to advance mr greene any more money just at present then sophonisbas arm dropped all at once and she exclaimed oh mr robinson after all there was a certain hard good sense about miss greene which would have protected her from my evil thoughts had i known all the truth i found out afterwards that she was a considerable heiress and in spite of the opinion expressed by the present mrs robinson when miss walker i do not for a moment think she would have accepted me had i offered to her you are quite right not to embarrass yourself she said when i explained to her my immediate circumstances but why did you make papa an offer which you cannot perform he must remain here now till he hears from england had you explained it all at first the ten napoleons would have carried us to milan this was all true and yet i thought it hard upon me it was evident to me now that sophonisba was prepared to join her stepmother in thinking that i had illtreated them and i had not much doubt that i should find mr greene to be of the same opinion there was very little more said between us during the walk and when we reached the hotel at seven or halfpast seven oclock i merely remarked that i would go in and wish her father and mother goodbye i suppose you will drink tea with us said sophonisba and to this i assented i went into my own room and put all my things into my portmanteau for according to the custom which is invariable in italy when an early start is premeditated the boots was imperative in his demand that the luggage should be ready over night i then went to the greenes sittingroom and found that the whole party was now aware of my intentions so you are going to desert us said mrs greene i must go on upon my journey i pleaded in a weak apologetic voice go on upon your journey sir said mrs greene i would not for a moment have you put yourself to inconvenience on our account and yet i had already lost fourteen napoleons and given up all prospect of going to venice mr robinson is certainly right not to break his engagement with miss walker said sophonisba now i had said not a word about an engagement with miss walker having only mentioned incidentally that she would be one of the party at innspruck but continued she i think he should not have misled us and in this way we enjoyed our evening meal i was just about to shake hands with them all previous to my final departure from their presence when the boots came into the room ill leave the portmanteau till tomorrow morning said he all right said i because said he there will be such a crowd of things in the hall the big trunk i will take away now big trunkwhat big trunk the trunk with your rug over it on which your portmanteau stood i looked round at mr mrs and miss greene and saw that they were all looking at me i looked round at them and as their eyes met mine i felt that i turned as red as fire i immediately jumped up and rushed away to my own room hearing as i went that all their steps were following me i rushed to the inner recess pulled down the portmanteau which still remained in its old place tore away my own carpet rug which covered the support beneath it and there sawa white canvascovered box with a hole in the canvas on the side next to me it is my box said mrs greene pushing me away as she hurried up and put her finger within the rent it certainly does look like it said mr greene peering over his wifes shoulder theres no doubt about the box said sophonisba not the least in life said i trying to assume an indifferent look mon dieu said the boots corpo di baccho exclaimed the landlord who had now joined the party ohhhh screamed mrs greene and then she threw herself back on to my bed and shrieked hysterically there was no doubt whatsoever about the fact there was the lost box and there it had been during all those tedious hours of unavailing search while i was suffering all that fatigue in milan spending my precious zwanzigers in driving about from one hotel to another the box had been safe standing in my own room at bellaggio hidden by my own rug and now that it was found everybody looked at me as though it were all my fault mrs greenes eyes when she had done being hysterical were terrible and sophonisba looked at me as though i were a convicted thief who put the box here i said turning fiercely upon the boots i did said the boots by monsieurs express order by my order i exclaimed certainly said the boots corpo di baccho said the landlord and he also looked at me as though i were a thief in the mean time the landlady and the three daughters had clustered round mrs greene administering to her all manner of italian consolation the box and the money and the jewels were after all a reality and much incivility can be forgiven to a lady who has really lost her jewels and has really found them again there and then there arose a hurlyburly among us as to the manner in which the odious trunk found its way into my room had anybody been just enough to consider the matter coolly it must have been quite clear that i could not have ordered it there when i entered the hotel the boxes were already being lugged about and i had spoken a word to no one concerning them that traitorous boots had done itno doubt without malice prepense but he had done it and now that the greenes were once more known as moneyed people he turned upon me and told me to my face that i had desired that box to be taken to my own room as part of my own luggage my dear said mr greene turning to his wife you should never mention the contents of your luggage to any one i never will again said mrs greene with a mock repentant air but i really thought one never can be sure of sharpers said mr greene thats true said mrs greene after all it may have been accidental said sophonisba on hearing which goodnatured surmise both papa and mamma greene shook their suspicious heads i was resolved to say nothing then it was all but impossible that they should really think that i had intended to steal their box nor if they did think so would it have become me to vindicate myself before the landlord and all his servants i stood by therefore in silence while two of the men raised the trunk and joined the procession which followed it as it was carried out of my room into that of the legitimate owner everybody in the house was there by that time and mrs greene enjoying the triumph by no means grudged them the entrance into her sittingroom she had felt that she was suspected and now she was determined that the world of bellaggio should know how much she was above suspicion the box was put down upon two chairs the supporters who had borne it retiring a pace each mrs greene then advanced proudly with the selected key and mr greene stood by at her right shoulder ready to receive his portion of the hidden treasure sophonisba was now indifferent and threw herself on the sofa while i walked up and down the room thoughtfullymeditating what words i should say when i took my last farewell of the greenes but as i walked i could see what occurred mrs greene opened the box and displayed to view the ample folds of a huge yellow woollen dressinggown i could fancy that she would not willingly have exhibited this article of her toilet had she not felt that its existence would speedily be merged in the presence of the glories which were to follow this had merely been the padding at the top of the box under that lay a long papiermach case and in that were all her treasures ah they are safe she said opening the lid and looking upon her tawdry pearls and carbuncles mr greene in the mean time well knowing the passage for his hand had dived down to the very bottom of the box and seized hold of a small canvas bag it is here said he dragging it up and as far as i can tell as yet the knot has not been untied whereupon he sat himself down by sophonisba and employing her to assist him in holding them began to count his rolls they are all right said he and he wiped the perspiration from his brow i had not yet made up my mind in what manner i might best utter my last words among them so as to maintain the dignity of my character and now i was standing over against mr greene with my arms folded on my breast i had on my face a frown of displeasure which i am able to assume upon occasions but i had not yet determined what words i would use after all perhaps it might be as well that i should leave them without any last words greene my dear said the lady pay the gentleman his ten napoleons oh yes certainly whereupon mr greene undid one of the rolls and extracted eight sovereigns i believe that will make it right sir said he handing them to me i took the gold slipped it with an indifferent air into my waistcoat pocket and then refolded my arms across my breast papa said sophonisba in a very audible whisper mr robinson went for you to como indeed i believe he says he went to milan do not let that be mentioned said i by all means pay him his expenses said mrs greene i would not owe him anything for worlds he should be paid said sophonisba oh certainly said mr greene and he at once extracted another sovereign and tendered it to me in the face of the assembled multitude this was too much mr greene said i i intended to be of service to you when i went to milan and you are very welcome to the benefit of my intentions the expense of that journey whatever may be its amount is my own affair and i remained standing with my closed arms we will be under no obligation to him said mrs greene and i shall insist on his taking the money the servant will put it on his dressingtable said sophonisba and she handed the sovereign to the boots giving him instructions keep it yourself antonio i said whereupon the man chucked it to the ceiling with his thumb caught it as it fell and with a wellsatisfied air dropped it into the recesses of his pocket the air of the greenes was also well satisfied for they felt that they had paid me in full for all my services and now with many obsequious bows and assurances of deep respect the landlord and his family withdrew from the room was there anything else they could do for mrs greene mrs greene was all affability she had shown her jewels to the girls and allowed them to express their admiration in pretty italian superlatives there was nothing else she wanted tonight she was very happy and liked bellaggio she would stay yet a week and would make herself quite happy and though none of them understood a word that the other said each understood that things were now rosecoloured and so with scrapings bows and grinning smiles the landlord and all his myrmidons withdrew mr greene was still counting his money sovereign by sovereign and i was still standing with my folded arms upon my bosom i believe i may now go said i good night said mrs greene adieu said sophonisba i have the pleasure of wishing you goodbye said mr greene and then i walked out of the room after all what was the use of saying anything and what could i say that would have done me any service if they were capable of thinking me a thiefwhich they certainly didnothing that i could say would remove the impression nor as i thought was it suitable that i should defend myself from such an imputation what were the greenes to me so i walked slowly out of the room and never again saw one of the family from that day to this as i stood upon the beach the next morning while my portmanteau was being handed into the boat i gave the boots five zwanzigers i was determined to show him that i did not condescend to feel anger against him he took the money looked into my face and then whispered to me why did you not give me a word of notice beforehand he said and winked his eye he was evidently a thief and took me to be anotherbut what did it matter i went thence to milan in which city i had no heart to look at anything thence to verona and so over the pass of the brenner to innspruck when i once found myself near to my dear friends the walkers i was again a happy man and i may safely declare that though a portion of my journey was so troublesome and unfortunate i look back upon that tour as the happiest and the luckiest epoch of my life the end london w h smith and son printers
