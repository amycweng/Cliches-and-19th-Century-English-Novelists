gryll grange by thomas love peacock illustration minuet de la cour illustration titlepage gryll grange by thomas love peacock illustrated by f h townsend with an introduction by george saintsbury london macmillan and co ltd new york macmillan co introduction gryll grange the last and mellowest fruit from peacocks tree was like most mellow fruit not matured hastily in saying this i do not refer to the long periodexactly a generation in the conventional sensewhich intervened between crotchet castle of and this of for we know as a matter of fact from the preface to the edition of melincourt that peacock was planning gryll grange at a time considerably nearer to but still some years from its actual publication there might perhaps have been room for fear lest such a proceeding on the part of a man of seventyfive who was living in retirement should result in an illdigested mass of detail tempered or rather distempered by the grumbling of old age and exhibiting the marks of failing powers no anticipation could have been more happily falsified the advance in good temper of gryll grange even upon crotchet castle itself is denied by no one the book though long for its author is not in the least overloaded and no signs of failure have ever been detected in it except by those who upbraid the still further severance between the line of peacocks thought and the line of what is vulgarly accounted progress and who almost openly impute decay to powers no longer used on their side but against them the only plausible pretext for this insinuation is that very advance in mildness and mellowness which has been notedthat comparative absence of the sharper and cruder strokes of the earlier work but since the wit is as bright as ever though less hard it seems unreasonable to impute as a defect what but for very obvious reasons would be admitted as an improvement except brougham who still comes in for some severe language no one of peacocks old favourite abominations undergoes personal chastisement on the contrary indirect but pretty distinct apology is tendered to wordsworth southey and coleridge by appreciative citation of their work even among the general victims scotchmen and political economists have a still more direct olivebranch extended to them by the introduction of the personage of mr macborrowdale there is no more blasphemy of scott and i do not at the present moment remember any very distinct slaps at paper money peace had been made long ago with the church of england through the powerful medium of dr folliott but it is ratified and cemented anew here not merely by the presentation of dr opimian but in rather an odd fashion perhaps by the trait of falconers devotion to st catharine so also as the fair hand of lady clarinda despite some hard knocks administered to her father and brother had beckoned peacock away from his cutanddried satire of the aristocracy so now lord curryfin exhibits a further stage of reconciliation in short all those elements of society to which very young men not wanting either in brains or heart often take crude and fanciful objection had by this time approved themselves as they always do with the rarest exceptions to les mes bien nes at worst graceful if unnecessary ornaments to life at best valuable to the social fabric as solid and all but indispensable buttresses of it in all these reconciliations and forgivenesses of injuries however it is very important to observe that there is no mawkishness and whatever may have been sometimes thought and said there is no ratting in the real sense as must be obvious to any attentive reader of the novels and as has been pointed out once or twice before in these introductions peacock had at no time been anything like an enrolled much less a convinced member of the radical or any party he may have been a republican in his youth though for my part i should like more trustworthy evidence for it than that of thomas jefferson hogg a very clever but a distinctly unscrupulous person if he wasand it is not at all improbable that he had the republican measles a very common disease of youth pretty earlyhe certainly had never been a democrat even his earlier satire is doubleedged and as must be constantly repeated and remembered it was always his taste and his endeavour to shoot folly as it flew to attack existent and not extinct forms of popular or fashionable delusion such follies whether in or since have certainly not as a rule been of the aristocratic monarchical or tory order generally he found plenty of these follies however in the other kindthe kind which he had begun to satirise smartly in crotchet castleand he showed pretty decisively that his hand had not lost its cunning nor his sword its sharpness the satire though partly is not mainly political and it is an interesting detail though it only refreshes the memory of those who knew the facts then or have studied them since that barely she years before a far more sweeping reform than that of a very acute judge who disliked and resisted it spoke of another reform lunacy as not likely to arise in his time and these words it must be remembered are put in the mouth of mr macborrowdale who is represented as merely middleaged it is fortunate however for the interest of gryll grange that politics in the strict sense occupy so small a part of it for of all subjects they lose interest first to all but a very select number of readers the bulk of the satiric comment of the book is devoted either to purely social matters or to the debateable land between these and politics proper a little but not very much of this is obsolete or obsolescent american slavery is no more and the pantopragmatic society in official language the social science congress has ceased to exist as a single recognised institution but there is not much about slavery here and if pantopragmatics have lost their special society they flourish more than ever as a general and fashionable subject of human attention you shall not open a number of the times twice perhaps not once in a week without finding columns of debate harangue or letterwriting purely pantopragmatical still more is this the case with another subject which has even more attention and on which what some think the central and golden sentence of the book is laid down by dr opimian in the oftenquoted words if all the nonsense which in the last quarter of a century it is appalling to think that this quarter is getting on for threequarters now has been talked on all other subjects were thrown into one scale and all that has been talked on the subject of education alone were thrown into the other i think the latter would preponderate indeed it cannot be said that after nearly fiveandthirty years up to and including the present moment during which competitive examination has been a field of battle much has been added to peacocks attack on it or anything said on the other side to weaken the cogency of that attack no doubt he was to some extent a prejudiced judge for though few people would at any time of his youth have had less to fear from competitive examination his own fortune had been made by the opposite system and the competitive scheme must infallibly tend rather to exclude than to admit persons like him but a wise criticism does not ask cut bone in cases of argument it simply looks to see whether the advocacy is sound not whether the advocate has received or expects his fee and peacocks advocacy is here not merely sound it is in so far as it goes inexpugnable it is true there is a still more irrefragable rejoinder to it which has kept competition safe hitherto though for obvious reasons it will very rarely be found openly expressed by the defenders of the system and that is that under the popular jealousy resulting from wide or universal suffrage there is no alternative but competitive examination or else the american system of alternating spoils to the victors which is demonstrably worse for the public and not demonstrably much better for private interests as for tableturning and lectures and the excess of hurrying about and siberian dinners and so forth they are certainly not dead tableturning may have changed its name the others have not even adopted the wellknown expedient of the alias but appear just as they were thirty years ago in the social and satiric dictionaries of today it would be odd if this comparative freshness and actuality of subject did not make gryll grange one of the lightest and brightest of peacocks novels and i think it fully deserves that description but it would be doing it extremely scant justice to allow any one to suppose that its attractions consist solely or even mainly in valuable thoughts and expressions of sense satire and scholarship to combine wordsworth with warrington in lighter respects in respects of form and movement and it is absolutely impossible that he should have been an evangelical we must not dismiss without some special mention the episodethough it is not properly an episode inasmuch as it has throughout an important connection with the working of the storyof aristophanes in london this has sometimes been adversely criticised as not sufficiently antiquewhich seems to overlook the obvious retort that if it had been more so it could not by any possibility have been sufficiently modern those who know something of aristophanes and something of london may doubt whether it could have established the nexus much better i have elsewhere pointed out the curious connection with mansels phrontisterion which was considerably earlier in date and with the sentiments of which peacock would have been in the heartiest agreement but it is extremely unlikely that he ever saw it his antipathy to the english universities appears to have been one of the most enduring of his crazes probably because it was always the most unreasonable and though there is no active renewal of hostilities in this novel or none of importance it is noticeable there is also no direct or indirect palinode as there is in most other cases as for the play itself it seems to me very good miss gryll must have looked delightful as circe we get a more distinct description of her personality here than anywhere else gryllus has an excellent standpoint and the dialogue though unequal is quite admirable at the best indeed there is a gilbertian tone about the whole piece which i should be rather more surprised at being the first to note so far as i know if i were not pretty well prepared to find that the study of the average dramatic critic is not much in peacock the choric trochees which by the way is a tautology are of the highest excellence especially the piece beginning as before the pike will fly in which coeurdelions discomfiture of the septemvirate of quacks is hymned and the finale is quite attic i do not know whether the thing has ever been attempted as an actual show though rather exacting in its machinery it ought to have been the novel is rather full of other verse but except love and ageso often mentioned but never to be mentioned enough for its strange and admirable commixture of sense and sentiment of knowledge of the heart and knowledge of lifethis is not of the first class for peacock certainly not worthy to be ranked with the play the death of philemon is indeed a beautiful piece in its first half the second were better cut the dappled palfrey a very charming fabliau in the original chiefly suggests the superiority of lochinvar to which it is a sort of counterpart and complement the new order of chivalry with a good deal of truth has also a good deal of illiberality and amusing as it is is a relapse into peacocks old vein of almost insolent personality sir moses montefiore and sir jamsetjee jejeebhoy did not deserve though they might afford to despise the sort of cheap rallying here applied to them and might have retaliated not without point on persons who drew large salaries at the india house with frequent additional gratifications and stood up for chivalry in their leisure moments and the legend of st laura is not first rate but the italian translations make us wish for more of the same on the whole however though we may like some things more and some less here i cannot conceive the whole being otherwise than delightful to any person of knowledge sense and taste and as we close peacocks novels there is this interesting though rather melancholy thought that we close the book in more senses than one they have never been imitated save afar off and even the faroff imitations have not been very satisfactory the english muse seems to have set at the joining of the old and new ages this one person with the learning and tastes of the ancestors with the irreverent criticism of the moderns to comment on the transition and having fashioned him to have broken the mould george saintsbury contents

the new forest is always mentioned as if it were still unenclosed this is the only state in which the author has been acquainted with it since its enclosure he has never seen it and purposes never to do so the mottoes are sometimes specially apposite to the chapters to which they are prefixed but more frequently to the general scope or to borrow a musical term the motivo of the operetta chapter i misnomers ego sic semper et ubique vixi ut ultimam quamque lucem taraquam non redituram consumerempetronius arbiter always and everywhere i have so lived that i might consume the passing light as if it were not to return palestine soup said the reverend doctor opimian dining with his friend squire gryll a curiously complicated misnomer we have an excellent old vegetable the artichoke of which we eat the head we have another of subsequent introduction of which we eat the root and which we also call artichoke because it resembles the first in flavour although me judice a very inferior affair this last is a species of the helianthus or sunflower genus of the syngenesia frustranea class of plants it is therefore a girasol or turntothesun from this girasol we have made jerusalem and from the jerusalem artichoke we make palestine soup mr gryll a very good thing doctor the rev dr opimian a very good thing but a palpable misnomer mr gryll i am afraid we live in a world of misnomers and of a worse kind than this in my little experience i have found that a gang of swindling bankers is a respectable old firm that men who sell their votes to the highest bidder and want only the protection of the ballot to sell the promise of them to both parties are a free and independent constituency that a man who successively betrays everybody that trusts him and abandons every principle he ever professed is a great statesman and a conservative forsooth a nil conservando that schemes for breeding pestilence are sanitary improvements that the test of intellectual capacity is in swallow and not in digestion that the art of teaching everything except what will be of use to the recipient is national education and that a change for the worse is reform look across the atlantic a sympathiser would seem to imply a certain degree of benevolent feeling nothing of the kind it signifies a readymade accomplice in any species of political villainy a knownothing would seem to imply a liberal selfdiffidenceon the scriptural principle that the beginning of knowledge is to know that thou art ignorant no such thing it implies furious political dogmatism enforced by bludgeons and revolvers a locofoco is the only intelligible term a fellow that would set any place on fire to roast his own eggs a filibuster is a pirate under national colours but i suppose the word in its origin implies something virtuous perhaps a friend of humanity the rev dr opimian more likely a friend of roaringgreek phrasein the sense in which roaring is used by our old dramatists for which see middletons roaring girl and the commentators thereon mr gryll while we are on the subject of misnomers what say you to the wisdom of parliament the rev dr opimian why sir i do not call that a misnomer the term wisdom is used in a parliamentary sense the wisdom of parliament is a wisdom sui generis it is not like any other wisdom it is not the wisdom of socrates nor the wisdom of solomon it is the wisdom of parliament it is not easily analysed or defined but it is very easily understood it has achieved wonderful things by itself and still more when science has come to its aid between them they have poisoned the thames and killed the fish in the river a little further development of the same wisdom and science will complete the poisoning of the air and kill the dwellers on the banks it is pleasant that the precious effluvium has been brought so efficiently under the wisdoms own wise nose thereat the nose like trinculos has been in great indignation the wisdom has ordered the science to do something the wisdom does not know what nor the science either but the wisdom has empowered the science to spend some millions of money and this no doubt the science will do when the money has been spent it will be found that the something has been worse than nothing the science will want more money to do some other something and the wisdom will grant it redit labor actus in orbem but you have got on moral and political ground my remark was merely on a perversion of words of which we have an inexhaustible catalogue mr gryll whatever ground we take doctor there is one point common to most of these cases the word presents an idea which does not belong to the subject critically considered palestine soup is not more remote from the true jerusalem than many an honourable friend from public honesty and honour however doctor what say you to a glass of old madeira which i really believe is what it is called the rev dr opimian in vino veritas i accept with pleasure miss gryll you and my uncle doctor get up a discussion on everything that presents itself dealing with your theme like a series of variations in music you have run half round the world propos of the soup what say you to the fish the labour returns compelled into a circle the rev dr opimian premising that this is a remarkably fine slice of salmon there is much to be said about fish but not in the way of misnomers their names are single and simple perch sole cod eel carp char skate tench trout brill bream pike and many others plain monosyllables salmon dory turbot gudgeon lobster whitebait grayling haddock mullet herring oyster sturgeon flounder turtle plain dissyllables only two trisyllables worth naming anchovy and mackerel unless any one should be disposed to stand up for halibut which for my part i have excommunicated mr gryll i agree with you on that point but i think you have named one or two that might as well keep it company the rev dr opimian i do not think i have named a single unpresentable fish mr gryll bream doctor there is not much to be said for bream the rev dr opimian on the contrary sir i think there is much to be said for him in the first place there is the authority of the monastic brotherhoods who are universally admitted to have been connoisseurs in fish and in the mode of preparing it and you will find bream pie set down as a prominent item of luxurious living in the indictments prepared against them at the dissolution of the monasteries the work of destruction was rather too rapid and i fear the receipt is lost but he can still be served up as an excellent stew provided always that he is fullgrown and has swum all his life in clear running water i call everything fish that seas lakes and rivers furnish to cookery though scientifically a turtle is a reptile and a lobster an insect fish miss grylli could discourse to you on fish by the hour but for the present i will forbear as lord curryfin is coming down to thornback bay to lecture the fishermen on fish and fisheries and to astonish them all with the science of their art you will no doubt be curious to hear him there will be some reserved seats miss gryll i shall be very curious to hear him indeed i have never heard a lecturing lord the fancy of lords and gentlemen to lecture everybody on everything everywhere seems to me something very comical but perhaps it is something very serious gracious in the lecturer and instructive to the audience i shall be glad to be cured of my unbecoming propensity to laugh whenever i hear of a lecturing lord the rev dr opimian i hope miss gryll you will not laugh at lord curryfin for you may be assured nothing will be farther from his lordships intention than to say anything in the slightest degree droll mr gryll doctor johnson was astonished at the mania for lectures even in his day when there were no lecturing lords he thought little was to be learned from lectures unless where as in chemistry the subject required illustration by experiment now if your lord is going to exhibit experiments in the art of cooking fish with specimens in sufficient number for all his audience to taste i have no doubt his lecture will be well attended and a repetition earnestly desired the rev dr opimian i am afraid the lecture will not have the aid of such pleasant adventitious attractions it will be a pure scientific exposition carefully classified under the several divisions and subdivisions of ichthyology entomology herpetology and conchology but i agree with doctor johnson that little is to be learned from lectures for the most part those who do not already understand the subject will not understand the lecture and those who do will learn nothing from it the latter will hear many things they would like to contradict which the biensance of the lectureroom does not allow i do not comprehend how people can find amusement in lectures i should much prefer a tenson of the twelfth century when two or three masters of the gai saber discussed questions of love and chivalry miss gryll i am afraid doctor our age is too prosy for that sort of thing we have neither wit enough nor poetry enough to furnish the disputants i can conceive a state of society in which such tensons would form a pleasant winter evening amusement but that state of society is not ours the rev dr opimian well miss gryll i should like some winter evening to challenge you to a tenson and your uncle should be umpire i think you have wit enough by nature and i have poetry enough by memory to supply a fair portion of the requisite materials without assuming an absolute mastery of the gai saber miss gryll i shall accept the challenge doctor the wit on one side will i am afraid be very shortcoming but the poetry on the other will no doubt be abundant mr gryll suppose doctor you were to get up a tenson a little more relative to our own wise days spiritrapping for example is a fine field nec pueri credunt sed tu vera puta you might go beyond the limits of a tenson there is ample scope for an aristophanic comedy in the contest between the just and the unjust in the clouds and in other scenes of aristophanes you have ancient specimens of something very like tensons except that love has not much share in them let us for a moment suppose this same spiritrapping to be truedramatically so at least let us fit up a stage for the purpose make the invoked spirits visible as well as audible and calling before us some of the illustrious of former days ask them what they think of us and our doings of our astounding progress of intellect our march of mind our higher tone of morality our vast diffusion of education our art of choosing the most unfit man by competitive examination not even boys believe it but suppose it to be true the rev dr opimian you had better not bring on many of them at once nor ask many similar questions or the chorus of ghostly laughter will be overwhelming i imagine the answer would be something like hamlets you yourselves sirs shall be as wise as we were if like crabs you could go backward it is thought something wonderful that uneducated persons should believe in witchcraft in the nineteenth century as if educated persons did not believe in grosser follies such as this same spiritrapping unknown tongues clairvoyance tableturning and all sorts of fanatical impositions having for the present their climax in mormonism herein all times are alike there is nothing too monstrous for human credulity i like the notion of the aristophanic comedy but it would require a numerous company especially as the chorus is indispensable the tenson may be carried on by two mr gryll i do not see why we should not have both miss gryll oh pray doctor let us have the comedy we hope to have a houseful at christmas and i think we may get it up well chorus and all i should so like to hear what my great ancestor gryllus thinks of us and homer and dante and shakespeare and richard the first and oliver cromwell the rev dr opimian a very good dramatis personae with these and the help of one or two athenians and romans we may arrive at a tolerable judgment on our own immeasurable superiority to everything that has gone before us before we proceed further we will give some account of our interlocutors chapter ii the squire and his niece fortuna spondet multa multis prestat nemini vive in dies et horas nam proprium est nihil marmor vetus apud feam ad hor epist i ii fortune makes many promises to many keeps them to none live to the days and hours for nothing is your own gregory gryll esq of gryll grange in hampshire on the borders of the new forest in the midst of a park which was a little forest in itself reaching nearly to the sea and well stocked with deer having a large outer tract where a numerous lightrented and wellconditioned tenantry fattened innumerable pigs considering himself well located for what he professed to be epicuri de grege porcus and held though he found it difficult to trace the pedigree that he was lineally descended from the ancient and illustrious gryllus who maintained against ulysses the superior happiness of the life of other animals to that of the life of man this inscription appears to consist of comic senarii slightly dislocated for the inscriptional purpose spondet fortuna multa multis praestat nemini vive in dies et horas nam proprium est nihil a pig from the herd of epicurus the old philosophers accepted goodhumouredly the disparaging terms attached to them by their enemies or rivals the epicureans acquiesced in the pig the cynics in the dog and cleanthes was content to be called the ass of zeno as being alone capable of bearing the burthen of the stoic philosophy plutarch bruta animalia raiione uti gryllus in this dialogue seems to have the best of the argument spenser however did not think so when he introduced his gryll in the paradise of acrasia reviling sir guyons palmer for having restored him to the human form streightway he with his virtuous staff them strooke and streight of beasts they comely men became yet being men they did unmanly looke and stared ghastly some for inward shame and some for wrath to see their captive dame but one above the rest in speciall that had an hog been late hight grylle by name repyned greatly and did him miscall that had from hoggish forme him brought to naturall said guyon see the mind of beastly man that hath so soon forgot the excellence of his creation when he life began that now he chooseth with vile difference to be a beast and lacke intelligence fairy queen book ii canto in plutarchs dialogue ulysses after his own companions have been restored to the human form solicits circe to restore in the same manner any other greeks who may be under her enchantments circe consents provided they desire it gryllus endowed with speech for the purpose answers for all that they had rather remain as they are and supports the decision by showing the greater comfort of their condition as it is to what it would probably be if they were again sent forth to share the common lot of mankind we have unfortunately only the beginning of the dialogue of which the greater portion has perished it might be seen that to a man who traced his ancestry from the palace of circe the first care would be the continuance of his ancient race but a wife presented to him the forethought of a perturbation of his equanimity which he never could bring himself to encounter he liked to dine well and withal to dine quietly and to have quiet friends at his table with whom he could discuss questions which might afford ample room for pleasant conversation and none for acrimonious dispute he feared that a wife would interfere with his dinner his company and his afterdinner bottle of port for the perpetuation of his name he relied on an orphan niece whom he had brought up from a child who superintended his household and sate at the head of his table she was to be his heiress and her husband was to take his name he left the choice to her but reserved to himself a veto if he should think the aspirant unworthy of the honourable appellation the young lady had too much taste feeling and sense to be likely to make a choice which her uncle would not approve but time as it rolled on foreshadowed a result which the squire had not anticipated miss gryll did not seem likely to make any choice at all the atmosphere of quiet enjoyment in which she had grown up seemed to have steeped her feelings in its own tranquillity and still more the affection which she felt for her uncle and the conviction that though he had always premeditated her marriage her departure from his house would be the severest blow that fate could inflict on him led her to postpone what she knew must be an evil day to him and might peradventure not be a good one to her oh the ancient name of gryll sighed the squire to himself what if it should pass away in the nineteenth century after having lived from the time of circe often indeed when he looked at her at the head of his table the star of his little circle joyous herself and the source of joy in others he thought the actual state of things admitted no change for the better and the perpetuity of the old name became a secondary consideration but though the purpose was dimmed in the evening it usually brightened in the morning in the meantime the young lady had many suitors who were permitted to plead their cause though they made little apparent progress several young gentlemen of fair promise seemingly on the point of being accepted had been each in his turn suddenly and summarily dismissed why was the young ladys secret if it were known it would be easy she said in these days of artificial manners to counterfeit the presence of the qualities she liked and still more easy the absence of the qualities she disliked there was sufficient diversity in the characters of the rejected to place conjecture at fault and mr gryll began to despair the uncle and niece had come to a clear understanding on this subject he might present to her attention any one whom he might deem worthy to be her suitor and she might reject the suitor without assigning a reason for so doing in this way several had appeared and passed away like bubbles on a stream illustration was the young lady too fastidious was the young lady over fastidious or were none among the presented worthy or had that which was to touch her heart not yet appeared mr gryll was the godfather of his niece and to please him she had been called morgana he had had some thoughts of calling her circe but acquiesced in the name of a sister enchantress who had worked out her own idea of a beautiful garden and exercised similar power over the minds and forms of men chapter iii the dukes folly moisten your lungs with wine the dogstars sway returns and all things thirst beneath his ray alcaeus falernum opimianum annorum centum heu heu inquit trimalchio ergo diutius vivit vinum quam homuncio quare reyye reviovas faciamus vita vinum est petronius arbiter falernian opimian wine an hundred years old alas alas exclaimed trimalchio this wine lives longer than man wherefore let us sing moisten your lungs wine is life wordsworths question in his poets epitaph art thou a man of purple cheer a rosy man right plump to see might have been answered in the affirmative by the reverend doctor opimian the worthy divine dwelt in an agreeably situated vicarage on the outskirts of the new forest a good living a comfortable patrimony a moderate dowry with his wife placed him sufficiently above the cares of the world to enable him to gratify all his tastes without minute calculations of cost his tastes in fact were four a good library a good dinner a pleasant garden and rural walks he was an athlete in pedestrianism he took no pleasure in riding either on horseback or in a carriage but he kept a brougham for the service of mrs opimian and for his own occasional use in dining out illustration the rev doctor opimian mrs opimian was domestic the care of the doctor had supplied her with the best books on cookery to which his own inventive genius and the kindness of friends had added a large and always increasing manuscript volume the lady studied them carefully and by diligent superintendence left the doctor nothing to desire in the service of his table his cellar was well stocked with a selection of the best vintages under his own especial charge in all its arrangements his house was a model of order and comfort and the whole establishment partook of the genial physiognomy of the master from the master and mistress to the cook and from the cook to the torn cat there was about the inhabitants of the vicarage a sleek and purring rotundity of face and figure that denoted community of feelings habits and diet each in its kind of course for the doctor had his port the cook her ale and the cat his milk in sufficiently liberal allowance in the morning while mrs opimian found ample occupation in the details of her household duties and the care of her little family the doctor unless he had predestined the whole day to an excursion studied in his library in the afternoon he walked in the evening he dined and after dinner read to his wife and family or heard his children read to him this was his home life now and then he dined out more frequently than at any other place with his friend and neighbour mr gryll who entirely sympathised with him in his taste for a good dinner beyond the limits of his ordinary but within those of his occasional range was a solitary round tower on an eminence backed with wood which had probably in old days been a landmark for hunters but having in modern days no very obvious use was designated as many such buildings are by the name of the folly the country people called it the dukes folly though who the duke in question was nobody could tell tradition had dropped his name one fine midsummer day with a southerly breeze and a cloudless sky the doctor having taken an early breakfast in the progress of which he had considerably reduced the altitude of a round of beef set out with a good stick in his hand and a newfoundland dog at his heels for one of his longest walks such as he could only take in the longest days arriving at the folly which he had not visited for a long time he was surprised to find it enclosed and having at the back the novelty of a covered passage built of the same gray stone as the tower itself this passage passed away into the wood at the back whence was ascending a wreath of smoke which immediately recalled to him the dwelling of circe indeed the change before him had much the air of enchantment and the circean similitude was not a little enhanced by the antique masonry and the expanse of sea which was visible from the eminence he leaned over the gate repeated aloud the lines of the odyssey and fell into a brown study from which he was aroused by the approach of a young gentleman from within the enclosure greek passage od k i climbed a cliff with spear and sword in hand whose ridge oerlooked a shady length of land to learn if aught of mortal works appear or cheerful voice of mortal strike the ear from the high point i marked in distant view a stream of curling smoke ascending blue and spiry tops the tufted trees above of circes palace bosomed in the grove thither to haste the region to explore was first my thought greek passage id the palace in a woody vale they found highraised of stone a shaded space around pope i beg your pardon sir said the doctor but my curiosity is excited by what i see here and if you do not think it impertinent and would inform me how these changes have come about i should be greatly obliged most willingly sir said the other but if you will walk in and see what has been done the obligation will be mine the doctor readily accepted the proposal the stranger led the way across an open space in the wood to a circular hall from each side of which a wide passage led on the left hand to the tower and on the right to the new building which was so masked by the wood as not to be visible except from within the glade it was a square structure of plain stone much in the same style as that of the tower the young gentleman took the lefthand passage and introduced the doctor to the lower floor of the tower i have divided the tower he observed into three rooms one on each floor this is the diningroom above it is my bedroom above it again is my library the prospect is good from all the floors but from the library it is most extensive as you look over the woods far away into the open sea a noble diningroom said the doctor the height is well proportioned to the diameter that circular table well becomes the form of the room and gives promise of a fine prospect in its way i hope you will favour me by forming a practical judgment on the point said his new acquaintance as he led the way to the upper floor the doctor marvelling at the extreme courtesy with which he was treated this building thought he might belong to the age of chivalry and my host might be sir calidore himself but the library brought him back to other days the walls were covered with books the upper portion accessible by a gallery running entirely round the apartment the books of the lower circle were all classical those of the upper english italian and french with a few volumes in spanish the young gentleman took down a homer and pointed out to the doctor the passage which as he leaned over the gate he had repeated from the odyssey this accounted to the doctor for the deference shown to him he saw at once into the greek sympathy you have a great collection of books said the doctor i believe said the young gentleman i have all the best books in the languages i cultivate home tooke says greek latin italian and french are unfortunately the usual bounds of an english scholars acquisition i think any scholar fortunate whose acquisition extends so far these languages and our own comprise i believe with a few rare exceptions all the best books in the world i may add spanish for the sake of cervantes lope de vega and calderon mr buchanan says that peacock learned spanish at an advanced period of life which ought to have been mentioned in our introductory memoir scarcely a spanish book however appears in the catalogue of his libraryg it was a dictum of porson that life is too short to learn german meaning i apprehend not that it is too difficult to be acquired within the ordinary space of life but that there is nothing in it to compensate for the portion of life bestowed on its acquirement however little that may be mr haywards french hotelkeeper in germany had a different but not less cogent reason for not learning german whenever a dish attracts attention by the art displayed in its conception or preparation apart from the material the artist will commonly be discovered to be french many years ago we had the curiosity to inquire at the htel de france at dresden to whom our party were indebted for the enjoyment they had derived from a suprme de volaille and were informed the cook and the master of the hotel were one and the same person a frenchman ci devant chef of a russian minister he had been eighteen years in germany but knew not a word of any language but his own a quoi bon messieurs was his reply to our expression of astonishment quoi bon apprendre la langue dun peuple qui ne possde pas une cuisine art of dining pp the doctor was somewhat puzzled what to say he had some french and more italian being fond of romances of chivalry and in greek and latin he thought himself a match for any man but he was more occupied with speculations on the position and character of his new acquaintance than on the literary opinions he was enunciating he marvelled to find a young man rich enough to do what he here saw done doing anything of the kind and fitting up a library in a solitary tower instead of passing his time in clubs and runions and other pursuits and pleasures of general society but he thought it necessary to say something to the point and rejoined porson was a great man and his dictum would have weighed with me if i had had a velleity towards german but i never had any but i rather wonder you should have placed your library on the upper instead of the middle floor the prospect as you have observed is fine from all the floors but here you have the sea and the sky to the greatest advantage and i would assign my best lookout to the hours of dressing and undressing the first thing in the morning the last at night and the halfhour before dinner you can give greater attention to the views before you when you are following operations important certainly but mechanical from repetition and uninteresting in themselves than when you are engaged in some absorbing study which probably shuts out all perception of the external world what you say is very true sir said the other but you know the lines of milton or let my lamp at midnight hour be seen in some high lonely tower where i may oft outwatch the bear with thrice great hermes these lines have haunted me from very early days and principally influenced me in purchasing this tower and placing my library on the top of it and i have another association with such a mode of life a french clock in the library struck two and the young gentleman proposed to his visitor to walk into the house they accordingly descended the stairs and crossed the entrancehall to a large drawingroom simply but handsomely furnished having some good pictures on the walls an organ at one end of the room a piano and harp at the other and an elegantlydisposed luncheon in the middle at this time of the year said the young gentleman i lunch at two and dine at eight this gives me two long divisions of the morning for any indoor and outdoor purposes i hope you will partake with me you will not find a precedent in homer for declining the invitation really said the doctor that argument is cogent and conclusive i accept with pleasure and indeed my long walk has given me an appetite now you must know said the young gentleman i have none but female domestics you will see my two waitingmaids he rang the bell and the specified attendants appeared two young girls about sixteen and seventeen both pretty and simply but very becomingly dressed of the provision set before him the doctor preferred some cold chicken and tongue madeira and sherry were on the table and the young attendants offered him hock and claret the doctor took a capacious glass from each of the fair cupbearers and pronounced both wines excellent and deliciously cool he declined more not to overheat himself in walking and not to infringe on his anticipations of dinner the dog who had behaved throughout with exemplary propriety was not forgotten the doctor rose to depart i think said his host i may now ask you the homeric questiongreek phrase who and whence are you most justly said the doctor my name is theophilus opimian i am a doctor of divinity and the incumbent of ashbrookcumferndale i am simply said the other algernon falconer i have inherited some money but no land therefore having the opportunity i made this purchase to fit it up in my own fashion and live in it in my own way the doctor preparing to depart mr falconer proposed to accompany him part of the way and calling out another newfoundland dog who immediately struck up a friendship with his companion he walked away with the doctor the two dogs gamboling before them chapter iv the foresta soliloquy on hair mille hominum species et rerum discolor usus velle suum cuique est nee voto vivitur uno persius in mind and taste men differ as in frame each has his special will and few the same the rev dr opimian it strikes me as singular that with such a house you should have only female domestics mr falconer it is not less singular perhaps that they are seven sisters all the children of two old servants of my father and mother the eldest is about my own age twentysix so that they have all grown up with me in time and place they live in great harmony together and divide among them the charge of all the household duties those whom you saw are the two youngest the rev dr opimian if the others acquit themselves as well you have a very efficient staff but seven young women as the establishment of one young bachelor for such i presume you to be mr falconer assented is something new and strange the world is not over charitable illustration seven young women in a bachelors establishment mr falconer the world will never suppose a good motive where it can suppose a bad one i would not willingly offend any of its prejudices i would not affect eccentricity at the same time i do not feel disposed to be put out of my way because it is not the way of the worldle chemin du monde as a frenchman entitled congreves comedybut i assure you these seven young women live here as they might do in the temple of vesta congreve le meilleur auteur comique dangleterre ses pices les plus estimes sont le fourbe le vieux garon amour pour amour l epouse du matin le chemin du monde manuel bibliographique par g peignot paris it was a singular combination of circumstances that induced and enabled me to form such an establishment but i would not give it up nor alter it nor diminish it nor increase it for any earthly consideration the rev dr opimian you hinted that besides miltons verses you had another association of ideas with living in the top of a tower mr falconer i have read of somebody who lived so and admitted to his sanctum only one young person a niece or a daughter i forget which but on very rare occasions would descend to speak to some visitor who had previously propitiated the young lady to obtain him an interview at last the young lady introduced one who proposed for her and gained the consent of the recluse i am not sure of his name but i always call him lord noirmont to carry her off i think this was associated with some affliction that was cured or some mystery that was solved and that the hermit returned into the everyday world i do not know where i read it but i have always liked the idea of living like lord noirmont when i shall have become a sufficiently disappointed man the rev dr opimian you look as little like a disappointed man as any i have seen but as you have neither daughter nor niece you would have seven links instead of one between the top of your tower and the external world mr falconer we are all born to disappointment it is as well to be prospective our happiness is not in what is but in what is to be we may be disappointed in our everyday realities and if not we may make an ideality of the unattainable and quarrel with nature for not giving what she has not to give it is unreasonable to be so disappointed but it is disappointment not the less the rev dr opimian it is something like the disappointment of the men of gotham when they could not fish up the moon from the sea mr falconer it is very like it and there are more of us in the predicament of the men of gotham than are ready to acknowledge the similitude the rev dr opimian i am afraid i am too matteroffact to sympathise very clearly with this form of aestheticism but here is a charming bit of forest scenery look at that old oak with the deer under it the long and deep range of fern running up from it to that beechgrove on the upland the lights and shadows on the projections and recesses of the wood and the blaze of foxglove in its foreground it is a place in which a poet might look for a glimpse of a hamadryad mr falconer very beautiful for the actual presenttoo beautiful for the probable future some day or other the forest will be disforested the deer will be either banished or destroyed the wood will be either shut up or cut down here is another basis for disappointment the more we admire it now the more we shall regret it then the admiration of sylvan and pastoral scenery is at the mercy of an enclosure act and instead of the glimpse of a hamadryad you will some time see a large board warning you off the premises under penalty of rigour of law the rev dr opimian but my dear young friend you have yourself enclosed a favourite old resort of mine and of many others i did not see such a board as you speak of but there is an effective fence which answers the purpose mr falconer true but when the lot of crown land was put up for sale it was sure to be purchased and shut up by somebody at any rate i have not interfered with the external picturesque and i have been much more influenced by an intense desire of shutting up myself than of shutting up the place merely because it is my property about halfway from their respective homes the two new friends separated the doctor having promised to walk over again soon to dine and pass the night the doctor soliloquised as he walked strange metamorphosis of the old tower a good diningroom a good library a bedroom between them he did not show it me good wine excellent pretty waitingmaids exceedingly pretty two of seven vestals who maintain the domestic fire on the hearth of the young numa by the way they had something of the vestal costume white dresses with purple borders but they had nothing on their heads but their own hair very gracefully arranged the vestals had headdresses which hid their hair if they had any they were shaved on admission perhaps the hair was allowed to grow again perhaps not i must look into the point if not it was a wise precaution hair the only grace of form says the arbiter elegantiarum who compares a bald head to a fungus a head without hair says ovid is as a field without grass and a shrub without leaves venus herself if she had appeared with a bald head would not have tempted apuleius and i am of his mind a husband in menander in a fit of jealous madness shaves his wifes head and when he sees what he has made of her rolls at her feet in a paroxysm of remorse he was at any rate safe from jealousy till it grew again and here is a subtlety of euripides which none of his commentators have seen into gisthus has married electra to a young farmer who cultivates his own land he respects the princess from magnanimity and restores her a pure virgin to her brother orestes not probable say some critics but i say highly probable for she comes on with her head shaved there is the talisman and the consummate artifice of the great poet it is ostensibly a symbol of grief but not the less a most efficient ally of the aforesaid magnanimity in mourning says aristotle sympathising with the dead we deform ourselves by cutting off our hair and truly it is quod solum formse decus est cecidere capillipetronius c laevior rotundo horti tubere quod creavit unda ibid a head to speak in the gardeners style is a bulbous excrescence growing up between the shoulders g a steevens lecture on heads turpe pecus mutilum turpe est sine gramme campus et sine fronde frutex et sine crine caput ovid arks amatorio iii at vero quod nefas dicere neque sit ullum hujus rei tam dirum exemplum si cujuslibet eximiae pulcherrimaeque fominae caput capillo exspoliaveris et faciem nativa specie nudaveris licet

rorans calva processerit placere non potent nee vulcano suo apuleius metamorph ii but indeed what it is profanation to speak nor let there be hereof any so dire example if you despoil of its hair the head of any most transcendent and perfectly beautiful woman and present her face thus denuded of its native loveliness though it were even she the descended from heaven the born of the sea the educated in the waves though i say it were venus herself attended by the graces surrounded by the loves cinctured with her girdle fragrant with spices and dewy with balsams yet if she appeared with a bald head she could not please even her own vulcan a womans head shaved is a step towards a deaths head as a symbol of grief it was not necessary to the case of electra for in the sister tragedies of schylus and sophocles her grief is equally great and she appears with flowing hair but in them she is an unmarried maid and there is no dramatic necessity for so conspicuous an antidote to her other charms neither is it according to custom for in recent grief the whole hair was sacrificed but in the memory of an old sorrow only one or two curls were cut off therefore it was the dramatic necessity of a countercharm that influenced euripides helen knew better than to shave her head in a case where custom required it euripides makes electra reproach helen for thus preserving her beauty which further illustrates his purpose in shaving the head of electra where custom did not require it and terence showed his taste in not shaving the head of his heroine in the phormio though the severity of athenian custom would have required it her beauty shone through her dishevelled hair but with no hair at all she would not have touched the heart of antipho sophocles electra v euripides orestes v but wherefore does my mind discourse these things to me suspending dismal images on lovely realities for the luxuriant hair of these young girls is of no ordinary beauty their tresses have not been deposited under the shadow of the sacred lotus as pliny tells us those of the vestals were well this young gentlemans establishment may be perfectly moral strictly correct but in one sense it is morality thrown away the world will give him no credit for it i am sure mrs opimian will not if he were married it would be different but i think if he were to marry now there would be a fiercer fire than vestas among his lares the temple would be too hot for the seven virgins i suppose as he is so resolute against change he does not mean to marry then he talks about anticipated disappointment in some unrealisable ideality leading him to live like lord noirmont whom i never heard of before he is far enough off from that while he lunches and walks as he does and no doubt dines in accordance he will not break his heart for any moon in the water if his cooks are as good as his waitingmaids and the wine which he gave me is a fair specimen of his cellar he is learned too greek seems to be the strongest chord in his sympathies if it had not been for the singular accident of his overhearing me repeat half a dozen lines of homer i should not have been asked to walk in i might have leaned over the gate till sunset and have had no more notice taken of me than if i had been a crow at dinner the doctor narrated his morning adventure to mrs opimian and found her as he had anticipated most virtuously uncharitable with respect to the seven sisters she did not depart from her usual serenity but said with equal calmness and decision that she had no belief in the virtue of young men my dear said the doctor it has been observed though i forget by whom that there is in every mans life a page which is usually doubled down perhaps there is such a page in the life of our young friend but if there be the volume which contains it is not in the same house with the seven sisters illustration verifying the question of hair of the vestals the doctor could not retire to rest without verifying his question touching the hair of the vestals and stepping into his study was taking out an old folio to consult lipsius de vestalibus when a passage flashed across his memory which seemed decisive on the point how could i overlook it he thought ignibus iliacis aderam cum lapsa capillis decidit ante sacros lanea vitta focos says rhea sylvia in the fasti he took down the fasti and turning over the leaves lighted on another line attonit flebant demisso crine ministr with the note of an old commentator this will enlighten those who doubt if the vestals wore their hair i infer said the doctor that i have doubted in good company but it is clear that the vestals did wear their hair of second growth the woollen wreath by vestas inmost shrine fell from my hair before the fire divine with hair dishevelled wept the vestal train but if it was wrapped up in wool it might as well not have been there the vitta was at once the symbol and the talisman of chastity shall i recommend my young friend to wrap up the heads of his vestals in a vitta it would be safer for all parties but i cannot imagine a piece of advice for which the giver would receive less thanks and i had rather see them as they are so i shall let well alone chapter v the seven sisters greek passage euripides alcestis rejoice thy spirit drink the passing day esteem thine own and all beyond as fortunes the doctor was not long without remembering his promise to revisit his new acquaintance and purposing to remain till the next morning he set out later in the day the weather was intensely hot he walked slowly and paused more frequently than usual to rest under the shade of trees he was shown into the drawingroom where he was shortly joined by mr falconer and very cordially welcomed the two friends dined together in the lower room of the tower the dinner and wine were greatly to the doctors mind in due time they adjourned to the drawingroom and the two young handmaids who had waited at dinner attended with coffee and tea the doctor then saidyou are well provided with musical instruments do you play mr falconer no i have profited by the observation of doctor johnson sir once on a time i took to fiddling but i found that to fiddle well i must fiddle all my life and i thought i could do something better the rev dr opimian then i presume these are pieces of ornamental furniture for the use of occasional visitors mr falconer not exactly my maids play on them and sing to them the rev dr opimian your maids mr falconer even so they have been thoroughly well educated and are all accomplished musicians the rev dr opimian and at what time do they usually play on them mr falconer every evening about this time when i am alone the rev dr opimian and why not when you have company mr falconer la morgue aristocratique which pervades all society would not tolerate such a proceeding on the part of young women of whom some had superintended the preparation of the dinner and others attended on it it would not have been incongruous in the homeric age the rev dr opimian then i hope you will allow it to be not incongruous this evening homer being the original vinculum between you and me mr falconer would you like to hear them the rev dr opimian indeed i should the two younger sisters having answered the summons and the doctors wish having been communicated the seven appeared together all in the same dress of white and purple the seven pleiads thought the doctor what a constellation of beauty he stood up and bowed to them which they gracefully acknowledged they then played on and sang to the harp and piano the doctor was enchanted after a while they passed over to the organ and performed some sacred music of mozart and beethoven they then paused and looked round as if for instructions we usually end said mr falconer with a hymn to st catharine but perhaps it may not be to your taste although saint catharine is a saint of the english church calendar i like all sacred music said the doctor and i am not disposed to object to a saint of the english church calendar she is also said mr falconer a most perfect emblem of purity and in that sense alone there can be no fitter image to be presented to the minds of young women very true said the doctor and very strange withal he thought to himself the sisters sang their hymn made their obeisance and departed the rev dr opimian the hands of these young women do not show signs of menial work mr falconer they are the regulating spirits of the household they have a staff of their own for the coarser and harder work the rev dr opimian their household duties then are such as homeric damsels discharged in the homes of their fathers with greek word for the lower drudgery mr falconer something like it the rev dr opimian young ladies in short in manners and accomplishments though not in social position only more useful in a house than young ladies generally are mr falconer something like that too if you know the tree by its fruit the manner in which this house is kept may reconcile you to the singularity of the experiment the rev dr opimian i am perfectly reconciled to it the experiment is eminently successful the doctor always finished his day with a tumbler of brandy and water soda water in summer and hot water in winter after his usual draught he retired to his chamber where he slept like a top and dreamed of electra and nausicaa vestals pleiads and saint catharine and woke with the last words he had heard sung on the preceding night still ringing in his ears dei virgo catharina lege constans in divina coli gemma preciosa margarita fulgida sponsa christi gloriosa paradisi viola virgin bride supremely bright gem and flower of heavenly light pearl of the empyreal skies violet of paradise chapter vi the rustic lover despairing beside a clear stream a shepherd forsaken was laid the next morning after a comfortable breakfast the doctor set out on his walk home his young friend accompanied him part of the way and did not part with him till he had obtained a promise of another and longer visit the doctor as usual soliloquised as he walked no doubt these are vestals the purity of the establishment is past question this young gentleman has every requisite which her dearest friends would desire in a husband for miss gryll and she is in every way suited to him but these seven damsels interpose themselves like the sevenfold shield of ajax there is something very attractive in these damsels facis non omnibus una nec diversa tamen qualem decet esse sororum though various features did the sisters grace a sisters likeness was in every face addison ovid met ii if i had such an establishment i should be loath to break it up it is original in these days of monotony it is satisfactory in these days of uncongenial relations between master and servant it is effective in the admirable arrangements of the household it is graceful in the personal beauty and tasteful apparel of the maidens it is agreeable in their manners in their accomplishments in their musical skill it is like an enchanted palace mr gryll who talks so much of circe would find himself at home he might fancy himself waited on by her handmaids the daughters of fountains groves and rivers miss gryll might fancy herself in the dwelling of her namesake morgana but i fear she would be for dealing with it as orlando did with morgana breaking the talisman and dissolving the enchantment this would be a pity but it would also be a pity that these two young persons should not come together but why should i trouble myself with matchmaking it is always a thankless office if it turns out well your good service is forgotten if it turns out ill you are abused by both parties the doctors soliloquy was cut short by a sound of lamentation which as he went on came to him in louder and louder bursts he was attracted to the spot whence the sounds proceeded and had some difficulty in discovering a doleful swain who was ensconced in a mass of fern taller than himself if he had been upright and but that by rolling over and over in the turbulence of his grief he had flattened a large space down to the edge of the forest brook near which he reclined he would have remained invisible in his lair the tears in his eyes and the passionate utterances of his voice contrasted strangely with a round russetin face which seemed fortified by beef and ale against all possible furrows of care but against love even beef and ale mighty talismans as they are are feeble barriers cupids arrows had pierced through the os triplex of treble x and the stricken deer lay mourning by the stream illustration a doleful swain the doctor approaching kindly inquired what is the matter but was answered only by a redoubled burst of sorrow and an emphatic rejection of all sympathy you cant do me any good you do not know that said the doctor no man knows what good another can do him till he communicates his trouble for some time the doctor could obtain no other answer than the repetition of you cant do me any good but at length the patience and kind face of the inquirer had their effect on the sad shepherd and he brought out with a desperate effort and a more clamorous explosion of grief she wont have me who wont have you well if you must know said the swain you must its one of the young ladies up at the folly young ladies said the doctor servants they call themselves said the other but they are more like ladies and hold their heads high enough when one of them wont have me fathers is one of the best farms for miles round and its all his own hes a true old yeoman father is and theres nobody but him and me and if i had a nice wife that would be a good housekeeper for him and play and sing to him of an eveningfor she can do anything she canread write and keep accounts and play and singive heard herand make a plumpuddingive seen herwe should be as happy as three cricketsfour perhaps at the years end and she wont have me you have put the question said the doctor plump said the other and she looked at first as if she was going to laugh she didnt though then she looked serious and said she was sorry for me she said she saw i was in earnest she knew i was a good son and deserved a good wife but she couldnt have me miss said i do you like anybody better no she said very heartily that is one comfort said the doctor what comfort said the other when she wont have me she may alter her mind said the doctor if she does not prefer any one else besides she only says she cant cant said the other is civil for wont thats all does she say why she cant said the doctor yes said the other she says she and her sisters wont part with each other and their young master now said the doctor you have not told me which of the seven sisters is the one in question its the third said the other what they call the second cook theres a housekeeper and two cooks and two housemaids and two waiting maids but they only manage for the young master there are others that wait on them and what is her name said the doctor dorothy said the other her name is dorothy their names follow like abc only that a comes last betsey catherine dorothy eleanor fanny grace anna but they told me it was not the alphabet they were christened from it was the key of a minor if you know what that means i think i do said the doctor laughing they were christened from the greek diatonic scale and make up two conjunct tetrachords if you know what that means i cant say i do said the other looking bewildered and so said the doctor the young gentleman whose name is algernon is the proslambanomenos or keynote and makes up the octave his parents must have designed it as a foretelling that he and his seven fostersisters were to live in harmony all their lives but how did you become acquainted why said the other i take a great many things to the house from our farm and its generally she that takes them in i know the house well said the doctor and the master and the maids perhaps he may marry and they may follow the example live in hope tell me your name hedgerow said the other harry hedgerow and if you know her aint she a beauty why yes said the doctor they are all goodlooking and she wont have me cried the other but with a more subdued expression the doctor had consoled him and given him a ray of hope and they went on their several ways the doctor resumed his soliloquy here is the semblance of something towards a solution of the difficulty if one of the damsels should marry it would break the combination one will not by herself but what if seven applefaced hedgerows should propose simultaneously seven notes in the key of a minor an octave below stranger things have happened i have read of six brothers who had the civility to break their necks in succession that the seventh who was the hero of the story might inherit an estate but again and again why should i trouble myself with matchmaking i had better leave things to take their own course still in his interior speculum the doctor could not help seeing a dim reflection of himself pronouncing the nuptial benediction on his two young friends

agapt said the reverend doctor opimian the next morning at breakfast in the best sense of the words that i am satisfied is the relation between this young gentleman and his handmaids mrs opimian perhaps doctor you will have the goodness to make your view of this relation a little more intelligible to me the rev dr opimian assuredly my dear the word signifies beloved in its purest sense and in this sense it was used by saint paul in reference to some of his female coreligionists and fellowlabourers in the vineyard in whose houses he occasionally dwelt and in this sense it was applied to virgins and holy men who dwelt under the same roof in spiritual love mrs opimian very likely indeed you are a holy man doctor but i think if you were a bachelor and i were a maid i should not trust myself to be your agaaga illustration should not trust myself to be your agaaga the rev dr opimian agapt but i never pretended to this sort of spiritualism i followed the advice of saint paul who says it is better to marry mrs opimian you need not finish the quotation the rev dr opimian agapt is often translated adoptive sister a very possible relation i think where there are vows of celibacy and inward spiritual grace mrs opimian very possible indeed and equally possible where there are none the rev dr opimian but more possible where there are seven adoptive sisters than where there is only one mrs opimian perhaps the rev dr opimian the manners my dear of these damsels towards their young master are infallible indications of the relations between them their respectful deference to him is a symptom in which i cannot be mistaken mrs opimian i hope you are not the rev dr opimian i am sure i am not i would stake all my credit for observation and experience on the purity of the seven vestals i am not strictly accurate in calling them so for in rome the number of vestals was only six but there were seven pleiads till one disappeared we may fancy she became a seventh vestal or as the planets used to be seven and are now more than fifty we may pass a seventh vestal in the name of modern progress mrs opimian there used to be seven deadly sins how many has modern progress added to them the rev dr opimian none i hope my dear but this will be due not to its own tendencies but to the comprehensiveness of the old definitions mrs opimian i think i have heard something like your greek word before the rev dr opimian agapmon my dear you may have heard the word agapmon mrs opimian that is it and what may it signify the rev dr opimian it signifies abode of love spiritual love of course mrs opimian spiritual love which rides in carriages and four fares sumptuously like dives and protects itself with a high wall from profane observation the rev dr opimian well my dear and there may be no harm in all that mrs opimian doctor you are determined not to see harm in anything the rev dr opimian i am afraid i see more harm in many things than i like to see but one reason for not seeing harm in this agapmon matter is that i hear so little about it the world is ready enough to promulgate scandal but that which is quietly right may rest in peace mrs opimian surely doctor you do not think this agapemone right the rev dr opimian i only say i do not know whether it is right or wrong it is nothing new three centuries ago there was a family of love on which middleton wrote a comedy queen elizabeth persecuted this family middleton made it ridiculous but it outlived them both and there may have been no harm in it after all mrs opimian perhaps doctor the world is too good to see any novelty except in something wrong the rev dr opimian perhaps it is only wrong that arrests attention because right is common and wrong is rare of the many thousand persons who walk daily

destruction around them if the dishonesty of avarice did not tempt their employment where the more costly low pressure would ensure absolute safety honestly built houses would not come suddenly down and crush their occupants ships faithfully built and efficiently manned would not so readily strike on a lee shore nor go instantly to pieces on the first touch of the ground honestly made sweetmeats would not poison children honestly compounded drugs would not poison patients in short the larger portion of what we call accidents are crimes mrs opimian i have often heard you say of railways and steamvessels that the primary cause of their disasters is the insane passion of the public for speed that is not crime but folly the rev dr opimian it is crime in those who ought to know better than to act in furtherance of the folly but when the world has grown honest it will no doubt grow wise when we have got rid of crime we may consider how to get rid of folly so that question is adjourned to the greek kalends mrs opimian there are always in a newspaper some things of a creditable character the rev dr opimian when we are at war naval and military heroism abundantly but in time of peace these virtues sleep they are laid up like ships in ordinary no doubt of the recorded facts of civil life some are good and more are indifferent neither good nor bad but good and indifferent together are scarcely more than a twelfth part of the whole still the matters thus presented are all exceptional cases a hermit reading nothing but a newspaper might find little else than food for misanthropy but living among friends and in the bosom of our family we see the dark side of life in the occasional picture the bright is its everyday aspect the occasional is the matter of curiosity of incident of adventure of things that really happen to few and may possibly happen to any the interest attendant on any action or event is in just proportion to its rarity and happily quiet virtues are all around us and obtrusive virtues seldom cross our path on the whole i agree in opinion with theseus that there is more good than evil in the world eurip suppl herm mrs opimian i think doctor you would not maintain any opinion if you had not an authority two thousand years old for it the rev dr opimian well my dear i think most opinions worth mentioning have an authority of about that age chapter viii pantopragmatics cool the wine doris pour it in the cup simple unmixed with water such dilution serves only to wash out the spirit of man the doctor under the attraction of his new acquaintance had allowed more time than usual to elapse between his visits to gryll grange and when he resumed them he was not long without communicating the metamorphosis of the old tower and the singularities of its inhabitants they dined well as usual and drank their wine cool miss gryll there are many things in what you have told us that excite my curiosity but first what do you suppose is the young gentlemans religion the rev dr opimian from the great liking he seems to have taken to me i should think he was of the church of england if i did not rather explain it by our greek sympathy at the same time he kept very carefully in view that saint catharine is a saint of the english church calendar i imagine there is less of true piety than of an abstract notion of ideal beauty even in his devotion to her but it is so far satisfactory that he wished to prove his religion such as it is to be within the pale of the church of england miss gryll i like the idea of his closing the day with a hymn sung in concert by his seven vestals the rev dr opimian i am glad you think charitably of the damsels it is not every lady that would but i am satisfied they deserve it mr gryll i should like to know the young gentleman i wish you could manage to bring him here should not you like to see him morgana miss gryll yes uncle mr gryll try what you can do doctor we shall have before long some poetical and philosophical visitors that may tempt him to join us the rev dr opimian it may but i am not confident he seems to me to be indisposed to general society and to care for nothing but woods rivers and the sea greek poetry saint catharine and the seven vestals however i will try what can be done mr gryll but doctor i think he would scarcely have provided such a spacious diningroom and so much domestic accommodation if he had intended to shut himself up from society altogether i expect that some day when you go there you will find a large party try if he will cooperate in the aristophanic comedy the rev dr opimian a good idea that may be something to his mind miss gryll talking of comedy doctor what has become of lord curryfin and his lecture on fish the rev dr opimian why lord michin malicho lord facingbothways and two or three other archquacks have taken to merryandrewising in a new arena which they call the science of pantopragmatics and they have bitten lord curryfin into tumbling with them but the mania will subside when the weather grows cool and no doubt we shall still have him at thornback bay teaching the fishermen how to know a herring from a halibut marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief hamlet miss gryll but pray doctor what is this new science the rev dr opimian why that miss gryll i cannot well make out i have asked several professors of the science and have got nothing in return but some fine varieties of rigmarole of which i can make neither head nor tail it seems to be a real art of talking about an imaginary art of teaching every man his own business nothing practical comes of it and indeed so much the better it will be at least harmless as long as it is like hamlets reading words words words like most other science it resolves itself into lecturing lecturing lecturing about all sorts of matters relevant and irrelevant one enormous bore prating about jurisprudence another about statistics another about education and so forth the crambe repetita of the same rubbish which has already been served up twis hot and twis cold at as many other associations nicknamed scientific miss gryll then doctor i should think lord curryfins lecture would be a great relief to the unfortunate audience the rev dr opimian no doubt more amusing and equally profitable not a fish more would be caught for it and this will typify the result of all such scientific talk i had rather hear a practical cook lecture on bubble and squeak no bad emblem of the whole affair mr gryll it has been said a man of genius can discourse on anything bubble and squeak seems a limited subject but in the days of the french revolution there was an amusing poem with that title and there might be an amusing lecture especially if it were like the poem discursive and emblematical but men so dismally far gone in the affectation of earnestness would scarcely relish it and many a jacke of dover hast thou sold that hath been twis

vidi lei che si facea corona riflettendo da se gli eterni ral dante paradiso xxxi i lifted up my gaze and looked on her who made herself a crown reflecting from herself the eternal rays it was not long before the doctor again walked over to the tower to propose to his young friend to cooperate in the aristophanic comedy he found him well disposed to do so and they passed a portion of the afternoon in arranging their programme they dined and passed the evening much as before the next morning as they were ascending to the library to resume their pleasant labour the doctor said to himself i have passed along galleries wherein were many chambers and the doors in the day were more commonly open than shut yet this chamber door of my young friend is always shut there must be a mystery in it and the doctor not generally given to morbid curiosity found himself very curious about this very simple matter at last he mustered up courage to say i have seen your library diningroom and drawingroom but you have so much taste in internal arrangements i should like to see the rest of the house mr falconer there is not much more to see you have occupied one of the best bedrooms the rest do not materially differ the rev dr opimian to say the truth i should like to see your own mr falconer i am quite willing but i have thought perhaps erroneously it is decorated in a manner you might not altogether approve the rev dr opimian nothing indecorous i hope mr falconer quite the contrary you may perhaps think it too much devoted to my peculiar views of the purity of ideal beauty as developed in saint catharine the rev dr opimian you have not much to apprehend on that score mr falconer you see there is an altar with an image of saint catharine and the panels of the room are painted with subjects from her life mostly copied from italian masters the pictures of st catharine and her legend very early impressed her on my mind as the type of ideal beautyof all that can charm irradiate refine exalt in the best of the better sex the rev dr opimian you are enthusiastic but indeed though she is retained as a saint in the reformed church i am not very familiar with her history and to me some of these pictures require explanation mr falconer i will tell you her legend as briefly as i may and we will pass from picture to picture as the subjects arise the legend of saint catharine catharine was a princess of alexandria in the third century she embraced the christian religion by divine inspiration she was preeminent in beauty learning and discourse she converted her father and mother and all with whom she came into communication the emperor maxentius brought together the fifty wisest men of the empire to convert her from the error of her way and she converted them all to the new faith maxentius burned her proselytes and threatened her with a similar death she remained firm he had her publicly scourged and cast her into prison to perish by famine going on an expedition he left the execution of his orders to the empress and his chief general porphyrius angels healed her wounds and supplied her with food and in a beatific vision the saviour of the world placed a ring on her finger and called her his bride the presence of the ring showed to her the truth of the visitation the empress and porphyrius visited the prison and she converted them also the emperor returning put the empress and porphyrius to death and after many ineffectual expostulations with catharine determined on putting her to death by the wheel which bears her name maria vergine delle vergini e misericordia delle misericordie vestita de i lampi del sole e coronata de i raggi delle stelle prese il sottile il delicato ed il sacro dito di catarina humile di core e mansueta di vita ed il largo il clmente ed il pictoso figliuol suo o cinse con lo anellovita di santa catarina ii vinegia four of these wheels armed with iron teeth and revolving towards each other were to cut her to pieces angels broke the wheels he then brought her to the stake and the angels extinguished the flames he then ordered her to be beheaded by the sword this was permitted and in the meantime the day had closed the body reserved for exposure to wild beasts was left under guard at the place of execution intense darkness fell on the night and in the morning the body had disappeared the angels had borne it to the summit of the loftiest mountain of the horeb range where still a rock bearing the form of a natural sarcophagus meets the eye of the traveller here it was watched by angelguards and preserved in unchanging beauty till in the fulness of time it was revealed to a holy man who removed it to the shrine under which it lies to this day with the ring still on its hand in the convent which was then founded and which bears her namethe convent saint catharine of mount sinai the rev dr opimian most of this is new to me yet i am not unfamiliar with pictures of the marriage of saint catharine which was a favourite subject with the great italian masters but here is a picture which the legend as you have related it does not illustrate what is this tomb with flames bursting from it and monks and others recoiling in dismay mr falconer it represents a remarkable incident at the tomb of the saint the empress catharine ii was a great benefactress to the convent of mount sinai and desired to possess saint catharines ring she sent a mitred abbot as an envoy to request it from the brotherhood the monks unwilling to displease the empress replied that they did not dare to remove it themselves but that they would open the tomb and the envoy might take it they opened the tomb accordingly and the envoy looked on the hand and the ring he approached to draw it off but flames burst forth he recoiled and the tomb closed under such a manifestation of the saints displeasure the fathers could not again attempt to open it illustrations of jerusalem and mount sinai p the rev dr opimian i should like to have seen the empress receiving the envoys report mr falconer her reception of it would depend on the degree of faith which she either actually felt or might have thought it politic to assume at any rate the fathers had shown their devotion and afforded her a good opportunity for exhibiting hers she did not again seek to obtain the ring the rev dr opimian now what are these three pictures in one frame of chapels on hills mr falconer these chapels are here represented as they may be supposed to have been in the catholic days of england three sisters named catharine martha and anne built them to their namesake saints on the summits of three hills which took from these dedications the names they still bear from the summit of each of these chapels the other two were visible the sisters thought the chapels would long remain memorials of catholic piety and sisterly love the reformation laid them in ruins nothing remains of the chapel of st anne but a few gray stones built into an earthen wall which some halfcentury ago enclosed a plantation the hill is now better known by the memory of charles fox than by that of its ancient saint the chapel of saint martha has been restored and applied to protestant worship the chapel of saint catharine remains a picturesque ruin on the banks of the wey near guildford the rev dr opimian and that old church mr falconer that was the church of saint catharine which was pulled down to make way for the dock by which her name is now profaned an act of desecration which has been followed by others and will be followed by many more whenever it may suit the interests of commerce to commit sacrilege on consecrated ground and dissipate the ashes of the dead an act which even when that of a barbarian invader horace thought it would be profanation even to look on whatever may be in other respects the superiority of modern piety we are far inferior to the ancients in reverence for temples and tombs the saint whom i have chosen frequently to my mind the most perfect ideality of physical moral and intellectual beauty the rev dr opimian i am afraid i cannot gainsay that observation but what is that stained glass window mr falconer it is copied on a smaller scale and with more of italian artistic beauty in the principal figure from the window in west wickham church she is trampling on the emperor maxentius you see all her emblems the palm which belongs to all sainted martyrs the crown the wheel the fire the sword which belong especially to her and the book with which she is always represented as herself a miracle of learning and its chosen universal patroness in the schools of the middle ages the rev dr opimian unquestionably the legend is interesting at present your faith is simply poetical but take care my young friend that you do not finish by becoming the dupe of your own mystification mr falconer i have no fear of that i think i can clearly distinguish devotion to ideal beauty from superstitious belief i feel the necessity of some such devotion to fill up the void which the world as it is leaves in my mind i wish to believe in the presence of some local spiritual influence genius or nymph linking us by a medium of something like human feeling but more pure and more exalted to the allpervading creative and preservative spirit of the universe but cannot realise it from things as they are everything is too deeply tinged with sordid vulgarity there can be no intellectual power resident in a wood where the only inscription is not genio loci but trespassers will be prosecuted no naiad in a stream that turns a cottonmill no oread in a mountain dell where a railway train deposits a cargo of vandals no nereids or oceanitides along the seashore where a coastguard is watching for smugglers no the intellectual life of the material world is dead imagination cannot replace it but the intercession of saints still forms a link between the visible and invisible in their symbols i can imagine their presence each in the recess of our own thought we may preserve their symbols from the intrusion of the world and the saint whom i have chosen presents to my mind the most perfect ideality of physical moral and intellectual beauty epod illustration perfect ideality of beauty the rev dr opimian i cannot object to your taste but i hope you will not be led into investing the ideality with too much of the semblance of reality i should be sorry to find you far gone in hagiolatry i hope you will acquiesce in martin keeping equally clear of peter and jack mr falconer nothing will more effectually induce me so to acquiesce than your company dear doctor a tolerant liberality like yours has a very persuasive influence from this digression the two friends proceeded to the arrangement of their aristophanic comedy and divided their respective shares after the manner of beaumont and fletcher chapter x the thunderstorm si bene calculum ponas ubique naufragium est petronius arbiter if you consider well the events of life shipwreck is everywhere after luncheon the doctor thought of returning home when a rumbling of distant thunder made him pause they reascended the tower to reconnoitre the elements from the library the windows were so arranged as to afford a panoramic view the thunder muttered far off but there was neither rain nor visible lightning the storm is at a great distance said the doctor and it seems to be passing away on the verge of the sky but on the opposite horizon appeared a mass of darkblue cloud which rose rapidly and advanced in the direct line of the tower before it rolled a lighter but still lurid volume of vapour which curled and wreathed like eddying smoke before the denser blackness of the unbroken cloud simultaneously followed the flashing of lightning the rolling of thunder and a deluge of rain like the bursting of a waterspout they sate some time in silence watching the storm as it swept along with wind and driving rain and whirling hail bringing for a time almost the darkness of night through which the forked lightning poured a scarcely interrupted blaze suddenly came a long dazzling flash that seemed to irradiate the entire circumference of the sky followed instantaneously by one of those crashing peals of thunder which always indicate that something very near has been struck by the lightning the doctor turned round to make a remark on the awful grandeur of the effect when he observed that his young friend had disappeared on his return he said he had been looking for what had been struck and what was said the doctor nothing in the house said his host the vestals thought the doctor these were all his solicitude but though mr falconer had looked no farther than to the safety of the seven sisters his attention was soon drawn to a tumult below which seemed to indicate that some serious mischief had resulted from the lightning and the youngest of the sisters appearing in great trepidation informed him that one of two horses in a gentlemans carriage had been struck dead and that a young lady in the carriage had been stunned by the passing flash though how far she was injured by it could not be immediately known the other horse it appeared had been prancing in terror and had nearly overthrown the carriage but he had been restrained by the vigorous arm of a young farmer who had subsequently carried the young lady into the house where she was now resting on a couch in the female apartments and carefully attended by the sisters illustration the other horse prancing in terror mr falconer and the doctor descended into the hall and were assured that the young lady was doing well but that she would be much better for being left some time longer undisturbed an elderly gentleman issued from the female apartments and the doctor with some amazement recognised his friend mr gryll to whom and his niece this disaster had occurred the beauty of the morning had tempted them to a long drive and they thought it would be a good opportunity to gratify at least a portion of the curiosity which the doctors description of the folly and its inhabitants had excited in them they had therefore determined on taking a circuit in which they would pass under the walls of the tower they were almost at the extremity of their longest radius when the storm burst over them and were just under the tower when the lightning struck one of their horses harry hedgerow was on his way with some farm produce when the accident occurred and was the young farmer who had subdued the surviving horse and carried the young lady into the house mr gryll was very panegyrical of this young mans behaviour and the doctor when he recognised him shook him heartily by the hand and told him he felt sure that he was a lad who would make his way a remark which harry received as a good omen for dorothy heard it and looked at him with a concurrent though silent approbation the drawingroom and the chambers for visitors were between the tower and the gynoceum or female apartments which were as completely separated from the rest of the house as they could have been in athens after some anxious inquiries it was reported that the young lady was sleeping and that one or other of the sisters would keep constant watch by her it was therefore arranged that mr gryll should dine and pass the night where he was before dinner he had the satisfaction of hearing from medical authority that all would be well after a little time harry hedgerow had bethought him of a retired physician who lived with a maiden sister in a cottage at no great distance from the tower and who often gave gratuitous advice to his poorer neighbours if he prescribed anything beyond their means himself or his sister was always ready to supply it though their own means were limited they were the good angels of a small circumference the old physician confirmed the opinion already given by the sisters that the young lady for the present only required repose but he accepted the invitation to remain till the morning in the event of his advice being needed so miss gryll remained with the elder sisters mr gryll and the two doctors spiritual and temporal sat down to dinner with mr falconer and were waited on as usual by the younger handmaids chapter xi electrical sciencethe death of philemon where wine is not no mirth the banquet knows where wine is not the dance all joyless goes the man oppressed with cares who tastes the bowl shall shake the weight of sorrow from his soul bacchus on the birth of the vine predicting its benefits in the twelfth book of the dionysiaca of nonnus the conversation at dinner turned on the occurrences of the morning and the phenomena of electricity the physician who had been a traveller related many anecdotes from his own observation especially such as tended to show by similarity that the injury to miss gryll would not be of long duration he had known in similar cases instances of apparent total paralysis but he had always found it temporary perhaps in a day or two but at most in a very few days it would certainly pass away in the meantime he recommended absolute repose mr falconer entreated mr gryll to consider the house as his own matters were arranged accordingly and it was determined that the next morning a messenger should be despatched to gryll grange for a supply of apparel the rev dr opimian who was as fond as the squire himself of the young lady had been grievously discomposed by the accident of the morning and felt that he should not thoroughly recover his serenity till he could again see her in her proper character the light and life of her society he quoted homer schylus aristotle plutarch athenaeus horace persius and pliny to show that all which is practically worth knowing on the subject of electricity had been known to the ancients the electric telegraph he held to be a nuisance as disarranging chronology and giving only the heads of a chapter of which the details lost their interest before they arrived the heads of another chapter having intervened to destroy it then what an amount of misery it inflicted when merely saying that there had been a great battle and that thousands had been wounded or killed it maintained an agony of suspense in all who had friends on the field till the ordinary channels of intelligence brought the names of the suflferers no sicilian tyrant had invented such an engine of cruelty this declamation against a supposed triumph of modern science which was listened to with some surprise by the physician and with great respect by his other auditors having somewhat soothed his troubled spirit in conjunction with the physicians assurance he propitiated his genius by copious libations of claret pronouncing high panegyrics on the specimen before him and interspersing quotations in praise of wine as the one great panacea for the cares of this world a week passed away and the convalescent had made good progress mr falconer had not yet seen his fair guest six of the sisters one remaining with miss gryll performed every evening at the earnest request of mr gryll a great variety of music but always ending with the hymn to their masters saint the old physician came once or twice and stayed the night the reverend doctor opimian went home for his sunday duties but took too much interest in the fair morgana not to return as soon as he could to the tower arriving one morning in the first division of the day and ascending to the library he found his young friend writing he asked him if he were working on the aristophanic comedy mr falconer said he got on best with that in the doctors company but i have been writing he said on something connected with the athenian drama i have been writing a ballad on the death of philemon as told by suidas and apuleius the doctor expressed a wish to hear it and mr falconer read it to him the death of philemon suidas sub voce greek apuleius florid closed was philemons hundredth year the theatre was thronged to hear his last completed play in the mid scene a sudden rain dispersed the crowdto meet again on the succeeding day he sought his home and slept and dreamed nine maidens through his door it seemed passed to the public street he asked them why they left his home they said a guest will hither come we must not stay to meet he called his boy with morning light told him the vision of the night and bade his play be brought his finished page again he scanned resting his head upon his hand absorbed in studious thought he knew not what the dream foreshowed that nought divine may hold abode where deaths dark shade is felt and therefore were the muses nine leaving the old poetic shrine where they so long had dwelt ii the theatre was thronged once more more thickly than the day before to hear the halfheard song the day wore on impatience came they called upon philemons name with murmurs loud and long some sought at length his studious cell and to the stage returned to tell what thousands strove to ask the poet we have been to seek sate with his hand upon his cheek as pondering oer his task we spoke he made us no reply we reverentially drew nigh and twice our errand told he answered not we drew more near the awful mystery then was clear we found him stiff and cold struck by so fair a death we stood awhile in sad admiring mood then hastened back to say that he the praised and loved of all is deaf for ever to your call that on this selfsame day when here presented should have been the close of his fictitious scene his lifes true scene was oer we seemed in solemn silence awed to hear the farewell and applaud which he may speak no more of tears the rain gave prophecy the nuptial dance of comedy yields to the funeral train assemble where his pyre must burn honour his ashes in their urn and on another day return to hear his songs again the rev dr opimian a beautiful fiction mr falconer if it be a fiction the supernatural is confined to the dream all the rest is probable and i am willing to think it true dream and all the rev dr opimian you are determined to connect the immaterial with the material world as far as you can mr falconer i like the immaterial world i like to live among thoughts and images of the past and the possible and even of the impossible now and then the rev dr opimian certainly there is much in the material world to displease sensitive and imaginative minds but i do not know any one who has less cause to complain of it than you have you are surrounded with all possible comforts and with all the elements of beauty and of intellectual enjoyment mr falconer it is not my own world that i complain of it is the world on which i look from the loopholes of retreat i cannot sit here like one of the gods of epicurus who as cicero says was satisfied with thinking through all eternity how comfortable he was i look with feelings of intense pain on the mass of poverty and crime of unhealthy unavailing unremunerated toil blighting childhood in its blossom and womanhood in its prime of all the oppressions that are done under the sun comprehende igitur animo et propone ante oculos deura nihil aliud in omni aeternitate nisi mihi pulchre est et ego beatus sum cogitant emcicero de natura deorum i c the rev dr opimian i feel with you on all these points but there is much good in the world more good than evil i have always maintained they would have gone off in a discussion on this point but the french cook warned them to luncheon in the evening the young lady was sufficiently recovered to join the little party in the drawingroom which consisted as before of mr falconer mr gryll doctor anodyne and the reverend doctor opimian miss gryll was introduced to mr falconer she was full of grateful encomium for the kind attention of the sisters and expressed an earnest desire to hear their music the wish was readily complied with she heard them with great pleasure and though not yet equal to much exertion she could not yet refrain from joining in with them in their hymn to saint catharine she accompanied them when they retired the rev dr opimian i presume those latin words are genuine old monastic verses they have all the air of it mr falconer they are so and they are adapted to old music dr anodyne there is something in this hymn very solemn and impressive in an age like ours in which music and pictures are the predominant tastes i do not wonder that the forms of the old catholic worship are received with increasing favour there is a sort of adhesion to the old religion which results less from faith than from a certain feeling of poetry it finds its disciples but it is of modern growth and has very essential differences from what it outwardly resembles the rev dr opimian it is as i have frequently had occasion to remark and as my young friend here will readily admit one of the many forms of the love of ideal beauty which without being in itself religion exerts on vivid imaginations an influence that is very often like it mr falconer an orthodox english churchman was the poet who sang to the virgin thy image fells to earth yet some i ween not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend as to a visible power in which did blend all that was mixed and reconciled in thee of mothers love with maiden purity of high with low celestial with terrene wordsworth ecclesiastical sonnets i the rev dr opimianwell my young friend the love of ideal beauty has exercised none but a benignant influence on you whatever degree of orthodoxy there may be in your view of it the little party separated for the night chapter xii the forest dellthe power of lovethe lottery of marriage greek passage philetaerus cynagis i pray you what can mortal man do better than live his daily life as pleasantly as daily means avail him lifes frail tenure warns not to trust tomorrow the next day mr falconer was perfectly certain that miss gryll was not yet well enough to be removed no one was anxious to refute the proposition they were all so well satisfied withthe place and the company they were in that they felt the young lady included a decided unwillingness to go that day miss gryll came to dinner and the next day she came to breakfast and in the evening she joined in the music and in short she was once more altogether herself but mr falconer continued to insist that the journey home would be too much for her when this excuse failed he still entreated his new friends to remain and so passed several days at length mr gryll found he must resolve on departing especially as the time had arrived when he expected some visitors he urgently invited mr falconer to visit him in return the invitation was cordially accepted and in the meantime considerable progress had been made in the aristophanic comedy mr falconer after the departure of his visitors went up into his library he took down one book after another but they did not fix his attention as they used to do he turned over the leaves of homer and read some passages about circe then took down bojardo and read of morgana and falerina and dragontina then took down tasso and read of armida he would not look at ariostos alcina because her change into an old woman destroyed all the charm of the previous picture he dwelt on the enchantress who remained in unaltered beauty but even this he did only by fits and starts and found himself continually wandering away towards a more enchanting reality he descended to his bedroom and meditated on ideal beauty in the portraits of saint catharine but he could not help thinking that the ideal might be real at least in one instance and he wandered down into his drawingroom there he sat absorbed in thought till his two young handmaids appeared with his luncheon he smiled when he saw them and sat down to the table as if nothing had disturbed him then taking his stick and his dog he walked out into the forest there was within moderate distance a deep dell in the bottom of which ran a rivulet very small in dry weather but in heavy rains becoming a torrent which had worn itself a highbanked channel winding in fantastic curves from side to side of its narrow boundaries above this channel old forest trees rose to a great height on both sides of the dell the slope every here and there was broken by promontories which during centuries the fall of the softer portions of the soil had formed and on these promontories were natural platforms covered as they were more or less accessible to the sun with grass and moss and fern and foxglove and every variety of forest vegetation these platforms were favourite resorts of deer which imparted to the wild scene its own peculiar life this was a scene in which but for the deeper and deeper wear of the floods and the bolder falls of the promontories time had made little change the eyes of the twelfth century had seen it much as it appeared to those of the nineteenth the ghosts of departed ages might seem to pass through it in succession with all their changes of faith and purpose and manners and costume to a man who loved to dwell in the past there could not be a more congenial scene one old oak stood in the centre of one of the green platforms and a portion of its gnarled roots presented a convenient seat mr falconer had frequently passed a day here when alone the deer had become too accustomed to him to fly at his approach and the dog had been too well disciplined to molest them there he had sat for hours at a time reading his favourite poets illustration reading his favourite poets there was no great poet with some of whose scenes this scenery did not harmonise the deep woods that surrounded the dwelling of circe the obscure sylvan valley in which dante met virgil the forest depths through which angelica fled the enchanted wood in which rinaldo met the semblance of armida the forestbrook by which jaques moralised over the wounded deer were all reproduced in this single spot and fancy peopled it at pleasure with nymphs and genii fauns and satyrs knights and ladies friars foresters hunters and huntress maids till the whole diurnal world seemed to pass away like a vision there for him matilda had gathered flowers on the opposite bank laura had risen from one of the little poolsrestingplaces of the streamto seat herself in the shade rosalind and maid marian had peeped forth from their alleys green all different in form in feature and in apparel but now they were all one each as she rose in imagination presented herself under the aspect of the newlyknown morgana dante purgatorio c or in forma di ninfa o d altra diva che del pi chiaro fondo di sorga esca e pongasi a seder in sulla riva petrarca sonetto finding his old imaginations thus disturbed he arose and walked home he dined alone drank a bottle of madeira as if it had been so much water summoned the seven sisters to the drawingroom earlier and detained them later than usual till their music and its old associations had restored him to something like tranquillity he had always placed the summum bonum of life in tranquillity and not in excitement he felt that his path was now crossed by a disturbing force and determined to use his utmost exertions to avoid exposing himself again to its influence in this mood the reverend doctor opimian found him one morning in the library reading he sprang up to meet the divine exclaiming ah dear doctor i am very glad to see you have you any special favourite among the odes of pindar the doctor thought this an odd question for the first salutation he had expected that the first inquiry would have been for the fair convalescent he divined that the evasion of this subject was the result of an inward struggle he thought it would be best to fall in with the mood of the questioner and said charles foxs favourite is said to have been the second olympic i am not sure that there is or can be anything better what say you mr falconer it may be that something in it touches a peculiar tone of feeling but to me there is nothing like the ninth pythian the rev dr opimian i can understand your fancy for that ode you see an image of ideal beauty in the nymph cyrene mr falconer hidden are the keys of wise persuasion of sacred endearments seems a strange phrase in english but in greek the words invest a charming sentiment with singular grace fit words to words as closely as we may the difference of the mind which utters them fails to reproduce the true semblance of the thought the difference of the effect produced as in this instance by exactly corresponding words can only be traced to the essential difference of the greek and the english mind greek passagepindar the rev dr opimian and indeed as with the words so with the image we are charmed by cyrene wrestling with the lion but we should scarcely choose an english girl so doing as the type of ideal beauty mr falconer we must draw the image of cyrene not from an english girl but from a greek statue the rev dr opimian unless a man is in love and then to him all images of beauty take something of the form and features of his mistress mr falconer that is to say a man in love sees everything through a false medium it must be a dreadful calamity to be in love the rev dr opimian surely not when all goes well with it mr falconer to me it would be the worst of all mischances the rev dr opimian every man must be subject to love once in his life it is useless to contend with him love says sophocles is unconquered in battle and keeps his watch in the soft cheeks of beauty mr falconer i am afraid doctor the morgana to whom you have introduced me is a veritable enchantress you find me here determined to avoid the spell the rev dr opimian pardon me you were introduced as jupiter was to semele by thunder and lightning which was happily not quite as fatal mr falconer i must

presume doctor from the complacency with which you speak of love you have had no cause to complain of him the rev dr opimian quite the contrary i have been an exception to the rule that the course of true love never did run smooth nothing could run more smooth than mine i was in love i proposed i was accepted no crossings before no bickerings after i drew a prize in the lottery of marriage mr falconer it strikes me doctor that the lady may say as much the rev dr opimian i have made it my study to give her cause to say so and i have found my reward mr falconer still yours is an exceptional case for as far as my reading and limited observation have shown me there are few happy marriages it has been said by an old comic poet that a man who brings a wife into his house brings into it with her either a good or an evil genius and i may add from juvenal the gods only know which it will be greek passage theodectes apud stobaeum conjugium petimus partumque uxoris at illis notum qui pueri

desire to see you you ought to be there to assist in the preliminary arrangements mr falconer before you came i had determined not to go for to tell you the truth i am afraid of falling in love the rev dr opimian it is not such a fearful matter many have been the better for it many have been cured of it it is one of those disorders which every one must have once mr falconer the later the better the rev dr opimian no the later the worse if it falls into a season when it cannot be reciprocated mr falconer that is just the season for it if i were sure that it would not be reciprocated i think i should be content to have gone through it the rev dr opimian do you think it would be reciprocated mr falconer oh no i only think it possible that it might be the rev dr opimian well there is a gentleman doing his best to bring about your wish mr falconer indeed who the rev dr opimian a visitor at the grange who seems in great favour with both uncle and niecelord curryfin mr falconer lord curryfin i never heard you speak of him but as a person to be laughed at the rev dr opimian that was my impression of him before i knew him barring his absurdities in the way of lecturing on fish and of shining in absurd company in the science of pantopragmatics he has very much to recommend him and i discover in him one quality which is invaluable he does all he can to make himself agreeable to all about him and he has great tact in seeing how to do it in any intimate relation of lifewith a reasonable wife for instancehe would be the pink of a good husband the doctor was playing not altogether unconsciously the part of an innocent iago he only said what was true and he said it with a good purpose for with all his repeated resolutions against matchmaking he could not dismiss from his mind the wish to see his young friends come together and he would not have liked to see lord curryfin carry off the prize through mr falconers neglect of his opportunity jealousy being the test of love he thought a spice of it might be not unseasonably thrown in mr falconer notwithstanding your example doctor love is to be avoided because marriage is at best a dangerous experiment the

above all things children the great blessing of old age the one that never fails if all else fail is a daughter mr falconer all daughters are not good the rev dr opimian most are of all relations in life it is the least disappointing where parents do not so treat their daughters as to alienate their affections which unhappily many do mr falconer you do not say so much for sons the rev dr opimian young men are ambitious selfwilled selfindulgent easily corrupted by bad example of which there is always too much i cannot say much for those of the present day though it is not absolutely destitute of good specimens mr falconer you know what paterculus says of those of his own day the rev dr opimian the faith of wives towards the proscribed was great of freedmen middling of slaves some of sons none so he says but there were some for example of the sons of marcus oppius and quintus cicero you may observe by the way he gives the first place to the wives id tamen nolandum est fuisse in

proscription of the second triumvirate will be found in freinihemius suppununta liviania cxx mr falconer well that is a lottery in which every man must take his chance but my scheme of life was perfect the rev dr opimian perhaps there is something to be said against condemning seven young women to celibacy mr falconer but if such were their choice the rev dr opimian no doubt there are many reasons why they should prefer the condition they are placed in to the ordinary chances of marriage but after all to be married is the natural aspiration of a young woman and if favourable conditions presented themselves mr falconer conditions suitable to their education are scarcely compatible with their social position the rev dr opimian they have been educated to be both useful and ornamental the ornamental need not and in their case certainly does not damage the useful which in itself would procure them suitable matches mr falconer shook his head and after a brief pause poured out a volume of quotations demonstrating the general unhappiness of marriage the doctor responded by as many demonstrating the contrary he paused to take breath both laughed heartily but the result of the discussion and the laughter was that mr falconer was curious to see lord curryfin and would therefore go to gryll grange chapter xiii lord curryfinsiberian dinnerssocial monotony ille potens sui

the joys i have possessed in spite of fate are mine not heaven itself upon the past has power but what has been has been and i have had my hour dryden a large party was assembled at the grange among them were some of the young ladies who were to form the chorus one elderly spinster miss ilex who passed more than half her life in visits and was everywhere welcome being always goodhumoured agreeable in conversation having much knowledge of society good sense in matters of conduct good taste and knowledge in music sound judgment in dress which alone sufficed to make her valuable to young ladies a fair amount of reading old and new and on most subjects an opinion of her own for which she had always something to say mr macborrowdale an old friend of mr gryll a gentleman who comprised in himself all that scotland had ever been supposed to possess of mental moral and political philosophy and yet he bore it not about not as being loth to wear it out but because he held that there was a time for all things and that dinner was the time for joviality and not for argument mr minim the amateur composer of the music for the comedy mr pallet the amateur painter of the scenery and last not least the newlymade acquaintance lord curryfin we grant although he had much wit h was very shy of using it as being loth to wear it out and therefore bore it not about except on holidays or so as men their best apparel do hudibras lord curryfin was a man on the younger side of thirty with a good person handsome features a powerful voice and an agreeable delivery he had a strong memory much power of application and a facility of learning rapidly whatever he turned his mind to but with all this he valued what he learned less for the pleasure which he derived from the acquisition than from the effect which it enabled him to produce on others he liked to shine in conversation and there was scarcely a subject which could be mooted in any society on which his multifarious attainments did not qualify him to say something he was readily taken by novelty in doctrine and followed a new lead with great pertinacity and in this way he had been caught by the science of pantopragmatics and firmly believed for a time that a scientific organisation for teaching everybody everything would cure all the evils of society but being one of those over sharp wits whose edges are very soon turned he did not adhere to any opinion with sufficient earnestness to be on any occasion betrayed into intemperance in maintaining it so far from this if he found any unfortunate opinion in a hopeless minority of the company he happened to be in he was often chivalrous enough to come to its aid and see what could be said for it when lecturing became a mania he had taken to lecturing and looking about for an unoccupied subject he had lighted on the natural history of fish in which he soon became sufficiently proficient to amuse the ladies and astonish the fishermen in any seaside place of fashionable resort here he always arranged his lectureroom so that the gentility of his audience could sit on a platform and the natives in a gallery above and that thus the fishy and tarry odours which the latter were most likely to bring with them might ascend into the upper air and not mingle with the more delicate fragrances that surrounded the select company below he took a summer tour to several wateringplaces and was thoroughly satisfied with his success the fishermen at first did not take cordially to him but their wives attended from curiosity and brought their husbands with them on nights not favourable to fishing and by degrees he won on their attention and they took pleasure in hearing him though they learned nothing from him that was of any use in their trade but he seemed to exalt their art in the eyes of themselves and others and he told them some pleasant anecdotes of strange fish and of perilous adventures of some of their own craft which led in due time to the crowding of his gallery the ladies went as they always will go to lectures where they fancy they learn something whether they learn anything or not and on these occasions not merely to hear the lecturer but to be seen by him to them however attractive the lecture might have been the lecturer was more so he was an irresistible temptation to matrons with marriageable daughters and wherever he sojourned he was overwhelmed with invitations it was a contest who should have him to dinner and in the simplicity of his heart he ascribed to admiration of his science and eloquence all the courtesies and compliments with which he was everywhere received he did not like to receive unreturned favours and never left a place in which he had accepted many invitations without giving in return a ball and supper on a scale of great munificence which filled up the measure of his popularity and left on all his guests a very enduring impression of a desire to see him again so his time passed pleasantly with a heart untouched by either love or care till he fell in at a dinner party with the reverend doctor opimian the doctor spoke of gryll grange and the aristophanic comedy which was to be produced at christmas and lord curryfin with his usual desire to have a finger in every pie expressed an earnest wish to be introduced to the squire this was no difficult matter the doctor had quickly brought it about and lord curryfin had gone over in the doctors company to pass a few days at the grange here in a very short time he had made himself completely at home and had taken on himself the office of architect to superintend the construction of the theatre receiving with due deference instructions on the subject from the reverend doctor opimian sufficient progress had been made in the comedy for the painter and musician to begin work on their respective portions and lord curryfin whose heart was in his work passed whole mornings in indefatigable attention to the progress of the building it was near the house and was to be approached by a covered way it was a miniature of the athenian theatre from which it differed in having a roof but it resembled it in the arrangements of the stage and orchestra and in the graduated series of semicircular seats for the audience when dinner was announced mr gryll took in miss ilex miss gryll of course took the arm of lord curryfin mr falconer took in one of the young ladies and placed her on the left hand of the host the reverend dr opimian took in another and was consequently seated between her and miss ilex mr falconer was thus as far removed as possible from the young lady of the house and was consequently though he struggled as much as possible against it frequently distrait unconsciously and unwillingly observing miss gryll and lord curryfin and making occasional observations very wide of the mark to the fair damsels on his right and left who set him down in their minds for a very odd young man the soup and fish were discussed in comparative silence the entres not much otherwise but suddenly a jubilant expression from mr macborrowdale hailed the disclosure of a large sirloin of beef which figured before mr gryll mr macborrowdale you are a man of taste mr gryll that is a handsomer ornament of a dinnertable than clusters of nosegays and all sorts of uneatable decorations i detest and abominate the idea of a siberian dinner where you just look on fiddlefaddles while your dinner is behind a screen and you are served with rations like a pauper the rev dr opimian i quite agree with mr macborrowdale i like to see my dinner and herein i rejoice to have addison on my side for i remember a paper in which he objects to having roast beef placed on a sideboard even in his day it had been displaced to make way for some incomprehensible french dishes among which he could find nothing to eat i do not know what he would have said to its being placed altogether out of sight still there is something to be said on the other side there is hardly one gentleman in twenty who knows how to carve and as to ladies though they did know once on a time they do not now what can be more pitiable than the righthand man of the lady of the house awkward enough in himself with the dish twisted round to him in the most awkward possible position digging in unutterable mortification for a joint which he cannot find and wishing the unanatomisable volaille behind a russian screen with the footmen i was now in great hunger and confusion when i thought i smelled the agreeable savour of roast beef but could not tell from which dish it arose though i did not question but it lay disguised in one of them upon turning my head i saw a noble sirloin on the sidetable smoking in the most delicious manner i had recourse to it more than once and could not see without some indignation that substantial english dish banished in so ignominious a manner to make way for french kickshawstaller no mr macborrowdale i still like to see the volaille it might be put on table with its joints divided mr gryll as that turkeypoult is mr macborrowdale which gives my niece no trouble but the precaution is not necessary with such a righthand man as lord curryfin who carves to perfection mr macborrowdale your arrangements are perfect at the last of these siberian dinners at which i had the misfortune to be present i had offered me for two of my rations the tail of a mullet and the drumstick of a fowl men who carve behind screens ought to pass a competitive examination before a jury of gastronomers men who carve at a table are drilled by degrees into something like tolerable operators by the mere shame of the public process mr gryll i will guarantee you against a siberian dinner whenever you dine with me the rev dr opimian mr gryll is a true conservative in dining mr gryll a true conservative i hope not what a soidisant conservative is practically a man who sails under national colours hauls them down and hoists the enemys like old customs i like a glass of wine with a friend what say you doctor mr macborrowdale will join us mr macborrowdale most willingly miss gryll my uncle and the doctor have got as usual into a discussion to the great amusement of the old lady who sits between them and says nothing lord curryfin perhaps their discussion is too recondite for her miss gryll no they never talk before ladies of any subject in which ladies cannot join and she has plenty to say for herself when she pleases but when conversation pleases her she likes to listen and be silent it strikes me by a few words that float this way that they are discussing the art of dining she ought to be a proficient in it for she lives much in the world and has met as many persons whom she is equally willing either to meet tomorrow or never to meet again as any regular dineur en ville and indeed that is the price that must be paid for society whatever difference of character may lie under the surface the persons you meet in its circles are externally others yet the same the same dress the same manners the same tastes and opinions real or assumed strongly defined characteristic differences are so few and artificial general resemblances so many that in every party you may always make out the same theatrical company it is like the flowing of a river it is always different water but you do not see the difference lord curryfin for my part i do not like these monotonous exteriors i like visible character your uncle and mr macborrowdale are characters then the reverend dr opimian he is not a man made to pattern he is simpleminded learned tolerant and the quintessence of bonhomie the young gentleman who arrived today the hermit of the folly is evidently a character i flatter myself i am a character laughing miss gryll laughing indeed you are or rather many characters in one i never knew a man of such infinite variety you seem always to present yourself in the aspect in which those you are with would best wish to see you there was some ambiguity in the compliment but lord curryfin took it as implying that his aspect in all its variety was agreeable to the young lady he did not then dream of a rival in the hermit of the folly chapter xiv music and paintingjack of dover greek passage anacreon i love not him who oer the winecups flow talks but of war and strife and scenes of woe but him who can the muses gifts employ to mingle love and song with festal joy the dinner and dessert passed away the ladies retired to the drawingroom the gentlemen discoursed over their wine mr macborrowdale pronounced a eulogium on the port which was cordially echoed by the divine in regard to the claret mr falconer doctor your tastes and sympathies are very much with the greeks but i doubt if you would have liked their wine condiments of seawater and turpentine must have given it an odd flavour and mixing water with it in the proportion of three to one must have reduced the strength of merely fermented liquor to something like the smallest ale of christophero sly the rev dr opimian i must say i should not like to put either salt water or turpentine into this claret they would not improve its bouquet nor to dilute it with any portion of water it has to my mind as it is just the strength it ought to have and no more but the greek taste was so exquisite in all matters in which we can bring it to the test as to justify a strong presumption that in matters in which we cannot test it it was equally correct salt water and turpentine do not suit our wine it does not follow that theirs had not in it some basis of contrast which may have made them pleasant in combination and it was only a few of their wines that were so treated lord curryfin then it could not have been much like their drink of the present day my master cannot be right in his mind said lord byrons man fletcher or he would not have left italy where we had everything to go to a country of savages there is nothing to eat in greece but tough billygoats or to drink but spirits of turpentine the rev dr opimian there is an ambiguous present which somewhat perplexes me in an epigram of rhianus here is a vessel of halfwine halfturpentine and a singularly lean specimen of kid the sender hippocrates is worthy of all praise perhaps this was a doctors present to a patient alcaeus anacreon and nonnus could not have sung as they did under the inspiration of spirit of turpentine we learn from athenseus and pliny and the old comedians that the greeks had a vast variety of wine enough to suit every variety of taste i infer the unknown from the known we know little of their music i have no doubt it was as excellent in its kind as their sculpture trelawnys recollections greek passage anthologia palatina appendix mr minim i can scarcely think that sir they seem to have had only the minor key and to have known no more of counterpoint than they did of perspective the rev dr opimian their system of painting did not require perspective their main subject was on one foreground buildings rocks trees served simply to indicate not to delineate the scene mr falconer i must demur to their having only the minor key the natural ascent of the voice is in the major key and with their exquisite sensibility to sound they could not have missed the obvious expression of cheerfulness with their three scales diatonic chromatic and enharmonic they must have exhausted every possible expression of feeling their scales were in true intervals they had really major and minor tones we have neither but a confusion of both they had both sharps and flats we have neither but a mere set of semitones which serve for both in their enharmonic scale the fineness of their ear perceived distinctions which are lost on the coarseness of ours mr minim with all that they never got beyond melody they had no harmony in our sense they sang only in unisons and octaves mr falconer it is not clear that they did not sing in fifths as to harmony in one sense i will not go so far as to say with ritson that the only use of the harmony is to spoil the melody but i will say that to my taste a simple accompaniment in strict subordination to the melody is far more agreeable than that niagara of sound under which it is now the fashion to bury it mr minim in that case you would prefer a song with a simple pianoforte accompaniment to the same song on the italian stage mr falconer a song sung with feeling and expression is good however accompanied otherwise the pianoforte is not much to my mind all its intervals are false and temperament is a poor substitute for natural intonation then its incapability of sustaining a note has led as the only means of producing effect to those infinitesimal subdivisions of sound in which all sentiment and expression are twittered and frittered into nothingness the rev dr opimian i quite agree with you the other day a band passed my gate playing the campbells are coming but instead of the fine old scotch lilt and the emphasis on oho oho what they actually played was the caaaaampbells are cooooming ohohooo ohohooo i thought to myself there is the essence and quintessence of modern music i like the old organmusic such as it was when there were no keys but c and f and every note responded to a syllable the effect of the prolonged and sustained sound must have been truly magnificent where through the longdrawn aisle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swelled the note of praise who cares to hear sacred music on a piano mr minim yet i must say that there is a great charm in that brilliancy of execution which is an exclusively modern and very modern accomplishment mr falconer to those who perceive it all things are as they are perceived to me music has no charm without expression lord curryfin who having observed mr macborrowdales determination not to be drawn into an argument amused himself with asking his opinion on all subjects what is your opinion mr macborrowdale mr macborrowdale i hold to the opinion i have already expressed that this is as good a glass of port as ever i tasted lord curryfin i mean your opinion of modern music and musical instruments mr macborrowdale the organ is very good for psalms which i never sing and the pianoforte for jigs which i never dance and if i were not to hear either of them from january to december i should not complain of the privation lord curryfin you are an utilitarian mr macborrowdale you are all for utilitypublic utilityand you see none in music mr macborrowdale nay not exactly so if devotion is good if cheerfulness is good and if music promotes each of them in proper time and place music is useful if i am as devout without the organ and as cheerful without the piano as i ever should be with them that may be the defect of my head or my ear i am not for forcing my tastes or notastes on other people let every man enjoy himself in his own way while he does not annoy others i would not deprive you of your enjoyment of a brilliant symphony and i hope you would not deprive me of my enjoyment of a glass of old wine the rev dr opimian trs mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur poscentes vario multum diversa palate three guests dissent most widely in their wishes with different taste they call for different dishes mr falconer nor our reverend friend of the pleasure of a classical quotation the rev dr opimian and the utility too sir for i think i am indebted to one for the pleasure of your acquaintance mr falconer when you did me the honour to compare my house to the palace of circe the gain was mine mr pallet you admit sir that the greeks had no knowledge of perspective the rev dr opimian observing that they had no need of it their subject was a foreground like a relievo their background was a symbol not a representation no knowledge is perhaps too strong they had it where it was essential they drew a peristyle as it appeared to the eye as accurately as we can do in short they gave to each distinct object its own proper perspective but to separate objects they did not give their relative perspective for the reason i have given that they did not need it mr falconer there is to me one great charm in their painting as we may judge from the specimens in pompeii which though not their greatest works indicate their school they never crowded their canvas with figures they presented one two three four or at most five persons preferring one and rarely exceeding three these persons were never lost in the profusion of scenery dress and decoration they had clearlydefined outlines and were agreeable objects from any part of the room in which they were placed mr pallet they must have lost much in beauty of detail the rev dr opimian therein is the essential difference of ancient and modern taste simple beautyof idea in poetry of sound in music of figure in paintingwas their great characteristic ours is detail in all these matters overwhelming detail we have not grand outlines for the imagination of the spectator or hearer to fill up his imagination has no play of its own it is overloaded with minutio and kaleidoscopical colours lord curryfin detail has its own beauty i have admired a dutch picture of a butchers shop where all the charm was in detail the rev dr opimian i cannot admire anything of the kind i must take pleasure in the thing represented before i can derive any from the representation mr pallet i am afraid sir as our favourite studies all lead us to extreme opinions you think the greek painting was the better for not having perspective and the greek music for not having harmony the rev dr opimian i think they had as much perspective and as much harmony as was consistent with that simplicity which characterised their painting and music as much as their poetry lord curryfin what is your opinion mr macborrowdale mr macborrowdale i think you may just buz that bottle before you lord curryfin i mean your opinion of greek perspective mr macborrowdale troth i am of opinion that a bottle looks smaller at a distance than when it is close by and i prefer it as a fullsized object in the foreground lord curryfin i have often wondered that a gentleman so well qualified as you are to discuss all subjects should so carefully avoid discussing any mr macborrowdale after dinner my lord after dinner i work hard all the morning at serious things sometimes till i get a headache which however does not often trouble me after dinner i like to crack my bottle and chirp and talk nonsense and fit myself for the company of jack of dover lord curryfin jack of dover who was he mr macborrowdale he was a man who travelled in search of a greater fool than himself and did not find him jacke of dover his quest of inquirie or his privy search for the veriest foole in england london reprinted for the percy society the rev dr opimian he must have lived in odd times in our days he would not have gone far without falling in with a teetotaller or a decimal coinage man or a schoolforall man or a competitive examination man who would not allow a drayman to lower a barrel into a cellar unless he could expound the mathematical principles by which he performed the operation mr macborrowdale nay that is all pragmatical fooling the fooling jack looked for was jovial fooling fooling to the top of his bent excellent fooling which under the semblance of folly was both merry and wise he did not look for mere unmixed folly of which there never was a deficiency the fool he looked for was one which it takes a wise man to makea shakespearian fool oeuvre ma foi o nest facile atteindre pourtant quil faut parfaitement sage tre pour le vrai fol bien navement feindre eutrapel p the rev dr opimian in that sense he might travel far and return as he did in his own day without having found the fool he looked for mr macborrowdale a teetotaller well he is the true heautontimorumenos the selfpunisher with a jug of toastandwater for his christmas wassail so far his folly is merely pitiable but his intolerance makes it offensive he cannot enjoy his own tipple unless he can deprive me of mine a fox that has lost his tail there is no tyrant like a thoroughpaced reformer i drink to his own reformation mr gryll he is like bababecs faquir who sat in a chair full of nails pour avoir de la considration but the faquir did not want others to do the same he wanted all the consideration for himself and kept all the nails for himself if these meddlers would do the like by their toastandwater nobody would begrudge it them the rev dr opimian now sir if the man who has fooled the greatest number of persons to the top of their bent were to be adjudged the fittest companion for jack of dover you would find him in a distinguished meddler with everything who has been for halfacentury the merryandrew of a vast arena which he calls moral and political science but which has in it a dash of everything that has ever occupied human thought lord curryfin i know whom you mean but he is a great man in his way and has done much good the rev dr opimian he has helped to introduce much change whether for good or for ill remains to be seen i forgot he was your lordships friend i apologise and drink to his health lord curryfin oh pray do not apologise to me i would not have my friendships tastes pursuits and predilections interfere in the slightest degree with the fullest liberty of speech on all persons and things there are many who think with you that he is a moral and political jack of dover so be it time will bring him to his level mr macborrowdale i will only say of the distinguished personage that jack of dover would not pair off with him this is the true universal science the oracle of la dive bouteille mr gryll it is not exactly greek music mr minim that you are giving us for our aristophanic choruses mr minim no sir i have endeavoured to give you a good selection as appropriate as i can make it mr pallet neither am i giving you greek painting for the scenery i have taken the liberty to introduce perspective the rev dr opimian very rightly both for aristophanes in london mr minim besides sir we must have such music as your young ladies can sing the rev dr opimian assuredly and so far as we have yet heard them rehearse they sing it delightfully after a little more desultory conversation they adjourned to the drawingrooms chapter xv expression in musicthe dappled palfreylove and agecompetitive examination greek passage anthologia palatina v this this is life when pleasure drives out care short is the span of time we each may share today while love wine song the hours adorn today we live none know the coming morn lord curryfins assiduities to miss gryll had discomposed mr falconer more than he chose to confess to himself lord curryfin on entering the drawingrooms went up immediately to the young lady of the house and mr falconer to the amazement of the reverend doctor sat down in the outer drawingroom on a sofa by the side of miss ilex with whom he entered into conversation in the inner drawingroom some of the young ladies were engaged with music and were entreated to continue their performance some of them were conversing or looking over new publications after a brilliant symphony performed by one of the young visitors in which runs and crossings of demisemiquavers in tempo prestissimo occupied the principal share mr falconer asked miss ilex how she liked it miss ilex i admire it as a splendid piece of legerdemain but it expresses nothing mr falconer it is well to know that such things can be done and when we have reached the extreme complications of art we may hope to return to nature and simplicity miss ilex not that it is impossible to reconcile execution and expression rubini identified the redundancies of ornament with the overflowings of feeling and the music of donizetti furnished him most happily with the means of developing this power i never felt so transported out of myself as when i heard him sing tu che al ciel spiegasti l ali mr falconer do you place donizetti above mozart miss ilex oh surely not but for supplying expressive music to a singer like rubini i think donizetti has no equal at any rate no superior for music that does not require and does not even suit such a singer but which requires only to be correctly interpreted to be universally recognised as the absolute perfection of melody harmony and expression i think mozart has none beethoven perhaps he composed only one opera fidelio but what an opera that is what an effect in the sudden change of the key when leonora throws herself between her husband and pizarro and again in the change of the key with the change of the scene when we pass from the prison to the hall of the palace what pathos in the songs of affection what grandeur in the songs of triumph what wonderful combinations in the accompaniments where a perpetual stream of countermelody creeps along in the bass yet in perfect harmony with the melody above mr falconer what say you to haydn miss ilex haydn has not written operas and my principal experience is derived from the italian theatre but his music is essentially dramatic it is a full stream of perfect harmony in subjection to exquisite melody and in simple balladstrains that go direct to the heart he is almost supreme and alone think of that air with which every one is familiar my mother bids me bind my hair the graceful flow of the first part the touching effect of the semitones in the second with true intonation and true expression the less such an air is accompanied the better mr falconer there is a beauty and an appeal to the heart in ballads which will never lose its effect except on those with whom the pretence of fashion overpowers the feeling of nature braham said something like this to a parliamentary committee on theatres in miss ilex it is strange however what influence that pretence has in overpowering all natural feelings not in music alone is it not curious thought the doctor that there is only one old woman in the room and that my young friend should have selected her for the object of his especial attention but a few simple notes struck on the ear of his young friend who rose from the sofa and approached the singer the doctor took his place to cut off his retreat miss gryll who though a proficient in all music was particularly partial to ballads had just begun to sing one illustration in vain was pursuit though some followed pellmell the dappled palfrey founded on le vair palefroi among the fabliaux published by barbazan my traitorous uncle has wooed for himself her father has sold her for land and for pelf my steed for whose equal the world they might search in mockery they borrow to bear her to church oh there is one path through the forest so green where thou and i only my palfrey have been we traversed it oft when i rode to her bower to tell my love tale through the rift of the tower thou knowst not my words but thy instinct is good by the road to the church lies the path through the wood thy instinct is good and her love is as true thou wilt see thy way homeward dear palfrey adieu they feasted full late and full early they rose and churchward they rode more than half in a doze the steed in an instant broke off from the throng and pierced the green path which he bounded along in vain was pursuit though some followed pellmell through bramble and thicket they floundered and fell on the backs of their coursers some dozed as before and missed not the bride till they reached the church door the knight from his keep on the forestbound gazed the drawbridge was down the portcullis was raised and true to his hope came the palfrey amain with his only loved lady who checked not the rein the drawbridge went up the portcullis went down the chaplain was ready with bell book and gown the wreck of the bridetrain arrived at the gate the bride showed the ring and they muttered too late not too late for a feast though too late for a fray whats done cant be undone make peace while you may so spake the young knight and the old ones complied and quaffed a deep health to the bridegroom and bride mr falconer had listened to the ballad with evident pleasure he turned to resume his place on the sofa but finding it preoccupied by the doctor he put on a look of disappointment which seemed to the doctor exceedingly comic surely thought the doctor he is not in love with the old maid miss gryll gave up her place to a young lady who in her turn sang a ballad of a different character love and age i played with you mid cowslips blowing when i was six and you were four when garlands weaving flowerballs throwing were pleasures soon to please no more through groves and meads oer grass and heather with little playmates to and fro we wandered hand in hand together but that was sixty years ago you grew a lovely roseate maiden and still our early love was strong still with no care our days were laden they glided joyously along and i did love you very dearly how dearly words want power to show i thought your heart was touched as nearly but that was fifty years ago then other lovers came around you your beauty grew from year to year and many a splendid circle found you the centre of its glittering sphere i saw you then first vows forsaking on rank and wealth your hand bestow oh then i thought my heart was breaking but that was forty years ago and i lived on to wed another no cause she gave me to repine and when i heard you were a mother i did not wish the children mine my own young flock in fair progression made up a pleasant christmas row my joy in them was past expression but that was thirty years ago you grew a matron plump and comely you dwelt in fashions brightest blaze my earthly lot was far more homely but i too had my festal days no merrier eyes have ever glistened around the hearthstones wintry glow than when my youngest child was christened but that was twenty years ago time passed my eldest girl was married and i am now a grandsire gray one pet of four years old ive carried among the wildflowered meads to play in our old fields of childish pleasure where now as then the cowslips blow she fills her baskets ample measure and that is not ten years ago but though first loves impassioned blindness has passed away in colder light i still have thought of you with kindness and shall do till our last goodnight the everrolling silent hours will bring a time we shall not know when our young days of gathering flowers will be an hundred years ago miss ilex that is a melancholy song but of how many first loves is it the true tale and how many are far less happy the rev dr opimian it is simple and well sung with a distinctness of articulation not often heard miss ilex that young ladys voice is a perfect contralto it is singularly beautiful and i applaud her for keeping within her natural compass and not destroying her voice by forcing it upwards as too many do the rev dr opimian forcing forcing seems to be the rule of life a young lady who forces her voice into altissimo and a young gentleman who forces his mind into a receptacle for a chaos of crudities are pretty much on a par both do ill where if they were contented with attainments within the limits of natural taste and natural capacity they might both do well as to the poor young men many of them become mere crammed fowls with the same result as hermogenes who after astonishing the world with his attainments at seventeen came to a sudden end at the age of twentyfive and spent the rest of a long life in hopeless imbecility miss ilex the poor young men can scarcely help themselves they are not held qualified for a profession unless they have overloaded their understanding with things of no use in it incongruous things too which could never be combined into the pursuits of natural taste the rev dr opimian very true brindley would not have passed as a canalmaker nor edward williams as a bridgebuilder i saw the other day some examination papers which would have infallibly excluded marlborough from the army and nelson from the navy i doubt if haydn would have passed as a composer before a committee of lords like one of his pupils who insisted on demonstrating to him that he was continually sinning against the rules of counterpoint on which haydn said to him i thought i was to teach you but it seems you are to teach me and i do not want a preceptor and thereon he wished his lordship a goodmorning fancy watt being asked how much joan of naples got for avignon when she sold it to pope clement the sixth and being held unfit for an engineer because he could not tell the builder of pontypryd miss ilex that is an odd question doctor but how much did she get for it the rev dr opimian nothing he promised ninety thousand golden florins but he did not pay one of them and that i suppose is the profound sense of the question it is true he paid her after a fashion in his own peculiar coin he absolved her of the murder of her first husband and perhaps he thought that was worth the money but how many of our legislators could answer the question is it not strange that candidates for seats in parliament should not be subjected to competitive examination plato and persius would furnish good hints for it i should like to see honourable gentlemen having to answer such questions as are deemed necessary tests for government clerks before they would be held qualified candidates for seats in the legislature that would be something like a reform in the parliament oh that it were so and i were the examiner ha ha ha what a comedy plato alcibiades i persius sat iv the doctors hearty laugh was contagious and miss ilex joined in it mr macborrowdale came up mr macborrowdale you are as merry as if you had discovered the object of jack of dovers quest the rev dr opimian something very like it we have an honourable gentleman under competitive examination for a degree in legislative wisdom mr macborrowdale truly that is fooling competition to the top of its bent the rev dr opimian competitive examination for clerks and none for legislators is not this an anomaly ask the honourable member for muckborough on what acquisitions in history and mental and moral philosophy he founds his claim of competence to make laws for the nation he can only tell you that he has been chosen as the most conspicuous grub among the moneygrubs of his borough to be the representative of all that is sordid selfish hardhearted unintellectual and antipatriotic which are the distinguishing qualities of the majority among them ask a candidate for a clerkship what are his qualifications he may answer all that are requisite reading writing and arithmetic nonsense says the questioner do you know the number of miles in direct distance from timbuctoo to the top of chimborazo i do not says the candidate then you will not do for a clerk says the competitive examiner does moneygrub of muckborough know he does not nor anything else the clerk may be able to answer some of the questions put to him moneygrub could not answer one of them but he is very fit for a legislator mr macborrowdale eh but he is subjected to a pretty severe competitive examination of his own by what they call a constituency who just put him to the test in the art of conjuring to see if he can shift money from his own pocket into theirs without any inconvenient third party being aware

sua breve luce sasconde e il sonno eterna notte adduce tasso aminta love while youth knows its prime for mortal life can make no truce with time love for the sun goes down to rise as bright to us his transient light is veiled and sleep comes on with everlasting night lord curryfin was too much a man of the world to devote his attentions in society exclusively to one and make them the subject of special remark he left the inner drawingroom and came up to the doctor to ask him if he knew the young lady who had sung the last ballad the doctor knew her well she was miss niphet the only daughter of a gentleman of fortune residing a few miles distant lord curryfin as i looked at her while she was singing i thought of southeys description of lailas face in thadaba a broad light floated oer its marble paleness as the wind waved the fountain fire marble paleness suits her well there is something statuesque in her whole appearance i could not help thinking what an admirable camilla she would make in cimarosas orazii her features are singularly regular they had not much play but the expression of her voice was such as if she felt the full force of every sentiment she uttered the rev dr opimian i consider her to be a person of very deep feeling which she does not choose should appear on the surface she is animated in conversation when she is led into it otherwise she is silent and retiring but obliging in the extreme always ready to take part in anything that is going forward she never needs for example being twice asked to sing she is free from the vice which horace ascribes to all singers of not complying when asked and never leaving off when they have once begun if this be a general rule she is an exception to it lord curryfin i rather wonder she does not tinge her cheeks with a slight touch of artificial red just as much as would give her a sort of blushrose complexion miss ilex you will not wonder when you know her better the artificial the false in any degree however little is impossible to her she does not show all she thinks and feels but what she does show is truth itself lord curryfin and what part is she to take in the aristophanic comedy the rev dr opimian she is to be the leader of the chorus lord curryfin i have not seen her at the rehearsals the rev dr opimian so far her place has been supplied you will see her at the next in the meantime mr falconer had gone into the inner drawingroom sat down by miss gryll and entered into conversation with her the doctor observed them from a distance but with all the opportunity he had had for observation he was still undetermined in his opinion of the impression they might have made on each other it is well he said to himself that miss ilex is an old maid if she were as young as morgana i think she would win our young friends heart her mind is evidently much to his mind but so would morganas be if she could speak it as freely she does not why not to him at any rate she seems under no restraint to lord curryfin a good omen perhaps i never saw a couple so formed for each other heaven help me i cannot help harping on that string after all the vestals are the obstacle lord curryfin seeing miss niphet sitting alone at the side of the room changed his place sate down by her and entered into conversation on the topics of the day novels operas pictures and various phenomena of london life she kept up the ball with him very smartly she was every winter may and june in london mixed much in society and saw everything that was to be seen lord curryfin with all his protean accomplishments could not start a subject on which she had not something to say but she originated nothing he spoke and she answered one thing he remarked as singular that though she spoke with knowledge of many things she did not speak as with taste or distaste of any the world seemed to flow under her observation without even ruffling the surface of her interior thoughts this perplexed his versatile lordship he thought the young lady would be a subject worth studying it was clear that she was a character so far so well he felt that he should not rest satisfied till he was able to define it illustration mr pallet devoted to the scenery the theatre made rapid progress the walls were completed the building was roofed in the stage portion was so far finished as to allow mr pallet to devote every morning to the scenery the comedy was completed the music was composed the rehearsals went on with vigour but for the present in the drawingrooms illustration lord curryfin swinging over the stage miss niphet returning one morning from a walk before breakfast went into the theatre to see its progress and found lord curryfin swinging over the stage on a seat suspended by long ropes from above the visible scene he did not see her he was looking upwards not as one indulging in an idle pastime but as one absorbed in serious meditation all at once the seat was drawn up and he disappeared in the blue canvas that represented the sky she was not aware that gymnastics were to form part of the projected entertainment and went away associating the idea of his lordship as many had done before with something like a feeling of the ludicrous miss niphet was not much given to laughter but whenever she looked at lord curryfin during breakfast she could not quite suppress a smile which hovered on her lips and which was even the more forced on her by the contrast between his pantomimic disappearance and his quiet courtesy and remarkably good manners in company the lines of dryden a man so various that he seemed to be not one but all mankinds epitome passed through her mind as she looked at him lord curryfin noticed the suppressed smile but did not apprehend that it had any relation to himself he thought some graceful facetiousness had presented itself to the mind of the young lady and that she was amusing herself with her own fancy it was however to him another touch of character that lighted up her statuesque countenance with a new and peculiar beauty by degrees her features resumed their accustomed undisturbed serenity lord curryfin felt satisfied that in that aspect he had somewhere seen something like her and after revolving a series of recollections he remembered that it was a statue of melpomene there was in the park a large lake encircled with varieties of woodland and by its side was a pavilion to which miss niphet often resorted to read in an afternoon and at no great distance from it was the boathouse to which lord curryfin often resorted for a boat to row or sail on the water passing the pavilion in the afternoon he saw the young lady and entering into conversation ascertained what had so amused her in the morning he told her he had been tryingseverally by himself and collectively with the workmenthe strength of the suspending lines for the descent of the chorus of clouds in the aristophanic comedy she said she had been very ungrateful to laugh at the result of his solicitude for the safety of herself and her young friends he said that in having moved her to smile even at his expense he considered himself amply repaid from this time they often met in the pavilion that is to say he often found her reading there on his way to a boat and stopped awhile to converse with her they had always plenty to say and it resulted that he was always sorry to leave her and she was always sorry to part with him by degrees the feeling of the ludicrous ceased to be the predominant sentiment which she associated with him lamour vient sans quon y pense the days shortened and all things were sufficiently advanced to admit of rehearsals in the theatre the hours from twelve to twofrom noon to luncheonwere devoted to this pleasant pastime at luncheon there was much merriment over the recollections of the mornings work and after luncheon there was walking in the park rowing or sailing on the lake riding or driving in the adjacent country archery in a spacious field and in bad weather billiards reading in the library music in the drawingrooms battledore and shuttlecock in the hall in short all the methods of passing time agreeably which are available to good company when there are ample means and space for their exercise to say nothing of making love which lord curryfin did with all delicacy and discretiondirectly to miss gryll as he had begun and indirectly to miss niphet for whom he felt an involuntary and almost unconscious admiration he had begun to apprehend that with the former he had a dangerous rival in the hermit of the folly and he thought the latter had sufficient charms to console even orlando for the loss of angelica in short miss gryll had first made him think of marriage and whenever he thought his hopes were dim in that quarter he found an antidote to despair in the contemplation of the statuelike damsel mr falconer took more and more pleasure in miss grylls society but he did not declare himself he was more than once on the point of doing so but the images of the seven sisters rose before him and he suspended the intention on these occasions he always went home for a day or two to fortify his resolution against his heart thus he passed his time between the grange and the tower letting i dare not wait upon i would miss gryll had listened to lord curryfin she had neither encouraged nor discouraged him she thought him the most amusing person she had ever known she liked his temper his acquirements and his manners she could not divest herself of that feeling of the ludicrous which everybody seemed to associate with him but she thought the chances of life presented little hope of a happier marriage than a woman who would fall in with his tastes and pursuitswhich notwithstanding their tincture of absurdity were entertaining and even amiablemight hope for with him therefore she would not say no though when she thought of mr falconer she could not say yes lord curryfin invented a new sail of infallible safety which resulted like most similar inventions in capsizing the inventor on the first trial miss niphet going one afternoon later than usual to her accustomed pavilion found his lordship scrambling up the bank and his boat keel upwards at some little distance in the lake illustration found his lordship scrambling up the bank for a moment her usual selfcommand forsook her she held out both her hands to assist him up the bank and as soon as he stood on dry land dripping like a triton in trousers she exclaimed in such a tone as he had never before heard oh my dear lord then as if conscious of her momentary aberration she blushed with a deeper blush than that of the artificial rose which he had once thought might improve her complexion she attempted to withdraw her hands but he squeezed them both ardently and exclaimed in his turn like a lover in a tragedy surely till now i never looked on beauty she was on the point of saying surely before now you have looked on miss gryll but she checked herself she was content to receive the speech as a sudden ebullition of gratitude for sympathy and disengaging her hands she insisted on his returning immediately to the house to change his dank and dripping weeds as soon as he was out of sight she went to the boathouse to summon the men who had charge of it to the scene of the accident putting off in another boat they brought the capsized vessel to land and hung up the sail to dry she returned in the evening and finding the sail dry she set it on fire lord curryfin coming down to look after his tackle found the young lady meditating over the tinder she said to him illustration that sail will never put you under the water again he was touched by this singular development of solicitude for his preservation but could not help saying something in praise of his invention giving a demonstration of the infallibility of the principle with several scientific causes of error in working out the practice he had no doubt it would be all right on another experiment seeing that her looks expressed unfeigned alarm at this announcement he assured her that her kind interest in his safety was sufficient to prevent his trying his invention again they walked back together to the house and in the course of conversation she said to him the last time i saw the words infallible safety they were painted on the back of a stagecoach which in one of our summer tours we saw lying by the side of the road with its top in a ditch and its wheels in the air the young lady was still a mystery to lord curryfin sometimes he said to himself i could almost fancy melpomene in love with me but i have seldom seen her laugh and when she has done so now and then it has usually been at me that is not much like love her last remark was anything but a compliment to my inventive genius chapter xvii horsetaminglove in dilemmainjunctionssonorous vases o gran contrasto in giovenil pensiero desir di laude ed impeto damore ariosto c how great a strife in youthful minds can raise impulse of love and keen desire of praise lord curryfin amongst his multifarious acquirements had taken lessons from the great horsetamer and thought himself as well qualified as his master to subdue any animal of the species however vicious it was therefore with great pleasure he heard that there was a singularly refractory specimen in mr grylls stables illustration a singularly refractory specimen the next morning after hearing this he rose early and took his troublesome charge in hand after some preliminary management he proceeded to gallop him round and round a large open space in the park which was visible from the house miss niphet always an early riser and having just prepared for a walk saw him from her chamber window engaged in this perilous exercise and though she knew nothing of the peculiar character of his recalcitrant disciple she saw by its shakings kickings and plungings that it was exerting all its energies to get rid of its rider at last it made a sudden dash into the wood and disappeared among the trees it was to the young lady a matter of implicit certainty that some disaster would ensue she pictured to herself all the contingencies of accident being thrown to the ground and kicked by the horses hoofs being dashed against a tree or suspended like absalom by the hair she hurried down and hastened towards the wood from which just as she reached it the rider and horse emerged at full speed as before but as soon as lord curryfin saw miss niphet he took a graceful wheel round and brought the horse to a stand by her side for by this time he had mastered the animal and brought it to the condition of sir walters hunter in wordsworth weak as a lamb the hour that it is yeaned and foaming like a mountain cataract she did not attempt to dissemble that she had come to look for him but said i expected to find you killed illustration i expected to find you killed he said you see all my experiments are not failures i have been more fortunate with the horse than the sail at this moment one of the keepers appeared at a little distance lord curryfin beckoned to him and asked him to take the horse to the stables the keeper looked with some amazement and exclaimed why this is the horse that nobody could manage you will manage him easily enough now said lord curryfin so it appeared and the keeper took charge of him not altogether without misgiving miss niphefs feelings had been overexcited the more so from the severity with which she was accustomed to repress them the energy which had thus far upheld her suddenly gave way she sat down on a fallen tree and burst into tears lord curryfin sat down by her and took her hand she allowed him to retain it awhile but all at once snatched it from him and sped towards the house over the grass with the swiftness and lightness of virgils camilla leaving his lordship as much astonished at her movements as the volscian crowd attonitis inhians animis had been at those of her prototype he could not help thinking few women run gracefully but she runs like another atalanta hartleap well gaping with wondering minds when the party met at breakfast miss niphet was in her place looking more like a statue than ever with if possible more of marble paleness lord curryfins morning exploit of which the story had soon found its way from the stable to the hall was the chief subject of conversation he had received a large share of what he had always so much desiredapplause and admiration but now he thought he would willingly sacrifice all he had ever received in that line to see even the shadow of a smile or the expression of a sentiment of any kind on the impassive face of melpomene she left the room when she rose from the breakfasttable appeared at the rehearsal and went through her part as usual sat down at luncheon and departed as soon as it was over she answered as she had always done everything that was said to her frankly and to the purpose and also as usual she originated nothing in the afternoon lord curryfin went down to the pavilion she was not there he wandered about the grounds in all directions and returned several times to the pavilion always in vain at last he sat down in the pavilion and fell into a meditation he asked himself how it could be that having begun by making love to miss gryll having indeed gone too far to recede unless the young lady absolved him he was now evidently in a transition state towards a more absorbing and violent passion for a person who with all her frankness was incomprehensible and whose snowy exterior seemed to cover a volcanic fire which she struggled to repress and was angry with herself when she did not thoroughly succeed in so doing if he were quite free he would do his part towards the solution of the mystery by making a direct and formal proposal to her as a preliminary to this he might press miss gryll for an answer all he had yet obtained from her was wait till we are better acquainted he was in a dilemma between morgana and melpomene it had not entered into his thoughts that morgana was in love with him but he thought it nevertheless very probable that she was in a fair way to become so and that even as it was she liked him well enough to accept him on the other hand he could not divest himself of the idea that melpomene was in love with him it was true all the sympathy she had yet shown might have arisen from the excitement of strong feelings at the real or supposed peril of a person with whom she was in the habit of daily intercourse it might be so still the sympathy was very impassioned though but for his rashness in selfexposure to danger he might never have known it a few days ago he would not press miss gryll for an answer because he feared it might be a negative now he would not because he was at least not in haste for an affirmative but supposing it were a negative what certainty had he that a negative from morgana would not be followed by a negative from melpomene then his heart would be at sea without rudder or compass we shall leave him awhile to the contemplation of his perplexities as his thoughts were divided so were morganas if mr falconer should propose to her she felt she could accept him without hesitation she saw clearly the tendency of his feelings towards her she saw at the same time that he strove to the utmost against them in behalf of his old associations though with all his endeavours he could not suppress them in her presence so there was the lover who did not propose and who would have been preferred and there was the lover who had proposed and who if it had been clear that the former chance was hopeless would not have been lightly given up if her heart had been as much interested in lord curryfin as it was in mr falconer she would quickly have detected a diminution in the ardour of his pursuit but so far as she might have noticed any diffrence in his conduct she ascribed it only to deference to her recommendation to wait till they were better acquainted the longer and the more quietly he waited the better it seemed to please her it was not on him but on mr falconer that the eyes of her observance were fixed she would have given lord curryfin his liberty instantly if she had thought he wished it mr falconer also had his own dilemma between his new love and his old affections whenever the first seemed likely to gain the ascendency the latter rose in their turn like antaeus from earth with renovated strength and he kept up their force by always revisiting the tower when the contest seemed doubtful thus lord curryfin and mr falconer were rivals with a new phase of rivalry in some of their variations of feeling each wished the other success the latter because he struggled against a spell that grew more and more difficult to be resisted the former because he had been suddenly overpowered by the same kind of light that had shone from the statue of pygmalion thus their rivalry such as it was was entirely without animosity and in no way disturbed the harmony of the aristophanic party the only person concerned in these complications whose thoughts and feelings were undivided was miss niphet she had begun by laughing at lord curryfin and had ended by forming a decided partiality lor him she contended against the feeling she was aware of his intentions towards miss gryll and she would perhaps have achieved a conquest over herself if her sympathies had not been kept in a continual fever by the rashness with which he exposed himself to accidents by flood and field at the same time as she was more interested in observing morgana than morgana was in observing her she readily perceived the latters predilection for mr falconer and the gradual folding around him of the enchanted net these observations and the manifest progressive concentration of lord curryfins affections on herself showed her that she was not in the way of inflicting any very severe wound on her young friends feelings or encouraging a tendency to absolute hopelessness in her own lord curryfin was pursuing his meditations in the pavilion when the young lady whom he had sought there in vain presented herself before him in great agitation he started up to meet her and held out both his hands she took them both held them a moment disengaged them and sat down at a little distance which he immediately reduced to nothing he then expressed his disappointment at not having previously found her in the pavilion and his delight at seeing her now after a pause she said i felt so much disturbed in the morning that i should have devoted the whole day to recovering calmness of thought but for something i have just heard my maid tells me that you are going to try that horrid horse in harness and in a newlyinvented high phaeton of your own and that the grooms say they would not drive that horse in any carriage nor any horse in that carriage and that you have a double chance of breaking your neck i have disregarded all other feelings to entreat you to give up your intention lord curryfin assured her that he felt too confident in his power over horses and in the safety of his new invention to admit the possibility of danger but that it was a very small sacrifice to her to restrict himself to tame horses and low carriages or to abstinence from all horses and carriages if she desired it and from sailingboats she added and from sailingboats he answered and from balloons she said and from balloons he answered but what made you think of balloons because she said they are dangerous and you are inquiring and adventurous illustration and from balloons to tell you the truth he said i have been up in a balloon i thought it the most disarming excursion i ever made i have thought of going up again i have invented a valve o heavens she exclaimed but i have your promise touching horses and carriages and sails and balloons you have he said it shall be strictly adhered to she rose to return to the house but this time he would not part with her and they returned together thus prohibited by an authority to which he yielded implicit obedience from trying further experiments at the risk of his neck he restricted his inventive faculty to safer channels and determined that the structure he was superintending should reproduce as far as possible all the peculiarities of the athenian theatre amongst other things he studied attentively the subject of the echeia or sonorous vases which in that vast theatre propagated and clarified sound and though in its smaller representative they were not needed he thought it still possible that they might produce an agreeable effect but with all the assistance of the reverend doctor opimian he found it difficult to arrive at a clear idea of their construction or even of their principle for the statement of vitruvius that they gave an accordant resonance in the fourth the fifth and the octave seemed incompatible with the idea of changes of key and not easily reconcilable with the doctrine of harmonics at last he made up his mind that they had no reference to key but solely to pitch modified by dulyproportioned magnitude and distance he therefore set to work assiduously got a number of vases made ascertained that they would give a resonance of some kind and had them disposed at proper intervals round the audience part of the building this being done the party assembled some as audience some as performers to judge of the effect the first burst of choral music produced a resonance like the sound produced by seashells when placed against the ear only many times multiplied and growing like the sound of a gong it was the exaggerated concentration of the symphony of a limegrove full of cockchafers on a fine evening in the early summer the experiment was then tried with single voices the hum was less in itself but greater in proportion it was then tried with speaking the result was the same a powerful and perpetual hum not resonant peculiarly to the diatessaron the diapente or the diapason but making a new variety of continuous fundamental bass the drone of the cockchafer as he wheels by you in drowsy hum sounds his corno di bassetto on f below the line gardiners music of nature i am satisfied said lord curryfin the art of making these vases is as hopelessly lost as that of making mummies miss niphet encouraged him to persevere she said you have produced a decided resonance the only thing is to subdue it which you may perhaps effect by diminishing the number and enlarging the intervals of the vases he determined to act on the suggestion and she felt that for some little time at least she had kept him out of mischief but whenever anything was said or sung in the theatre it was necessary for the time to remove the echeia chapter xviii lecturesthe power of public opiniona new order of chivalry si mimnermus uti censet sine amore jocisque nil est jucundum vivas in amore jorisqne hor epist i vi if as mimnennus held nought else can move your soul to pleasure live in sports and love the theatre was completed and was found to be without the echeia a fine vehicle of sound it was tried not only in the morning rehearsals but occasionally and chiefly on afternoons of bad weather by recitations and even lectures for though some of the party attached no value to that mode of dogmatic instruction yet with the majority and especially with the young ladies it was decidedly in favour one rainy afternoon lord curryfin was entreated to deliver in the theatre his lecture on fish he readily complied and succeeded in amusing his audience more and instructing them as much as any of his more pretentious brother lecturers could have done we shall not report the lecture but we refer those who may be curious on the subject to the next meeting of the pantopragmatic society under the presidency of lord facingbothways and the vicepresidency of lord michin malicho at intervals in similar afternoons of bad weather some others of the party were requested to favour the company with lectures or recitations in the theatre mr minim delivered a lecture on music mr pallet on painting mr falconer though not used to lecturing got up one on domestic life in the homeric age even mr gryll took his turn and expounded the epicurean philosophy mr macborrowdale who had no objection to lectures before dinner delivered one on all the affairs of the worldforeign and domestic moral political and literary in the course of it he touched on reform the stone which lord michin malichowho was the gracchus of the last reform and is the sisyphus of the presenthas been so laboriously pushing up hill is for the present deposited at the bottom in the limbo of vanity if it should ever surmount the summit and run down on the other side it will infallibly roll over and annihilate the franchise of the educated classes for it would not be worth their while to cross the road to exercise it against the rabble preponderance which would then have been created thirty years ago lord michin malicho had several cogent arguments in favour of reform one was that the people were roaring for it and that therefore they must have it he has now in its favour the no less cogent argument that the people do not care about it and that the less it is asked for the greater will be the grace of the boon on the former occasion the outofdoor logic was irresistible burning houses throwing dead cats and cabbagestumps into carriages and other varieties of the same system of didactics demonstrated the fitness of those who practised them to have representatives in parliament so they got their representatives and many think parliament would have been better without them my father was a staunch reformer in his neighbourhood in london was the place of assembly of a knowledgeispower club the members at the close of their meetings collected mendingstones from the road and broke the windows to the right and left of their line of march they had a flag on which was inscribed the power of public opinion whenever the enlightened assembly met my father closed his shutters but closing within they did not protect the glass one morning he picked up from where it had fallen between the window and the shutter a very large and consequently very demonstrative specimen of dialectical granite he preserved it carefully and mounted it on a handsome pedestal inscribed with the power of public opinion he placed it on the middle of his library mantelpiece and the daily contemplation of it cured him of his passion for reform during the rest of his life he never talked as he had used to do of the people he always said the rabble and delighted in quoting every passage of hudibras in which the rabblerout is treated as he had come to conclude it ought to be he made this piece of granite the nucleus of many political disquisitions it is still in my possession and i look on it with veneration as my principal tutor for it had certainly a large share in the elements of my education if which does not seem likely another reform lunacy should arise in my time i shall take care to close my shutters against the power of public opinion the reverend doctor opimian being called on to contribute his share to these diversions of rainy afternoons said the sort of prose lecture which i am accustomed to deliver would not be exactly appropriate to the present time and place i will therefore recite to you some verses which i made some time since on what appeared to me a striking specimen of absurdity on the part of the advisers of royalty herethe bestowing the honours of knighthood which is a purely christian institution on jews and paynim very worthy persons in themselves and entitled to any mark of respect befitting their class but not to one strictly and exclusively christian moneylenders too of all callings the most antipathetic to that of a true knight the contrast impressed itself on me as i was reading a poem of the twelfth century by hues de tabaretlordne de chevalerieand i endeavoured to express the contrast in the manner and form following a new order of chivalry sir moses sir aaron sir jamramajee two stockjobbing jews and a shroffing

through country and town to strike with your falchions her enemies down ii now fancy these knights when the speech they have heard as they stand scarfed shoed shoulderdubbed belted and spurred with the crosshandled sword duly sheathed on the thigh thus simply and candidly making reply by your majestys grace we have risen up knights but we feel little relish for frays and for fights there are heroes enough full of spirit and fire always ready to shoot and be shot at for hire true with bulls and with bears we have battled our cause and the bulls have no horns and the bears have no paws and the mightiest blow which we ever have struck has achieved but the glory of laming a duck in stock exchange slang bulls are speculators for a rise bears for a fall a lame duck is a man who cannot pay

boyre vin bon et fraizrabelais v c some guests remained some departed and returned among these was mr macborrowdale one day after dinner on one of his reappearances lord curryfin said to him well mr macborrowdale in your recent observations have you found anything likely to satisfy jack of dover if he were prosecuting his inquiry among us mr macborrowdale troth no my lord i think if he were among us he would give up the search as hopeless he found it so in his own day and he would find it still more so now jack was both merry and wise we have less mirth in practice and we have more wisdom in pretension which jack would not have admitted the rev dr opimian he would have found it like juvenals search for patriotic virtue when catiline was everywhere and brutus and cato were nowhere et catilinam quocumque in populo videas quocumque sub axe sed nee brutus erit bruti nec avunculus usquam juv sat xiv lord curryfin well among us if jack did not find his superior or even his equal he would not have been at a loss for company to his mind there is enough mirth for those who choose to enjoy it and wisdom too perhaps as much as he would have cared for we ought to have more wisdom as we have clearly more science the rev dr opimian science is one thing and wisdom is another science is an edged tool with which men play like children and cut their own fingers if you look at the results which science has brought in its train you will find them to consist almost wholly in elements of mischief see how much belongs to the word explosion alone of which the ancients knew nothing explosions of powdermills and powdermagazines of coalgas in mines and in houses of highpressure engines in ships and boats and factories see the complications and refinements of modes of destruction in revolvers and rifles and shells and rockets and cannon see collisions and wrecks and every mode of disaster by land and by sea resulting chiefly from the insanity for speed in those who for the most part have nothing to do at the end of the race which they run as if they were so many mercuries speeding with messages from jupiter look at our scientific drainage which turns refuse into poison look at the subsoil of london whenever it is turned up to the air converted by gas leakage into one mass of pestilent blackness in which no vegetation can flourish and above which with the rapid growth of the evergrowing nuisance no living thing will breathe with impunity look at our scientific machinery which has destroyed domestic manufacture which has substituted rottenness for strength in the thing made and physical degradation in crowded towns for healthy and comfortable country life in the makers the day would fail if i should attempt to enumerate the evils which science has inflicted on mankind i almost think it is the ultimate destiny of science to exterminate the human race lord curryfin you have gone over a wide field which we might exhaust a good bin of claret in fully discussing but surely the facility of motion over the face of the earth and sea is both pleasant and profitable we may now see the world with little expenditure of labour or time the rev dr opimian you may be whisked over it but you do not see it you go from one great town to another where manners and customs are not even now essentially different and with this facility of intercourse become progressively less and less so the intermediate countrywhich you never see unless there is a show mountain or waterfall or ruin for which there is a station and to which you go as you would to any other exhibitionthe intermediate country contains all that is really worth seeing to enable you to judge of the various characteristics of men and the diversified objects of nature lord curryfin you can suspend your journey if you please and see the intermediate country if you prefer it the rev dr opimian but who does prefer it you travel round the world by a handbook as you do round an exhibitionroom by a catalogue mr macborrowdale not to say that in the intermediate country you are punished by bad inns and bad wine of which i confess myself intolerant i knew an unfortunate french tourist who had made the round of switzerland and had but one expression for every stage of his journey mauvaise auberge lord curryfin well then what say you to the electric telegraph by which you converse at the distance of thousands of miles even across the atlantic as no doubt we shall yet do mr gryll some of us have already heard the doctors opinion on that subject the rev dr opimian i have no wish to expedite communication with the americans if we could apply the power of electrical repulsion to preserve us from ever hearing anything more of them i should think that we had for once derived a benefit from science mr gryll your love for the americans doctor seems something like that of ciceros friend marius for the greeks he would not take the nearest road to his villa because it was called the greek road perhaps if your nearest way home were called the american road you would make a circuit to avoid it the rev dr opimian i am happy to say i am not put to the test magnetism galvanism electricity are one form of many names without magnetism we should never have discovered america to which we are indebted for nothing but evil diseases in the worst forms that can afflict humanity and slavery in the worst form in which slavery can cast the old world had the sugarcane and the cottonplant though it did not so misuse them then what good have we got from america what good of any kind from the whole continent and its islands from the esquimaux to patagonia non enim te puto graecos ludos desiderare praesertim quum graecos ita non mes ut ne ad villain quidem tuam via grasca ire soleascicero ep ad div vii i greek phraseschylus prometheus mr gryll newfoundland saltfish doctor the rev dr opindan that is something but it does not turn the scale mr gryll if they have given us no good we have given them none the rev dr opimian we have given them wine and classical literature but i am afraid bacchus and minerva have equally scattered their bounty upon barren ground on the other hand we have given the red men rum which has been the chief instrument of their perdition on the whole our intercourse with america has been little else than an interchange of vices and diseases lord curryfin do you count it nothing to have substituted civilised for savage men the rev dr opimian civilised the word requires definition but looking into futurity it seems to me that the ultimate tendency of the change is to substitute the worse for the better race the negro for the red indian the red indian will not work for a master no illusage will make him herein he is the noblest specimen of humanity that ever walked the earth therefore the white man exterminates his race but the time will come when by mere force of numbers the black race will predominate and exterminate the white and thus the worse race will be substituted for the better even as it is in st domingo where the negro has taken the place of the caraib the change is clearly for the worse lord curryfin you imply that in the meantime the white race is better than the red the rev dr opimian i leave that as an open question but i hold as some have done before me that the human mind degenerates in america and that the superiority such as it is of the white race is only kept up by intercourse with europe look at the atrocities in their ships look at their congress and their courts of justice debaters in the first suitors even advocates sometimes judges in the second settling their arguments with pistol and dagger look at their extensions of slavery and their revivals of the slavetrade now covertly soon to be openly if it were possible that the two worlds could be absolutely dissevered for a century i think a new columbus would find nothing in america but savages lord curryfin you look at america doctor through your hatred of slavery you must remember that we introduced it when they were our colonists it is not so easily got rid of its abolition by france exterminated the white race in st domingo as the white race had exterminated the red its abolition by england ruined our west indian colonies the rev dr opimian yes in conjunction with the direct encouragement of foreign slave labour given by our friends of liberty under the pretext of free trade it is a mockery to keep up a squadron for suppressing the slavetrade on the one hand while on the other hand we encourage it to an extent that counteracts in a tenfold degree the apparent power of suppression it is a clear case of false pretension mr gryll you know doctor the old world had slavery throughout its entire extent under the patriarchs the greeks the romans everywhere in short cicero thought our island not likely to produce anything worth having excepting slaves and of those none skilled as some slaves were in letters and music but all utterly destitute of both and in the old world the slaves were of the same race with the masters the negroes are an inferior race not fit i am afraid for anything else etiam illud jam cognitum est neque argenti scripulum esse ullum in ilia insula neque ullam spem praedae nisi ex mancipiis ex quibus nullos puto te literis aut musicis eruditos expectarecicero ad atticum iv a hope is expressed by pomponius mela iii c he wrote under claudius that by the success of the roman arms the island and its savage inhabitants would soon be better known it is amusing enough to peruse such passages in the midst of londongibbon c i the rev dr opimian not fit perhaps for anything else belonging to what we call civilised life very fit to live on little and wear nothing in africa where it would have been a blessing to themselves and the rest of the world if they had been left unmolested if they had had a friar bacon to surround their entire continent with a wall of brass mr falconer i am not sure doctor that in many instances even yet the white slavery of our factories is not worse than the black slavery of america we have done much to amend it and shall do more still much remains to be done the rev dr opimiun and will be done i hope and believe the americans do nothing to amend their system on the contrary they do all they can to make bad worse whatever excuse there may be for maintaining slavery where it exists there can be none for extending it into new territories none for reviving the african slavetrade these are the crying sins of america our white slavery so far as it goes is so far worse that it is the degradation of a better race but if it be not redressed as i trust it will be it will work out its own retribution and so it is of all the oppressions that are done under the sun though all men but the red men will work for a master they will not fight for an oppressor in the day of his need thus gigantic empires have crumbled into dust at the first touch of an invaders footstep for petty as for great oppressions there is a day of retribution growing out of themselves it is often long in coming ut sit magna tamen eerie lenla ira deoruni est but it comes raro anteccdentem scelestum deseruit pede poena claudo the anger of the gods though great is slow the foot of punishment though lame oertakes at last preceding wrong lord curryfin i will not say doctor ive seen and sure i ought to know but i have been in america and i have found there what many others will testify a very numerous class of persons who hold opinions very like your own persons who altogether keep aloof from public life because they consider it abandoned to the rabble but who are as refined as enlightened as full of sympathy for all that tends to justice and liberty as any whom you may most approve amongst ourselves the rev dr opimian of that i have no doubt but i look to public acts and public men lord curryfin i should much like to know what mr macborrowdale thinks of all this mr macborrowdale troth my lord i think we have strayed far away from the good company we began with we have lost sight of jack of dover but the discussion had one bright feature it did not interfere with it rather promoted the circulation of the bottle for every man who spoke pushed it on with as much energy as he spoke with and those who were silent swallowed the wine and the opinion together as if they relished them both the rev dr opimian so far discussion may find favour in my own experience i have found it very absorbent of claret but i do not think it otherwise an incongruity after dinner provided it be carried on as our disquisitions have always been with frankness and good humour consider how much instruction has been conveyed to us in the form of conversations at banquet by plato and xenophon and plutarch i read nothing with more pleasure than their symposia to say nothing of athenaeus whose work is one long banquet mr macborrowdale nay i do not object to conversation on any subject i object to afterdinner lectures i have had some unfortunate experiences i have found what began in conversation end in a lecture i have on different occasions met several men who were in that respect all alike once started they never stopped the rest of the good company or rather the rest which without them would have been good company was no company no one could get in a word they went on with one unvarying stream of monotonous desolating sound this makes me tremble when a discussion begins i sit in fear of a lecture lord curryfin well you and i have lectured but never after dinner we do it when we have promised it and when those who are present expect it after dinner i agree with you it is the most doleful blight that can fall on human enjoyment mr macborrowdale i will give you one or two examples of these postprandial inflictions one was a great indian reformer he did not open his mouth till he had had about a bottle and a half of wine then he burst on us with a declamation on all that was wrong in india and its remedy he began in the punjab travelled to calcutta went southward got into the temple of juggernaut went southward again and after holding forth for more than an hour paused for a moment the man who sate next him attempted to speak but the orator clapped him on the arm and said excuse me now i come to madras on which his neighbour jumped up and vanished another went on in the same way about currency his first hours talking carried him just through the restriction act of ninetyseven as we had then more than halfacentury before us i took my departure but these were two whom topography and chronology would have brought to a close the bore of all bores was the third his subject had no beginning middle nor end it was education never was such a journey through the desert of mind the great sahara of intellect the very recollection makes me thirsty the rev dr opimian if all the nonsense which in the last quarter of a century has been talked on all other subjects were thrown into one scale and all that has been talked on the subject of education alone were thrown into the other i think the latter would preponderate lord curryfin we have had through the whole period some fine specimens of nonsense on other subjects for instance with a single exception political economy mr macborrowdale i understand your lordships politeness as excepting the present company you need not except me i am free to confess as they say in another place that i have talked a great deal of nonsense on that subject myself lord curryfin then we have had latterly a mighty mass on the purification of the thames the rev dr opimian allowing full weight to the two lastnamed ingredients they are not more than a counterpoise to competitive examination which is also a recent exotic belonging to education lord curryfin patronage it used to be alleged considered only the fitness of the place for the man not the fitness of the man for the place it was desirable to reverse this the rev dr opimian true but dum vitant stulli vitium in contraria curruni when fools would from one vice take flight they rush into its oppositehor sal i questions which can only be answered by the parrotings of a memory crammed to disease with all sorts of heterogeneous diet can form no test of genius taste judgment or natural capacity competitive examination takes for its norma it is better to learn many things ill than one thing well or rather it is better to learn to gabble about everything than to understand anything this is not the way to discover the wood of which mercuries are made i have been told that this precious scheme has been borrowed from china a pretty fountainhead for moral and political improvement and if so i may say after petronius this windy and monstrous loquacity has lately found its way to us from asia and like a pestilential star has blighted the minds of youth otherwise rising to greatness nuper ventosa isthaec et enormis loquacitas athenas ex asia commigravit animosque juvenum ad magna surgentes veluti pestilenti quodam sidere afflavit lord curryfin there is something to be said on behalf of applying the same tests addressing the same questions to everybody the rev dr opimian i shall be glad to hear what can be said on that behalf lord curryfin after a pause mass as the second gravedigger says in hamlet i cannot tell a chorus of laughter dissolved the sitting chapter xx algernon and morganaopportunity and repentancethe forest in winter les violences quon se fait pour sempcher daimer sont souvent plus cruelles que les rigueurs de ce quon aime la rochefoucauld the winter set in early december began with intense frost mr falconer one afternoon entering the inner drawingroom found miss gryll alone she was reading and on the entrance of her visitor laid down her book he hoped he had not interrupted her in an agreeable occupation to observe romantic method we shall give what passed between them with the christian names of the speakers morgana i am only reading what i have often read before orlando innamorato and i was at the moment occupied with a passage about the enchantress from whom my name was borrowed you are aware that enchantresses are in great favour here algernon circe and gryllus and your name sufficiently show that and not your name only buti should like to see the passage and should be still better pleased if you would read it to me morgana it is where orlando who had left morgana sleeping by the fountain returns to seek the enchanted key by which alone he can liberate his friends il conte che d intrare havea gran voglia subitamente al fonte ritornava quivi trov morgana che con gioglia danzava intorno e danzando cantava ne pui leggier si move al vento foglia come ella sanza sosta si voltava mirando hora a la terra ed hora al sole ed al suo canto usa va tal parole qualonque cerca al mondo haver thesoro over diletto o segue onore e stato ponga la mano a questa chioma d oro ch io porto in fronte e quel fara beato ma quando ha il destro a far cotal lavoro non prenda indugio che l tempo passato pi non ritorna e non si trova mai ed io mi volto e lui lascio con guai cosi cantava d intorno girando la bella fata a quella fresca fonte ma come gionto vide il conte orlando subitamente rivolt la fronte il prato e la fontana abbandonando prese il viaggio suo verso d un monte quai chiudea la valletta picciolina quivi fuggendo morgana cammina bojardo ii c ed vinegia with earnest wish to pass the enchanted gate orlando to the fount again advanced and found morgana all with joy elate dancing around and singing as she danced as lightly moved and twirled the lovely fate as to the breeze the lightest foliage glanced with looks alternate to the earth and sky she thus gave out her words of witchery let him who seeks unbounded wealth to hold or joy or honour or terrestrial state seize with his hand this lock of purest gold that crowns my brow and blest shall be his fate but when time serves behoves him to be bold nor even a moments pause interpolate the chance once lost he never finds again i turn and leave him to lament in vain thus sang the lovely fate in bowery shade circling in joy around the crystal fount but when within the solitary glade glittered the armour of the approaching count she sprang upon her feet as one dismayed and took her way towards a lofty mount that rose the valleys narrow length to bound thither morgana sped along the ground i have translated fata fate it is usually translated fairy but the idea differs essentially from ours of a fairy amongst other things there is no fato no oberon to the titania it does not indeed correspond with our usual idea of fate but it is more easily distinguished as a class for our old acquaintances the fates are an inseparable three the italian fata is independent of her sisters they are enchantresses but they differ from other enchantresses in being immortal they are beautiful loo and their beauty is immortal always in bojardo he would not have turned alcina into an old woman as ariosto did which i must always consider a dreadful blemish on the many charms of the orlando furioso algernon i remember the passage well the beautiful fata dancing and singing by the fountain presents a delightful picture morgana then you know orlando who had missed his opportunity of seizing the golden forelock while she was sleeping pursues her a long while in vain through rocky deserts la penitenza following him with a scourge the same idea was afterwards happily worked out by machiavelli in his capitolo del occasion algernon you are fond of italian literature you read the language beautifully i observe you have read from the original poem and not from bemis rifacciamento morgana i prefer the original it is more simple and more in earnest bemis playfulness is very pleasant and his exordiums are charming and in many instances he has improved the poetry still i think he has less than the original of what are to me the great charms of poetry truth and simplicity even the greater antiquity of style has its peculiar appropriateness to the subject and bojardo seems to have more faith in his narrative than berni i go on with him with ready credulity where bernis pleasantry interposes a doubt algernon you think that in narratives however wild and romantic the poet should write as if he fully believed in the truth of his own story morgana i do and i think so in reference to all narratives not to poetry only what a dry skeleton is the history of the early ages of rome told by one who believes nothing that the romans believed religion pervades every step of the early roman history and in a great degree down at least to the empire but because their religion is not our religion we pass over the supernatural part of the matter in silence or advert to it in a spirit of contemptuous incredulity we do not give it its proper place nor present it in its proper colours as a cause in the production of great effects therefore i like to read livy and i do not like to read niebuhr algernon may i ask if you read latin morgana i do sufficiently to derive great pleasure from it perhaps after this confession you will not wonder that i am a spinster algernon so far that i think it would tend to make you fastidious in your choice not that you would be less sought by any who would be worthy your attention for i am told you have had many suitors and have rejected them all in succession and have you not still many and among them one very devoted lover who would bring you title as well as fortune a very amiable person too though not without a comic side to his character morgana i do not well know he so far differs from all my preceding suitors that in every one of them i found the presence of some quality that displeased me or the absence of some which would have pleased me the want in the one way or the other of that entire congeniality in taste and feeling which i think essential to happiness in marriage he has so strong a desire of pleasing and such power of acquisition and assimilation that i think a woman truly attached to him might mould him to her mind still i can scarcely tell why he does not complete my idealities they say love is his own avenger and perhaps i shall be punished by finding my idealities realised in one who will not care for me algernon i take that to be impossible morgana blushed held down her head and made no reply algernon looked at her in silent admiration a new light seemed to break in on him though he had had so many opportunities of forming a judgment on the point it seemed to strike him for the first time with irresistible conviction that he had never before heard such a sweet voice nor seen such an expressive and intelligent countenance and in this way they continued like two figures in a tableau vivant till the entrance of other parties broke the spell which thus had fixed them in their positions a few minutes more and their destinies might have been irrevocably fixed but the interruption gave mr falconer the opportunity of returning again to his tower to consider in the presence of the seven sisters whether he should not be in the position of a roman who was reduced to the dilemma of migrating without his household deities or of suffering his local deities to migrate without him and whether he could sit comfortably on either of the horns of this dilemma he felt that he could not on the other hand could he bear to see the fascinating morgana metamorphosed into lady curryfin the time had been when he had half wished it as the means of restoring him to liberty he felt now that when in her society he could not bear the idea but he still thought that in the midst of his domestic deities he might become reconciled to it he did not care for horses nor keep any for his own use but as time and weather were not always favourable to walking he had provided for himself a comfortable travellingchariot without a box to intercept the view in which with posthorses after the fashion of the olden time he performed occasional migrations he found this vehicle of great use in moving to and fro between the grange and the tower for then with all his philosophy impatience was always his companion impatience on his way to the grange to pass into the full attraction of the powerful spell by which he was drawn like the fated ship to the magnetic rock in the arabian nights impatience on his way to the tower to find himself again in the regions mild of pure and serene air in which the seven sisters seemed to dwell like miltons ethereal spirits before the starry threshold of joves court here was everything to soothe nothing to irritate or disturb him nothing on the spot but it was with him as it is with many perhaps with all the two great enemies of tranquillity hope and remembrance would still intrude not like a bubble and a spectre as in the beautiful lines of coleridge who late and lingering seeks thy shrine on him but seldom power divine thy spirit rests satiety and sloth poor counterfeits of thee mock the tired worldling idle hope and dire remembrance interlope and vex the feverish slumbers of the mind the bubble floats before the spectre stalks behind coleridges ode to tranquillity for the remembrance of morgana was not a spectre and the hope of her love which he cherished in spite of himself was not a bubble but their forces were not less disturbing even in the presence of his earliest and most long and deeply cherished associations he did not allow his impatience to require that the horses should be put to extraordinary speed he found something tranquillising in the movement of a postilion in a smart jacket vibrating on one horse upwards and downwards with one invariable regulated motion like the crosshead of a sidelever steamengine and holding the whip quietly arched over the neck of the other the mechanical monotony of the movement seemed less in contrast than in harmony with the profound stillness of the wintry forest the leafless branches heavy with rime frost and glittering in the sun the deep repose of nature broken now and then by the traversing of deer or the flight of wild birds highest and loudest among them the long lines of rooks but for the greater part of the way one long deep silence undisturbed but by the rolling of the wheels and the iron tinkling of the hoofs on the frozen ground by degrees he fell into a reverie and meditated on his last dialogue with morgana it is a curious coincidence he thought that she should have been dwelling in a passage in which her namesake enchantress inflicted punishment on orlando for having lost his opportunity did she associate morgana with herself and orlando with me did she intend a graceful hint to me not to lose my opportunity i seemed in a fair way to seize the golden forelock if we had not been interrupted do i regret that i did not that is just what i cannot determine yet it would be more fitting that whatever i may do should be done calmly deliberately philosophically than suddenly passionately impulsively one thing is clear to me it is now or never this or none the world does not contain a second morgana at least not of mortal race well the opportunity will return so far i am not in the predicament in which we left orlando i may yet ward off the scourge of la penitenza but his arrival at home and the sight of the seven sisters who had all come to the halldoor to greet him turned his thoughts for awhile into another channel he dined at his usual hour and his two hebes alternately filled his glass with madeira after which the sisters played and sang to him in the drawingroom and when he had retired to his chamber had looked on the many portraitures of his virgin saint and had thought by how many charms of life he was surrounded he composed himself to rest with the reflection i am here like rasselas in the happy valley and i can now fully appreciate the force of that beautiful chapter the wants of him who wants nothing chapter xxi skatingpas de deux on the

trying if he could not outdo mr tait illustration trying if he could not outdo mr tait he thought it would be best to try his experiment without witnesses and having more than an hours daylight before breakfast he devoted that portion of the morning to his purpose but cutting a nine by itself baffled his skill and treated him to two or three tumbles which however did not abate his ardour at length he bethought him of cutting a nine between two eights and by shifting his feet rapidly at the points of difficulty striking in and out of the nine to and from the eights on each side in this he succeeded and exhibiting his achievement in the afternoon adorned the surface of the ice with successions of till they amounted to as many sextillions with their homogeneous sequences he then enclosed the line with an oval and returned to the bank through an admiring circle who if they had been as numerous as the spectators to the olympic games would have greeted him with as loud shouts of triumph as saluted epharmostus of opus among the spectators on the bank were miss niphet and mr macborrowdale standing side by side while lord curryfin was cutting his sextillions mr macborrowdale said there is a young gentleman who is capable of anything and who would shine in any pursuit if he would keep to it he shines as it is in almost everything he takes in hand in private society there is genius even in his failures as in the case of the theatrical vases but the world is a field of strong competition and affords eminence to few in any sphere of exertion and to those few rarely but in one miss niphet before i knew him i never heard of him but as a lecturer on fish and to that he seems to limit his public ambition in private life his chief aim seems to be that of pleasing his company of course you do not attach much value to his present pursuit you see no utility in it mr macborrowdale on the contrary i see great utility in it i am for a healthy mind in a healthy body the first can scarcely be without the last and the last can scarcely be without good exercise in pure air in this way there is nothing better than skating i should be very glad to cut eights and nines with his lordship but the only figure i should tut would be that of as many feet as would measure my own length on the ice lord curryfin on his return to land thought it his duty first to accost miss gryll who was looking on by the side of miss ilex he asked her if she ever skated she answered in the negative i have tried it she said but unsuccessfully i admire it extremely and regret my inability to participate in it he then went up to miss niphet and asked her the same question she answered i have skated often in our grounds at home then why not now he asked she answered i have never done it before so many witnesses but what is the objection he asked none that i know of she answered then he said as i have done or left undone some things to please you will you do this one thing to please me greek phrasepind olymp ix with what a clamour he passed through the circle certainly she replied adding to herself i will do anything in my power to please you illustration she was an atalanta on ice as on turf she equipped herself expeditiously and started before he was well aware she was half round the lake before he came up with her she then took a second start and completed the circle before he came up with her again he saw that she was an atalanta on ice as on turf he placed himself by her side slipped her arm through his and they started together on a second round which they completed arminarm by this time the blushrose bloom which had so charmed him on a former occasion again mantled on her cheeks though from a different cause for it was now only the glow of healthful exercise but he could not help exclaiming i now see why and with what tints the athenians coloured their statues is it clear she asked that they did so i have doubted it before he answered but i am now certain that they did in the meantime miss gryll miss ilex and the reverend doctor opimian had been watching their movements from the bank miss ilex i have seen much graceful motion in dancing in private society and on the italian stage and some in skating before today but anything so graceful as that doublegliding over the ice by those two remarkably handsome young persons i certainly never saw before miss gryll lord curryfin is unquestionably handsome and miss niphet especially with that glow on her cheeks is as beautiful a young woman as imagination can paint they move as if impelled by a single will it is impossible not to admire them both the rev dr opimian they remind me of the mythological fiction that jupiter made men and women in pairs like the siamese twins but in this way they grew so powerful and presumptuous that he cut them in two and now the main business of each half is to look for the other which is very rarely found and hence so few marriages are happy here the two true halves seem to have met the doctor looked at miss gryll to see what impression this remark might make on her he concluded that if she thought seriously of lord curryfin she would show some symptom of jealousy of miss niphet but she did not she merely said i quite agree with you doctor there is evidently great congeniality between them even in their respective touches of eccentricity but the doctors remark had suggested to her what she herself had failed to observe lord curryfins subsidence from ardour into deference in his pursuit of herself she had been so undividedly the cynosure of neighbouring eyes that she could scarcely believe in the possibility of even temporary eclipse her first impulse was to resign him to her young friend but then appearances might be deceitful her own indifference might have turned his attentions into another channel without his heart being turned with them she had seen nothing to show that miss niphets feelings were deeply engaged in the question she was not a coquette but she would still feel it as a mortification that her hitherto unquestioned supremacy should be passing from her she had felt all along that there was one cause which would lead her to a decided rejection of lord curryfin but her orlando had not seized the golden forelock perhaps he never would after having seemed on the point of doing so he had disappeared and not returned he was now again within the links of the sevenfold chain which had bound him from his earliest days she herself too had had perhaps had still the chance of the golden forelock in another quarter might she not subject her afterlife to repentance if her first hope should fail her when the second had been irrevocably thrown away the more she contemplated the sacrifice the greater it appeared possibly doubt had given preponderance to her thoughts of mr falconer and certainly had caused them to repose in the case of lord curryfin but when doubt was thrown into the latter scale also the balance became more even she would still give him his liberty if she believed that he wished it for then her pride would settle the question but she must have more conclusive evidence on the point than the reverend doctors metaphorical deduction from a mythological fiction in the evening while the party in the drawingroom were amusing themselves in various ways mr macborrowdale laid a drawing on the table and said doctor what should you take that to represent the rev dr opimian an unformed lump of i know not what mr macborrowdale not unformed it is a flint formation of a very peculiar kind the rev dr opimian very peculiar certainly who on earth can have amused himself with drawing a misshapen flint there must be some riddle in it some nigma as insoluble to me as aelia laelia crispis this nigma has been the subject of many learned disquisitions the reader who is unacquainted with it may find it under the article nigma in the encyclopedia britannica and probably in every other encyclopaedia lord curryfin and others of the party were successively asked their opinions one of the young ladies guessed it to be the petrifaction of an antediluvian mussel lord curryfin said petrifactions were often siliceous but never pure silex which this purported to be it gave him the idea of an asss head which however could not by any process have been turned into flint conjecture being exhausted mr macborrowdale said it is a thing they call a celt the asss head is somewhat germane to the matter the artium societatis syndicus et socii have determined that it is a weapon of war evidently of human manufacture it has been found with many others like it among bones of mammoths and other extinct animals and is therefore held to prove that men and mammoths were contemporaries the rev dr opimian a weapon of war had it a handle is there a hole for a handle mr macborrowdale that does not appear the rev dr opimian these flints and no other traces of men among the bones of mammoths mr macborrowdale none whatever the rev dr opimian what do the artium societatis syndicus et socii suppose to have become of the men who produced these demonstrations of high aboriginal art mr macborrowdale they think these finished specimens of skill in the art of chipping prove that the human race is of greater antiquity than has been previously supposed and the fact that there is no other relic to prove the position they consider of no moment whatever the rev dr opimian ha ha ha this beats the elephant in the moon which turned out to be a mouse in a telescope but i can help them

find out the way old song in percys reliques harry hedgerow had volunteered to be mr falconers mercury during his absences from the tower and to convey to him letters and any communications which the sisters might have to make riding at a good trot on a horse more distinguished for strength than grace he found the shortest days long enough for the purpose of going and returning with an ample interval for the refreshment of himself and his horse illustration mr falconers mercury while discussing beef and ale in the servants hall he heard a good deal of the family news and many comments on the visitors from these he collected that there were several young gentlemen especially remarkable for their attention to the young lady of the mansion that among them were two who were more in her good graces than the others that one of these was the young gentleman who lived in the dukes folly and who was evidently the favourite and that the other was a young lord who was the life and soul of the company but who seemed to be very much taken with another young lady who had at the risk of her own life jumped into the water and picked him out when he was nearly being drowned illustration he heard a good deal of the family news this story had lost nothing in travelling harry deducing from all this the conclusion most favourable to his own wishes determined to take some steps for the advancement of his own lovesuit especially as he had obtained some allies who were willing to march with him to conquest like the seven against thebes the reverend doctor opimian had finished his breakfast and had just sat down in his library when he was informed that some young men wished to see him the doctor was always accessible and the visitors were introduced he recognised his friend harry hedgerow who was accompanied by six others after respectful salutations on their part and benevolent acceptance on his harry as the only one previously known to the doctor became spokesman for the deputation harry hedgerow you see sir you gave me some comfort when i was breaking my heart and now we are told that the young gentleman at the folly is going to be married the rev dr opimian indeed you are better informed than i am harry hedgerow why its in everybodys mouth he passes half his time at squire grylls and they say its all for the sake of the young lady thats there she that was some days at the folly that i carried in when she was hurt in the great storm i am sure i hope it be true for you said if he married and suitable parties proposed for her sisters miss dorothy might listen to me i have lived in the hope of that ever since and here are six suitable parties to propose for her six sisters that is the long and the short of it the rev dr opimian the short of it at any rate you speak like a spartan you come to the point at once but why do you come to me i have no control over the fair damsels harry hedgerow why no sir but you are the greatest friend of the young gentleman and if you could just say a word for us to him you see sir the rev dr opimian i see seven notes in the key of a minor proposing to sound in harmony with the seven notes of the octave above but i really do not see what i can do in the matter harry hedgerow indeed sir if you could only ask the young gentleman if he would object to our proposing to the young ladies the rev dr opimian why not propose to them yourselves you seem to be all creditable young men harry hedgerow i have proposed to miss dorothy you know and she would not have me and the rest are afraid we are all something to do with the land and the wood farmers and foresters and nurserymen and all that and we have all opened our hearts to one another they dont pretend to look above us but it seems somehow as if they did and couldnt help it they are so like young ladies they daze us like why if theyd have us theyd be all in reach of one another fancy what a family party thered be at christmas we just want a good friend to put a good foot foremost for us and if the young gentleman does marry perhaps they may better themselves by doing likewise illustration six partners for six sisters the rev dr opimian and so you seven young friends have each a different favourite among the seven sisters harry hedgerow why thats the beauty of it the rev dr opimian the beauty of it perhaps it is i suppose there is an agistor among you an agistor was a forest officer who superintended the taking in of strange cattle to board and lodge and accounted for the profit to the sovereign i have read the word but never heard it i am inclined to think that in modern times the duty was carried on under another name or merged in the duties of another office harry hedgerow after looking at his companions who all shook their heads i am afraid not ought there to be we dont know what it means the rev dr opimian i thought that among so many foresters there might be an agistor but it is not indispensable well if the young gentleman is going to be married he will tell me of it and when he does tell me i will tell him of you have patience it may all come right harry hedgerow thank ye sir thank ye sir kindly which being echoed in chorus by the other six they took their departure much marvelling what the reverend doctor could mean by an agistor upon my word said the doctor to himself a very goodlooking respectable set of young men i do not know what the others may have to say for themselves they behaved like a greek chorus they left their share of the dialogue to the coryphaeus he acquitted himself well more like a spartan than an athenian but none the worse for that brevity in this case is better than rhetoric i really like that youth how his imagination dwells on the family party at christmas when i first saw him he was fancying how the presence of miss dorothy would gladden his fathers heart at that season now he enlarges the circle but it is still the same predominant idea he has lost his mother she must have been a good woman and his early home must have been a happy one the christmas hearth would not be so uppermost in his thoughts if it had been otherwise this speaks well for him and his i myself think much of christmas and all its associations i always dine at home on christmas day and measure the steps of my childrens heads on the wall and see how much higher each of them has risen since the same time last year in the scale of physical life there are many poetical charms in the heraldings of christmas the halcyon builds its nest on the tranquil sea the bird of dawning singeth all night long i have never verified either of these poetical facts i am willing to take them for granted i like the idea of the yulelog the enormous block of wood carefully selected long before and preserved where it would be thoroughly dry which burned on the oldfashioned hearth it would not suit the stoves of our modem saloons we could not burn it in our kitchens where a small fire in the midst of a mass of black iron roasts and bakes and boils and steams and broils and fries by a complicated apparatus which whatever may be its other virtues leaves no space for a christmas fire i like the festoons of holly on the walls and windows the dance under the mistletoe the gigantic sausage the baron of beef the vast globe of plumpudding the true image of the earth flattened at the poles the tapping of the old october the inexhaustible bowl of punch the life and joy of the old hall when the squire and his household and his neighbourhood were as one i like the idea of what has gone and i can still enjoy the reality of what remains i have no doubt harrys father burns the yulelog and taps the old october perhaps instead of the beef he produces a fat pig roasted whole like eumaeus the divine swineherd in the odyssey how harry will burn the yulelog if he can realise this daydream of himself and his six friends with the seven sisters i shall make myself acquainted with the position and characters of these young suitors to be sure it is not my business and i ought to recollect the words of cicero est enim difficilis cura rerum alienarum quamquam terentianus ille chrmes humani nihil a se alienum putat i hold with chrmes too i am not without hope from some symptoms i have lately seen that rumour in the present case is in a fair way of being right and if with the accordance of the young gentleman as keynote these two heptachords should harmonise into a double octave i do not see why i may not take my part as fundamental bass it is a hard matter to take active concern in the affairs of others although the chrmes of terence thinks nothing human alien to himselfde officiis i chapter xxiii the two quadrillespopes ombrepoetical truth to naturecleopatra

satisfied guest return contented to the night he sprang from in the meantime mr falconer after staying somewhat longer than usual at home had returned to the grange he found much the same party as he had left but he observed or imagined that lord curryfin was much more than previously in favour with miss gryll that she paid him more marked attention and watched his conduct to miss niphet with something more than curiosity amongst the winter evenings amusements were two forms of quadrille the oldfashioned game of cards and the more recently fashionable dance on these occasions it was of course a carpetdance now dancing had never been in mr falconers line and though modern dancing especially in quadrilles is little more than walking still in that little more there is ample room for grace and elegance of motion herein lord curryfin outshone all the other young men in the circle he endeavoured to be as indiscriminating as possible in inviting partners but it was plain to curious observation especially if a spice of jealousy mingled with the curiosity that his favourite partner was miss niphet when they occasionally danced a polka the reverend doctors mythological theory came out in full force it seemed as if nature had preordained that they should be inseparable and the interior conviction of both that so it ought to be gave them an accordance of movement that seemed to emanate from the innermost mind sometimes too they danced the minuet de la cour illustration minuet de la cour having once done it they had been often unanimously requested to repeat it in this they had no competitors miss gryll confined herself to quadrilles and mr falconer did not even propose to walk through one with her when dancing brought into miss niphets cheeks the blushrose bloom which had more than once before so charmed lord curryfin it required little penetration to see through his external decorum the passionate admiration with which he regarded her mr falconer remarked it and looking round to miss gryll thought he saw the trace of a tear in her eye it was a questionable glistening jealousy construed it into a tear but why should it be there was her mind turning to lord curryfin and the more readily because of a newlyperceived obstacle had mortified vanity any share in it no this was beneath morgana then why was it there was it anything like regret that in respect of the young lord she too had lost her opportunity was he himself blameless in the matter he had been on the point of declaration and she had been apparently on the point of acceptance and instead of following up his advantage he had been absent longer than usual this was ill but in the midst of the contending forces which severally acted on him how could he make it well so he sate still tormenting himself in the meantime mr gryll had got up at a cardtable in the outer which was the smaller drawingroom a quadrille party of his own consisting of himself miss ilex the reverend dr opimian and mr macborrowdale mr gryll this is the only game of cards that ever pleased me once it was the great evening charm of the whole nation now when cards are played at all it has given place to whist which in my younger days was considered a dry solemn studious game played in moody silence only interrupted by an occasional outbreak of dogmatism and illhumour quadrille is not so absorbing but that we may talk and laugh over it and yet is quite as interesting as anything of the kind has need to be miss ilex i delight in quadrille i am old enough to remember when in mixed society in the country it was played every evening by some of the party but chaque ge a ses plaisirs son esprit et ses mours it is one of the evils of growing old that we do not easily habituate ourselves to changes of custom the old who sit still while the young dance and sing may be permitted to regret the once always accessible cards which in their own young days delighted the old of that generation and not the old only the rev dr opimian there are many causes for the diminished attraction of cards in evening society late dinners leave little evening the old time for cards was the interval between tea and supper now there is no such interval except here and there in outoftheway places where perhaps quadrille and supper may still flourish as in the days of queen anne nothing was more common in country towns and villages halfacentury ago than parties meeting in succession at each others houses for tea supper and quadrille how popular this game had been you may judge from gays ballad which represents all classes as absorbed in quadrille then the facility of locomotion dissipates annihilates neighbourhood boileau for example when patients lie in piteous case in comes the apothecary and to the doctor cries alas non debes quadrilare the patient dies without a pill for why the doctors at quadrille should france and spain again grow loud the muscovite grow louder britain to curb her neighbours proud would want both ball and powder must want both sword and gun to kill for why the generals at quadrille people are not now the fixtures they used to be in their respective localities finding their amusements within their own limited circle half the inhabitants of a country place are here today and gone tomorrow even of those who are more what they call settled the greater portion is less probably at home than whisking about the world then again where cards are played at all whist is more consentaneous to modern solemnity there is more wiseacreism about it in the same manner that this other sort of quadrille in which people walk to and from one another with faces of exemplary gravity has taken the place of the oldfashioned countrydance the merry dance i dearly love would never suggest the idea of a quadrille any more than merry england would call up any image not drawn from ancient ballads and the old english drama mr gryll well doctor i intend to have a ball at christmas in which all modes of dancing shall have fair play but countrydances shall have their full share the rev dr opimian i rejoice in the prospect i shall be glad to see the young dancing as if they were young miss ilex the variety of the game called tredrillethe ombre of popes rape of the lockis a pleasant game for three pope had many opportunities of seeing it played yet he has not described it correctly and i do not know that this has been observed the rev dr opimian indeed i never observed it i shall be glad to know how it is so miss ilex quadrille is played with forty cards tredrille usually with thirty sometimes as in popes ombre with twentyseven in forty cards the number of trumps is eleven in the black suits twelve in the red in thirty nine in all suits alike in twentyseven they cannot be more than nine in one suit and eight in the other three in popes ombre spades are trumps and the number is eleven the number which they would be if the cards were forty if you follow his description carefully you will find it to be so nine cards in the black and ten in the red suits in addition to the aces of spades and clubs spadille and basto which are trumps in all suits seven cards in each of the four suits in addition to spadille and basto mr macborrowdale why then we can only say as a great philosopher said on another occasion the description is sufficient to impose on the degree of attention with which poetry is read miss ilex it is a pity it should be so truth to nature is essential to poetry few may perceive an inaccuracy but to those who do it causes a great diminution if not a total destruction of pleasure in perusal shakespeare never makes a flower blossom out of season wordsworth coleridge and southey are true to nature in this and in all other respects even in their wildest imaginings the rev dr opimian yet here is a combination by one of our greatest poets of flowers that never blossom in the same season bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies the tufted crowtoe and pale jessamine the white pink and the pansie freakt with jet the glowing violet the muskrose and the wellattired woodbine with cowslips wan that hang the pensive head and every flower that sad embroidery wears bid amaranthus all his beauty shed and daffodillies fill their cups with tears to deck the laurat hearse where lycid lies and at the same time he plucks the berries of the myrtle and the ivy miss ilex very beautiful if not true to english seasons but milton might have thought himself justified in making this combination in arcadia generally he is strictly accurate to a degree that is in itself a beauty for instance in his address to the nightingale thee chauntress oft the woods among i woo to hear thy evensong and missing thee i walk unseen on the dry smoothshaven green the song of the nightingale ceases about the time that the grass is mown the rev dr opimian the old greek poetry is always true to nature and will bear any degree of critical analysis i must say i take no pleasure in poetry that will not mr macborrowdale no poet is truer to nature than burns and no one less so than moore his imagery is almost always false here is a highlyapplauded stanza and very taking at first sight the nightdew of heaven though in silence it weeps shall brighten with verdure the sod where he sleeps and the tear that we shed though in secret it rolls shall long keep his memory green in our souls but it will not bear analysis the dew is the cause of the verdure but the tear is not the cause of the memory the memory is the cause of the tear the rev dr opimian there are inaccuracies more offensive to me than even false imagery here is one in a song which i have often heard with displeasure a young man goes up a mountain and as he goes higher and higher he repeats excelsior but excelsior is only taller in the comparison of things on a common basis not higher as a detached object in the air jacks beanstalk was excelsior the higher it grew but jack himself was no more celsus at the top than he had been at the bottom mr macborrowdale i am afraid doctor if you look for profound knowledge in popular poetry you will often be disappointed the rev dr opimian i do not look for profound knowledge but i do expect that poets should understand what they talk of burns was not a scholar but he was always master of his subject all the scholarship of the world would not have produced tarn o shanter but in the whole of that poem there is not a false image nor a misused word what do you suppose these lines represent i turning saw throned on a flowery rise one sitting on a crimson scarf unrolled a queen with swarthy cheeks and bold black eyes browbound with burning gold mr macborrowdale i should take it to be a description of the queen of bambo the rev dr opimian yet thus one of our most popular poets describes cleopatra and one of our most popular artists has illustrated the description by a portrait of a hideous grinning thiop moore led the way to this perversion by demonstrating that the gyptian women must have been beautiful because they were the countrywomen of cleopatra here we have a sort of counterdemonstration that cleopatra must have been a fright because she was the countrywoman of the gyptians but cleopatra was a greek the daughter of ptolemy auletes and a lady of pontus the ptolemies were greeks and whoever will look at their genealogy their coins and their medals will see how carefully they kept their pure greek blood uncontaminated by african intermixture think of this description and this picture applied to one who dio says and all antiquity confirms himwas the most superlatively beautiful of women splendid to see and delightful to hear for she was eminently accomplished she spoke many languages with grace and facility her mind was as wonderful as her personal beauty there is not a shadow of intellectual expression in that horrible portrait de pauw the great depreciator of everything gyptian has on the authority of a passage in aelian presumed to affix to the countrywomen of cleopatra the stigma of complete and unredeemed uglinessmoores epicurean fifth note greek phrasediovlii the conversation at the quadrilletable was carried on with occasional pauses and intermingled with the technicalities of the game miss gryll continued to alternate between joining in the quadrilledances and resuming her seat by the side of the room where she was the object of great attention from some young gentlemen who were glad to find her unattended by either lord curryfin or mr falconer mr falconer continued to sit as if he had been fixed to his seat like theseus the more he reflected on his conduct in disappearing at that critical point of time and staying away so long the more he felt that he had been guilty of an unjustifiable and perhaps unpardonable offence he noticed with extreme discomposure the swarm of moths as he called them to himself who were fluttering in the light of her beauty he would gladly have put them to flight and this being out of the question he would have been contented to take his place among them but he dared not try the experiment illustration moths fluttering in the light of her beauty nevertheless he would have been graciously received the young lady was not cherishing any feeling of resentment against him she understood and made generous allowance for his divided feelings but his irresolution if he were left to himself was likely to be of long duration and she meditated within herself the means of forcing him to a conclusion one way or the other chapter xxiv progress of sympathyloves injunctionsorlando innamorato greek passage anacreon see youth the nymph who charms your eyes watch lest you lose the willing

thicklyfalling snow and the morning opened on one vast expanse of white mantling alike the lawns and the trees and weighing down the widespreading branches lord curryfin determined not to be baulked of his skating sallied forth immediately after breakfast collected a body of labourers and swept clear an ample surface of ice a path to it from the house and a promenade on the bank here he and miss niphet amused themselves in the afternoon in company with a small number of the party and in the presence of about the usual number of spectators mr falconer was there and contented himself with looking on lord curryfin proposed a reel miss niphet acquiesced but it was long before they found a third at length one young gentleman of the plump and rotund order volunteered to supply the deficiency and was soon deposited on the ice where his partners in the icedance would have tumbled over him if they had not anticipated the result and given him a wide berth one or two others followed exhibiting several varieties in the art of falling ungracefully at last the lord and the lady skated away on as large a circuit as the cleared ice permitted and as they went he said to her if you were the prize of skating as atalanta was of running i should have good hope to carry you off against all competitors but yourself she answered do not disturb my thoughts or i shall slip he said no more but the words left their impression they gave him as much encouragement as under their peculiar circumstances he could dare to wish for or she could venture to intimate mr falconer admired their poetry of motion as much as all the others had done it suggested a remark which he would have liked to address to miss gryll but he looked round for her in vain he returned to the house in the hope that he might find her alone and take the opportunity of making his peace he found her alone but it seemed that he had no peace to make she received him with a smile and held out her hand to him which he grasped fervently he fancied that it trembled but her features were composed he then sat down at the table on which the old edition of bojardo was lying open as before he said you have not been down to the lake to see that wonderful skating she answered i have seen it every day but this the snow deters me today but it is wonderful grace and skill can scarcely go beyond it he wanted to apologise for the mode and duration of his departure and absence but did not know how to begin she gave him the occasion she said you have been longer absent than usualfrom our rehearsals but we are all tolerably perfect in our parts but your absence was remarkedby some of the party you seemed to be especially missed by lord curryfin he asked the reverend doctor every morning if he thought you would return that day algernon and what said the doctor morgana he usually said i hope so but one morning he said something more specific algernon what was it morgana i do not know that i ought to tell you algernon oh pray do morgana he said the chances are against it what are the odds said lord curryfin seven to one said the doctor it ought not to be so said lord curryfin for here is a whole greek chorus against seven vestals the doctor said i do not estimate the chances by the mere balance of numbers algernon he might have said more as to the balance of numbers morgana he might have said more that the seven outweighed the one algernon he could not have said that morgana it would be much for the one to say that the balance was even algernon but how if the absentee himself had been weighed against another in that ones own balance morgana one to one promises at least more even weight algernon i would not have it so pray forgive me morgana forgive you for what algernon i wish to say and i do not well know how without seeming to assume what i have no right to assume and then i must have double cause to ask your forgiveness morgana shall i imagine what you wish to say and say it for you algernon you would relieve me infinitely if you imagine justly morgana you may begin by saying with achilles my mind is troubled like a fountain stirred and i myself see not the bottom of it troilus and cressida act iii sc algernon i think i do see it more clearly morgana you may next say i live an enchanted life i have been in danger of breaking the spell it has once more bound me with sevenfold force i was in danger of yielding to another attraction i went a step too far in all but declaring it i do not know how to make a decent retreat algernon oh no no nothing like that morgana then there is a third thing you may say but before i say that for you you must promise to make no reply not even a monosyllable and not to revert to the subject for four times seven days you hesitate algernon it seems as if my fate were trembling in the balance morgana you must give me the promise i have asked for algernon i do give it morgana repeat it then word for word algernon to listen to you in silence not to say a syllable in reply not to return to the subject for four times seven days morgana then you may say i have fallen in love very irrationallyhe was about to exclaim

given my heart and this i will do if i ever do at the end of four times seven days if not then never she placed her finger on her lips again and immediately left the room having first pointed to a passage in the open pages of orlando innamorato she was gone before he was aware that she was going but he turned to the book and read the indicated passage it was a part of the continuation of orlandos adventure in the enchanted garden when himself pursued and scourged by la penitenza he was pursuing the fata morgana over rugged rocks and through briery thickets cosi diceva con molta rovina sempre seguia morgana il cavalliero fiacca ogni bronco ed ogni mala spina lasciando dietro a se largo il sentiero ed a la fata molto s avicina e gi d averla presa il suo pensiero ma quel pensiero ben

scattering tree and bush and brier and leaving wide the vestige of his tread nearer he drew with feet that could not tire and strong in hope to seise her as she sped how vain the hope her form he seemed to clasp but soon as seized she vanished from his grasp how many times he laid his eager hand on her bright form or on her vesture fair but her white robes and their vermilion band deceived his touch and passed away like air but once as with a halfturned glance she scanned her foeheavens will and happy chance were there no breath for pausing might the time allow he seized the golden forelock of her brow then passed the gloom and tempest from the sky the air at once grew calm and all serene and where rude thorns had clothed the mountain high was spread a plain all flowers and vernal green repentance ceased her scourge still standing nigh with placid looks in her but rarely seen she said beware how yet the prize you lose the key of fortune few can wisely use in the last stanza of the preceding translation the seventh line is the essence of the stanza immediately following the eighth is from a passage several stanzas forward after orlando has obtained the key which was the object of his search che mal se trova alcun sotto la luna ch adopri ben la chiave di fortuna the first two books of bojardos poem were published in the first complete edition was published in the venetian edition of from which i have cited this passage and the preceding one in chapter xx is the fifteenth and last complete italian edition the original work was superseded by the rifacciamenti of berni and domenichi mr panizzi has rendered a great service to literature in reprinting the original he collated all accessible editions verum opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum he took for his standard as i think unfortunately the milanese edition of with all the care he bestowed on his task he overlooked one fearful perversion in the concluding stanza which in all editions but the milanese reads thus mentre ch io canto ahim dio redentore she must have anticipated my coming said the young gentleman to himself she had opened the book at this passage and has left it to say to me for herchoose between love and repentance four times seven days that is to ensure calm for the christmas holidays the term will pass over twelfth night the lovers of old romance were subjected to a probation of seven years seven long years i served thee fair one seven long years my fee was scorn but here perhaps the case is reversed she may have feared a probation of seven years for herself and not without reason and what have i to expect if i let the four times seven days pass by why then i can read in her looksand they are interpreted in the verses before mei am assigned to repentance without the hope of a third opportunity she is not without a leaning towards lord curryfin veggio italia tutta a fiamma e a foco per questi galli che con gran furore vengon per disertar non so che loco per vi lascio

valore for furore it was no doubt in deference to the conquerors that the printer of made this substitution but it utterly perverts the whole force of the passage the french under charles viii invaded italy in september and the horror with which their devastations inspired bojardo not only stopped the progress of his poem but brought his life prematurely to a close he died in december the alteration of this single word changes almost into a compliment an expression of cordial detestation she thinks he is passing from her and on the twentyninth day or perhaps in the meantime she will try to regain him of course she will succeed what rivalry could stand against her if her power over him is lessened it is that she has not chosen to exert it she has but to will it and he is again her slave twentyeight days twentyeight days of doubt and distraction and starting up he walked out into the park not choosing the swept path but wading kneedeep in snow where it lay thickest in the glades he was recalled to himself by sinking up to his shoulders in a hollow he emerged with some difficulty and retraced his steps to the house thinking that even in the midst of loves most dire perplexities dry clothes and a good fire are better than a hole in the snow illustration sinking up to his shoulders in a hollow chapter xxv harry and dorothy greek passage humerus in odyssea the youthful suitors playing each his part stirred pleasing tumult in each fair ones heart adaptednot translated harry hedgerow had found means on several occasions of delivering farm and forest produce at the tower to introduce his six friends to the sisters giving all the young men in turn to understand that they must not think of miss dorothy an injunction which in the ordinary perverse course of events might have led them all to think of no one else and produced a complication very disagreeable for their introducer it was not so however the beauty of it as harry said to the reverend doctor was that each had found a distinct favourite among the seven vestals they had not however gone beyond giving pretty intelligible hints they had not decidedly ventured to declare or propose they left it to harry to prosecute his suit to miss dorothy purposing to step in on the rear of his success they had severally the satisfaction of being assured by various handsome young gipsies whose hands they had crossed with lucky shillings that each of them was in love with a fair young woman who was quite as much in love with him and whom he would certainly marry before twelve months were over and they went on their way rejoicing now harry was indefatigable in his suit which he had unbounded liberty to plead for dorothy always listened to him complacently though without departing from the answer she had originally given that she and her sisters would not part with each other and their young master the sisters had not attached much importance to mr falconers absences for on every occasion of his return the predominant feeling he had seemed to express was that of extreme delight at being once more at home one day while mr falconer was at the grange receiving admonition from orlando innamorato harry having the pleasure to find dorothy alone pressed his suit as usual was listened to as usual and seemed likely to terminate without being more advanced than usual except in so far as they both found a progressive pleasure she in listening and he in being listened to there was to both a growing charm in thus dallying with the innocence of love and though she always said no with her lips he began to read yes in her eyes harry well but miss dorothy though you and your sisters will not leave your young master suppose somebody should take him away from you what would you say then dorothy what do you mean master harry harry why suppose he should get married miss dorothy dorothy married harry how should you like to see a fine lady in the tower looking at you as much as to say this is mine dorothy i will tell you very candidly i should not like it at all but what makes you think of such a thing harry you know where he is now dorothy at squire grylls rehearsing a play for christmas harry and squire grylls niece is a great beauty and a great fortune dorothy squire grylls niece was here and my sisters and myself saw a great deal of her she is a very nice young lady but he has seen great beauties and great fortunes before he has always been indifferent to the beauties and he does not care about fortune i am sure he would not like to change his mode of life harry ah miss dorothy you dont know what it is to fall in love it tears a man up by the roots like a gale of wind dorothy is that your case master harry harry indeed it is miss dorothy if you didnt speak kindly to me i do not know what would become of me but you always speak kindly to me though you wont have me dorothy i never said wont master harry harry no but you always say cant and thats the same as wont so long as you dont dorothy you are a very good young man master harry everybody speaks well of you and i am really pleased to think you are so partial to me and if my young master and my sisters were married and i were disposed to follow their example i will tell you very truly you are the only person i should think of master harry master harry attempted to speak but he felt choked in the attempt at utterance and in default of words he threw himself on his knees before his beloved and clasped his hands together with a look of passionate imploring which was rewarded by a benevolent smile and they did not change their attitude till the entrance of one of the sisters startled them from their sympathetic reverie illustration encouraged his six allies to carry on the siege harry having thus made a successful impression on one of the theban gates encouraged his six allies to carry on the siege of the others for which they had ample opportunity as the absences of the young gentleman became longer and the rumours of an attachment between him and miss gryll obtained more ready belief chapter xxvi doubts and questions greek passage alcus bacchis tis vain to brood on care since grief no remedy supplies be ours the sparkling bowl to share and drown our sorrows as they rise mr falconer saw no more of miss gryll till the party assembled in the drawingrooms she necessarily took the arm of lord curryfin for dinner and it fell to the lot of mr falconer to offer his to miss niphet so that they sat at remote ends of the table each wishing himself in the others place but lord curryfin paid all possible attention to his fair neighbour mr falconer could see that miss grylls conversation with lord curryfin was very animated and joyous too merry perhaps for love but cordial to a degree that alarmed him it was however clear by the general mirth at the head of the table that nothing very confidential or sentimental was passing still a young lady who had placed the destiny of her life on a point of brief suspense ought not to be so merry as miss gryll evidently was he said little to miss niphet and she with her habit of originating nothing sat in her normal state of statuelike placidity listening to the conversation near her she was on the left hand of mr gryll miss ilex was on his right and on her right was the reverend doctor opimian these three kept up an animated dialogue mr macborrowdale was in the middle of the table and amused his two immediate fair neighbours with remarks appertaining to the matter immediately before them the preparation and arrangement of a good dinner remarks that would have done honour to francatelli after a while mr falconer bethought him that he would try to draw out miss niphets opinion on the subject nearest his heart he said to her they are very merry at the head of the table miss niphet i suppose lord curryfin is in the vein for amusing his company and he generally succeeds in his social purposes mr falconer you lay stress on social as if you thought him not successful in all his purposes miss niphet not in all his inventions for example but in the promotion of social enjoyment he has few equals of course it must be in congenial society there is a power of being pleased as well as a power of pleasing with miss gryll and lord curryfin both meet in both no wonder that they amuse those around them mr falconer in whom there must also be a power of being pleased miss niphet most of the guests here have it if they had not they would scarcely be here i have seen some dismal persons any one of whom would be a killjoy to a whole company there are none such in this party i have also seen a whole company all willing to be pleased but all mute from not knowing what to say to each other not knowing how to begin lord curryfin would be a blessing to such a party he would be the steel to their flint mr falconer have you known him long miss niphet only since i met him here mr falconer have you heard that he is a suitor to miss gryll miss niphet i have heard so mr falconer should you include the probability of his being accepted in your estimate of his social successes miss niphet love affairs are under influences too capricious for the calculation of probabilities mr falconer yet i should be very glad to hear your opinion you know them both so well miss niphet i am disposed to indulge you because i think it is not mere curiosity that makes you ask the question otherwise i should not be inclined to answer it i do not think he will ever be the affianced lover of morgana perhaps he might have been if he had persevered as he began but he has been used to smiling audiences he did not find the exact reciprocity he looked for he fancied that it was or would be for another i believe he was right mr falconer yet you think he might have succeeded if he had persevered miss niphet i can scarcely think otherwise seeing how much he has to recommend him mr falconer but he has not withdrawn miss nipket no and will not but she is too highminded to hold him to a proposal not followed up as it commenced even if she had not turned her thoughts elsewhere mr falconer do you not think she could recall him to his first ardour if she exerted all her fascinations for the purpose miss nipket it may be so i do not think she will try she added to herself i do not think she would succeed mr falconer did not feel sure she would not try he thought he saw symptoms of her already doing so in his opinion morgana was and must be irresistible but as he had thought his fair neighbour somewhat interested in the subject he wondered at the apparent impassiveness with which she replied to his questions in the meantime he found as he had often done before that the more his mind was troubled the more madeira he could drink without disordering his head chapter xxvii love in memory il faut avoir aim une fois en sa vie non pour le moment o lon aime car on nprouve alors que des tourmens des regrets de la jalousie mais peu peu ces tourmensl deviennent des souvenirs qui charment notre arrire saison et quand vous verrez la vieillesse douce facile et tolrante vous pourrez dire comme fontenelle lamour a pass parla scribe la vieille miss gryll carefully avoided being alone with mr falconer in order not to give him an opportunity of speaking on the forbidden subject she was confident that she had taken the only course which promised to relieve her from a life of intolerable suspense but she wished to subject her conduct to dispassionate opinion and she thought she could not submit it to a more calmlyjudging person than her old spinster friend miss ilex who had moreover the great advantage of being a woman of the world she therefore took an early opportunity of telling her what had passed between herself and mr falconer and asking her judgment on the point miss ilex why my dear if i thought there had been the slightest chance of his ever knowing his own mind sufficiently to come to the desired conclusion himself i should have advised your giving him a little longer time but as it is clear to me that he never would have done so and as you are decidedly partial to him i think you have taken the best course which was open to you he had all but declared to you more than once before but this all but would have continued and you would have sacrificed your life to him for nothing miss gryll but do you think you would in my case have done as i did miss ilex no my dear i certainly should not for in a case very similar i did not it does not follow that i was right on the contrary i think you are right and i was wrong you have shown true moral courage where it was most needed miss gryll i hope i have not revived any displeasing recollections miss ilex no my dear no the recollections are not displeasing the daydreams of youth however fallacious are a composite of pain and pleasure for the sake of the latter the former is endured nay even cherished in memory miss gryll hearing what i hear you were seeing what i see you are observing your invariable cheerfulness i should not have thought it possible that you could have been crossed in love as your words seem to imply miss ilex i was my dear and have been foolish enough to be constant all my life to a single idea and yet i would not part with this shadow for any attainable reality illustration constant all my life to a single idea miss gryll if it were not opening the fountain of an ancient sorrow i could wish to know the story not from idle curiosity but from my interest in you miss ilex indeed my dear morgana it is very little of a story but such as it is i am willing to tell it you i had the credit of being handsome and accomplished i had several lovers but my inner thoughts distinguished only one and he i think had a decided preference for me but it was a preference of present impression if some genius had commanded him to choose a wife from any company of which i was one he would i feel sure have chosen me but he was very much of an universal lover and was always overcome by the smiles of present beauty he was of a romantic turn of mind he disliked and avoided the ordinary pursuits of young men he delighted in the society of accomplished young women and in that alone it was the single link between him and the world he would disappear for weeks at a time wandering in forests climbing mountains and descending into the dingles of mountainstreams with no other companion than a newfoundland dog a large black dog with a white breast four white paws and a white tip to his tail a beautiful affectionate dog i often patted him on the head and fed him with my hand he knew me as well as bajardo knew angelica rinaldos horse he had escaped from his master and had revelled sacripante with his heels tears started into her eyes at the recollection of the dog she paused for a moment miss gryll i see the remembrance is painful do not proceed miss ilex no my dear i would not if i could forget that dog well my young gentleman as i have said was a sort of universal lover and made a sort of halfdeclaration to half the young women he knew sincerely for the moment to all but with more permanent earnestness more constant return to me than to any other if i had met him with equal earnestness if i could have said or implied to him in any way take me while you may or think of me no more i am persuaded i should not now write myself spinster but i wrapped myself up in reserve i thought it fitting that all advances should come from him that i should at most show nothing more than willingness to hear not even the semblance of anxiety to receive them so nothing came of our love but remembrance and regret another girl whom i am sure he loved less but who understood him better acted towards him as i ought to have done and became his wife therefore my dear i applaud your moral courage and regret that i had it not when the occasion required it miss gryll my lover if i may so call him differs from yours in this that he is not wandering in his habits nor versatile in his affections miss ilex the peculiar system of domestic affection in which he was brought up and which his maturer years have confirmed presents a greater obstacle to you than any which my lovers versatility presented to me if i had known how to deal with it miss gryll but how was it that having so many admirers as you must have had you still remained single miss ilex because i had fixed my heart on one who was not like any one else if he had been one of a class such as most persons in this world are i might have replaced the first idea by another but his soul was like a star and dwelt apart indi va mansueto alia donzella con umile sembiante e gesto umano come intorno al padrone il can saltella che sia due giorni o tre stato lontano bajardo ancora avea memoria d ella che in albracca il servia gi di sua mano orlando furioso c i s miss gryll a very erratic star apparently a comet rather miss ilex no for the qualities which he loved and admired in the object of his temporary affection existed more in his imagination than in her she was only the framework of the picture of his fancy he was true to his idea though not to the exterior semblance on which he appended it and to or from which he so readily transferred it unhappily for myself he was more of a reality to me than i was to him miss gryll his marriage could scarcely have been a happy one did you ever meet him again miss ilex not of late years but for a time occasionally in general society which he very sparingly entered our intercourse was friendly but he never knew never imagined how well i loved him nor even perhaps that i had loved him at all i had kept my secret only too well he retained his wandering habits disappearing from time to time but always returning home i believe he had no cause to complain of his wife yet i cannot help thinking that i could have fixed him and kept him at home your case is in many respects similar to mine but the rivalry to me was in a wandering fancy to you it is in fixed domestic affections still you were in as much danger as i was of being the victim of an idea and a punctilio and you have taken the only course to save you from it i regret that i gave in to the punctilio but i would not part with the idea i find a charm in the recollection far preferable to the waveless calm the slumber of the dead which weighs on the minds of those who have never loved or never earnestly chapter xxviii aristophanes in london non duco

fixed for the performance the theatre was brilliantly lighted with spermaceti candles in glass chandeliers for the audience and argand lamps for the stage in addition to mr grylls own houseful of company the beauty and fashion of the surrounding country which comprised an extensive circle adorned the semicircular seats which however were not mere stone benches but were backed armed and padded into comfortable stalls lord curryfin was in his glory in the capacity of stagemanager the curtain rising as there was no necessity for its being made to fall discovered the scene which was on the london bank of the thames on the terrace of a mansion occupied by the spiritrapping society with an archway in the centre of the building showing a street in the background gryllus was lying asleep circe standing over him began the dialogue the athenian theatre was open to the sky and if the curtain had been made to fall it would have been folded up in mid air destroying the effect of the scene

victory to hermogenes the chorus sang its third song see chapter xv circe at the request of the spiritrappers whose power was limited to the production of sound called up several visible spirits all illustrious in their day but all appearing as in the days of their early youth before their renown was around them they were all subjected to competitive examination and were severally pronounced disqualified for the pursuit in which they had shone at last came one whom circe recommended to the examiners as a particularly promising youth he was a candidate for military life every question relative to his profession he answered to the purpose to every question not so relevant he replied that he did not know and did not care this drew on him a reprimand he was pronounced disqualified and

circe miss gryll was resplendent as circe and miss niphet as leader of the chorus looked like melpomene herself slightly unbending her tragic severity into that solemn smile which characterised the chorus of the old comedy the charm of the first acted irresistibly on mr falconer the second would have completed if anything had been wanted to complete it the conquest of lord curryfin the supper

and the intended ball mr falconer having no fancy for balls and disturbed beyond endurance by the interdict which miss gryll had laid on him against speaking for four times seven days on the subject nearest his heart having discharged with becoming selfcommand his share in the aristophanic comedy determined to pass his remaining days of probation in the tower where he found in the attentions of the seven sisters not a perfect nepenthe but the only possible antidote to intense vexation of spirit it is true his two hebes pouring out his madeira approximated as nearly as anything could do to helens administration of the true nepenthe he might have sung of madeira as redis bacchus sang of one of his favourite wines egli il vero oro potabile che mandar suole in esilio ogni male inrimediabile egli delena il nepente che fa stare il mondo allegro dai pensieri foschi e neri sempre sciolto e sempre esente redi bacco in toscana matters went on quietly at the grange one evening mr gryll said quietly to the reverend doctor opimian i have heard you doctor more than once very eulogistic of hair as indispensable to beauty what say you to the bald venus of the romansvenus calva the rev dr opimian why sir if it were a question whether the romans had any such deity i would unhesitatingly maintain the negatur where do you find her mr gryll in the first place i find her in several dictionaries the rev dr opimian a dictionary is nothing without an authority you have no authority but that of one or two very late writers and two or three old grammarians who had found the word and guessed at its meaning you do not find her in any genuine classic a bald venus it is as manifest a contradiction in terms as hot ice or black snow lord curryfin yet i have certainly read though i cannot at this moment say where that there was in rome a temple to venus calva and that it was so dedicated in consequence of one of two circumstances the first being that through some divine anger the hair of the roman women fell off and that ancus martius set up a bald statue of his wife which served as an expiation for all the women recovered their hair and the worship of the bald venus was instituted the other being that when rome was taken by the gauls and when they had occupied the city and were besieging the capitol the besieged having no materials to make bowstrings the women cut off their hair for the purpose and after the war a statue of the bald venus was raised in honour of the women the rev dr opimian i have seen the last story transferred to the time of the younger maximin but when two or three explanations of which only one can possibly be true are given of any real or supposed fact we may safely conclude that all are false these are ridiculous myths founded on the misunderstanding of an obsolete word some hold that calva as applied to venus signifies pure but i hold with others that it signifies alluring with a sense of deceit you will find the cognate

addresses her as craftweaving venus why should i multiply examples when poetry so abounds with complaints of deceitful love that i will be bound every one of this company could without a moments hesitation find a quotation in pointmiss gryll to begin with contra ille calvi ratussallust hist iii thinking himself to be deceitfully allured nam ubi domi sola sum sopor manus calvitur plautus in casina for when i am at home alone sleep alluringly deceives my hands greek passage greek passage greek passage miss gryll oh doctor with every one who has a memory for poetry it must be lembarras de richesses we could occupy the time till midnight in going round and round on the subject we should soon come to an end with instances of truth and constancy the rev dr opimian not so soon perhaps if we were to go on accumulating examples i think i could find you a penelope for a helen a fiordiligi for an angelica an imogene for a calista a sacripant for a rinaldo a romeo for an angelo to nearly the end of the chapter i will not say quite for i am afraid at the end of the catalogue the numbers of the unfaithful would predominate miss ilex do you think doctor you would find many examples of love that is one and once for all love never transferred from its first object to a second the rev dr opimian plato holds that such is the essence of love and poetry and romance present it in many instances miss ilex and the contrary in many more the rev dr opimian if we look indeed into the realities of life as they offer themselves to us in our own experience in history in biography we shall find few instances of constancy to first love but it would be possible to compile a volume of illustrious examples of love which though it may have previously ranged is at last fixed in single unchanging constancy even inez de castro was only the second love of don pedro of portugal yet what an instance is there of love enduring in the innermost heart as if it had been engraved on marble miss gryll what is that story doctor i know it but imperfectly the rev dr opimian inez de castro was the daughter singularly beautiful and accomplished of a castilian nobleman attached to the court of alphonso the fourth of portugal when very young she became the favourite and devoted friend of constance the wife of the young prince don pedro the princess died early and the grief of inez touched the heart of pedro who found no consolation but in her society thence grew love which resulted in secret marriage pedro and inez lived in seclusion at coimbra perfectly happy in each other and in two children who were born to them till three of alphonsos courtiers moved by i know not what demon of mischieffor i never could discover an adequate motiveinduced the king to attempt the dissolution of the marriage and failing in this to authorise them to murder inez during a brief absence of her husband pedro raised a rebellion and desolated the estates of the assassins who escaped one into france and two into castile pedro laid down his arms on the entreaty of his mother but would never again see his father and lived with his two children in the strictest retirement in the scene of his ruined happiness when alphonso died pedro determined not to assume the crown till he had punished the assassins of his wife the one who had taken refuge in france was dead the others were given up by the king of castile they were put to death their bodies were burned and their ashes were scattered to the winds he then proceeded to the ceremony of his coronation the mortal form of inez veiled and in royal robes was enthroned by his side he placed the queenly crown on her head and commanded all present to do her homage he raised in a monastery side by side two tombs of white marble one for her one for himself he visited the spot daily and remained inconsolable till he rejoined her in death this is the true history which has been sadly perverted by fiction miss ilex there is indeed something grand in that longenduring constancy something terribly impressive in that veiled spectral image of robed and crowned majesty you have given this doctor as an instance that the first love is not necessarily the strongest and this no doubt is frequently true even romeo had loved rosalind before he saw juliet but love which can be so superseded is scarcely love it is acquiescence in a semblance acquiescence which may pass for love through the entire space of life if the latent sympathy should never meet its perfect counterpart the rev dr opimian which it very seldom does but acquiescence in the semblance is rarely enduring and hence there are few examples of lifelong constancy but i hold with plato that true love is single indivisible unalterable miss ilex in this sense then true love is first love for the love which endures to the end of life though it may be the second in semblance is the first in reality the next morning lord curryfin said to miss niphet you took no part in the conversation of last evening you gave no opinion on the singleness and permanence of love miss niphet i mistrust the experience of others and i have none of my own lord curryfin your experience when it comes cannot but confirm the theory the love which once dwells on you can never turn to another miss niphet i do not know that i ought to wish to inspire such an attachment lord curryfin because you could not respond to it miss niphet on the contrary because i think it possible i might respond to it too well she paused a moment and then afraid of trusting herself to carry on the dialogue she said come into the hall and play at battledore and shuttlecock he obeyed the order but in the exercise her every movement developed some new grace that maintained at its highest degree the intensity of his passionate admiration illustration her every movement developed some new grace chapter xxx a captive knightrichard and alice dum fata snunt jungamus amores mox veniet tenebris mors adoperta

fire divine and tender words befit not locks of snow the shuttlecock had been some time on the wing struck to and fro with unerring aim and to all appearances would never have touched the ground if lord curryfin had not seen or fancied he saw symptoms of fatigue on the part of his fair antagonist he therefore instead of returning the shuttlecock struck it upward caught it in his hand and presented it to her saying i give in the victory is yours she answered the victory is yours as it always is in courtesy she said this with a melancholy smile more fascinating to him than the most radiant expression from another she withdrew to the drawingroom motioning to him not to follow in the drawingroom she found miss gryll who appeared to be reading at any rate a book was open before her miss gryll you did not see me just now as i passed through the hall you saw only two things the shuttlecock and your partner in the game miss niphet it is not possible to play and see anything but the shuttlecock miss gryll and the hand that strikes it miss niphet that comes unavoidably into sight miss gryll my dear alice you are in love and do not choose to confess it illustration you are in love and do not choose to confess it miss niphet i have no right to be in love with your suitor miss gryll he was my suitor and has not renounced his pursuit but he is your lover i ought to have seen long ago that from the moment his eyes rested on you all else was nothing to him with all that habit of the world which enables men to conceal their feelings in society with all his exertion to diffuse his attentions as much as possible among all the young ladies in his company it must have been manifest to a careful observer that when it came as it seemed in ordinary course to be your turn to be attended to the expression of his features was changed from complacency and courtesy to delight and admiration i could not have failed to see it if i had not been occupied with other thoughts tell me candidly do you not think it is so miss niphet indeed my dear morgana i did not designedly enter into rivalry with you but i do think you conjecture rightly miss gryll and if he were free to offer himself to you and if he did so offer himself you would accept him miss niphet assuredly i would miss gryll then when you next see him he shall be free i have set my happiness on another cast and i will stand the hazard of the die miss niphet you are very generous morgana for i do not think you give up what you do not value miss gryll no indeed i value him highly so much so that i have hesitated and might have finally inclined to him if i had not perceived his invincible preference of you i am sorry for your sake and his that i did not clearly perceive it sooner but you see what it is to be spoiled by admirers i did not think it possible that any one could be preferred to me i ought to have thought it possible but i had no experience in that direction so now you see a striking specimen of mortified vanity miss niphet you have admirers in abundance morgana more than have often fallen to the lot of the most attractive young women and love is such a capricious thing that to be the subject of it is no proof of superior merit there are inexplicable affinities of sympathy that make up an irresistible attraction heaven knows how miss gryll and these inexplicable affinities lord curryfin has found in you and you in him miss niphet he has never told me so miss gryll not in words but looks and actions have spoken for him you have both struggled to conceal your feelings from others perhaps even from yourselves but you are both too ingenuous to dissemble successfully you suit each other thoroughly and i have no doubt you will find in each other the happiness i most cordially wish you miss gryll soon found an opportunity of conversing with lord curryfin and began with him somewhat sportively i have been thinking she said of an old song which contains a morsel of good advice be sure to be off with the old love before you are on with the new you begin by making passionate love to me and all at once you turn round to one of my young friends and say zephyrs whisper how i love you lord curryfin oh no no indeed i have not said that nor anything to the same effect miss gryll well if you have not exactly said it you have implied it you have looked it you have felt it you cannot conceal it you cannot deny it i give you notice that if i die for love of you i shall haunt you lord curryfin ah miss gryll if you do not die till you die for love of me you will be as immortal as circe whom you so divinely represented miss gryll you offered yourself to me to have and to hold for ever and aye suppose i claim you do not look so frightened you deserve some punishment but that would be too severe but to a certain extent you belong to me and i claim the right to transfer you i shall make a present of you to miss niphet so according to the old rules of chivalry i order you as my captive by right to present yourself before her and tell her that you have come to receive her commands and obey them to the letter i expect she will keep you in chains for life you do not look much alarmed at the prospect yet you must be aware that you are a great criminal and you have not a word to say in your own justification lord curryfin who could be insensible to charms like yours if hope could have mingled with the contemplation but there were several causes by which hope seemed forbidden and therefore miss gryll and therefore when beauty and hope and sympathy shone under a more propitious star you followed its guidance you could not help yourself what heart were his that could resist that melancholy smile i shall flatter myself that i might have kept you if i had tried hard for it at first but il pentirsi da sesto nulla giova no doubt you might have said with the old song i neer could any lustre see in eyes that would not look on me but you scarcely gave me time to look on you before you were gone you see however like our own mirror of knighthood i make the best of my evil fate and cheer myself up with ends of verse and sayings of philosophers lord curryfin i am glad to see you so merry for even if your heart were more deeply touched by another than it ever could have been by me i think i may say of you in your own manner so light a heel will never wear the everlasting flint i hope and i believe you will always trip joyously over the surface of the world you are the personification of lallegro miss gryll i do not know how that may be but go now to the personification of la penserosa if you do not turn her into a brighter allegro than i am you may say i have no knowledge of womans heart it was not long after this dialogue that lord curryfin found an opportunity of speaking to miss niphet alone he said i am charged with a duty such as was sometimes imposed on knights in the old days of chivalry a lady who claims me as her captive by right has ordered me to kneel at your feet to obey your commands and to wear your chains if you please to impose them miss niphet to your kneeling i say rise for your obedience i have no commands for chains i have none to impose lord curryfin you have imposed them i wear them already inextricably indissolubly miss niphet if i may say with the witch in thalaba only she who knit his bonds can set him free i am prepared to unbind the bonds rise my lord rise lord curryfin i will rise if you give me your hand to lift me up miss niphet there it is now that it has helped you up let it go lord curryfin and do not call me my lord miss niphet what shall i call you lord curryfin call me richard and let me call you alice miss niphet that is a familiarity only sanctioned by longer intimacy than ours has been lord curryfin or closer miss niphet we have been very familiar friends during the brief term of our acquaintance but let go my hand lord curryfin i have set my heart on being allowed to call you alice and on your calling me richard miss niphet it must not be soat least not yet lord curryfin there is nothing i would not do to acquire the right miss niphet nothing lord curryfin nothing miss niphet how thrives your suit with miss gryll lord curryfin that is at an end i have her permissionher command she calls itto throw myself at your feet and on your mercy miss niphet how did she take leave of you crying or laughing lord curryfin why if anything laughing miss niphet do you not feel mortified lord curryfin i have another and deeper feeling which predominates over any possible mortification miss niphet and that is lord curryfin can you doubt what it is miss niphet i will not pretend to doubt i have for some time been well aware of your partiality for me lord curryfin partiality say love adoration absorption of all feelings into one miss niphet then you may call me alice but once more let go my hand lord curryfin my hand is it not miss niphet yours when you claim it lord curryfin then thus i seal my claim he kissed her hand as respectfully as was consistent with masterless passion and she said to him i will not dissemble if i have had one wish stronger than anotherstrong enough to exclude all othersit has been for the day when you might be free to say to me what you have now said am i too frank with you lord curryfin oh heaven no i drink in your words as a stream from paradise he sealed his claim again but this time it was on her lips the rose again mantled on her cheek but the blush was heightened to damask she withdrew herself from his arms saying once for all till you have an indisputable right chapter xxxi a twelfthnight ballpantopragmatic cookerymodern vandalisma bowl of punch sic erimus cuncti postquam

was the night of the ball the foldingdoors of the drawingrooms which occupied their entire breadth were thrown wide open the larger room was appropriated to grown dancers the smaller to children who came in some force and were placed within the magnetic attraction of an enormous twelfthcake which stood in a decorated recess the carpets had been taken up and the floors were painted with forms in chalk by skilful artists under the superintendence of mr pallet the library separated from all the apartments by antechambers with double doors was assigned with an arrangement of whisttables to such of the elder portion of the party as might prefer that mode of amusement to being mere spectators of the dancing mr gryll with miss ilex mr macborrowdale and the reverend dr opimian established his own quadrille party in a corner of the smaller drawingroom where they could at once play and talk and enjoy the enjoyment of the young lord curryfin was master of the ceremonies these all wear out of me like forms with chalk painted on rich mens floors for one feastnight says wordsworth of chance acquaintance in his neighbourhoodmiscellaneous sonnets no after two or three preliminary dances to give time for the arrival of the whole of the company the twelfthcake was divided the characters were drawn exclusively among the children and the little king and queen were duly crowned placed on a theatrical throne and paraded in state round both drawingrooms to their own great delight and that of their little associates then the ball was supposed to commence and was by general desire opened with a minuet by miss niphet and lord curryfin then came alternations of quadrilles and country dances interspersed with occasional waltzes and polkas so the ball went merrily with as usual abundant lovemaking in mute signs and in sotto voce parlance lord curryfin having brought his own lovemaking to a satisfactory close was in exuberant spirits sometimes joining in the dance sometimesin his official capacitytaking the round of the rooms to see that everything was going on to everybodys satisfaction he could not fail to observe that his proffered partnership in the dance though always graciously was not so ambitiously accepted as before he had disposed of himself for life a day had sufficed to ask and obtain the consent of miss niphets father who now sate on the side of the larger drawingroom looking with pride and delight on his daughter and with cordial gratification on her choice and when it was once as it was at once known that miss niphet was to be lady curryfin his lordship passed into the class of married men and was no longer the object of that solicitous attention which he had received as an undrawn prize in the lottery of marriage while it was probable that somebody would have him and nobody knew who the absence of mr falconer was remarked by several young ladies to whom it appeared that miss gryll had lost her two most favoured lovers at once however as she had still many others it was not yet a decided case for sympathy of course she had no lack of partners and whatever might have been her internal anxiety she was not the least gay among the joyous assembly lord curryfin in his circuit of the apartments paused at the quadrilletable and said you have been absent two or three days mr macborrowdalewhat news have you brought from london mr macborrowdale not much my lord tables turn as usual and the ghosttrade appears to be thriving instead of being merely audible the ghosts are becoming tangible and shake hands under the tables with living wiseacres who solemnly attest the fact civilised men illuse their wives the wives revenge themselves in their own way and the divorce court has business enough on its hands to employ it twenty years at its present rate of progression commercial bubbles burst and highpressure boilers blow up and mountebanks of all descriptions flourish on public credulity everywhere there are wars and rumours of wars the peace society has wound up its affairs in the insolvent court of prophecy a great tribulation is coming on the earth and apollyon in person is to be perpetual dictator all the nations there is to be sure one piece of news your line but it will be no news to you there is a meeting of the pantopragmatic society under the presidency of lord facingbothways who has opened it with a long speech philanthropically designed as an elaborate exercise in fallacies for the benefit of young rhetoricians the society has divided its work into departments which are to meddle with everything from the highest to the lowestfrom a voice in legislation to a finger in jack horners pie i looked for a department of fish with your lordships name at the head of it but i did not find it it would be a fine department it would divide itself naturally into three classesliving fish fossil fish and fish in the fryingpan lord curryfin i assure you mr macborrowdale all this seems as ridiculous now to me as it does to you the third class of fish is all that i shall trouble myself with in future and that only at the tables of myself and my friends mr gryll i wonder the pantopragmatics have not a department of cookery a female department to teach young wives how to keep their husbands at home by giving them as good dinners as they can get abroad especially at club those antidomestic institutions receive their chief encouragment from the total ignorance of cookery on the part of young wives for in this as in all other arts of life it is not sufficient to order what shall be done it is necessary to know how it ought to be done this is a matter of more importance to social wellbeing than ninetenths of the subjects the pantopragmatics meddle with the rev dr opimian and therefore i rejoice that they do not meddle with it a dinner prepared from a new art of cookery concocted under their auspices would be more comical and more uneatable than the roman dinner in peregrine pickle let young ladies learn cookery by all means but let them learn under any other tuition than that of the pantopragmatic society mr gryll as for the tribulation coming on the earth i am afraid there is some ground to expect it without looking for its foreshadowing exclusively to the apocalypse niebuhr who did not draw his opinions from prophecy rejoiced that his career was coming to a close for he thought we were on the eve of a darker middle age the rev dr opimian he had not before his eyes the astounding march of intellect drumming and trumpeting science from city to city but i am afraid that sort of obstreperous science only gives people the novel use of their eyes to see the way of blindness truths which from actions paths retired my silent search in vain required gaoler for look you sir you know not which way you shall go posthumus yes indeed do i fellow gaoler your death has eyes ins head then i have not seen him so pictured posthumus i tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct them the way i am going but such as wink and will not use them gaoler what an infinite mock is this that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness cymbeline act v scene collins ode on the manners i am not likely to find in the successive gabblings of a dozen lecturers of babel mr gryll if you could so find them they would be of little avail against the new irruption of goths and vandals which must have been in the apprehension of niebuhr there are vandals on northern thrones anxious for nothing so much as to extinguish truth and liberty wherever they show themselvesvandals in the bosom of society everywhere even amongst ourselves in multitudes with precisely the same aim only more disguised by knaves and less understood by dupes the rev dr opimian and you may add vandals dominating over society throughout half america who deal with free speech and even the suspicion of free thought just as the inquisition dealt with them only substituting lynch law and the gallows for a different mockery of justice ending in fire and faggot mr gryll i confine my view to europe i dread northern monarchy and southern anarchy and rabble brutality amongst ourselves smothered and repressed for the present but always ready to break out into inextinguishable flame like hidden fire under treacherous ashes incedis per ignes suppositos cineri doloso hor carm i mr macborrowdale in the meantime we are all pretty comfortable and sufficient for the day is the evil thereof which in our case so far as i can see happens to be precisely none miss ilex lord curryfin seems to be of that opinion for he has flitted away from the discussion and is going down a country dance with miss niphet the rev dr opimian he has chosen his time well he takes care to be her last partner before supper that he may hand her to the table but do you observe how her tragic severity has passed away she was always pleasant to look on but it was often like contemplating ideal beauty in an animated statuenow she is the image of perfect happiness and irradiates all around her miss ilex how can it be otherwise the present and the future are all brightness to her she cannot but reflect their radiance now came the supper which as all present had dined early was unaffectedly welcomed and enjoyed lord curryfin looked carefully to the comfort of his idol but was unremitting in his attentions to her fair neighbours after supper dancing was resumed with an apparent resolution in the greater portion of the company not to go home till morning mr gryll mr macborrowdale the reverend doctor opimian and two or three elders of the party not having had their usual allowance of wine after their early dinner remained at the supper table over a bowl of punch which had been provided in ample quantity and in the intervals of dancing circulated amongst other refreshments round the sides of the ballroom where it was gratefully accepted by the gentlemen and not absolutely disregarded even by the young ladies this may be conceded on occasion without admitting goldonis facetious position that a woman masked and silent may be known to be

festival harry walking home one afternoon met the reverend doctor opimian who was on his way to the tower where he purposed to dine and pass the night mr falconers absence from the ball had surprised him especially as lord curryfins rivalry had ceased and he could imagine no good cause for his not returning to the grange the doctor held out his hand to harry who returned the grasp most cordially the doctor asked him how he and his six young friends were prospering in their siege of the hearts of the seven sisters harry hedgerow why sir so far as the young ladies are concerned we have no cause to complain but we cant make out the young gentleman he used to sit and read all the morning at the top of the tower now he goes up the stairs and after a little while he comes down again and walks into the forest then he goes upstairs again and down again and out again something must be come to him and the only thing we can think of is that he is crossed in love and he never gives me a letter or a message to the grange so putting all that together we havent a merry christmas you see sir the rev dr opimian i see still harping on a merry christmas let us hope that the next may make amends harry hedgerow have they a merry christmas at the grange sir the rev dr opimian very merry harry hedgerow then theres nobody crossed in love there sir the rev dr opimian that is more than i can say i cannot answer for others i am not and never was if that is any comfort to you harry hedgerow it is a comfort to me to see you and hear the sound of your voice sir it always does me good the rev dr opimian why then my young friend you are most heartily welcome to see and hear me whenever you please if you will come over to the vicarage and you will always find a piece of cold roast beef and a tankard of good ale and just now a shield of brawn there is some comfort in them harry hedgerow ah thank ye sir they are comfortable things in their way but it isnt for them i should come the rev dr

happens in this world never let it spoil your dinner harry hedgerow thats fathers advice sir but it wont always do when he lost mother that spoiled his dinner for many a day he has never been the same man since though he bears up as well as he can but if i could take miss dorothy home to him im sure that would all but make him young again and if he had a little harry dandle next christmas wouldnt he give him the first spoonful out of the marrowbone the rev dr opimian i doubt if that would be good food for little harry notwithstanding it was hectors way of feeding astyanax but we may postpone the discussion of his diet till he makes his appearance in the meantime live in hope but live on beef and ale the doctor again shook him heartily by the hand an harry took his leave illustration live in hope but live on beef and ale the doctor walked on soliloquising as usual this young mans father has lost a good wife and has never been the same man since if he had had a bad wife he would have felt it as a happy release this life has strange compensations it helps to show the truth of juvenals remark that the gods alone know what is good for us il xxii vv juvenal sut x v now here again is my friend at the tower if he had not as i am sure he has the love of morgana he would console himself with his vestals if he had not their sisterly affection he would rejoice in the love of morgana but having both the love and the affection he is between two counterattractions either of which would make him happy and both together make him miserable who can say which is best for him or for them or for morgana herself i almost wish the light of her favour had shone on lord curryfin that chance has pass from her and she will not easily find such another perhaps she might have held him in her bonds if she had been so disposed but miss niphet is a glorious girl and there is a great charm in such perfect reciprocity jupiter himself as i have before had occasion to remark must have prearranged their consentaneity the young lord went on some time adhering as he supposed to his first pursuit and falling unconsciously and inextricably into the second and the young lady went on devoting her whole heart and soul to him not clearly perhaps knowing it herself but certainly not suspecting that any one else could dive into the heart of her mystery and now they both seem surprised that nobody seems surprised at their sudden appearance in the character affianced lovers his is another example of strange compensation for if morgana had accepted him on his first offer miss niphet would not have thought of him but she found him a waif and stray a flotsam on the waters of love and landed him at her feet without art or stratagem artlessness and simplicity triumphed where the deepest design would have failed i do not know if she had any compensation to look for but if she had she has found it for never was a man with more qualities for domestic happiness and not pedro of portugal himself was more overwhelmingly in love when i first knew him i saw only the comic side of his character he has a serious one too and not the least agreeable part of it but the comic still shows itself i cannot well define whether his exuberant goodhumour is contagious and makes me laugh by anticipation as soon as i fall into his company or whether it is impossible to think of him gravely lecturing on fish as a member of the pantopragmatic society without perceiving a ludicrous contrast between his pleasant social face and the unpleasant social impertinence of those wouldbe meddlers with everything it is true he has renounced that folly but it is not so easy to dissociate him from the recollection no matter if i laugh he laughs with me if he laughs i laugh with him laugh when you can is a good maxim between welldisposed sympathies a very little cause strikes out the fire of merriment as long liveth the merry man they say as doth the sorry man and longer by a day and a day so acquired is a day worth having but then another sayd sawe doth men advise that they be together both merry and wise these two quotations are from the oldest comedy in the english language ralph roister doister republished by the shakespeare society very good doctrine and fit to be kept in mind but there is much good laughter without much wisdom and yet with no harm in it the doctor was approaching the tower when he met mr falconer who had made one of his feverish exits from it and was walking at double his usual speed he turned back with the doctor who having declined taking anything before dinner but a glass of wine and a biscuit they went up together to the library they conversed only on literary subjects the doctor though miss gryll was uppermost in his mind determined not to originate a word respecting her and mr falconer though she was also his predominant idea felt that it was only over a bottle of madeira he could unbosom himself freely to the doctor the doctor asked what he had been reading of late he said i have tried many things but i have alway returned to orlando innamorato there it is on the table an old edition of the original poem the doctor said i have seen an old edition something like this on the drawingroom table at the grange he was about to say something touching sympathy in taste but he checked himself in time the two younger sisters brought in lights i observe said the doctor that your handmaids always move in pairs my hot water for dressing is always brought by two inseparables whom it seems profanation to call housemaids illustration your handmaids always move in pairs mr falconer it is always so on my side of the house that not a breath of scandal may touch their reputation if you were to live here from january to december with a houseful of company neither you nor i nor any of my friends would see one of them alone for a single minute the rev dr opimian i approve the rule i would stake my life on the conviction that these sisters are pure as the newfalln snow when never yet the sullying sun has seen its purity nor the warm zephyr touched and tainted it southey thalaba but as the world is constituted the most perfect virtue needs to be guarded from suspicion i cannot however associate your habits with a houseful of company mr falconer there must be sympathies enough in the world to make up society for all tastes more difficult to find in some cases than in others but still always within the possibility of being found i contemplated when i arranged this house the frequent presence of a select party the aristophanic comedy and its adjuncts brought me into pleasant company elsewhere i have postponed the purpose not abandoned it several thoughts passed through the doctors mind he was almost tempted to speak them how beautiful was miss gryll in circe how charmingly she acted what was a select party without women and how could a bachelor invite them but this would be touching a string which he had determined not to be the first to strike so apropos of the aristophanic comedy he took down aristophanes and said what a high idea of athenian comedy is given by this single line in which the poet opines the bringing out of comedy to be the most difficult of all arts it would not seem to be a difficult art nowadays seeing how much new comedy is nightly produced in london and still more in paris which whatever may be its literary value amuses its audiences as much as aristophanes amused the athenians mr falconer there is this difference that though both audiences may be equally amused the athenians felt they had something to be proud of in the poet which our audiences can scarcely feel as far as novelties are concerned and as to the atrocious outrages on taste and feeling perpetrated under the name of burlesques i should be astonished if even those who laugh at them could look back on their amusement with any other feeling than that of being most heartily ashamed of the author the theatre and themselves when the dinner was over and a bottle of claret had been placed by the side of the doctor and a bottle of madeira by the side of his host who had not been sparing during dinner of his favourite beverage which had been to him for some days like ale to the captain and his friends in beaumont and fletcher almost his eating and his drinking solely the doctor said i am glad to perceive that you keep up your practice of having a good dinner though i am at the same time sorry to see that you have not done your old justice to it greek passageequits ale is their eating and their drinking solely scornful lady act iv scene mr falconer a great philosopher had seven friends one of whom dined with him in succession on each day of the week he directed amongst his last dispositions that during six months after his death the establishment of his house should be kept on the same footing and that a dinner should be daily provided for himself and his single guest of the day who was to be entreated to dine there in memory of him with one of his executors both philosophers to represent him in doing the honours of the table alternately the rev dr opimian i am happy to see that the honours of your table are done by yourself and not by an executor administrator or assign the honours are done admirably but the old justice on your side is wanting i do not however clearly see what the feralis cna of guest and executor has to do with the dinner of two living men mr falconer ah doctor you should say one living man and a ghost i am only the ghost of myself i do the honours of my departed conviviality the rev dr opimian i thought something was wrong but whatever it may be take horaces advicealleviate every ill with wine and song the sweet consolations of deforming anxiety mr falconer i do doctor madeira and the music of the seven sisters are my consolations and great ones but they do not go down to the hidden care that gnaws at the deepest fibres of the heart like ratatosk at the roots of the ash of ygdrasil the rev dr opimian in the scandinavian mythology one of the most poetical of all mythologies i have a great respect for odin and thor their adventures have always delighted me and the system was admirably adapted to foster the high spirit of a military people lucan has a fine passage on the subject illia omne malum vino cantuque levato deformis aggrimonio dulcibus alloquiis epod xiii pharsalia the doctor repeated the passage of lucan with great emphasis this was not what mr falconer wanted he had wished that the doctor should inquire into the cause of his trouble but independently of the doctors determination to ask no questions and to let his young friend originate his own disclosures the unlucky metaphor had carried the doctor into one of his old fields and if it had not been that he awaited the confidence which he felt sure his host would spontaneously repose in him the scandinavian mythology would have formed his subject for the evening he paused therefore and went on quietly sipping his claret mr falconer could restrain himself no longer and without preface or note of preparation he communicated to the doctor all that had passed between miss gryll and himself not omitting a single word of the passages of bojardo which were indelibly impressed on his memory the rev dr opimian i cannot see what there is to afflict you in all this you are in love with miss gryll she is disposed to receive you favourably what more would you wish in that quarter mr falconer no more in that quarter but the seven sisters are as sisters to me if i had seven real sisters the relationship would subsist and marriage would not interfere with it but be a woman as amiable as liberal as indulgent as confiding as she may she could not treat the unreal as she would the real tie the rev dr opimian i admit it is not to be expected still there is one way out of the difficulty and that is by seeing all the seven happily married mr falconer all the seven married surely that is impossible the rev dr opimian not so impossible as you apprehend the doctor thought it a favourable opportunity to tell the story of the seven suitors and was especially panegyrical on harry hedgerow observing that if the maxim noscitur a sociis might be reversed and a mans companions judged by himself it would be a sufficient recommendation of the other six whom moreover the result of his inquiries had given him ample reason to think well of mr falconer received with pleasure at christmas a communication which at the midsummer preceding would have given him infinite pain it struck him all at once that as he had dined so ill he would have some partridges for supper his larder being always well stocked with game they were presented accordingly after the usual music in the drawingroom and the doctor though he had dined well considered himself bound in courtesy to assist in their disposal when recollecting how he had wound up the night of the ball he volunteered to brew a bowl of punch over which they sate till a late hour discoursing of many things but chiefly of morgana illustration discoursing of many things but chiefly of morgana chapter xxxiii the conquest of thebes greek passage schylus prometheus oh wise was he the first who taught this lesson of observant thought that equal fates alone may dress the bowers of nuptial happiness that never where ancestral pride inflames or affluence rolls its tide should loves illomened bonds entwine the offspring of an humbler line mr falconer the next morning after the doctor had set out on his return walk departed from his usual practice of not seeing one of the sisters alone and requested that dorothy would come to him in the drawingroom she appeared before him blushing and trembling illustration she appeared before him blushing and trembling sit down he said dear dorothy i have something to say to you and your sisters but i have reasons for saying it first to you it is probable at any rate possible that i shall very soon marry and perhaps in that case you may be disposed to do the same and i am told that one of the best young men i have ever known is dying for love of you he is a good young man that is certain said dorothy then becoming suddenly conscious of how much she had undesignedly admitted she blushed deeper than before and by way of mending the matter she said but i am not dying for love of him i daresay you are not said mr falconer you have no cause to be so as you are sure of him and only your consent is wanting and yours said dorothy and that of my sisters especially my elder sisters indeed they ought to set the example i am sure of that said mr falconer so far if i understand rightly they have followed yours it was your lovers indefatigable devotion that brought together suitors to them all as to my consent that you shall certainly have so the next time you see master harry send him to me he is here now said dorothy then ask him to come in said mr falconer and dorothy retired in some confusion but her lips could not contradict her heart harry appeared mr falconer so harry you have been making love in my house without asking my leave harry hedgerow i couldnt help making love sir and i didnt ask your leave because i thought i shouldnt get it mr falconer candid as usual harry but do you think dorothy would make a good farmers wife harry hedgerow i think sir she is so good and so clever and so ready and willing to turn her hand to anything that she would be a fit wife for anybody from a lord downwards but it may be most for her own happiness to keep in the class in which she was born mr falconer she is not very pretty you know harry hedgerow not pretty sir if she isnt a beauty i dont know who is mr falconer well no doubt she is a handsome girl harry hedgerow handsome is not the thing sir shes beautiful mr falconer well harry she is beautiful if that will please you harry hedgerow it does please me sir i ought to have known you were joking when you said she was not pretty mr falconer but you know she has no fortune harry hedgerow i dont want fortune i want her and nothing else and nobody else mr falconer but i cannot consent to her marrying without a fortune of her own harry hedgerow why then ill give her one beforehand father has saved some money and she shall have that well settle it on her as the lawyers say mr falconer you are a thoroughly good fellow harry and i really wish dorothy joy of her choice but that is not what i meant she must bring you a fortune not take one from you and you must not refuse it harry repeated that he did not want fortune and mr falconer repeated that so far as depended on him he should not have dorothy without one it was not an arduous matter to bring to an amicable settlement the affair of harry and dorothy being thus satisfactorily arranged the other six were adjusted with little difficulty and mr falconer returned with a light heart to the grange where he presented himself at dinner on the twentyseventh day of his probation he found much the same party as before for though some of them absented themselves for a while they could not resist mr grylls earnest entreaties to return he was cordially welcomed by all and with a gracious smile from morgana chapter xxxiv christmas talesclassical tales

is not as it should be one evening at least of christmas ought to be devoted to merveilleuses histoires racontes autour du foyer which chateaubriand enumerates among the peculiar enjoyments of those qui nont pas quitt leur pays natal you must have plenty of ghosts in greek and latin doctor illustration you must have plenty of ghosts in greek and latin the rev dr opimian no doubt all literature abounds with ghosts but there are not many classical ghosts that would make a christmas tale according to the received notion of a ghost story the ghosts of patroclus in homer of darius in schylus of polydorus in euripides are fine poetical ghosts but none of them would make a ghost story i can only call to mind one such story in greek but even that as it has been turned into ballads by goethe in the bride of corinth and by lewis in the gay gold ring lewis says in a note on the gay gold ringi once read in some grecian author whose name i have forgotten the story which suggested to me the outline of the foregoing ballad it was as follows a young man arriving at the house of a friend to whose daughter he was betrothed was informed that some weeks had passed since death had deprived him of his intended bride never having seen her he soon reconciled himself to her loss especially as during his stay at his friends house a young lady was kind enough to visit him every night in his chamber whence she retired at daybreak always carrying with her some valuable present from her lover this intercourse continued till accident showed the young man the picture of his deceased bride and he recognised with horror the features of his nocturnal visitor the young ladys tomb being opened he found in it the various presents which his liberality had bestowed on his unknown innamoratam g lewis tales of wonder v i p would not be new to any one here there are some classical tales of wonder not ghost stories but suitable christmas tales there are two in petronius which i once amused myself by translating as closely as possible to the originals and if you please i will relate them as i remember them for i hold with chaucer whoso shall telle a tale after a man he most reherse as

this proposal being received with an unanimous by all means doctor the doctor went on these stories are told at the feast of trimalchio the first by niceros a freedman one of the guests while i was yet serving we lived in a narrow street where now is the house of gavilla there as it pleased the gods i fell in love with the wife of terentius the tavernkeepermelissa tarentianamany of you knew her a most beautiful kissthrower miss gryll that is an odd term doctor the rev dr opimian it relates i imagine to some graceful gesture of pantomimic dancing for beautiful hostesses were often accomplished dancers virgils copa which by the way is only half panegyrical gives us nevertheless a pleasant picture in this kind it seems to have been one of the great attractions of a roman tavern and the host in looking out for a wife was probably much influenced by her possession of this accomplishment the dancing probably was of that kind which the moderns call demicaractre and was performed in picturesque costume the doctor would have gone off in a dissertation on dancing hostesses but miss gryll recalled him to the story which he continued in the words of niceros but by hercules mine was pure love her manners charmed me and her friendliness if i wanted money if she had earned an as she gave me a semis if i had money i gave it into her keeping never was woman more trustworthy her husband died at a farm which they possessed in the country i left no means untried to visit her in her distress for friends are shown in adversity it so happened that my master had gone to capua to dispose of some castoff finery seizing the opportunity i persuaded a guest of ours to accompany me to the fifth milestone he was a soldier strong as pluto we set off before cockcrow the moon shone like day we passed through a line of tombs my man began some ceremonies before the pillars i sat down singing and counting the stars then as i looked round to my comrade he stripped himself and laid his clothes by the wayside my heart was in my nose i could no more move than a dead man but he walked three times round his clothes and was suddenly changed into a wolf do not think i am jesting no mans patrimony would tempt me to lie but as i had begun to say as soon as he was changed into a wolf he set up a long howl and fled into the woods i remained awhile bewildered then i approached to take up his clothes but they were turned into stone who was dying of fear but i but i drew my sword and went on cutting shadows till i arrived at the farm i entered the narrow way the life was half boiled out of me perspiration ran down me like a torrent my eyes were dead i could scarcely come to myself my melissa began to wonder why i walked so late and if you had come sooner she said you might at least have helped us for a wolf entered the farm and fell on the sheep tearing them and leaving them all bleeding he escaped but with cause to remember us for our man drove a spear through his neck when i heard these things i could not think of sleep but hurried homeward with the dawn and when i came to the place where the clothes had been turned into stone i found nothing but blood when i reached home my soldier was in bed lying like an ox and a surgeon was dressing his neck i felt that he was a turnskin and i could never after taste bread with him not if you would have killed me let those who doubt of such things look into them if i lie may the wrath of all your genii fall on me this story being told trimalchio the lord of the feast after giving his implicit adhesion to it and affirming the indisputable veracity of niceros relates another as a fact of his own experience while yet i wore long hair for from a boy i led a chian life our little iphis the delight of the family died by hercules a pearl quick beautiful one of ten thousand while therefore his unhappy mother was weeping for him and we all were plunged in sorrow suddenly witches came in pursuit of him as dogs you may suppose of a hare we had then in the house a cappadocian tall brave to audacity capable of lifting up an angry bull he boldly with a drawn sword rushed out through the gate having his left hand carefully wrapped up and drove his sword through a womans bosom here as it were safe be what i touch we heard a groan but assuredly i will not lie we did not see the women but our stout fellow returning threw himself into bed and all his body was livid as if he had been beaten with whips for the evil hand had touched him we closed the gate and resumed our watch over the dead but when the mother went to embrace the body of her son she touched it and found it was only a figure of which all the interior was straw no heart nothing the witches had stolen away the boy and left in his place a strawstuffed image i ask youit is impossible notto believe that there are women with more than mortal knowledge nocturnal women who can make that which is uppermost downmost but our tall hero after this was never again of his own colour indeed after a few days he died raving free boys wore long hair a chian life is a delicate and luxurious life trimalchio implies that though he began life as a slave he was a pet in the household and was treated as if he had been free we wondered and believed says a guest who heard the story and kissing the table we implored the nocturnals to keep themselves to themselves while we were returning from supper miss gryll those are pleasant stories doctor and the peculiar style of the narrators testifies to their faith in their own marvels still as you say they are not ghost stories lord curryfin shakespeares are glorious ghosts and would make good stories if they were not so familiarly known there is a ghost much to my mind in beaumont and fletchers lovers progress cleander has a beautiful wife calista and a friend lisander calista and lisander love each other en tout bien tout honneur lisander in selfdefence and in fair fight kills a court favourite and is obliged to conceal himself in the country cleander and dorilaus calistas father travel in search of him they pass the night at a country inn the jovial host had been long known to cleander who had extolled him to dorilaus but on inquiring for him they find he has been dead three weeks they call for more wine dismiss their attendants and sit up alone chatting of various things and among others of mine host whose skill on the lute and in singing is remembered and commended by cleander while they are talking a lute is struck within followed by a song beginning tis late and cold stir up the fire sit close and draw the table nigher be merry and drink wine thats old and ending welcome welcome shall go round and i shall smile though underground and when the song ceases the hosts ghost enters they ask him why he appears he answers to wait once more on cleander and to entreat a courtesy to see my body buried in holy ground for now i lie unhallowed by the clerks fault let my new grave be made amongst good fellows that have died before me and merry hosts of my kind cleander promises that it shall be done and dorilaus who is a merry old gentleman throughout the play adds and forty stoops of wine drank at thy funeral cleander asks him ist in your power some hours before my death to give me warning the host replies i cannot tell you truly but if i can so much on earth i loved you i will appear again in a subsequent scene the ghost forewarns him and he is soon after assassinated not premeditatedly but as an accident in the working out by subordinate characters of a plot to bring into question the purity of calistas love for lisander miss ilex in my young days ghosts were so popular that the first question asked about any new play was is there a ghost in it the castle spectre had set this fashion it was one of the first plays i saw when i was a very little girl the opening of the foldingdoors disclosing the illuminated oratory the extreme beauty of the actress who personated the ghost the solemn music to which she moved slowly forward to give a silent blessing to her kneeling daughter and the chorus of female voices chanting jubilate made an impression on me which no other scene of the kind has ever made that is my ghost but i have no ghost story worth telling mr falconer there are many stories in which the supernatural is only apparent and is finally explained but some of these especially the novels of brockden brown carry the principle of terror to its utmost limits what can be more appalling than his wielandt it is one of the few tales in which the final explanation of the apparently supernatural does not destroy or diminish the original effect miss gryll generally i do not like that explaining away i can accord a ready faith to the supernatural in all its forms as i do to the adventures of ulysses and orlando i should be sorry to see the enchantments of circe expounded into sleights of hand the rev dr opimian i agree with you miss gryll i do not like to find a ghost which has frightened me through two volumes turned into a cock lane ghost in the third miss gryll we are talking about ghosts but we have not a ghost story i want a ghost story miss niphet i will try to tell you one which i remember imperfectly it relates as many such stories do to a buried treasure an old miser had an only daughter he denied himself everything but he educated her well and treated her becomingly he had accumulated a treasure which he designed for her but could not bear the thought of parting with it and died without disclosing the place of its concealment the daughter had a lover not absolutely poor nor much removed from it he farmed a little land of his own when her father died and she was left destitute and friendless he married her and they endeavoured by economy and industry to make up for the deficiencies of fortune the young husband had an aunt with whom they sometimes passed a day of festival and christmas day especially they were returning home late at night on one of these occasions snow was on the ground the moon was in the first quarter and nearly setting crossing a field they paused a moment to look on the beauty of the starry sky and when they again turned their eyes to the ground they saw a shadow on the snow it was too long to have any distinct outline but no substantial form was there to throw it the young wife clung trembling to the arm of her husband the moon set and the shadow disappeared new years day came and they passed it at the aunts on their return the moon was full and high in heaven they crossed the same field not without hesitation and fear in the same spot as before they again saw the shadow it was that of a man in a large loose wrapper and a highpeaked hat they recognised the outline of the old miser the husband sustained his nearly fainting wife as their eyes were irresistibly fixed on it it began to move but a cloud came over the moon and they lost sight of it the next night was bright and the wife had summoned all her courage to follow out the mystery they returned to the spot at the same hour the shadow again fell on the snow and again it began to move and glided away slowly over the surface of the snow they followed it fearfully at length it stopped on a small mound in another field of their own farm they walked round and round it but it moved no more the husband entreated his wife to remain while he sought a stick to mark the place when she was alone the shadow spread out its arms as in the act of benediction and vanished the husband found her extended on the snow he raised her in his arms she recovered and they walked home he returned in the morning with a pickaxe and spade cleared away the snow broke into the ground and found a pot of gold which was unquestionably their own and then with the usual end of a nurses tale they lived happily all the rest of their lives miss ilex your story though differing in all other respects reminds me of a ballad in which there is a shadow on the snow around it and round he had ventured to go but no form that had life threw that stamp on the snow mr gryll in these instances the shadow has an outline without a visible form to throw it i remember a striking instance of shadows without distinguishable forms a young chevalier was riding through a forest of pines in which he had before met with fearful adventures when a strange voice called on him to stop he did not stop and the stranger jumped up behind him he tried to look back but could not turn his head they emerged into a glade where he hoped to see in the moonlight the outline of the unwelcome form but unaccountable shadows fell around unstamped with delineations of themselves miss bannermans tales of superstition and chivalry the three brothers vol iv p miss gryll well mr macborrowdale have you no ghost story for us mr macborrowdale in faith miss gryll ghosts are not much in my line the main business of my life has been among the driest matters of fact but i will tell you a tale of a bogle which i remember from my boyish days there was a party of witches and warlocks assembled in the refectory of a ruined abbey intending to have a merry supper if they could get the materials they had no money and they had for servant a poor bogle who had been lent to them by his satanic majesty on condition that he should provide their supper if he could but without buying or stealing they had a roaring fire with nothing to roast and a large stone table with nothing on it but broken dishes and empty mugs so the firelight shone on an uncouth set of long hungry faces whether there was among them ae winsome wench and wawlie is more than i can say but most probably there was or the bogle would scarcely have been so zealous in the cause still he was late on his quest the friars of a still flourishing abbey were making preparations for a festal day and had despatched a man with a cart to the nearest town to bring them a supply of good things he was driving back his cart well loaded with beef and poultry and ham and a supply of choice rolls for which a goodwife in the town was famous and a new arrival of rare old wine a special present to the abbot from some great lord the bogle having smelt out the prize presented himself before the carter in the form of a sailor with a wooden leg imploring charity the carter said he had nothing for him and the sailor seemed to go on his way he reappeared in various forms always soliciting charity more and more importunately every time and always receiving the same denial at last he appeared as an old woman leaning on a stick who was more pertinacious in her entreaties than the preceding semblances and the carter after asseverating with an oath that a whole shipload of beggars must have been wrecked that night on the coast reiterated that he had nothing for her only the smallest coin master said the old woman i have no coin said the carter just a wee bite and sup of something said the old woman you are scarcely going about without something to eat and drink something comfortable for yourself just look in the cart i am sure you will find something good something something something said the carter if there is anything fit to eat or drink in the cart i wish a bogle may fly away with it thank you said the bogle and changed himself into a shape which laid the carter on his back with his heels in the air the bogle made lawful prize of the contents of the cart the refectory was soon fragrant with the odour of roast and the old wine flowed briskly to the great joy of the assembly who passed the night in feasting singing and dancing and toasting old nick but tarn kend what was whni fu brawlie there was ae winsome wend and wawlie thai

must have a ghost story to tell us mr falconer not exactly a ghost story miss gryll but there is a legend which took my fancy and which i taured into a ballad if you permit me i will repeat it the permission being willingly granted mr falconer closed the series of fireside marvels by reciting the legend of saint laura saint larua in her sleep of death preserves beneath the tomb tis willed where what is willed must be in incorruptability her beauty and her bloom so pure her maiden life had been so free from earthly stain twas fixed in fate by heavens own queen that till the earths last

might not gainsay and sadly passed the timid band to execute the high command they dared not disobey the monument was opened then it gave to general sight the alabaster couch alone but all its lucid

funeral train lo on the morrow morn still closed the monument was found but in its robes funereal drest the corpse they had consigned to rest lay on the stony ground fear and amazement seized on all they called on marys aid and in the tomb unclosed again with choral hymn and funeral train the corpse again was laid but with the incorruptible corruption might not rest the lonely chapels stonepaved

live in tranquillity mr gryll to mr ballot miss gryll he thought of nothing but politics he had no feeling of poetry there was never a more complete negation of sympathy than between him and me mr gryll to sir john pachyderm miss gryll he was a mere man of the world with no feeling of any kind tolerable in company but tiresome beyond description in a ttette i did not choose that he should bestow all his tediousness on me mr gryll to mr enavant miss gryll he was what is called a fast man and was always talking of slow coaches i had no fancy for living in an express train i like to go quietly through life and to see all that lies in my way mr gryll to mr geront miss gryll he had only one fault but that one was unpardonable he was too old to do him justice he did not begin as a lover seeing that i took pleasure in his society he was led by degrees into fancying that i might accept him as a husband i liked his temper his acquirements his conversation his love of music and poetry his devotion to domestic life but age and youth cannot harmonise in marriage mr gryll to mr long owen miss gryll he was in debt and kept it secret from me i thought he only wanted my fortune but be that as it might the concealment destroyed my esteem mr gryll to mr larvel miss gryll he was too ugly expression may make plain features agreeable and i tried if daily intercourse would reconcile me to his but no his ugliness was unredeemed mr gryll none of these objections applied to lord curryfin miss gryll no uncle but he came too late and besides he soon found what suited him better mr gryll there were others did any of the same objections apply to them all miss gryll indeed uncle the most of them were nothing or at best mere suits of good clothes men made as it were to pattern by the dozen selfish frivolous without any earnest pursuit or desire to have one ornamental drawingroom furniture no more distinguishable in memory than a set of chairs mr gryll well my dear morgana for mere negations there is no remedy but for positive errors even for gambling it strikes me they are curable miss gryll no uncle even my limited observation has shown me that men are easily cured of unfashionable virtues but never of fashionable vices miss gryll and miss niphet arranged that their respective marriages and those of the seven sisters should be celebrated at the same time and place in the course of their castlebuilding before marriage miss niphet said to her intended when i am your wife i shall release you from your promise of not trying experiments with horses carriages boats and so forth but with this proviso that if ever you do try a dangerous experiment it shall be in my company no dear alice he answered you will make my life too dear to me to risk it in any experiment you shall be my guiding star and the only question i shall ask respecting my conduct in life will be whether it pleases you some natural tears they shed but wiped them soon might have been applied to the sisters when they stepped on their bridal morning into the carriages which were to convey them to the grange it was the dissipation of a dream too much above mortal frailty too much above the contingencies of chance and change to be permanently realised but the damsels had consented and the suitors rejoiced and if ever there was a man on earth with his saul abune the moon it was harry hedgerow on the bright february morning that gave him the hand of his dorothy illustration his saul abune the moon there was a grand djeuner at gryll grange there were the nine brides and the nine bridegrooms a beautiful array of bridesmaids a few friends of mr gryll mr niphet lord curryfin and mr falconer and a large party at the lower end of the hall composed of fathers mothers and sisters of the bridegrooms of the seven vestals none of the bridegrooms had brothers and harry had neither mother nor sister but his father was there in rustic portliness looking as harry had anticipated as if he were all but made young again among the most conspicuous of the party were the reverend doctor opimian and his lady who had on this occasion stepped out of her domestic seclusion in due course the reverend doctor stood up and made a speech which may be received as the epilogue of our comedy the rev dr opimian we are here to do honour to the nuptials first of the niece of our excellent host a young lady whom to name is to show her title to the love and respect of all present with a young gentleman of whom to say that he is in every way worthy of her is to say all that can be said of him in the highest order of praise secondly of a young lord and lady to whom those who had the pleasure of being here last christmas are indebted for the large share of enjoyment which their rare and diversified accomplishments and their readiness to contribute in every way to social entertainment bestowed on the assembled party and who both in contrast and congenialityfor both these elements enter into perfect fitness of companionshipmay be considered to have been expressly formed for each other thirdly of seven other young couples on many accounts most interesting to us all who enter on the duties of married life with as fair expectation of happiness as can reasonably be entertained in this diurnal sphere an old greek poet saysfour things are good for man in this world first health second personal beauty third riches not dishonourably acquired fourth to pass life among friends but thereon says the comic poet anaxandrides health is rightly placed first but riches should have been second for what is beauty ragged and starving greek passage simonides athenus xv p be this as it may we here see them all four health in its brightest bloom riches in two instances more than competence in the other seven beauty in the brides good looks as far as young men need them in the bridegrooms and as bright a prospect of passing life among friends as ever shone on any most earnestly do i hope that the promise of their marriage morning may be fulfilled in its noon and in its sunset and when i add may they all be as happy in their partners as i have been i say what all who knew the excellent person beside me will feel to be the best good wish in my power to bestow and now to the health of the brides and bridegrooms in bumpers of champagne let all the attendants stand by each with a fresh bottle with only one uncut string let all the corks when i give the signal be discharged simultaneously and we will receive it as a peal of bacchic ordnance in honour of the power of joyful event whom we may assume to be presiding on this auspicious occasion this was a roman deity invocato hilaro atque prospra eventuapuleius metamorph iv the end
