contents chapter i chapter ii chapter iii chapter iv chapter v chapter vi chapter vii chapter viii chapter ix chapter x chapter xi chapter xii chapter xiii chapter xiv chapter xv chapter xvi chapter xvii chapter xviii lodore chapter i excellent creature whose perfections make even sorrow lovely beaumont and fletcher mr villiers now became the constant visitor of mrs elizabeth and her niece and all discontent all sadness all listlessness vanished in his presence there was in his mind a constant spring of vivacity which did not display itself in mere gaiety but in being perfectly alive at every moment and continually ready to lend himself to the comfort and solace of his companions sitting in their dingy london house the spirit of dulness had drawn a curtain between them and the sun and neither thought nor event had penetrated the fortification of silence and neglect which environed them edward villiers came and as mist flies before the wind so did all ethels depression disappear when his voice only met her ear his step on the stairs announced happiness and when he was indeed before her light and day displaced every remnant of cheerless obscurity the abstracted wounded yet lofty spirit of lodore was totally dissimilar to the airy brightness of villiers disposition lodore had outlived a storm and shown himself majestic in ruin no ill had tarnished the nature of villiers he enjoyed life he was in goodhumour with the world and thought well of mankind lodore had endangered his peace from the violence of passion and reaped misery from the pride of his soul villiers was imprudent from his belief in the goodness of his fellowcreatures and imparted happiness from the store that his warm heart insured to himself the one had never been a boythe other had not yet learned to be a man ethels heart had been filled by her father and all affection all interest borrowed their force from his memory she did not think of love and while villiers was growing into a part of her life becoming knit to her existence by daily habit and a thousand thoughts expended on him she entertained his idea chiefly as having been the friend of lodore he is certainly the kindesthearted creature in the world this was the third time that when laying her gentle head on the pillow this feeling came like a blessing to her closing eyes she heard his voice in the silence of night even more distinctly than when it was addressed to her outward sense during the day for the first time after the lapse of months she found one to whom she could spontaneously utter every thought as it rose in her mind a fond elder brother if such ever existed cherishing the confidence and tenderness of a beloved sister might fill the place which her new friend assumed for ethel she thought of him with overflowing affection and the name of mr villiers sometimes fell from her lips in solitude and hung upon her ear like sweetest music in early life there is a momentperhaps of all the enchantments of love it is the one which is never renewedwhen passion unacknowledged to ourselves imparts greater delight than any afterstage of that everprogressive sentiment we neither wish nor expect a new joy has risen like the sun upon our lives and we rejoice in the radiance of morning without adverting to the noon and twilight that is to follow ethel stood on the threshold of womanhood the door of life had been closed before heragain it was thrown openand the sudden splendour that manifested itself blinded her to the forms of the objects of menace or injury which a more experienced eye would have discerned within the brightness of her newfound day ethel expressed a wish to visit eton in talking of the past lord lodore had never adverted to any events except those which had occurred during his boyish days his youthful pleasures and exploits had often made a part of their conversation he had traced for her a plan of eton college and the surrounding scenery spoken of the trembling delight he had felt in escaping from bounds and told how he and derham had passed happy hours beside the clear streams and beneath the copses of that rural country there was one fountain which he delighted to celebrate and the ivied ruins of an old monastery now become a part of a farmyard which had been to these friends the bodily image of many imaginary scenes among the sketches of whitelock were several taken in the vicinity of windsor and there were in his portfolio studies of trees cottages and also of this same abbey which lodore instantly recognized to many he had some appending anecdote some schoolboy association he had purchased the whole collection from whitelock ethel had copied a few and these together with various sketches made in the illinois formed her dearest treasure more precious in her eyes than diamonds and rubies we are most jealous of what sits nearest to our hearts and we must love fondly before we can let another into the secret of those trivial but cherished emotions which form the dearest portion of our solitary meditations ethel had several times been on the point of proposing a visit to eton to her aunt but there was an awful sacredness in the very name which acted like a spell upon her imagination when first it fell from her lips the word seemed echoed by unearthly whisperings and she fled from the idea of going thitheras it is the feminine disposition often to do from the full accomplishment of its wishes as if disaster must necessarily be linked to the consummation of their desires but a word was enough for villiers he eagerly solicited permission to escort them thither as being an etonian himself his guidance would be of great advantage ethel faltered her consent and the struggle of delight and sensibility made that project appear painful which was indeed the darling of her thoughts on a bright day in the first week of may they made this excursion they repaired to one of the inns at salt hill and prolonged their walks and drives about the country in some of the former where old walls were to be scrambled up and rivulets overleaped mrs elizabeth remained at the hotel and ethel and villiers pursued their rambles together ethels whole soul was given up to the deep filial love that had induced the journey every green field was a stage on which her father had played a part each majestic tree or humble streamlet was hallowed by being associated with his image the pleasant verdant beauty of the landscape clad in all the brightness of early summer the sunny balmy daythe clouds which pranked the heavens with bright and floating shapeseach hedgerow and each cottage with its trim gardeneach embowered nookhad a voice which was music to her soul from the college of eton they sought the dames house where lodore and derham had lived then crossing the bridge they entered windsor and prolonged their walk into the forest ethel knew even the rustic names of the spots she most desired to visit and to these villiers led her in succession day declined before they got home and found mrs elizabeth and their repast waiting them and the evening was enlivened by many a tale of boyish pranks achieved by villiers in these scenes the following morning they set forth again and three days were spent in these delightful wanderings ethel would willingly never have quitted this spot it appeared to her as if seeing all still much remained to be seenas if she could never exhaust the variety of sentiments and deep interest which endeared every foot of this to her so holy ground nor were her emotions silent and the softness of her voice and the flowing eloquence with which she expressed herself formed a new charm for her companion sometimes her heart was too full to admit of expression and grief for her fathers loss was renewed in all its pristine bitterness one day on feeling herself thus overcome she quitted her companions and sought the shady walks of the garden of the hotel to indulge in a gush of sorrow which she could not repress there was something in her gesture and manner as she left them that reminded villiers of lady lodore it was one of those mysterious family resemblances which are so striking and powerful and yet which it is impossible to point out to a stranger a bligh as this indescribable resemblance is called in some parts of england of her motherstruck villiers forcibly and he suddenly asked mrs elizabeth if miss fitzhenry had never expressed a desire to see lady lodore god forbid exclaimed the old lady it was my brothers dying wish that she should never hear lady lodores name and i have religiously observed it ethel only knows that she was the cause of her fathers misfortunes that she deserted every duty and is unworthy of the name she bears villiers was astonished at this tirade falling from the lips of the unusually placid maiden whose heightened colour bespoke implacable resentment do not mention that womans name mr villiers she continued i am convinced that i should die on the spot if i saw her she is as much a murderess as if she had stabbed her husband to the heart with a dagger her letter to me that i sent to my poor brother in america was more the cause of his death i am sure than all the duels in the world lady lodore i often wonder a thunderbolt from heaven does not fall on and kill her mrs elizabeths violence was checked by seeing ethel cross the road to return promise not to mention her name to my niece she cried for the present be assured that i will not villiers answered he had been struck most painfully by some of mrs elizabeths expressions they implied so much more of misconduct on lady lodores part than he had ever suspectedbut she must know best and it seemed to him indeed the probable interpretation of the mystery that enveloped her separation from her husband the account spread by lady santerre and current in the world appeared inadequate and improbable lodore would not have dared to take her child from her but on heavier grounds it was then true that a dark and disgraceful secret was hidden in her heart and that her propriety her good reputation her seeming pride of innocence were but the mask to cover the reality that divided her from her daughter for ever villiers was well acquainted with lady lodore circumstances had caused him to take a deep interest in herthese were now at an end but the singular coincidences that had brought him in contact with her daughter renewed many forgotten images and caused him to dwell on the past with mixed curiosity and uneasiness mrs elizabeths expressions added to the perplexity of his ideas their chief effect was to tarnish to his mind the name of lady lodore and to make him rejoice at the termination that had been put to their more intimate connexion chapter ii one within whose subtle being as light and wind within some delicate cloud that fades amid the blue noons burning sky genius and youth contended shelley the party returned to town and on the following evening they went to the italian opera for the first time since her fathers death ethel threw aside her mourning attire for the first time also she made one of the audience at the kings theatre she went to hear the music and to spend the evening with the only person in the world who was drawn towards her by feelings of kindness and sympathythe only personbut that sufficed his being near her was the occasion of more delight than if she had been made the associate of regal splendour yet it was no defined or disturbing sentiment that sat so lightly on her bosom and shone in her eyes hers was the first gentle opening of a girls heart who does not busy herself with the future and reposes on the serene present with unquestioning confidence she looked round on the gay world assembled and thought all are as happy as i am she listened to the music with a subdued but charmed spirit and turned now and then to her companions with a glad smile expressive of her delight fewer words were spoken in their little box probably than in any in the house but in none were congregated three hearts so guileless and so perfectly satisfied with the portion allotted to them at length both opera and ballt were over and leaning on the arm of villiers the ladies entered the roundroom the house had been very full and the crowd was great a seat was obtained for aunt bessy on one of the sofas near the door which opened on the principal staircase villiers and ethel stood near her when the crowd had thinned a little villiers went to look for the servant and ethel remained surveying the moving numbers with curiosity wondering at her own fate that while every one seemed familiar one to the other she knew and was known by none she did not repine at this villiers had dissipated the sense of desertion which before haunted her and she was much entertained as she heard the remarks and interchange of compliments going on about her her attention was particularly attracted by a very beautiful woman or rather girl she seemed standing on the other side of the room conversing with a very tall personage to whom she being not above the middle size looked up as she talked which action perhaps added to her youthful appearance there was an ease in her manners that bespoke a matron as to station she was dressed very simply in white without any ornament her cloak hung carelessly from her shoulders and gave to view her round symmetrical figure her silky chesnutcoloured hair fell in thick ringlets round her face and was gathered with inimitable elegance in large knots on the top of her head there was something bewitching in her animated smile and sensibility beamed from her long and dark grey eyes her simple gesture as she placed her little hand on her cloak her attitude as she stood were wholly unpretending but graceful beyond measure ethel watched her unobserved with admiration and interest so that she almost forgot where she was until the voice of villiers recalled her your carriage is upwill you come the lady turned as he spoke and recognized him with a cordial and most sweet smile they moved on while ethel turned back to look again as her carriage was loudly called and mrs elizabeth seizing her arm whispered out of breath o my dear do make haste she hurried on therefore and her glance was momentary but she saw with wonder that the lady was looking with eagerness at the party she caught ethels eye blushed and turned away while the folding doors closed and with a kind of nervous trepidation her companions descended the stairs in a moment the ladies were in their carriage which drove off while mrs elizabeth exclaimed in the tone of one aghast thank god we got away o ethel that was lady lodore my motherimpossible o that we had never come to town continued her aunt long have i prayed that i might never see her againand she looking as if nothing had happened and that lodore had not died through her means wicked wicked woman i will not stay in london a day longer ethel did not interrupt her ravings she remembered captain markham and could not believe but that her aunt laboured under some similar mistake it was ridiculous to imagine that this girlishlooking lovely being had been the wife of her father whom she remembered with his high forehead rather bare of hair his deep marked countenance his look that bespoke more than mature age her aunt was mistaken she felt sure and yet when she closed her eyes the beautiful figure she had seen stole according to the arabian image beneath her lids and smiled sweetly and again started forward to look after her this little act seemed to confirm what mrs elizabeth said and yet again it was impossible had she been named my sister there were something in itbut my motherimpossible yet strange as it seemed it was so in this instance mrs elizabeth had not deceived herself and thus it was that two so near of kin as mother and daughter met it might be said for the first time villiers was inexpressibly shocked and believing that lady lodore must suffer keenly from so strange and unnatural an incident his first kindly impulse was to seek to see her on the following morning during her absence the violent attack of her sisterinlaw had weighed with him but her look at once dissipated his uneasy doubts there was that in this lady which no man could resist she had joined to her beauty the charm of engaging manners made up of natural grace vivacity intuitive tact and soft sensibility which infused a kind of idolatry into the admiration with which she was universally regarded but it was not the beauty and fashion of lady lodore which caused villiers to take a deep interest in her his intercourse with her had been of long standing and the object of his very voyage to america was intimately connected with her edward villiers was the son of a man of fortune his father had been left a widower young in life with this only child who thus single and solitary in his paternal home became almost adopted into the family of his mothers brother viscount maristow this nobleman being rich married and blessed with a numerous progeny the presence of little edward was not felt as a burthen and he was brought up with his cousins like one of them among these it would have been hard if villiers could not have found an especial friend this was not the elder son who much his senior looked down upon him with friendly regard it was the second who was likewise several years older horatio saville was a being fashioned for every virtue and distinguished by every excellence to know that a thing was right to be done was enough to impel horatio to go through fire and water to do it he was one of those who seem not to belong to this world yet who adorn it most conscientious upright and often cold in seeming because he could always master his passions good overmuch he might be called but that there was no pedantry nor harshness in his nature resolute aspiring and true his noble purposes and studious soul demanded a frame of iron and he had one of the frailest mechanism it was not that he was not tall wellshaped with earnest eyes a brow built up high to receive and entertain a capacious mind but he was thin and shadowy a hectic flushed his cheek and his voice was broken and mournful at school he held the topmost place at college he was distinguished by the energy with which he pursued his studies and these so opposite from what might have been expected to be the pursuits of his ardent mind were abstruse metaphysicsthe highest and most theoretical mathematics and crossgrained argument based upon hairfine logic to these he addicted himself his desire was knowledge his passion truth his eager and neversleeping endeavour was to inform and to satisfy his understanding villiers waited on him as an inferior spirit may attend on an archangel and gathered from him the crumbs of his knowledge with gladness and content he could not force his boyish mind to similar exertions nor feel that keen thirst for knowledge that kept alive his cousins application though he could admire and love these with fervour when exhibited in another it was indeed a singular fact that this constant contemplation of so superior a being added to his careless turn of mind not to be like horatio was to be nothingto be like him was impossible so he was content to remain one of the halfignorant uninformed creatures most men are and to found his pride upon his affection for his cousin who being several years older might well be advanced even beyond his emulation horatio himself did not desire to be imitated by the lighthearted edward he was too familiar with the exhaustion the sadness the disappointment of his pursuits he could not be otherwise himself but he thought all that he aspired after was well exchanged for the sparkling eyes exhaustless spirits and buoyant step of villiers we none of us wish to exchange our identity for that of another yet we are never satisfied with ourselves the unknown has always a charm and unless blinded by miserable vanity we know ourselves too well to appreciate our especial characteristics at a very high rate when horace after deep midnight study felt his brain still working like a thousand millwheels that cannot be stopped when sleep fled from him and yet his exhausted mind could no longer continue its labourshe envied the light slumbers of his cousin which followed exercise and amusement villiers loved and revered him and he felt drawn closer to him than towards any of his brothers and strove to refine his taste and regulate his conduct through his admonitions and example while he abstained from following him in the steep and thorny path he had selected horatio quitted college he was no longer a youth and his manhood became as studious as his younger days he had no desire but for knowledge no thought but for the nobler creations of the soul and the discernment of the sublime laws of god and nature he nourished the ambition of showing to these latter days what scholars of old had been though this feeling was subservient to his instinctive love of learning and his wish to adorn his mind with the indefeasible attributes of truth he was universally respected and loved though little understood his young cousin edward only was aware of the earnestness of his affections and the sensibility that nestled itself in his warm heart he was outwardly mild placid and forbearing and thus obtained the reputation of being coldthough those who study human nature ought to make it their first maxim that those who are tolerant of the follies of their fellowswho sympathize with and assist their wishes and who apparently forget their own desires as they devote themselves to the accomplishment of those of their friends must have the quickest feelings to make them enter into and understand those of others and the warmest affections to be able to conquer their wayward humours so that they can divest themselves of selfishness and incorporate in their own being the pleasures and pains of those around them the sparkling eye the languid step and flushed cheek of horatio saville were all tokens that there burnt within him a spirit too strong for his frame but he never complained or if he ever poured out his pentup emotions it was in the ear of edward only who but partly understood him but who loved him entirely what that thirst for knowledge was that preyed on him and for ever urged him to drink of the purest streams of wisdom and yet which ever left him unsatisfied fevered and mournful the gay spirit of edward villiers could not guess often he besought his cousin to close his musty books to mount a rapid horse to give his studies to the winds and deliver his soul to nature but horace pointed to some unexplained passage in plato the divine or some undiscovered problem in the higher sciences and turned his eyes from the sun or if indeed he yielded and accompanied his youthful friend some appearance of earth or air would awaken his curiosity rouze his slumbering mind again to inquire and making his study of the wide cope of heaven he gave himself up to abstruse meditation while nominally seeking for relaxation from his heavier toils horatio saville was nineandtwenty when he first met lady lodore who was nearly the same age he had begun to feel that his health was shaken and he tried to forget for a time his devouring avocations he changed the scene and went on a visit to a friend who had a country house not far from hastings lady lodore was expected as a guest together with her mother she was much talked of having become an object of interest or curiosity to the many a mystery hung over her fate but her reputation was cloudless and she was warmly supported by the leaders of fashion saville heard of her beauty and her sufferings the injustice with which she had been treatedof her magnanimity and desolate condition he heard of her talents her powers of conversation her fashion he figured to himself as we are apt to incarnate to our imagination the various qualities of a human being of whom we hear much a woman brilliant but rather masculine majestic in figure with wild dark eyes and a very determined manner lady lodore came she entered the room where he was sitting and the fabric of his fancy was at once destroyed he saw a sweetlooking woman serene fair and with a countenance expressive of contented happiness he found that her manners were winning from their softness her conversation was delightful from its total want of pretension or impertinence what the power was that from the first moment they met drew horatio saville and lady lodore together is one of those natural secrets which it is impossible to explain though a student saville was a gentleman with the manners and appearance of the better specimens of our aristocracy there might be something in his look of ill health which demanded sympathy something in his superiority to the rest of the persons about her in the genius that sat on his brow and the eloquence that flowed from his lips something in the contrast he presented to every one else she had ever seenneither entering into their gossiping slanders nor understanding their empty selfsufficiency that possessed a charm for one satiated with the worlds common scene it was less of wonder that cornelia pleased the student there were no rough corners no harshness about her she won her way into any heart by her cheerful smiles and kind tones and she listened to saville when he talked of what other women would have lent a languid ear to with such an air of interest that he found no pleasure so great as that of talking on saville was accustomed to find the men of his acquaintance ignorant all the knowledge of worldlings was as a point in comparison with his vast acquirements he did not seek lady lodores society either to learn or to teach but to forget thought and to feel himself occupied and diverted from the sense of listlessness that haunted him in society without having recourse to the to him dangerous attraction of his books lady lodore had in the very brightness of her earliest youth selected a proud and independent position she had refused to bend to her husbands will or to submit to the tyranny as she named it which he had attempted to exercise youth is bold and fearless the forked tongue of scandal the thousand ills with which woman is threatened in society without a guide or a protectorall the worldly considerations which might lead her to unite herself again to her husband she had rejected with unbounded disdain her mother was there to stand between her and the shafts of envy and calumny and she conceived no mistrust of herself she believed that she could hold her course with taintless feelings and security of soul through a thousand dangers at first she had been somewhat annoyed by illnatured observations but lady santerre poured the balm of flattery on her wounds and a few tears shed in her presence dissipated the gathering cloud cornelia had every motive a woman could have for guarding her conduct from reproach she lived in the midst of polished society and was thoroughly imbued with its maxims and laws she witnessed the downfall of several as young and lovely as herself and heard the sarcasms and beheld the sneers which were heaped as a tomb above their buried fame she had vowed to herself never to become one of these she was applauded for her pride and held up as a pattern no one feared her she was no coquette though she strove universally to please she formed no intimate friendships though every man felt honoured by her notice she had no prudery on her lips but her conduct was as open and as fair as day here lay her defence against her husband and she preserved even the outposts of such bulwarks with scrupulous yet unobtrusive exactitude her spirits as well as her spirit held her up through many a year more than ten years had passed since her separation from lodorea long time to tell of but it had glided away she scarcely knew howtaking little from her loveliness adding to the elegance of her appearance and the grace of her manners season after season came and went and she had no motive for counting them anxiously she was sought after and admired it was a holiday life for her and she wondered what people meant when they spoke of the delusions of this world and the dangers of our own hearts she saw a gay reality about her and felt the existence of no internal enemy nothing ever moved her to sorrow except the reflection that now and then came across that she had a childdivorced for ever from her maternal bosom the sight of a baby cradled in its mothers arms or stretching out its little hands to her had not unoften caused her to turn abruptly away to hide her tears and once or twice she had been obliged to quit a theatre to conceal her emotion when such sentiments were brought too vividly before her but when her eyes were drowned in tears and her bosom heaved with sad emotion pride came to check the torrent and hatred of her oppressor gave a new impulse to her swelling heart she had rather avoided female friendships and had been warned from them by the treachery of one and the misconduct of another of her more intimate acquaintances lady lodore renounced friendship but the world began to grow a little dull the frivolity of one the hardheartedness of another disgusted she saw each occupied by themselves and their families and she was alone balls and assemblies palled upon hercountry pleasures were stupidshe had began to think all things stale and unprofitable when she became acquainted with horatio saville she was glad again to feel animated with a sense of living enjoyment she congratulated herself on the idea that she could take interest in some one thing or person among the empty shapes that surrounded her and without a thought beyond the amusement of the present moment most of her hours were spent in his company chapter iii ah now ye gentle pairnow think awhile now while ye still can think and still can smile so did they think only with graver thoughts and smiles reduced leigh hunt a month stole away as if it had been a day and lady lodore was engaged to pass some weeks with another friend in a distant county it was easily contrived without contrivance by saville that he should visit a relation who lived within a mornings ride of her new abode the restriction placed upon their intercourse while residing under different roofs contrasted painfully with the perfect freedom they had enjoyed while inhabiting the same their attachment was too young and too unacknowledged to need the zest of difficulty it required indeed the facility of an unobstructed path for it to proceed to the accustomed bourne and a straw thrown across was sufficient to check its course for ever the impatience and restlessness which cornelia experienced during her journey the rush of transport that thrilled through her when she heard of savilles arrival at a neighbouring mansion awoke her in an instant to a knowledge of the true state of her heart her pride was happily for herself united to presence of mind and fortitude she felt the invasion of the enemy and she lost not a moment in repelling the dangers that menaced her she resolved to be true to the line of conduct she had marked out for herselfshe determined not to love she did not alter her manner nor her actions she met horatio with the same sweet smileshe conversed with the same kind interest but she did not indulge in one dream one thoughtone reverie sweet food of love during his absence and guarded over herself that no indication of any sentiment less general than the friendship of society might appear though she was invariably kind yet his feelings told him that she was changed without his being able to discover where the alteration lay the line of demarcation which she took care never to pass was too finely traced for any but feminine tact to discern though it obstructed him as if it had been as high and massive as a city wall now and then his speaking eye rested on her with a pleading glance while she answered his look with a frank smile that spoke a heart at ease and perfect selfpossession indeed while they remained near each other in despite of all her selfdenying resolves cornelia was happy she felt that there was one being in the world who took a deep and present interest in her whose thoughts hovered round her and whose mind she could influence to the conception of any act or feeling she might desire that tranquillity yet animation of spiritthat gratitude on closing her eyes at nightthat glad anticipation of the morrows sunthat absence of every harsh and jarring emotion which is the disposition of the human soul the nearest that we can conceive to perfect happiness and which now and then visits sad humanity to teach us of what unmeasured and pure joy our fragile nature is capable attended her existence and made each hour of the day a newborn blessing this state of things could not last an accident revealed to saville the true state of his heart he became aware that he loved cornelia deeply and fervently and from that moment he resolved to exile himself for ever from her dear presence misery is the child of love when happiness is not this horatio felt but he did not shrink from the endurance all abstracted and lofty as his speculations were still his place had been in the hotbed of patrician society and he was familiar with the repetition of domestic revolutions too frequent there for worlds he would not have cornelias name become a byeword and mark for scandalthat name which she had so long kept bright and unreachable his natural modesty prevented him from entertaining the idea that he could indeed destroy her peace but he knew how many and easy are the paths which lead to the loss of honour in the worlds eyes that it could be observed and surmised that one man had approached lady lodore with any but sentiments of reverence was an evil to be avoided at any cost saville was firm as rock in his resolveshe neither doubted nor procrastinated he left the neighbourhood where she resided and returning to his fathers house tried to acquire strength to bear the severe pain which he could not master his gentle and generous nature ever thoughtful for others and prodigal of self was not however satisfied with this mere negative act of justice towards one who honoured him he felt conscious with her friendship and kindest thoughts he was miserable in the idea that he could not further serve her he revolved a thousand plans in his mind tending to her advantage in fancy he entered the solitude of her meditations and tried to divine what her sorrows or desires were that he might minister to their solace or accomplishment their previous intercourse had been very unreserved and though cornelia spoke but distantly and coldly of lodore she frequently mentioned her child and lamented with much emotion the deprivation of all those joys which maternal love bestows often had saville said why not appeal more strongly to lord lodore or if he be inflexible why calmly endure an outrage shocking to humanity the laws of your country may assist you they would not said cornelia for his reply would be so fraught with seeming justice that the blame would fall back on me he asks but the trivial sacrifice of my duty to my mothermy poor mother who since i was born has lived with me and for me and who has no existence except through me i am to tear away and to trample upon the first of human ties to render myself worthy of the guardianship of my child i cannot do iti should hold myself a parricide do not let us talk more of these things endurance is the fate of woman and if i have more than my share let us hope that some other poor creature less able to bear has her portion lightened in consequence i should be glad if once indeed i were permitted to see my cherub girl though it were only while she slept but an ocean rolls between us and patience must be my comforter the soft sweetness of her look and voice the angelic grace that animated every tone and glance rendered these maternal complaints mournful yet enchanting music to the ear of saville he could have listened for ever but when exiled from her they assumed another form he began to think whether it were not possible to convince lord lodore of the inexcusable cruelty of his conduct and again and again he imaged the exultation of heart he should feel if he could succeed in placing her lost babe in the mothers arms saville was the frankest of human beings finding his cousin edward on a visit at maristow castle he imparted his project to him of making a voyage to america seeking out lord lodore and using every argument and persuasion to induce him to restore her daughter to his wife villiers was startled at the mention of this chivalrous intent what could have rouzed the studious horace to such sudden energy by one of those strange caprices of the human mind which bring forth discord instead of harmony edward had never liked lady lodorehe held her to be false and dangerous circumstances had brought him more in contact with her mother than herself and the two were associated and confounded in his mind till he heard lady santerres falsetto voice in the sweet one of cornelia and saw her deceitful vulgar devices in the engaging manners of her daughter he was struck with horror when he discovered that saville loved nay idolized this beauteous piece of mischief as he would have named her he saw madness and folly in his quixotic expedition and argued against it with all his might it would not do horatio was resolved to dedicate himself to the happiness of her he loved and since this must be done in absence and distance what better plan than to restore to her the precious treasure of which she had been robbed saville resolved to cross the atlantic and though opposed to his scheme villiers offered to accompany him a voyage to america was but a trip to an active and unoccupied young man the society of his cousin would render the journey delightful he preferred it at all times to the commoner pleasures of life and besides on this occasion he was animated with the hope of being useful to him there was nothing effeminate in saville his energy of purpose and depth of thought forbade the idea still there was something that appeared to require kindness and support his delicate health of which he took no care demanded feminine attentions his careless reliance upon the uprightness of others and total selfoblivion often hurried him to the brink of dangers and though fearlessness and integrity were at hand to extricate him edward who knew his keen sensibility and repressed quickness of temper was not without fear that on so delicate a mission his ardent feelings might carry him beyond the mark and that in endeavouring to serve a woman whom he loved with enthusiastic adoration he might rouze the angry passions of her husband with such feelings the cousins crossed the atlantic and arrived at new york thence they proceeded to the west of america and passing and his daughter on the road without knowing it arrived at the illinois after their departure they were astonished to find that mr fitzhenry as he was named to them had broken up his establishment sold his farm and departed with the intention of returning to europe what this change might portend they could not guess whether it were the result of any communication with lady lodorewhether a reconciliation was under discussion or whether it were occasioned by caprice merely they could not tell at any rate it seemed to put an end to savilles mediation if lodore returned to england it was probable that cornelia would herself make an exertion to have her child restored to her whether he could be of any use was problematical but untimely interference was to be deprecated events must be left to take their own course saville was scarcely himself aware how glad he was to escape any kind of intercourse with the husband of cornelia this feeling however unacknowledged became paramount with him now that lodore was about to leave america he wished to linger in it he planned a long tour through the various states he studied their laws and customs he endeavoured to form a just estimate of the institutions of the new world and their influence on those governed by them edward had little sympathy in these pursuits he was eager to return to london and felt more inclined to take his gun and shoot in the forests than to mingle in the society of the various towns this difference of taste caused the cousins at various times to separate saville was at washington when villiers made a journey to the borders of canada to the falls of the niagara and returned by new york a portion of the united states which his cousin avoided visiting until lodore should have quitted it thus it was that a strange combination of circumstances brought villiers into contact with this unfortunate nobleman and made him a witness of and a participator in the closing scene of his disastrous and wasted life villiers did not sympathize in his cousins admiration of cornelia and was easily won to take a deep interest in the fortunes of her husband the very aspect of lodore commanded attention his voice entered the soul illstarred and struck by calamity he rose majestically from the ruin around him and seemed to defy fate the first thought that struck villiers was how could lady lodore desert such a man how pitifully degraded must she be who preferred the throng of fools to the society of so matchless a being the gallantry with which he rushed to his fate his exultation in the prospect of redeeming his honour his melting tenderness towards his daughter filled villiers with respect and compassion it was all over now lodore was dead his passions his wrongs his errors slept with him in the grave he had departed from the busy stage never to be forgottenyet to be seen no more lodore was dead and cornelia was free her husband had alluded to the gladness with which she would welcome liberty and villiers knew that there was another also whose heart would rejoice and open itself at once to the charming visitation of permitted love villiers sighed to think that saville would marry the beautiful widow but he did not doubt that this event would take place having seen that ethel was in kind hands and learnt the satisfactory arrangements made for her return to england he hastened to join his cousin and to convey the astounding intelligence savilles generous disposition prevented exultation and subdued joy still the prospect of future happiness became familiar to him shadowed only by the fear of not obtaining the affections of her he so fervently loved for strange to say saville was diffident to a fault he could not imagine any qualities in himself to attract a beautiful and fashionable woman his hopes were slight his thoughts timid the pain of eternal division was replaced by the gentler anxieties of love and he returned to england scarcely daring to expect that crown to his desires which seemed too high an honour too dear a blessing for earthly love to merit chapter iv ma la fede degli amanti come laraba fenice che vi sia ciaschun lo dice ma dove sia nessun lo sa metastasio meanwhile lady lodore had been enduring the worst miseries of illfated love the illness of lady santerre preceding her death had demanded all her time and she nursed her with exemplary patience and kindness during her midnight watchings and solitary days she had full time to feel how deep a wound her heart had received the figure and countenance of her absent friend haunted her in spite of every effort and when death hovered over the pillow of her mother she clung with mad desperation to the thought that there was still one when this parent should be gone to love her even though she never saw him more lady santerre died after the first burst of natural grief cornelia began to reflect that lord lodore might now imagine that every obstacle to their reconciliation was removed she had looked upon her husband as her enemy and injurer she had regarded him with indignation and fearbut now she hated him strong aversion had sprung up during the struggles of passion in her bosom she hated him as the eternal barrier between her and one who loved her with rare disinterestedness the human heart must desire happinessin spite of every effort at resignation it must aspire to the fulfilment of its wish lord lodore was the cause why she was cut off from it for ever he had foreseen that this feeling this combat this misery would be her doom in the deserted situation she chose for herself she had laughed his fears to scorn now she abhorred him the more for having divined her destiny while she banished the pleasant thoughts of love she indulged in the poisoned ones of hate and while she resisted each softer emotion as a crime she opened her heart to the bitterest resentment as a permitted solace nor was she aware that thus she redoubled all her woes it was under the influence of these feelings that she had written to mrs elizabeth fitzhenry that harsh decided letter which lodore received at new york the intelligence of his violent death came as an answer to her expressions of implacable resentment a pang of remorse stung her when she thought how she had emptied the vials of her wrath on a head which had so soon after been laid low for ever the double loss of husband and mother caused lady lodore to seclude herself not in absolute solitude but in the agreeable retreat of friendly society she was residing near brighton when saville returned from america and with a heart beating high with its own desires again beheld the mistress of his affections his delicate nature caused him to respect the weeds she wore even though they might be termed a mockery they were the type of her freedom and his hopes yet as the tokens of death they were to be respected he saw her more beautiful than ever more courted more waited on and he half despaired how could he the abstracted student the man of dreams the sensitive and timid invalid ensnare the fancy of one formed to adorn the circles of wealth and fashion thus it was that saville and cornelia were further off than ever when they imagined themselves most near neither of them could afterwards comprehend what divided them or why when each would have died for the others sake cobweb barriers should have proved inextricable and wherefore after weathering every more stormy peril they should perish beneath the influence of a summer breeze the pride of cornelias heart hid by the artificial courtesies of society was a sentiment resolved confirmed active and far beyond her own controul the smallest opposition appeared rebellion to her majesty of will while her own caprices her own desires were sacred decrees she was too haughty to admit of discussiontoo firmly intrenched in a sense of what was due to her not to start indignantly from remonstrance it is true all this was but a painted veil she was tremblingly alive to censure and wholly devoted to the object of her attachment but saville was unable to understand these contradictions his modesty led him to believe that he of all men was least calculated to excite love in a womans bosom he saw in cornelia a beautiful creation to admire and adore but he was slow to perceive the tenderness of soul which her disposition made her anxious to conceal and he was conscious of no qualities in himself that could entitle him to a place in her affections except that he loved her what merit had he and the interests of his affection he was willing to sacrifice at the altar of her wishes though his life should be the oblation necessary to insure their accomplishment this is not the description of true love on either side for to be perfect that sentiment ought to exist through the entireness of mutual sympathy and trust but not the less did their passionate attachment engross the minds of both all might have been well indeed had the lovers been left to themselves but friends and relations interfered to mar and to destroy the sisters of saville accused lady lodore of encouraging and intending to marry the marquess of c saville instantly resolved to be no obstacle in the way of her ambition cornelia was fired with treble indignation to perceive that he at once conceded the place to his rival one word or look of gentleness would have changed this but she resolved to vanquish by other arms and to force him to show some outward sign of jealousy and resentment saville had a natural dignity of mind founded on simplicity of heart and directness of purpose cornelia knew that he loved heron that his claim rested all that might be done to embellish and elevate her existence he would study to achieve but he could not enter into nor understand the puerile fancies of a spoiled beauty and while she was exerting all her powers and succeeded in fascinating a crowd of flatterers she saw saville apart abstracted from such vanities pursuing a silent course ready to approach her when her attention was disengaged but at no time making one among her ostentatious admirers there was no moment of her life in which cornelia did not fully appreciate her lovers value and her own good fortune in having inspired him with a serious and faithful attachment but she imagined that this must be known and acknowledged and that to ask any demonstration of gratitude was ungenerous and tyrannical an untaught girl could not have acted with more levity and wilfulness it was worse when she found that she was accused of encouraging a wealthier and more illustrious rival she disdained to exculpate herself from the charge of such low ambition but rather furnished new grounds for accusation and in the arrogance of conscious power smiled at the pettiness of the attempts made to destroy her influence proud in the belief that she could in an instant dispel the clouds she had conjured athwart her heaven she cared not how ominously the thunder muttered nor how dark and portentous lowered the threatening storm it came when she least expected it convinced of the fallacy of his confidence made miserable by her caprices agonized by the idea that he only lingered to add another trophy to his rivals triumph saville who was always impetuous and precipitate suddenly quitted england this was a severe blow at first but soon cornelia smiled at it he would returnhe must the sincerity of their mutual preference would overcome the petty obstacles of time and distance she never felt more sure of his devotion than now and she looked so happy and spoke so gaily that those who were more ready to discern indifference than love in her sentiments assured the absent saville that lady lodore rejoiced at his absence as having shaken off a burthen and got rid of an impediment which in spite of herself was a clog to her brilliant career the trusting love that painted her face in smiles was a traitor to itself and while she rose each day in the belief that the one was near at hand which would bring her lover before her dearer and more attached than ever she was in reality at work in defacing the whole web of life and substituting dark blank and sad disappointment for the images of light and joy with which her fancy painted it saville had been gone five months it was strange that he did not return and she began to ponder upon how she must unbend and what demonstration she must make to attract him again to her side the marquess of cwas dismissed and she visited the daughters of lord maristow to learn what latest news they had received of their brother do you know lady lodore said sophia saville that this is horatios weddingday it is too true we regret it because he weds a foreignerbut there is no help now he is married had sudden disease seized on the framework of her body and dissolved and scattered with poisonous influence and unutterable pains the atoms that composed it lady lodore would have been less agonized less terrified a thousand daggers were at once planted in her bosom saville was false married divided from her for ever she was stunnedscarcely understanding the meaning of the phrases addressed to her and unable to conceal her perturbation she replied at random and hastened to shorten her visit but no interval of doubt or hope was afforded the words she had heard were concise true to their meaning and allsufficing her heart died within her what had she done was she the cause she longed to learn all the circumstances that led to this hasty marriage and whether inconstancy or resentment had impelled him to the fatal act yet wherefore ask these things it was over the scene was closed it were little worth to analyze the poison she had imbibed since she was past all mortal cure her first resolve was to forgetnever never to think of the false one more but her thoughts never wandered from his image and she was eternally busied in retrospection and conjecture she was tempted at one time to disbelieve the intelligence and to consider it as a piece of malice on the part of miss saville then the common newspaper told her that at the ambassadors house at naples the honourable horatio saville had married clorinda daughter of the principe villamarina a neapolitan nobleman of the highest rank it was true thereforeand how was it true did he love his bride why else marryhad he forgotten his tenderness towards her alas it needed not forgetting it was a portion of past time fleeting as time itself it had been borne away with the hours as they passed and remembered as a thing which had been and was no more the reveries of love which for months had formed all her occupation were a blank or rather to be replaced by the agonies of despair her native haughtiness forsook her she was alone and desolatehedged in on all sides by insuperable barriers which shut out every glimpse of hope she was humbled in her own eyes through her want of success and heartily despised herself and all her caprices and vanities which had led her to this desart and then left her to pine she detested her position in society her mechanism of being and every circumstance selfinherent or adventitious that attended her existence all seemed to her sick fancy so constructed as to ensure disgrace desertion and contempt she lay down each night feeling as if she could never endure to raise her head on the morrow the unkindness and cruelty of her lovers conduct next presented themselves to her contemplation she had suffered much during the past years more than she had ever acknowledged even to herself she had suffered of regret and sorrow while she brooded over her solitary position and the privation of every object on whom she might bestow affection she had had nothing to hope saville had changed all this he had banished her cares and implanted hope in her heart now again his voice recalled the evils his hand crushed the newborn expectation of happiness he was the cause of every ill and the adversity which she had endured proudly and with fortitude while it seemed the work of fate grew more bitter and heavy when she felt that it arose through the agency of one whose kind affection and guardianship she had fondly believed would hereafter prove a blessing sent as from heaven itself be to the star of her life this fit passed off with struggles and relapses she wore down the first gush of sorrow and her disposition again assumed force over her she had found it difficult to persuade herself in spite of facts that she was not loved but it was easy once convinced of the infidelity of her lover to regard him with indifference she now regretted lost happinessbut saville was no longer regretted she wept over the vanished forms of delight lately so dear to her but she remembered that he who had called them into life had driven them away and she smiled in proud scorn of his fleeting and unworthy passion it was not to this love that she had made so tender and lavish a return she had loved his constancy his devotion his generous solicitude for her welfarefor the happiness which she bestowed on him and for the sympathy that so dearly united them these were fled and it were vain to consecrate herself to an empty and deformed mockery of so beautiful a truth then she tried to hate himto despise and to lessen him in her own estimation the attempt recoiled on herself the recollection of his worth stole across her memory to frustrate her vain endeavours his voice hauntedhis expressive eyes beamed on her it were better to forget indifference was her only refuge and to attain this she must wholly banish his image from her mind cornelia was possessed of wonderful firmness of purpose it had carried her on so long unharmed and now that danger was at hand it served effectually to defend her she rose calm and free above unmerited disaster she grew proud of the power she found that she possessed of conquering the most tyrannical of passions peace entered her soul and she hailed it as a blessing the clause in her husbands will which deprived her of the guardianship of her daughter had been forgotten during this crisis before under the supposition that she should marry she had deferred taking any step to claim her the idea of a struggle to be made unassisted unadvised and unshielded was terrible she had not courage to encounter all the annoyances that might ensue to get rid for a time of the necessity of action and reflection she went abroad she changed the sceneshe travelled from place to place she gave herself up in the solitude of continental journies to the whole force of contending passions now overcome by despair and again repressing regret asserting to herself the lofty pride of her nature by degrees she recovered a healthier tone of minda distant and faint yet genuine sense of duty dawned upon her and she began to think on what her future existence was to depend and how she could best secure some portion of happiness her heart once again warmed towards the image of her daughterand she felt that in watching the development of her mind and leading her to love and depend on her a new interest and real pleasure might spring up in life she reproached herself for having so long by silence and passive submission given scope to the belief that she was willing to be a party against herself in the injustice of lodore and she returned to england with the intention of instantly enforcing her rights over her child and taking to her bosom and to her fondest care the little being whose affection and gratitude was to paint her future life with smiles she called to mind lady santerres worldly maxims and her own experience she knew that the first step to success is the appearance of prosperity and power to command the good wishes and aid of her friends she must appear independent of them she was earnest therefore to hide the wounds her heart had received and the real loathing with which she regarded all things she arrayed herself in smiles and banished far below into the invisible recesses of her bosom the contempt and disgust with which she viewed the scene around her she returned to england she appeared at the height of the season in the midst of society as beautiful as charming as happy in look and manner as in her days of lighthearted enjoyment she paused yet a moment longer to reflect on what step she had better take on first enforcing her claim but her mind was full of its intention and set upon the fulfilment at this time but a few days after her arrival in london she went to the opera she heard the name of fitzhenry called in the lobbyshe saw and recognized mrs elizabeththe venerable sister bessy so little altered that time might be said to have touched but not trenched her homely kindly face with her in attendance on her she beheld horatio savilles favourite cousinthe gay and fashionable edward villiers it was strange her curiosity was strongly excited it had not long to languish the next morning villiers called and was readily admitted chapter v and as good lost is seld or never found shakspeare lady lodore and villiers met for the first time since horatio savilles marriage neither were exactly aware of what the other knew or thought cornelia was ignorant how far her attachment to his cousin was known to him whether he shared the general belief in her worldly coquetry or what part he might have had in occasioning their unhappy separation she could not indeed see him without emotion he had been lodores second and received the last dying breath of him who had in her brightest youth selected her from the world to share his fortunes those days were long past yet as she grew older disappointed and devoid of pleasurable interest in the present she often turned her thoughts backward and wondered at the part she had acted similar feelings were in edwards mind he was prejudiced against her in every way he despised her worldly calculations as reported to him and rejoiced in their failure he believed these reports and despised her yet he could not see her without being moved at once with admiration and pity the moonlit hill and tragic scene in which he had played his part came vividly before his eyes he had been struck by the nobleness of lodores appearancethe sensibility that sat on his countenancehis gentle yet dignified manners ethels idolatry of her father had confirmed the favourable prepossession he could not help compassionating cornelia for the loss of her husband forgetting for the moment their separation then again recurred to him the eloquent appeals of saville his eulogiums his fervent reverential affection she had lost him also could she hold up her head after such miserable events the evidence of the senses and the ideas of our own minds are more forcibly present than any notion we can form of the feelings of others in spite therefore of his belief in her heartlessness villiers had pictured cornelia attired in dismal weeds the victim of grief he saw her beaming in beauty at the operahe now beheld her radiant in sweet smiles in her own home nothing touchednothing harmed her and the glossy surface he doubted not imaged well the insensible unimpressive soul within lady lodore would have despised herself for ever had she betrayed the tremor that shook her frame when villiers entered her pride of sex was in arms to enable her to convince him that no regret no pining shadowed her days the reality was abhorrent and should never be confessed thus then they meteach with a whole epic of woe and death alive in their memory but both wearing the outward appearance of frivolity and thoughtlessness he saw her as lovely as ever and as kind her softest and sweetest welcome was extended to him it was this frequent show of frank cordiality which gained her golden opinions from the many her haughtiness was all of the minda desire to please and constant association with others had smoothed the surface and painted it in the colours most agreeable to every eye they addressed each other as if they had met but the day before at first a few questions and answers passedas to where she had been on the continent how she liked baden cand then lady lodore saidalthough i have not seen her for several years i instantly recognized a relative of mine with you yesterday evening does miss fitzhenry make any stay in town the idea of ethel was uppermost in villierss mind and struck by the manner in which the woman of fashion spoke of her daughter he replied during the season i believe i scarcely know miss fitzhenry came up for her health that consideration i suppose will regulate her movements she looked very well last nightperhaps she intends to remain till she gets ill and country air is ordered observed lady lodore that were nothing new at least replied villiers trying to hide the disgust he felt at her mode of speaking the young and blooming too often protract their first season till the roses are exchanged for lilies if miss fitzhenrys roses still bloom said the lady they must be perennial ones they have surely grown more fit for a herbal than a vase villiers now perceived his mistake and replied you are speaking of mrs elizabeth fitzhenry as the good lady styles herselfi spoke ofher niece has ethel been ill lady lodores hurried question and the use of the christian name as most familiar to her thoughts brought home to villierss heart the feeling of their near relationship there was something more than grating it was deeply painful to speak to a mother of a child who had been torn from herwho did not knowwho had even been taught to hate her he wished himself a hundred miles off but there was no help he must reply you might have seen last night that she is perfectly recovered lady lodores imagination refused to image her child in the tall elegant fullformed girl she had seen and she said was ethel with you i did not see herprobably she went home before the opera was over and i only perceived your party in the crushroomyou appear already intimate it is impossible to see miss fitzhenry and not to wish to be intimate replied villiers with his usual frankness i at least cannot help being deeply interested in every thing that relates to her you are very good to take concern in my little girl i should have imagined that you were too young yourself to like children children repeated villiers much amazed miss fitzhenryshe is not a child lady lodore scarcely heard him a sudden pang had shot across her heart to think how strangershow every one might draw near her daughter and be interested for her while she could not without making herself the tale of the town the subject through the medium of newspapers for every gossips teatable in englandwhere her sentiments would be scanned and her conduct criticizedand this through the revengeful feelings of her husband prolonged beyond the grave tears had been gathering in her eyes during the last moments she turned her head to hide them and a quick shower fell on her silken dress quite ashamed of this selfbetrayal she exerted herself to overcome her emotion villiers felt awkwardly situated his first impulse had been to rise to take her hand to soothe her but before he could do more than the first of these acts as lady lodore fancied for the purpose of taking his leave she said it is foolish to feel as i do yet perhaps more foolish to attempt to conceal from one as well acquainted as you are with every thing that i do feel pained at the unnatural separation between me and ethel especially when i think of the publicity i must incur by asserting a mothers claims i am ashamed of intruding this subject on you but she is no longer the baby cherub i could cradle in my arms and you have seen her lately and can tell me whether she has been well brought upwhether she seems tractableif she promises to be pretty did you not think her lovely cried villiers with animation you saw her last night taking my arm ethel cried the lady could that be ethel true she is now sixteeni had indeed forgother cheeks became suffused with a deep blush as she remembered all the solicisms she had been committing she is sixteen she continued and a womanwhile i fancied a little girl in a white frock and blue sash this alters every thing we have been indeed divided and must now remain so for evermore i will not injure her at her age by making her the public talkbesides many many other considerations would render me fearful of making myself responsible for her future destiny at least said villiers she ought to wait on you that were beyond lord lodores bond said the lady and why should she wait on me were she impelled by affection it were well but this is talking very simplywe could only be acquaintance and i would rather be nothing i confess that i repined bitterly that i was not permitted to have my little girl as i termed her for my plaything and companionbut my ideas are now changed a dear little tractable child would have been delightfulbut she is a woman with a will of her ownprejudiced against mebrought up in that vulgar america with all kinds of strange notions and ways lord lodore was quite right i believehe fashioned her for himself andbessy the worst thing that can happen to a girl is to have her prejudices and principles unhinged no new ones can flourish like those that have grown with her growth and mine i fear would differ greatly from those in which she has been educated a few years hence she may feel the want of a friend who understands the world and who could guide her prudently through its intricacies then she shall find that friend in me now i feel convinced that i should do more harm than good a loud knock at the street door interrupted the conversation one thing only i cannot endure said the lady hastily to present a domestic tragedy or farce to the opera housewe must not meet in public i shall shut up my house and return to paris mere written words express little lady lodores expressions were nothing but her countenance denoted a change of feeling a violence of emotion of which villiers hardly believed her capable but before he could reply the servant threw open the door and her brow immediately clearing serenity descended on her face with her blandest smile she extended her hand to her new visitor villiers was too much discomposed to imitate her so with a silent salutation he departed and cantered round the park to collect his thoughts before he called in seymourstreet the ladies there were not less agitated than lady lodore and displayed their feelings with the artlessness of recluses the first words that mrs elizabeth had addressed to her niece at the breakfast table were an awkwardly expressed intimation that she meant instantly to return to longfield ethel looked up with a face of alarm her aunt continued i do not want to speak ill of lady lodore my deargod forgive herthat is all i can say what your dear father thought of her his last will testifies i suppose you do not mean to disobey him his slightest word was ever a law with me said ethel and now that he is gone i would observe his injunctions more religiously than ever but then my dear there is but one thing to be done lady lodore will assuredly force herself upon us meet us at every turn oblige you to pay her your duty nor could you avoid it no my dear ethel there is but one escapeyour health thank god is restored and longfield is now in all its beauty we will return tomorrow ethel did not reply she looked very disconsolateshe did not know what to say at last mr villiers will think it so odd dropped from her lips mr villiers is nothing to us my dear said aunt bessynot the most distant relation he is an agreeable goodhearted young gentlemanbut there are so many in the world ethel left her breakfast untasted and went out of the room she felt that she could no longer restrain her tears my father she exclaimed while a passionate burst of weeping choked her utterance my only friend why why did you leave me why most cruel desert your poor orphan child gracious god to what am i reserved i must not see my mothera name so dear so sweet is for me a curse and a misery o my father why did you desert me her calm reflections were not less bitter she did not suffer her thoughts to wander to villiers or rather the loss of her father was still so much the first grief of her heart that on any new sorrow it was to this she recurred with agony the form of her youthful mother also flitted before her and she asked herself can she be so wicked lord lodore had never uttered her name it was not until his death had put the fatal seal on all things that she heard a garbled exaggerated statement from her aunt over whose benevolent features a kind of sacred horror mantled whenever she was mentioned the will of lord lodore and the stern injunction it contained that the mother and daughter should never meet satisfied ethel of the truth of all that her aunt said so that educated to obedience and deep reverence for the only parent she had ever known she recoiled with terror from transgressing his commands and holding communication with the cause of all his ills still it was hard and very very sad nor did she cease from lamenting her fate till villierss horse was heard in the street and his knock at the door then she tried to compose herself he will surely come to us at longfield she thought longfield will be so very stupid after london after london poor ethel she had lived in london as in a desert but lately it had appeared to her a city of bliss and all places else the abode of gloom and melancholy villiers was shocked at the appearance of sorrow which shadowed her face and for a moment thought that the rencounter with her mother was the sole occasion of the tears whose traces he plainly discerned his address was full of sympathetic kindnessbut when she said we return tomorrow to essexwill you come to see us at longfieldhis soothing tones were exchanged for those of surprise and vexation longfieldimpossible why my aunt has determined on it she thinks me recovered and so indeed i am but are you to be entombed at longfield except when dying if so do pray be ill again directly but this must not be dear mrs fitzhenry he continued as she came in i will not hear of your going to longfield look the very idea has already thrown miss fitzhenry into a consumptionyou will kill her indeed you must not think of it we shall all die if we stay in town said mrs elizabeth with perplexity at her nieces evident suffering then why stay in town asked villiers you just now said that we ought not to return to longfield answered the lady and i am sure if ethel is to look so ill and wretched i dont know what i am to do but there are many places in the world besides either london or longfield you were charmed with richmond the other day there are plenty of houses to be had there nothing can be prettier or more quiet well i dont know said aunt bessy i never thought of that to be sure and i have business which makes our going to longfield very inconvenient i expect mr humphries our solicitor next week and i have not seen him yet you really think mr villiers that we could get a house to suit us at richmond let us drive there today said villiers we can dine at the star and garter you can go in the britzskai on horseback the days are long we can see every thing and take your house at once this plan sounded very romantic and wild to the sober spinster but ethels face lighted up with vivid pleasure said more in its favour than what the good lady called prudence could allege against it silly people you women are said villiers you can do nothing by yourselves and are always running against posts unless guided by others this will make every thing easydispel every difficulty his thoughts recurred to lady lodore and her intended journey to paris as he said this and again they flew to a charming little villa on the rivers side whither he could ride every day and find ethel among her flowers alone and happy the excursion of this morning was prosperous the day was warm yet fresh and as they quitted town and got surrounded by fields and hedges and trees nature reassumed her rights and awakened transport in ethels heart the boyish spirits of villiers communicated themselves to her and mrs elizabeth smiled also with the most exquisite complacency a few inquiries conducted them to a pretty rural box surrounded by a small but well laidout shrubbery and this they engaged the dinner at the inn the twilight walk in its gardenthe fair prospect of the rich and cultivated country with its silvery meandering river at their feet and the aspect of the cloudless heavens where one or two stars silently struggled into sight amidst the pathless wastes of sky were objects most beautiful to look on and prodigal of the sweetest emotions the wide dark lake the endless forests and distant mountains of the illinois were not here but night bestowed that appearance of solitude which habit rendered dear to ethel and imagination could transform wooded parks and welltrimmed meadows into bowery seclusions sacred from the foot of man and fresh fields untouched by his hand a few days found ethel and her aunt installed at their little villa and delighted to be away from london education made loneliness congenial to both they might seek transient amusements in towns or visit them for business but happiness the agreeable tenor of unvaried daily life was to be found in the quiet of the country onlyand richmond was the country to them for cut off from all habits of intercourse with their species they had but to find trees and meadows near them at once to feel transported from the thick of human life into the most noiseless solitude ethel was very happy she rose in the morning with a glad and grateful heart and gazed from her chamber window watching the early sunbeams as they crept over the various parts of the landscape visiting with light and warmth each open field or embowered nook her bosom overflowed with the kindest feelings and her charmed senses answered the tremulous beating of her pure heart bidding it enjoy how beautiful did earth appear to her there was a delight and a sympathy in the very action of the shadows as they pranked the sunshiny ground with their dark and fluctuating forms the leafy boughs of the tall trees waved gracefully and each wind of heaven wafted a thousand sweets a magic spell of beauty and bliss held in one bright chain the whole harmonious universe and the soul of the enchantment was lovesimple girlish unacknowledged lovethe love of the young feminine heart which feels itself placed all bleakly and dangerously in a world scarce formed to be its home and which plumes itself with love to fly to the covert and natural shelter of anothers protecting care ethel did not knowdid not fancythat she was in love nor did any of the throes of passion disturb the serenity of her mind she only felt that she was very very happy and that villiers was the kindest of human beings she did not give herself up to idleness and reverie the first law of her education had been to be constantly employed her studies were various they perhaps did not sufficiently tend to invigorate her understanding but they sufficed to prevent every incursion of listlessness meanwhile during each the thought of villiers strayed through her mind like a heavenly visitant to gild all things with sunny delight some time during the day he was nearly sure to come or at least she was certain of seeing him on the morrow and when he came their boatings and their rides were prolonged while each moment added to the strength of the ties that bound her to him she relied on his friendship and his society was as necessary to her life as the air she breathed she so implicitly trusted to his truth that she was unaware that she trusted at allnever making a doubt about it that chance or time should injure or break off the tie was a possibility that never suggested itself to her mind as the silver thames traversed in silence and beauty the landscape at her feet so did love flow through her soul in one even and unruffled streamthe great law and emperor of her thoughts yet more felt from its influence than from any direct exertion of its power it was the result and the type of her sensibility of her constancy of the gentle yet lively sympathy it was her nature to bestow with guileless confidence those around her might be ignorant that her soul was imbued with it because being a part of her soul there was small outward demonstration none indeed near her thought any thing about it aunt bessy was a tyro in such matters and villiershe had resolved when he perceived love on her side to retreat for ever till then he might enjoy the dear delight that her society afforded him chapter vi alas he knows the laws of spain appoint me for his heir that all must come to me if i outlive him which sure i must do by the course of nature beaumont and fletcher edward villiers was the only child of a man of considerable fortune who had early in life become a widower from the period of this event colonel villiers for his youth had been passed in the army where he obtained promotion had led the careless life of a single man his sons home was at maristow castle when not at school and the father seldom remembered him except as an incumbrance for his estate was strictly entailed so that he could only consider himself possessed of a life interest in a property which would devolve without restriction on his more fortunate son edward was brought up in all the magnificence of his uncles lordly abode luxury and profusion were the elements of the air he breathed to be without any desired object that could be purchased appeared baseness and lowest penury he also was considered the favoured one of fortune in the family circle the elder brother among the savilles rose above but the younger fell infinitely below the undoubted heir of eight thousand a year and one of the most delightful seats in england he was brought up to look upon himself as a rich man and to act as such and meanwhile until his fathers death he had nothing to depend on except any allowance he might make him colonel villiers was a man of fashion addicted to all the extravagances and even vices of the times he set no bounds to his expenses gambling consumed his nights and his days were spent at horseraces or any other occupation that at once excited and impoverished him his income was as a drop of water in the mighty stream of his expenditure involvement followed involvement until he had not a shilling that he could properly call his own poor edward heard of these things but did not mark them he indulged in no blameworthy pursuits nor spent more than beseemed a man in his rank of life the idea of debt was familiar to him every oneeven lord maristowwas in debt far beyond his power of immediate payment he followed the universal example and suffered no inconvenience while his wants were obligingly supplied by the fashionable tradesmen he regarded the period of his coming of age as a time when he should become disembarrassed and enter upon life with ample means and still more brilliant prospects the day arrived it was celebrated with splendour at maristow castle colonel villiers was abroad but lord maristow wrote to him to remind him of this event which otherwise he might have forgotten a kind letter of congratulation was in consequence received from him by edward to which was appended a postscript saying that on his return at the end of a few weeks he would consult concerning some arrangements he wished to make with regard to his future income his return was deferred and edward began to experience some of the annoyances of debt still no real pain was associated with his feelings though he looked forward with eagerness to the hour of liberation colonel villiers came at last he spoke largely of his intended generosity which was shown meanwhile by his persuading edward to join in a mortgage for the sake of raising an immediate sum edward scarcely knew what he was about he was delighted to be of service to his father and without thought or idea of having made a sacrifice agreed to all that was asked of him he was promised an allowance of six hundred a year the few years that had passed since then were full of painful experience and bitter initiation his light and airy spirit was slow to conceive ill or to resent wrong when his annuity remained unpaid he listened to his fathers excuses with implicit credence and deplored his poverty one day he received a note from him written as usual in haste and confusion but breathing anxiety and regret on his account and promising to pay over to him the first money he could obtain on the evening of that day edward was led by a friend into the gambling room of a celebrated club the first man on whom his eyes fell was his father who was risking and losing rouleaus and notes in abundance at one moment while making over a large sum he suddenly perceived his son he grew pale and then a deep blush spread itself over his countenance edward withdrew his young heart was pierced to the core the consciousness of a fathers falsehood and guilt acted on him as the sudden intelligence of some fatal disaster would have done he breathed thickthe objects swam round himhe hurried into the streetshe traversed them one after the other it was not this scene alonethis single act the veil was withdrawn from a whole series of others similar and he became aware that his parent had stepped beyond the line of mere extravagance that he had lost honourable feeling that lies were common in his mouth and every othereven his only childwas sacrificed to his own selfish and bad passions edward never again asked his father for money the immediate result of the meeting in the gamblingroom had been his receiving a portion of what was due to him but his annuity was always in arrear and paid so irregularly that it became worse than nothing in his eyes especially as the little that he received was immediately paid over to creditors and to defray the interest of borrowed money he never applied again to colonel villiers he would have considered himself guilty of a crime had he forced his father to forge fresh subterfuges and to lie to his own son brought up in the midst of the wealthy he had early imbibed a horror of pecuniary obligation and this fastidiousness grew more sensitive and peremptory with each added day of his life yet with all this he had not learnt to set a right value upon money and he squandered whatever he obtained with thoughtless profusion he had no friend to whose counsel he could recur lord maristow railed against colonel villiers and when he heard of edwards difficulties offered to remonstrate and force his brotherinlaw to extricate him but here ended his assistance which was earnestly rejected horatios means were exceedingly limited but on a word from his cousin he eagerly besought him to have recourse to his purse to avoid his kindness and his uncles interference edward became reserved he had recourse to jews and moneylenders and appeared at ease while he was involving himself in countless and still increasing embarrassments edward was naturally extravagant or to speak more correctly his education and position implanted and fostered habits of expense and prodigality while his careless disposition was unapt to calculate consequences his very attempts at economy frequently cost him more than his most expensive whims he was not like his father a gambler nor did he enter into any very reprehensible pleasures but he had little to spend and was thoughtless and confiding and being always in arrear was forced in a certain way to continue a system which perpetually led him further into the maze and rendered his return impossible he had no hope of becoming independent except through his fathers death colonel villiers meanwhile had no idea of dying he was not fifty years of age and considering his own a better life than his sons involuntarily speculated on what he should do if he should chance to survive him he was a handsome and a fashionable man he often meditated a second marriage if he could render it advantageous and repined at his inability to make settlements which was an insuperable impediment to his project edwards death would overcome this difficulty such were the speculations of father and son and the portion of filial and paternal affection which their relative position but too usually inspires until he was twentyone edward had never spent a thought upon his scanty resources three years had past since thenthree brief years which had a little taught him of what homely stuff the world is made yet care and even reflection had not yet disturbed his repose days months sped on and nothing reminded him of his relative wealth or poverty in a way to annoy him till he knew ethel he had been interested for her in americahe had seen her young and lovely drowned in griefsorrowing with the hearts first prodigal sorrow for her adored father he had left her and thought of her no moreexcept as a passing reflection that in the natural course of things she was now to become the pupil of lady lodore and consequently that her unsophisticated feelings and affectionate heart would speedily be tarnished and hardened under her influence he anticipated meeting her hereafter in ballrooms and assemblies changed into a flirting giddy yet worldlyminded girl intent upon a good establishment and a fashionable partner he encountered her under the sober and primitive guardianship of mrs fitzhenry unchanged and unharmed the same radiant innocence beamed from her face her sweet voice was still true and heartreaching in its tones her manner mirrored the purity and lustre of a mind incapable of guile and adorned with every generous and gentle sentiment he drew near her with respect and admiration and soon no other object showed fair in his eyes except ethel she was the star of the world and he felt happy only when the light of her presence shone upon him her voice and smile visited his dreams and spoke peace and delight to his heart she was to him as a jewel yet sweeter and lovelier than any gem shut up in a casket of which he alone possessed the keyas a pearl of whose existence an indian diver is aware beneath the waves of ocean deep buried from every other eye there was all in ethel that could excite and keep alive imaginative and tender love in characterizing a race of women a delightful writer has described her individually she was in her nature a superior being her majestic forehead her dark thoughtful eye assured you that she had communed with herself she could bear to be left in solitudeyet what a look was hers if animated by mirth or love she was poetical if not a poet and her imagination was high and chivalrous the elevated tone of feeling fostered by her father her worship of his virtues and the loneliness of her life in the illinois combined to render her dissimilar to any girl villiers had ever before known or admired when unobserved he watched her countenance and marked the varying tracery of high thoughts and deep emotions pass over it her dark eye looked out from itself on vacancy but read there a meaning only to be discerned by vivid imagination and then when that eye so full of soul turned on him and affection and pleasure at once animated and softened its glanceswhen her sweet lips so delicate in their shape so balmy and soft in their repose were wreathed into a smilehe felt that his whole being was penetrated with enthusiastic admiration and that his nature had bent to a law from which it could never again be liberated that she should mingle with the worldenter into its contaminating pursuitsbe talked of in it with that spirit of depreciation and impertinence which is its essence was odious to him and he was overjoyed to have her safe at richmondsecure from lady lodoreshut up apart from all things except natureher unsophisticated aunt and his own admirationa bird of beauty brooding in its own fair nest unendangered by the fowler these were his feelings but by degrees other reflections forced themselves on him and love which when it has knocked and been admitted will be a tyrant obliged him to entertain regrets and fears which agonized him his hourly aspiration was to make her his own would that dear heart open to receive into its recesses his image and thenceforward dedicate itself to him only might he become her lover guardian husbandand they tread together the jungle of life aiding each other to thread its mazes and to ward off every danger that might impend over them bitter worldly considerations came to mar the dainty colours of this fair picture he could not conceal from himself the poverty that must attend him during his fathers life lord lodores singular will reduced ethels property to almost nothing should he then ally her to his scanty means and broken fortune his resolution was made he would not deny himself the present pleasure of seeing her to spare any future pain in which he should be the only sufferer but on the first token of exclusive regard on her side he would withdraw for ever footnote coleridges six months in the west indies chapter vii the world is too much with us wordsworth mrs elizabeth fitzhenrys morning task was to read the newspapersthe only intercourse she held with the world and all her knowledge of it was derived from these daily sheets ethel never looked at themher thoughts held no communion with the vulgar routine of life and she was too much occupied by her studies and reveries to spend any time upon topics so uninteresting as the state of the nation or the scandal of the day one morning while she was painting her aunt observed in her usual tone of voice scarce lifting her eyes from the paper mr villiers did not tell us thishe is going to be married i wonder who to married repeated ethel yes my dear here it is we hear from good authority that mr villiers of chiverton park is about to lead to the hymeneal altar a young and lovely bride the only child of a gentleman said to be the richest commoner in englandwho can it be ethel did not reply and the elder lady went on to other parts of the newspaper the poor girl on whom she had dealt all unaware this chance mortal blow put down her brush and hurried into the shrubbery to conceal her agitation why did she feel these sharp pangs why did a bitter deluge of anguish overflow and seem to choke her breathing and torture her heartshe could scarcely tell marriedthen i shall never see him more and a passion of tears not refreshing but forced out by agony and causing her to feel as if her heart was bursting shook her delicate frame at that moment the wellknown sound the galloping of villierss horse up the lane met her ear does he come here to tell us at last of his weddingday the horse came onit stoppedthe bell was rung little acts these which she had watched for and listened to for two months with such placid and innocent delight now they seemed the notes of preparation for a scene of despair she wished to retreat to her own room to compose herself but it was too late he was already in that through which she must passshe heard his voice speaking to her aunt now is he telling her she thought no idea of reproach or of accusation of unkindness in him dawned on her heart no word of love had passed between themeven yet she was unaware that she loved herself it was the instinctive result of this despot sentiment which exerted its sway over her without her being conscious of the cause of her sufferings the first words of mrs fitzhenry had been to speak of the paragraph in the newspaper and to show it her visitor villiers read it and considered it curiously he saw at once that however blunderingly worded his father was its hero and he wondered what foundation there might be for the rumour singular enough he said carelessly as he put the paper down you have kept your secret well said mrs elizabeth my secret i did not even know that i had one i at least never heard that you were going to be married imarried where is miss fitzhenry the concatenation of ideas presented by these words fell unremarked on the blunt senses of the good lady and she replied in the shrubbery i believe or upstairs she left me but a moment ago villiers hastened to the garden and soon discerned the tearful girl who was bending down to pluck and arrange some flowers so to hide her disturbed countenance could we at the moment of trial summon our reason and our foregone resolvescould we put the impression of the present moment at a distance which on the contrary presses on us with a power as omnipotent over our soul as a pointed sword piercing the flesh over our life we might become all that we are notangels or demigods or any other being that is not human as it is the current of the blood and the texture of the brain are the machinery by which the soul acts and their mechanism is by no means tractable or easily worked once put in motion we can seldom controul their operations but our serener feelings are whirled into the vortex they create thus edward villiers had a thousand times in his reveries thought over the possibility of a scene occurring such as the one he was called upon to act in nowand had planned a line of conduct but like mist before the wind this gossamer of the mind was swept away by an immediate appeal to his heart through his outward sensations there stood before him in all her loveliness the creature whose image had lived with him by day and by night for several long months and the gaze of her soft tearful eyes and the faultering tone of her voice were the laws to which his sense of prudence of right was immediately subjected a few confused sentences interchanged revealed to him that she participated in her aunts mistake and her simple question why did you conceal this from me spoke the guilelessness of her thoughts while the anguish which her countenance expressed betrayed that the concealment was not the only source of her grief this young pair were ignorant how dear they were to each other ethels affection was that generous giving away of a young heart which is unaware of the value of the gift it makesshe had asked for and thought of no return though her feeling was the result of a reciprocal one on his side it was the instinctive love of the dawn of womanhood subdued and refined by her gentle nature and imaginative mind edward was more alive to the nature of his own sentimentsbut his knowledge stood him in no stead to fortify him against the power of ethels tears in a moment they understood each otherone second sufficed to cause the before impervious veil to fall at their feet they had stept beyond this commonplace world and stood beside each other in the new and mysterious region of which love is emperor dearest ethel said villiers i have much to tell you do arrange that we should ride together i have very much to tell you you shall know every thing and judge for us both though you should condemn me she looked up in his face with innocent surprise but no words could destroy the sunshine that brightened her soul to know that she was loved sufficed then to fill her being to overflowing with happiness so that there was no room for a second emotion the lovers rode out together and thus secured the ttette which villiers especially yearned for although she was countrybred mrs fitzhenry was too timid to mount on horseback yet she could not feel fear for her niece who under her fathers guidance sat her steed with an ease and perfect command of the animal which long habit rendered second nature to her as they rode on considerably in advance of the groom they were at first silentthe deep sweet silence which is so eloquent of emotiontill with an effort slackening his pace and bringing his horse nearer villiers began he spoke of debt of difficulties of povertyof his unconquerable aversion to the making any demands on his fatherfruitless demands for he knew how involved colonel villiers was and how incapable even of paying the allowance he nominally made his son he declared his reluctance to drag ethel into the sea of cares and discomforts that he felt must surround his youth he besought her forgiveness for having loved herfor having linked her heart to his he could not willingly resign her while he believed that he all unworthy was of any worth in her eyes but would she not discard him for ever now that she knew that he was a beggar and that all to which he could aspire was an engagement to be fulfilled at some far distant daya day that might never comewhen fortune should smile on him ethel listened with exquisite complacency every word villiers spoke was fraught with tenderness his eye beamed adoration and sincerest love consciousness chained her tongue and her faltering voice refused to frame any echo to the busy instigations of her virgin heart yet it seemed to her as if she must speak as if she were called upon to avow how light and trivial were all worldly considerations in her eyes with bashful confusion she at length said you cannot think that i care for fortunei was happy in the illinois her simplicity of feeling was at this moment infectious it appeared the excess of selfishness to think of any thing but love in a desartwhile she had no desire beyond indeed in england or america she lived in a desart as far as society was concerned and felt not one of those tenacious though cobwebseeming ties that held sway over villiers all his explanations therefore went for nothing they only felt that this discourse concerning him had drawn them nearer to each other and had laid the first stone of an edifice of friendship henceforth to be raised beside the already established one of love a sudden shower forced them also to return home with speed and so interrupted any further discussion in the evening villiers left them and ethel sought as speedily as she might the solitude of her own chamber she had no idea of hiding any circumstance from mrs fitzhenry but confidence is more than any other thing a matter of interchange and cannot be bestowed unless the giver is certain of its being received they had too little sympathy of taste or idea and were too little in the habit of communicating their inmost thoughts to make ethel recur to her aunt besides young love is ever cradled in mysteryto reveal it to the vulgar eye appears at once to deprive it of its celestial loveliness and to marry it to the clodlike earth but alonealoneshe could think over the past dayrecall its minutest incident and as she imaged to herself the speaking fondness of her lovers eyes her own closed and a thrilling sense of delight swept through her frame what a different world was this to what it had been the day before the whole creation was invested by a purer atmosphere balmy as paradise which no disquieting thought could penetrate she called upon her fathers spirit to approve her attachment and when she reflected that edwards hand had supported his dying headthat to edward villierss care his latest words had intrusted hershe felt as if she were a legacy bequeathed to him and that she fulfilled lodores last behests in giving herself to him so sweetly and fondly did her gentle heart strive to make a duty of her wishes and the idea of her fathers approbation set the seal of perfect satisfaction on her dream of bliss it was somewhat otherwise with villiers things went on as before and he came nearly every day to richmond but while ethel rested satisfied with seeing him and receiving slight cherished tokens of his unabated regardas his voice assumed a more familiar tone and his attentions became more affectionatewhile these were enough for ethel he thought of the future and saw it each day dressed in gloomier colours in ethels presence indeed he forgot all but her he loved her fervently and beheld in her all that he most admired in woman her clearness of spirit her singleness of heart her unsuspicious and ingenuous disposition were irresistibly fascinatingand why not spend their lives thus in solitudehistheir mutual fortune might afford thiswhy not for ever thusthe happythe belovedhis life might pass like a dream of joy and that paradise might be realized on earth the impossibility of which philosophers have demonstrated and worldlings scoffed at thus he thought while in the same room with ethelwhile on his evening ride back to town her form glided before him and her voice sounded in his ears it seemed that where ethel was no one earthly bliss could be wanting where she was not a void must exist dark and dreary as a starless night but his progress onward took him out of the magic circle her presence drew a portion of his elevated feeling deserted him at each step it fell off like the bark pealing from a tree in successive coats till he was left with scarce a vestige of its brightnessas the hue and the scent deserts the flower when deprived of lightso when away from ethel her lover lost half the excellence which her presence bestowed edward villiers was eminently sociable in his disposition he had been brought up in the thick of life and knew not how to live apart from it his frank and cordial heart danced within his bosom when he was among those who sympathized with and liked him he was much courted in society and had many favourites and how ethel would like these and be liked by them was a question he perpetually asked himself he knew the worldliness of manytheir defective moral feeling and their narrow views but he believed that they were attached to him and no man was ever less a misanthrope than he he wished if married to ethel to see her a favourite in his own circle but he revolted from the idea of presenting her except under favourable auspices surrounded by the decorations of rank and wealth to give up the world the english world formed no portion of his picture of bliss and to occupy a subordinate degraded permitted place in it was to one initiated in its supercilious and insolent assumptions not to be endured the picture had also a darker side which was too often turned towards him if he felt hesitation when he regarded its brighter aspect as soon as this was dimmed the whole current of his feelings turned the other way and he called himself villain for dreaming of allying ethel not to poverty alone but to its worst consequences and disgrace in the shape of debt i am a beggar he thought one of many wants and unable to provide for anythe most povertystricken of beggars who has pledged away even his liberty were it claimed of him i look forward to the course of years with disgust i cannot calculate the ills that may occur or with how tremendous a weight the impending ruin may fall i can bear it alone but did i see her humiliated whom i would gladly place on a throneby heavens i could not endure life on such terms and a pistol or some other dreadful means would put an end to an existence become intolerable as these thoughts fermented within him he longed to pour them out before ethel to unload his mind of its care to express the sincere affection that led him to her side and yet urged him to exile himself for ever he rode over each day to richmond intent on such a design but as he proceeded the fogs and clouds that thickened round his soul grew lighter at first his pace was regulated as he drew nearer he pressed his horses flank with impatient heel and bounded forward each turn in the road was a step nearer the sunshine now the bridge the open field the winding lane were passed the walls of her abode and its embowered windows presented themselvesthey met and the glad look that welcomed him drove far away every thought of banishment and dispelled at once every remnant of doubt and despondency this state of things might have gone on much longeralready had it been protracted for two monthsbut for an accidental conversation between lady lodore and villiers since the morning after the opera they had scarcely seen each other edwards heart was too much occupied to permit him to join in the throng of a ballroom and they had no chance of meeting except in general society one evening at the opera the lady who accompanied lady lodore asked a gentleman who had just come into their box what had become of edward villiershe was never to be seen he is going to be married was the reply he is in constant attendance on the fair lady at richmond i had not heard of this observed lady lodore who for horatios sake felt an interest for his favourite cousin it is very little known the fiance lives out of the world and no one can tell any thing about her i did hear her name young craycroft has seen them riding together perpetually in richmond park and on wimbledon common he told me miss fitzroynomiss fitzsomething it isfitzgeorgenofitzhenryyes miss fitzhenry is the name cornelia reddened and asked no more questions she controlled her agitation and at first indeed she was scarcely aware how much she felt but while the whole house was listening to a favourite air and her thoughts had leisure to rally they came on her painfully and involuntary tears filled her eyes it was sad indeed to hear of her child as of a stranger and to be made to feel sensibly how wide the gulf was that separated them my sweet girlmy own ethelare you indeed so lost to me as her heart breathed this ejaculation she felt the downy cheek of her babe close to hers and its little fingers press her bosom a moments recollection brought another imageethel grown up to womanhood educated in hatred of her negligent and unfilialthis was not the little cherub whose loss she lamented let her look round the crowd then about her and among the fair girls she saw any one was as near her in affection and duty as the child so early torn from her to be for ever estranged and lost the baleful part of cornelias character was roused by these reflections her pride her selfwill her spirit of resistance and for this she has been taken from me she thought to marry while yet a child a ruined manto be wedded to care and indigence thus would it not have been had she been entrusted to me o how hereafter she may regret the injuries of her mother when she feels the effects of them in her own adversity it is not for me to prevent this illjudged union the aunt and niece would see in my opposition a motive to hasten it wise as they fancy themselveswise and goodwhat i the reviled reprobated they would therefore pursue with more eagerness be it somy day will yet come a glance of triumph shot across her face as she indulged in this emotion of revenge the most deceitful and reprehensible of human feelingsrevenge against a childhow sad at besthow sure to bring with it its recompense of bitterness of spirit and remorse but cornelias heart had been rudely crushed and in the ruin of her best affections her mother had substituted noxious passions of many kindspride chief of all while thus excited and indignant she saw edward villiers he came into her box the lady with her was totally unaware of what had been passing in her thoughts nor reverted to the name mentioned as having any connexion with her she asked villiers if it were true that he was going to be married lady heard the question she turned on him her eyes full of significant meaning and with a smile of scorn answered for him o yes mr villiers is going to be married his bride is young beautiful and portionless but he has the tastes of a hermithe means to emigrate to americahis simple and inexpensive habits are admirably suited to the wilderness this was said as if in jest and answered in the same tone the third in the trio joined in quite unaware of the secret meaning of the conversation several bitter allusions were made by lady lodore and the truth of all she said sent her words home to edwards heart she drew as if playfully a representation of highbred indigence that made his blood curdle as if she could read his thoughts she echoed their worst suggestions and unrolled the page of futurity such as he had often depicted it to himself presenting in sketchy yet forcible colours a picture from which his soul recoiled he would have escaped but there was a fascination in the topic and in the very bitterness of spirit which she awakened he rather encouraged her to proceed while he abhorred her for so doing acknowledging the while the justice of all she said lady lodore was angry and she felt pleasure in the pain she inflicted her wit became keener her sarcasm more pointed yet stopping short with care of any thing that should betray her to their companion and avoiding with inimitable tact any expression that should convey to one not in the secret that she meant any thing more than raillery or goodhumoured quizzing as it is called at length villiers took his leave were i he said the unfortunate man you represent me to be you would have to answer for my life this night but reassure yourselfit is all a dream i have no thoughts of marrying and the fair girl whose fate as my wife lady lodore so kindly compassionates is safe from every danger of becoming the victim of my selfishness and poverty this was said laughing yet an expressive intonation of voice conveyed his full meaning to cornelia i have done a good deed if i have prevented this marriage she thought yet a thankless one after all he is a gentleman and under sister bessys guardianship poor ethel might fall into worse hands while lady lodore thus dismissed her anger and all thought of its cause villiers felt more resentment than had ever before entered his kind heart the truths which the lady had spoken were unpalatable and the mode in which they were uttered was still more disagreeable he hated her for having discovered them and for presenting them so vividly to his sight at one moment he resolved never to see ethel more while he felt that he loved her with tenfold tenderness and would have given worlds to become the source of all happiness to herwishing this the more ardently because her mother had pictured him as being the cause to her of every ill edwards nature was very impetuous but perfectly generous the tempest of anger allayed he considered all that lady lodore had said impartially and while he felt that she had only repeated what he had told himself a thousand times he resolved not to permit resentment to controul him and to turn him from the right path he felt also that he ought no longer to delay acting on his good resolutions his intercourse with miss fitzhenry had begun to attract attention and must therefore cease once again he would ride over to richmondonce again see hersay farewell and then stoically banish every pleasant dreamevery heartenthralling hopewillingly sacrificing his dearest wishes at the shrine of her welfare chapter viii she to a window came that opened west towards which coast her love his way addrest there looking forth she in her heart did find many vain fancies working her unrest and sent her winged thoughts more swift than wind to bear unto her love the message of her mind the faerie queen ethel happy in her seclusion was wholly unaware of her mothers interference and its effects she had not the remotest suspicion that it would be considered as conducive to her welfare to banish the only friend that she had in the world in her solitary position life was a blank without edward and while she congratulated herself on her good fortune in the concurrence of circumstances that had brought them together and as she believed established her happiness on the dearest and most secure foundations she was far from imagining that he was perpetually revolving the necessity of bidding her adieu for ever if she had been told two years before that all intercourse between her and her father were to cease it would scarcely have seemed more unnatural or impossible than that such a decree should be issued to divide her from one to whom her young heart was entirely given she relied on him as the support of her lifeher guide and protectorshe loved him as the giver of good to hershe almost worshipped him for the many virtues which he either really possessed or with which her fondness bounteously gifted him meanwhile the unacute observations of mrs fitzhenry began to be awakened she gave herself great credit for discovering that there was something singular in the constant attendance of edward and yet in fact she owed her illumination on this point to her man of law mr humphries whom she had seen on business the day before finding how regular a visitor villiers was and their only one first elevated his eyebrows and then relaxed into a smile as he said i suppose i am soon to wish miss fitzhenry joy this same day edward had ridden down to them a violent storm prevented his return to town he slept at the inn and breakfasted with the ladies in the morning there was something familiar and homefelt in his appearance at the breakfasttable that filled ethel with delight women says the accomplished author of paul clifford think that they must always love a man whom they have seen in his nightcap there is deep philosophy in this observation and it was a portion of that feeling which made ethel feel so sweetly complacent when villiers unbidden rang the bell and gave his orders to the servant as if he had been at home aunt bessy started a little and while the young people were strolling in the shrubbery and renewing the flowers in the vases she was pondering on the impropriety of their position and wondering how she could break off an intimacy she had hitherto encouraged but one way presented itself to her plain imagination the old resource a return to longfield with light heart and glad looks ethel bounded up stairs to dress for dinner and she was twining her ringlets round her taper fingers before the glass when her aunt entered with a look of serious import my dear ethel i have something important to say to you ethel stopped in her occupation and turned inquiring eyes on her aunt my dear continued mrs fitzhenry we have been a long time away if you please we will return to longfield this time ethel did not grow pale she turned again to the mirror saying with a smile that lighted her whole countenance dear aunt that is impossiblei would rather not no negative could have been more imposing on the good lady than this she did not know how to reply how to urge her wish dearest aunt continued her niece you are losing timedinner will be announced and you are not dressed we will talk of longfield tomorrowwe must not keep mr villiers waiting it was often the custom of aunt bessy like the father of hamlet to sleep after dinner she did not betake herself to her orchard but her armchair for a few minutes gentle doze ethel and villiers meanwhile walked out and descending to the river side they were enticed by the beauty of the evening to go upon the water ethel was passionately fond of every natural amusement boating was a pleasure that she enjoyed almost more than any other and one with which she was seldom indulged for her spinster aunt had so many fears and objections and considered every event but sitting still in her drawingroom or a quiet drive with her old horses as so fraught with danger and difficulty that it required an absolute battle ever to obtain her consent for her niece to go on the rivershe would have died before she could have entered a boat herself and walking at the waters edge she always insisted that ethel should keep close to the bank while by the repetition of expressions of alarm and entreaties to return she destroyed every possibility of enjoyment the river sped swiftly on calm and free there is always life in a stream of which a lake is frequently deprived when sleeping beneath a windless sky a river pursues for ever its course accomplishing the task its creator has imposed and its waters are for ever changing while they seem the same it was a balmy summer evening the air seemed to brood over the earth warming and nourishing it all nature reposed and yet not as a lifeless thing but with the same enjoyment of rest as gladdened the hearts of the two beings who with gratitude and love drank in the influence of this softest hour of day the equal splash of the oar or its dripping when suspended the clear reflection of tree and lawn in the river the very colour of the stream stolen as it was from heaven itself the plash of the wings of the waterfowl who skimmed the waves towards their rushy nestsevery sound and every appearance was beautiful harmonious and soothing ethels soul was at peace grateful to heaven and satisfied with every thing around her a tenderness beamed from her eyes and was diffused over her attitude and attuned her voice which acted as a spell to make edward forget every thing but herself they had both been silent for some time a sweet silence more eloquent than any words when ethel observed my aunt wishes to return to longfield villiers started as if he had trodden upon a serpent exclaiming to longfield o yes that were far bestwhen shall you go why is it best why should we go asked ethel with surprise because replied villiers impetuously it had been better that you had never left itthat we had never met it is not thus that i can fulfil my promise to your father to guard and be kind to his child i am practising on your ignorance taking advantage of your loneliness and doing you an injury for which i should call any other a villain were he guilty it was the very delight that edward had been a moment before enjoying the very beauty and calmness of nature and the serenity and kindness of the sweet face turned towards him which stirred such bitterness checking himself however he continued after a pause in a more subsided tone are there any words by which i can lay bare my heart to you ethelnone to speak of my true and entire attachment is almost an insult and to tell you that i tear myself from you for your own sake sounds like impertinence yet all this is true and it is the reverence that i have for your excellence the idolatry which your singleness of heart and sincere nature inspires which prompts me to speak the truth though that be different from the usual language of gallantry or what is called love will you hate me or pity me most when i speak of my determination never to see you more you cannot guess how absolutely i am a ruined manhow i am one of those despicable hangerson of the rich and noble who cover my rags with mere gilding i am a beggari have not a shilling that i can call my own and it is only by shifts and meannesses that i can go on from day to day while each one menaces me with a prison or flight to a foreign country i shall goand you will regret me ethel or you will despise me it were best of all that you forgot me i am not worthy of youno man could be that i have known you and loved youand for your sake banished myself from you will be the solitary ray of comfort that will shed some faint glow over my chilled and darkened existence will you say even now one word of comfort to me ethel looked up the pure affectionateness of her heart prevented her from feeling for herself she thought only of her lover would that i could comfort you she said you will do what you think right and that will be your best consolation do not speak of hatred or contempt or indifference i shall not change though we part for ever how is it possible that i should ever cease to feel regard for one who has ever been kind considerate and generous to me go if you think it righti am a foolish girl and know nothing of the world and i will not doubt that you decide for the best villiers took her hand and held it in his his heart was penetrated by her disinterested selfforgetfulness and confidence he felt that he was loved and that he was about to part from her for ever the pain and pleasure of these thoughts mingled strangelyhe had no words to express them he felt that it would be easier to die than to give her up aunt bessy on the rivers bank imploring their return recalled them from the fairy region to which their spirits had wandered for one moment they had been united in sentiment one kindred emotion of perfect affection had as it were married their souls one to the other at the alien sound of poor bessys voice the spell fled away on airy wings leaving them disenchanted the rudder was turned the boat reached the shore and unable to endure frivolous talk about any subject except the one so near his heart villiers departed and rode back to town miserable yet most happydespairing yet full of joy to such a riddle love which finds its completion in sympathy and knows no desire beyond is the only solution the feelings of ethel were even more unalloyed she had no doubts about the future the present embraced the world she did not attempt to unravel the dreamy confusion of her thoughts or to clear up the golden mist that hung before curtaining most gloriously the reality beyond her step was buoyant her eyes sparkling and joyous love and gladness sat lightly on her bosom and gratitude to heaven for bestowing so deep a sense of happiness was the only sentiment that mingled with these villiers on leaving them had promised to return the next day and on the morrow she rose animated with such a spirit as may be kindled within the bosom of an enchantress when she pronounces the spell which is to controul the movements of the planetary orbs she was more than queen of the world for she was empress of edwards heart and ruling there she reigned over the course of destiny and bent to her will the conflicting elements of life he did not come it was strange now hope now fear were interchanged one for the other till night and certain disappointment arrived yet it was not muchthe morrows sun would light him on his way to her to cheat the lagging hours of the morrow she occupied herself with her painting and music tasking herself to give so many hours to her employments thus to add speed to the dilatory walk of time the long day was passed in fruitless expectationanother and another succeeded was he ill what strange mutation in the course of nature had occurred to occasion so inexplicable an absence a week went by and even a second was nearly spent she had not anticipated this estrangement day by day she went over in her mind their last conversation and edwards expressions gathered decision and a gloomy reality as she pondered on them the idea of an heroic sacrifice on his part and submission to his will on hers at first soothed herbut never to see him more was an alternative that tasked her fortitude too high and while her heart felt all the tumults of despair she found herself asking what his love could be that could submit to lose her love in a cottage is the dream of many a highborn girl who is not allowed to dance with a younger brother at almacks but a secluded an obscure an almost cottage life was all that ethel had ever known and all that she coveted villiers rejected thisnot for her sake that could not be but for the sake of a world which he called frivolous and vain and yet to whose tyranny he bowed to disentwine the tangled skein of thought which was thus presented was her task by day and night she awoke in the morning and her first thought was will he come she retired at night and sleep visited her eyes while she was asking herself why has he not been during the day these questions in every variety forced her attention to escape from her aunt to seek solitude to listen to each sound that might be his horse and to feel her heart sicken at the still renewed disappointment became in spite of herself all her occupation she might bend over her drawing or escape from her aunts conversation to the piano but these were no longer employments but rather means adopted to deliver herself up more entirely to her reveries the third the fourth week came and the silence of death was between ethel and her friend o but for one word one look to break the spell was she indeed never to see him more was all all overwas the harmony their two hearts made jarred into discordwas she again the orphan alone in the worldand was the fearless reliance she had placed upon fate and edwards fidelity mere folly or insanityand was desecration and forgetfulness to come over and to destroy the worship she had so fondly cherished nothing had she to turn tonothing to console her her life became one thought it twined round her soul like a serpent and compressed and crushed every other emotion with its folds i could bear all she thought were i permitted to see him only once again she and mrs fitzhenry were invited by mrs humphries to dine with her they were asked to the awful ceremony of spending a long day which in the innocence of her heart mrs fitzhenry fancied the most delightful thing in the world she thought that kindness and friendship demanded of her that she should be in montaguesquare by ten in the morning notwithstanding every exertion she could not get there till two and then when luncheon was over she wondered why the gap of time till seven appeared so formidable this was to be got over by a drive in hydepark ethel had shown peculiar pleasure in the idea of visiting london she had looked bright and happy during their journey to town but anxiety and agitation clouded her face at the thought of the park of the crisis about to arrive at the doubt and hope she entertained of finding villiers there the park became crowded but he was not in the drive at length he entered in the midst of a bevy of fair cousins whom ethel did not know as such he entered on horseback flanked on either side by pretty equestrians looking as gay and lighthearted as she would have done had she been one the chosen one among his companions twice he passed the first time his head was avertedhe saw nothing she even did not see his face the next time his eye caught the aspect of the wellknown chariothe glanced eagerly at those it contained kissed his hand and went on ethels heart died within her it was all over she was the neglected the forgotten but while she turned her face to the other window of the carriage so to hide its saddened expression from her companion a voice the dearest sweetest voice she had ever heard the soft harmonious voice whose accents were more melodious than music asked are you in town have you left richmond in spite of herself a smile mantled over her countenance dimpling it into gladness and she turned to see the beloved speaker who had not deserted herwho was there she turned but there was no answering glance of pleasure in the face of villiershe looked grave and bowed as if in this act of courtesy he fulfilled all of friendly interchange that was expected of him and rode off he was goneand seen no more chapter ix sure when the separation has been tried that we who part in love shall meet again wordsworth this little event roused ethel to the necessity of struggling with the sentiment to which hitherto she had permitted unquestioned power there had been a kind of pleasure mingled with her pain while she believed that she suffered for her lovers sake and in obedience to his will to love in solitude and absence was she well knew the lot of many of her sex and all that is imaginative and tender lends poetry to the emotion but to love without return her father had taught her was shame and follya dangerous and undignified sentiment that leads many women into acts of humiliation and misery he spoke the more warmly on this subject because he desired to guard his daughter by every possible means from a fate too common he knew the sensibility and constancy of her nature he dreaded to think that these should be played upon and that her angelic sweetness should be sacrificed at the altar of hopeless passion that all the powers he might gift her with all the fortitude and all the pride that he strove to instil might be insufficient to prevent this one grand evil he too well knew but all that could should be done and his own highsouled ethel should rise uninjured from the toils of the snarer the heartless game of the unfaithful lover she steeled her heart against every softer thought she tasked herself each day to devote her entire attention to some absorbing employment to languages and the composition of music as occupations that would not permit her thoughts to stray she felt a pain deepseated in her inmost heart but she refused to acknowledge it when a thought too sweet and bitter took perforce possession of the chambers of her brain she drove it out with stern and unshaken resolve she pondered on the best means to subdue every rebel idea she rose with the sun and passed much time in the open air that when night came bodily fatigue might overpower mental regrets she conversed with her aunt again about her dear lost father that by renewing images so long the only ones dear to her every subsequent idea might be driven from the place it had usurped always she was rewarded by the sense of doing right often by really mitigating the anguish which rose and went to rest with her and awakening her in the morning stung her to renew her endeavours while it whispered too audibly i am here she grew pale and thin and her eyes again resumed that lustre which spoke a quick and agitated life within her endeavours by being unremitting gave too much intensity to every feeling and made her live each moment of her existence a sensitive conscious life wearing out her frame and threatening while it accelerated the pulses to exhaust betimes the animal functions she felt this and she roused herself to contend afresh with her own heart as a last resource she determined to quit richmond her struggles and the energy called into action by her fortitude gave a tone of superiority to her mind which her aunt felt and submitted to now when a change of residence was determined upon she at once negatived the idea of returning to longfieldyet whither else betake themselves ethel no longer concealed from herself that she and the worthy spinster were solitary wanderers on earth cut off from human intercourse a bitter sense of desolation had crept over her from the moment that she knew herself to be deserted by villiers all that was bright in her position darkened into shadow she shrunk into herself when she reflected that should the ground at her feet open and swallow her not one among her fellowcreatures would be sensible that the whole universe of thought and feeling which emanated from her breathing spirit as water from a living spring was shrunk up and strangled in a narrow voiceless grave a short time before she had regarded death without terror for her father had been its prey and his image was often shadowed forth in her fancy beckoning her to join him now it had become more difficult to die nature and love were wedded in her mind and it was a bitter pang for one so young to bid adieu to both for ever turning her thoughts from villiers she would have been glad to discover any link that might enchain her to the mass she reverted to her mother her inexperience her youth and the timidity of her disposition prevented her from making any endeavour to break through the wall of unnatural separation raised between them she could only lament one sign one word from lady lodore would have been balm to her poor heart and she would have met it with fervent gratitude but she feared to offend she had no hope that any advance would have been met by other than a disdainful repulse and she shrunk from intruding herself on her unwilling parent she often wept to think that there was none near to support and comfort her and yet that at the distance of but a few miles her mother livedwhose very name was the source of the dearest sweetest and most cruel emotions she thought therefore of her surviving parent only to despair and to shrink with terror from the mere possibility of an accidental meeting she earnestly desired to leave england which had treated her with but a stepmothers welcome and to travel away she knew not whither yet most she wished to go to italy her father had often talked of taking her to that country and it was painted in her eyes with the hues of paradise she spoke of her desire to her aunt who thought her mad and believed that it was as easy to adventure to the moon as for two solitary women to brave alps and earthquakes banditti and volcanoes a savage people and an unknown land still even while she trembled at the mere notion she felt that ethel might lead her thither if she pleased it is one of the most beneficent dispensations of the creator that there is nothing so attractive and attaching as affection the smile of an infant may command absolutely because its source is in dependent love and the human heart for ever yearns for such demonstration from another what would this strange world be without that touch of nature it is to the immaterial universe what light is to the visible creation scent to the flower hue to the rainbow hope joy succour and selfforgetfulness where otherwise all would be swallowed up in vacant and obscure egotism no one could approach ethel without feeling that she possessed an irresistible charm the overflowing and trusting affectionateness of her nature was a loadstone to draw all hearts each one felt even without knowing wherefore that it was happiness to obey to gratify her thus while a journey to italy filled mrs elizabeth with alarm a consent hovered on her lips because she felt that any risk was preferable to disappointing a wish of her gentle niece and yet even then ethel paused she began to repent her desire of leaving the country inhabited by her dearest friend she felt that she should have an uncongenial companion in her auntthe child of the wilderness and the good lady of longfield were like a living and dead body in conjunctionthe one inquiring eager enthusiastic even in her contemplativeness sensitively awake to every passing object while the other dozed her hours away and fancied that pitfalls and wild beasts menaced her if she dared step one inch from the beaten way at this moment while embarrassed by the very yielding to her desires and experiencing a lingering sad regret for all that she was about to leave behind ethel received a letter from villiers her heart beat and her fingers trembled when first she saw as now she held a paper which might be every thing yet might be nothing to her she opened it at last and forced herself to consider and understand its contents it was as follows dear miss fitzhenry will your aunt receive me with her wonted kindness when i call tomorrow i fear to have offended by an appearance of neglect while my heart has never been absent from richmond plead my cause i entreat you i leave it in your hands ever and ever yours edward villiers grosvenor square saturday dearest ethel have you guessed at my sufferings shall you hail with half the joy that i do a change which enables you to revoke the decree of absence so galling at least to one of us if indeed you have not forgotten me i shall be rewarded for the wretchedness of these last weeks ethel kissed the letter and placed it near her heart a calm joy diffused itself over her mind and that she could indeed trust and believe in him she loved was the source of a grateful delight more medicinal than all the balmy winds of italy and its promised pleasures when villiers had last quitted richmond he had resolved not to expose himself again to the influence of ethel it was necessary that they should be dividedhow far better that they should never meet again he was not worthy of her another more fortunate would replace him if he sacrificed his own selfish feelings and determinately absented himself from her as if to confirm his view of their mutual interest his elder cousin mr saville had just offered his hand to the daughter of a wealthy earl and had been accepted villiers took refuge from his anxious thoughts among his pretty cousins sisters of the bridegroom and with them the discussion of estates settlements princely mansions and equipages was the order of the day edward sickened to reflect how opposite would be the prospect if his marriage with ethel were in contemplation it was not that a noble establishment would be exchanged for a modest humble dwellinghe loved with sufficient truth to feel that happiness with ethel transcended the wealth of the world it was the absolute penury the debt the care that haunted him and made such miserable contrast with the tens and hundreds of thousands that were the subject of discussion on the present occasion his resolution not to entangle ethel in this wilderness of ills gained strength by every chance word that fell from the lips of those around him and the image before so vivid of her home at richmond which he might at each hour enter of her dear face which at any minute might again bless his sight faded into a faroff vision of paradise from which he was banished for ever for a time he persevered in his purpose if not with ease yet with less of struggle than he himself anticipated that he could at any hour break the selfenacted law and behold ethel enabled him day after day to continue to obey it and to submit to the decree of banishment he had passed upon himself he loved his pretty cousins and their kindness and friendship soothed him he spent his days with them and the familiar sisterly intercourse hallowed by long association and made tender by the grace and sweetness of these good girls compensated somewhat for the absence of deeper interest they talked of horatio also and that was a more touching string than all the almost worship joined to pity and fear for him with which edward regarded his cousin made him cling fondly to those so closely related to him and who sympathized with and shared his enthusiastic affection this state of half indifference did not last long his meeting with ethel in hyde park operated an entire change he had seen her face but a momenther dear face animated with pleasure at beholding him and adorned with more than her usual loveliness he hurried away but the image still pursued him all at once the world around grew dark and blank at every instant his heart asked for ethel he thirsted for the sweet delight of gazing on her soft lustrous eyes touching her hand listening to her voice whose tones were so familiar and beloved he avoided his cousins to hide his regrets he sought solitude to commune with memory and the intense desire kindled within him to return to her was all but irresistible he had received a letter from horace saville entreating him to join him at naples he had contemplated complying as a means of obtaining forgetfulness should he not on the contrary make this visit with ethel for his companion it was a picture of happiness most enticing and then he recollected with a pang that it was impossible for him to quit england that it was only by being on the spot that he obtained the supplies necessary for his existence with bitterness of spirit he recognized once again his state of beggary and the hopelessness that attended on all his wishes all at once he was surprised by a message from his father through lord maristow he was told of colonel villierss intended marriage with the only daughter of a wealthy commoner which yet could not be arranged without the concurrence of edward or rather without sacrifices on his part for the making of settlements the entire payment of his debts and the promise of fifteen hundred a year for the future were the bribes offered to induce him to consent edward at once notified his compliance he saw the hour of freedom at hand and the present was too full of interest too pregnant with misery or happiness to allow the injury done to his future prospects to weigh with him for a moment thus he might purchase his union with ethelclaim her for his own with the thought a whole tide of tenderness and joy poured quick and warm into his heart and it seemed as if he had never loved so devotedly as now how false an illusion had blinded him he fancied that he had banished hope while indeed his soul was wedded to her image and the very struggle to free himself had served to make the thought of her more peremptory and indelible with these thoughts he again presented himself at richmond he asked mrs fitzhenrys consent to address her niece and became the accepted lover of ethel the meeting of their two young hearts in the security of an avowed attachment after so many hours wasted in despondency and painful struggles did not visit the fair girl with emotions of burning transport she felt it rather like a return to a natural state of things after unnatural deprivation as if a young nestling she had been driven from her mothers side and was now restored to the dear fosterage of her care she delivered herself up to a calm reliance upon the future and saw in the interweaving of duty and affection the fulfilment of her destiny and the confirmation of her earthly happiness they were to be joined never to part more while each breathed the breath of life no power could sever them health or sickness prosperity or adversitythese became mere words her health and her riches were garnered in his heart and while she bestowed the treasures of her affection upon him could he be poor it was not therefore to be her odious part to crush the first and single attachment of her soulto tear at once the painted veil of life delivering herself up to cheerless realitiesto know that to do right she must banish from her recollection those inwardspoken vows which she should deem herself of a base inconstant disposition ever to forget it was not reserved for her to pass joyless years of solitude reconciling herself to the necessity of divorcing her dearest thoughts from their wedded image the serene and fairshowing home she coveted was open before hershe might pass within its threshold and listen to the closing of the doors behind as they shut out the world from her with pure and unalloyed delight ethel was very young yet in youth such feelings are warmer in our hearts than in after years we do not know then that we can ever change or that snakelike casting the skin of an old careworn habit a new one will come fresh and bright in seeming as the one before had been at the hour of its birth we fancy then that if our present and first hope is disappointed our lives are a mere blank not worth a pins fee the singleness of our hearts has not been split into the million hairlike differences which woven by time into one texture clothes us in prudence as with a garment we are as if exposed naked to the action of passions and events and receive their influence with keen and fearful sensitiveness ethel scarcely heard and did not listen to nor understand the change of circumstances that brought villiers back to hershe only knew that he was confirmed her own satisfied with this delightful conclusion to her sufferings she placed her destiny in his hands without fear or question mrs elizabeth thought her niece very young to marry but villiers who had while hesitating done his best to hide his sweet ethel away from every inquisitive eye now that she was to be his own hastened to introduce lord maristow lady maristow had died two years before to her and to bring her among his cousins whom he regarded as sisters the change was complete and overwhelming to the fair recluses where before they lived in perpetual ttette or separated but to be alone they were now plunged into what appeared to them a crowd sophia harriet and lucy saville were highborn highbred and elegant girls accustomed to what they called the quiet of domestic life amidst a thousand relations and ten thousand acquaintances no female relative had stepped into their mothers place and they were peculiarly independent and highspirited they had always lived in what they called the world and knew nothing but what that world contained their manners were easy their tempers equable and affectionate if their dispositions were not all exactly alike they had a family resemblance that drew them habitually near each other they received ethel among their number with cordiality bestowing on her every attention which politeness and kindness dictated yet ethel felt somewhat as a wild antelope among tame ones their language the topics of their discourse their very occupations were all new to her she lent herself to their customs with smiles and sweetness but her eye brightened when edward came and she often unconsciously retreated to his side as a shelter and a refuge edwards avocations had been as worldly perhaps as those of his pretty cousins but a man is more thrown upon the reality of life while girls live altogether in a factitious state he had travelled much and seen all sorts of people besides between him and ethel there was that mute language which will make those of opposite sexes intelligible to one another even when literally not understanding each others dialect villiers found no deficiency of intelligence or sympathy in ethel while the fashionable girls to whom he had introduced her felt a little at a loss how to entertain the stranger lord maristow and his family had been detained in town till after mr savilles marriage and were now very eager to leave it they remained out of compliment to edward and looked forward impatiently to his wedding as the event that would set them free london was empty the shooting season had begun yet still he was delayed by his father he wished to sign the necessary papers and free himself from all business that he and his bride might immediately join horatio at naples yet still colonel villierss marriage was delayed till at last he intimated to his son that it was postponed for the present and begged that he would not remain in england on his account edward was somewhat staggered by this intelligence yet as the letter that communicated it contained a considerable remittance he quieted himself to give up ethel now was a thought that did not for a moment enter his mind it was but the reflection of the difficulties that would surround them if his prospects failed that for a few seconds clouded his brow with care but it was his nature usually to hope the best and to trust to fortune he had never been so prudent as with regard to his marriage with ethel but that was for her sake this consideration could not again enter for like her he would under the near hope of making her his have preferred the wilds of the illinois with her for his wife than the position of the richest english nobleman deprived of such a companion his heart delivered up to love was complete in its devotion and tenderness he was already wedded to her in soul and would sooner have severed his right arm from his body than voluntarily have divided himself from this dearer part of himself this other half towards whom he felt as if literally he had to give her being lent out of his side to her nearest his heart substantial life to have her by his side henceforth an individual solace dear with these feelings an early day was urged and named and drawing near ethel was soon to become a bride on first making his offer villiers had written to lady lodore and mrs fitzhenry much against her will by the advice of her solicitor did the same lady lodore was in scotland no answer came the promised day approached but still she preserved this silence it became necessary to proceed without her consent banns were published and ethel became the wife of villiers on the th of october lord maristow hastened down to his castle to kill pheasants while on her part mrs fitzhenry took her solitary way to longfield half consoled for separating from ethel by this return to the habits of more than sixty years in vain had london or richmond wooed her stay in vain was she pressed to pay a visit to maristow castle to return to her home was a more enticing prospect her good old heart danced within her when she first perceived the village steeple the chimneys of her own house made tears spring into her eyes and when indeed she found herself by the familiar hearth in the accustomed armchair and her attentive housekeeper came to ask if she would not take any thing after her journey it seemed to her as if all the delights of life were summed up in this welcome return to monotony and silence chapter x let me awake your love to my uncomforted brother old play meanwhile villiers and his bride proceeded on their way to naples it mattered little to ethel whither they were going or to whom edward was all in all to her and the vehicle that bore them along in their journey was a complete and perfect world containing all that her heart desired they avoided large towns and every place where there was any chance of meeting an acquaintance they passed up the rhine and ethel often imaged forth in her fancy a dear home in a secluded nook and longed to remain there cut off from the world for ever she had no thought but for her husband and gratitude to heaven for the happiness showered on her her soul might have been laid bare each faculty examined each idea sifted and one spirit one sentiment one love would have been found pervading and uniting them all the heart of a man is seldom as single and devoted as that of a woman in the present instance it was natural that edward should not be so absolutely given up to one thought as was his bride ethels affections had never been called forth except by her father and by him who was now her husband when it has been said that she thought of heaven to hallow and bless her happiness it must be understood that the dead made a part of that heaven to which she turned her eyes with such sweet thankfulness she was constant to the first affection of her heart she might be said to live perpetually in thought beside her fathers grave before she had wept and sorrowed near it now she placed the home of her happy married life close to the sacred earth and fancied that its mute inhabitant was the guardian angel to watch over and preserve her villiers had lived among many friends and was warmly attached to several his cousin horatio was dearer to him than any thing had ever been till he knew ethel even now he revered him more and felt a kind of duteous attachment drawing him towards him he wanted horatio to see and approve of ethelnot that he doubted what his opinion of her would be but the delight which his own adoration of her excellence imparted to him would be doubled when he saw it shared and confirmed by his friend besides this he was anxious to see horace on his own account he wished to know whether he was happy in his marriage whether clorinda were worthy of him and if lady lodore were entirely forgotten as they advanced on their journey his desire to see his cousin became more and more present to his mind and he talked of him to ethel and imparted to her a portion of his fervent and affectionate feelings entering switzerland they came into a world of snow here and there on the southern side of a mountain a lawny upland might disclose itself in summer verdure and the brawling torrents increased by the rains were not yet made silent by frost edward had visited these scenes before and he could act the guide to his enraptured ethel who remembered her fathers glowing descriptions and while she gazed with breathless admiration saw his step among the hills and thought that his eye had rested on the wonders she now beheld soon the mountains the skyseeking palaces of nature were passed and they entered fair joyous italy at each step they left winter far behind ethel would willingly have lingered in florence and rome but once south of the appenines edward was eager to reach naples and the letters he got from saville spurred him on to yet greater speed before leaving england lucy saville had said to ethelyou are now taking our other comfort from us and what we are to do without either horatio or edward i am unable to conjecture we shall be like a house without its props divided they are not either of them half what they were joined horace is so prudent so wise so considerate so sympathizing edward so active and so kindhearted in any difficulty we always asked horace what we ought to do and edward did the thing which he pointed out horatios marriage was a sad blow to us all you will bring edward back and we shall be the happier for your being with him but shall we ever see our brother againor shall we only see him to lament the change not that he can ever really alter his heart his understanding his goodness are as firm as rock but there is that about him which makes him too much the slave of those he is in immediate contact with he abhors strife the slightest disunion is mortal to him he is not of this world pureminded as a woman honourable as a knight of old he is more like a being we read of and his match is not to be found upon earth horatio never loved but once and his attachment was unfortunate he loved lady here recollection dyed miss savilles cheeks with crimson she had forgotten that lady lodore was the mother of ethel after a moments hesitation she continuedi have no right to betray the secrets of others horace was a discarded lover and he was forced to despise the lady whom he had imagined possessed of every excellence for the first time he was absorbed in what may be termed a selfish sentiment he could not bear to see any of us he fled even from edward and wandering away we heard at last that he was at naples whither he had gone quite unconscious of the spot of earth to which he was bending his steps the first letter we got from him was dated from that place his letter was to me for i am his favourite sister and god knows my devoted affection my worship of him deserves this preference you shall read it it is the most perfect specimen of enthusiastic and heartmoving eloquence ever penned he had been as in a trance and awoke again to life as he looked down from pausilippo on the bay of naples the attachment to one earthly object which preyed on his being was suddenly merged in one universal love and adoration he saw that the creation was good he purged his heart at once of the black spot which had blotted and marred its beauty and opened his whole soul to pure elevated heavenly love i tamely quote his burning and transparent expressions through which you may discern as in a glass the glorious excellence of his soul but alas this state of holy excitement could not endure something human will still creep in to mingle with and sully our noblest aspirations horatio was taken by an acquaintance to see a beautiful girl at a convent in a fatal moment an english lady said to him come and i will show you what perfect beauty is and those words decided my poor brothers destiny of course i only know our new sister through his letters he told us that clorinda was shut up in this convent through the heartless vanity of her mother who dreaded her as a rival to wait there till her parents should find some suitable match which she must instantly accept or be doomed to seclusion for ever in his younger days horace had said i am in love with an idea and therefore women have no power over me but the time came when his heart was to be the dupe of his imaginationso was it with his first loveso now i fear did he deceive himself with regard to clorinda he declared indeed that his love for her was not an absorbing passion like his first but a mingling of pity admiration and that tenderness which his warm heart was ever ready to bestow he described her as full of genius and sensibility a creature of fire and power but dimmed by sorrow and struggling with her chains he visited her again he tried to comfort he offered to serve her it was the first time that a manly generous spirit had ever presented itself to the desponding girl the highsouled englishman appeared as a god beside her sordid countrymen indeed horatio would have seemed such compared with any of his sex his fascination is irresistibleclorinda felt it she loved him with italian fervour and the first word of kindness from him elicited a whole torrent of gratitude and passion horace had no wish to marry his old wound was by no means healed but rather opened and bled afresh when he was called upon to answer the enthusiastic ardour of the italian girl he felt at once the difference of his feeling for her and the engrossing sentiment of which he had been nearly the victim but he could rescue her from an unworthy fate and make her happy he acted with his usual determination and precipitancy and within a month she became his wife here ends my story his letters were more concise after his marriage at first i attributed this to his having a new and dearer friend but latterly when he has written he has spoken with such yearning fondness for home that i fearand then when i offered to visit him he negatived my proposition how unlike horatio it can only mean that his wife was averse to my coming i have questioned slightly any travellers from italy mrs saville seldom appears in english society except at balls and then she is always surrounded by italians she is decidedly correct in her conduct but more i cannot tell her letters to us are beautifully written and of her talents even her genius i do not entertain a doubt perhaps i am prejudiced but i fear a neapolitan or rather i should say i fear a convent education and that taste which leads her to associate with her own demonstrative unrefined countrymen instead of trying to link herself to her husbands friends i may be wrongi shall be glad to be found so will you tell me whether i am i rather ask you than edward because your feminine eyes will discern the truth of these things quicker than he happy girl you are going to see horatioto find a new gifted fond friend one as superior to his fellowcreatures as perfection is superior to frailty this account remembered with more interest now that she approached the subject of it excited ethels curiosity and she began as they went on their way from rome to naples in a great degree to participate in edwards eagerness to see his cousin chapter xi sad and troubled how brave her anger shows how it sets off her natural beauty under what happy star was virolet born to be beloved and sought by two incomparable women fletcher it was the month of december when the travellers arrived at this piece of heaven dropt upon earth as the natives themselves name it the moon hung a glowing orb in the heavens and lighted up the sea to beauty a bloodred flash shot up now and then from vesuvius a summer softness was in the atmosphere while a thousand tokens presented themselves of a climate more friendly more joyous and more redundant than that of the northern isle from which they came it was very late at night when they reached their hotel and they were heartily fatigued so that it was not till the next morning that immediately after breakfast villiers left ethel and went out to seek the abode of his cousin he had been gone some little time when a waiter of the hotel throwing open ethels drawingroom door announced signor orazio quite new to italy ethel was ignorant of the custom in that country of designating people by their christian names and that horatio saville being a resident in naples and married to a neapolitan was known everywhere by the appellation which the servant now used ethel was not in the least aware that it was lucys brother who presented himself to her she saw a gentleman tall very slight in person with a face denoting habitual thoughtfulness and stamped by an individuality which she could not tell whether to think plain and yet it was certainly open and kind an appearance of extreme shyness almost amounting to awkwardness was diffused over him and his words came hesitatingly he spoke english and was an englishmanso much ethel discovered by his first words which were villiers is not at home and then he began to ask her about her journey and how she liked the view of the bay of naples which she beheld from her windows they were in this kind of trivial conversation when edward came bounding upstairs and with exclamations of delight greeted his cousin ethel infinitely surprised examined her guest with more care in a few minutes she began to wonder how she came to think him plain his deepset darkgrey eyes struck her as expressive if not handsome his features were delicately moulded and his fine forehead betokened depth of intellect but the charm of his face was a kind of fitful beamy inconstant smile which diffused incomparable sweetness over his physiognomy his usual look was cold and abstractedhis eye speculated with an inward thoughtfulnessa chilling seriousness sat on his features but this glancing and varying halfsmile came to dispel gloom and to invite and please those with whom he conversed his voice was modulated by feeling his language was fluent graceful in its turns of expression and original in the thoughts which it expressed his manners were marked by high breeding yet they were peculiar they were formed by his individual disposition and under the dominion of sensibility hence they were often abrupt and reserved he forgot the world around him and gave token by absence of mind of the absorbing nature of his contemplations but at a touch this vanished and a sweet earnestness and a beaming kindliness of spirit at once displaced his abstraction rendering him attentive cordial and gay never had horatio saville appeared to so little advantage as during his short ttette with his new relative at all times when quiescent he had a retiring manner and an appearance whose want of pretension did not at first allure and yet which afterwards formed his greatest attraction he was always unembarrassed and ethel could not guess that towards her alone he felt as timid and shy as a girl it was with considerable effect that horatio had commanded himself to appear before the daughter of lady lodore there was something incongruous and inconceivable in the idea of the child of cornelia a woman married to his cousin he feared to see in her an image of the being who had subdued his heart of hearts and laid prostrate his whole soul he trembled to catch the sound of her voice lest it might echo tones which could disturb to their depths his inmost thoughts ethel was so unlike her mother that by degrees he became reassured her eyes her hair her stature and tall slender shape were the reverse of lady lodore so that in a little while he ventured to raise his eyes to her face and to listen to her without being preoccupied by a painful sensation which in its violence resembled terror it is true that by degrees this dissimilarity to her mother became less she had gestures smiles and tones that were all lady lodore and which when discerned struck his heart with a pang stealing away his voice and causing him to stand suspended in the act he was about like one acted upon by magic while this mute and curious examination was going on in the minds of ethel and her visitant the conversation had not tarried edward had never been so far south and the wonders of naples were as new to him as to ethel saville was eager to show them and proposed going that very day to pompeii for as he said all their winter was not like the present day so that it was best to seize the genial weather while it lasted was mrs villiers too much fatigued on the contrary ethel was quite on the alert but first she asked whether mrs saville would not accompany them clorinda said horatio promises herself much pleasure from your acquaintance and intends calling on you today at twentyfour oclock that is at the ave maria how stupid i am he continued laughing i quite forget that you are not italianized as i am and do not know the way in which the people here count their time clorinda will call late in the afternoon the usual visiting hour at naples but she would find no pleasure in visiting a ruined city and fallen fragments one house in the chiaja is worth fifty pompeiis in the eyes of a neapolitan and clorinda is one heart and soul i hope you will be pleased with her for she is an admirable specimen of her countrywomen and they are wonderful and often sublime creatures in their way but do not mistake her for an english woman or you will be disappointedshe has not one atom of body one particle of mind that bears the least affinity to england and now is your carriage orderedthere it is at the door so as i should say to one of my own dear sisters put on your bonnet ethel quickly and do not keep us waiting for though at naples days are short in december and we have none of their light to lose when after this explanation ethel first saw clorinda she was inclined to think that saville had scarcely done his wife justice certainly she was entirely italian but she was very beautiful her complexion was delicate though dark and without much colour her hair silken and glossy as the ravens wing her large bright black eyes resplendent the perfect arch of her brows and the marmoreal and harmonious grace of her forehead such as is never seen in northern lands except in sculpture imitated from the greeks the lower part of her face was not so good her smile was deficient in sweetness her voice wanted melody and sounded loud to an english ear her gestures were expressive but quick and wanting in grace she was more agreeable when silent and could be regarded as a picture than when called into action she was complimentary in her conversation and her manners were winning by their frankness and ease she gesticulated too much and her features were too much in motiontoo pantomimely expressive so to speak not to impress disagreeably one accustomed to the composure of the english still she was a beautiful creature young artless desirous to please and endowed moreover with the vivacious genius the imaginative talent of her country she spoke as if she were passionately attached to her husband but when ethel mentioned his english home and his relations a cloud came over the lovely neapolitans countenance and a tremor shook her frame do not think hardly of me she said i do not hate england but i fear it i am sure i should be disliked therei should be censured perhaps taunted for a thousand habits and feelings as natural to me as the air i breathe i am proud and i should retort impertinence and displeasing my husband become miserable beyond words stay with us you i love and should be wretched to part from stay and enjoy this paradise with us intreat his sisters if they wish to see horatio to come over i will be more than a sister to them but let us all forget that such a place as that cold distant england exists this was clorindas usual mode of speaking of her husbands native country but once when ethel had urged her going there with more earnestness than usual suddenly her countenance became disturbed and with a lowering and stormy expression of face that her english friend could never afterwards forget she said say not another word i pray horatio lovedhe loves an englishwomanit is torture enough for me to know this i would rather be torn in quarters by wild horses broken in pieces on the rack than set foot in england my cousin as you have pity for me and value the life of horace use your influence to prevent his only dreaming of a return to england methinks i could strike him dead if i only knew that such a thought lived for a second in his heart these words said clorinda resumed her smiles and was more than usual desirous of flattering and pleasing ethel so that she softened though she could not erase the impression her vehemence had made however there appeared no necessity for ethel to exert her influence horace was equally averse to going to england he loved to talk of it he remembered with yearning fondness its verdant beauty its pretty villages its meandering streams its embowered groves the spots he had inhabited the trivial incidents of his daily life were recalled with affection but he did not wish to return villiers attributed this somewhat to his unforgotten attachment to lady lodore but it was more strange that he negatived the idea of one of his sisters visiting himshe would not like it was all the explanation he gave several months passed lightly over the heads of the newmarried pair while they beelike sipped the honey of life and never cloyed fed perpetually on sweets naples its galleries its classic and beautiful environs offered an endless succession of occupation and amusement the presence of saville elevated their pleasures for he added the living spirit of poetry to their sensations and associated the treasures of human genius with the sublime beauty of nature he had a tact a delicacy a kind of electric sympathy in his disposition that endeared him to every one that approached him his very singularities by keeping alive an interest in him added to the charm sometimes he was so abstracted as to do the most absent things in the world and the quick alternations of his gaiety and seriousness were often ludicrous from their excess there was one thing indeed to which ethel found it difficult to accustom herself which was his want of punctuality which often caused hours to be lost and their excursions spoiled nor did he ever furnish good excuses but seemed annoyed at being questioned on the subject clorinda never joined them in their drives and rides out of the city she feared to trust herself to winds and waves the heat the breeze the dust annoyed her and she found no pleasure in looking at mountains which after all were only mountains or ruins which were only ruinsstones fit for nothing but to be removed and thrown away but clorinda had an empire of her own to which she gladly admitted her english relatives and the delights of which they fully appreciated music heard in such perfection at the glory of naples the theatre of san carlo and the heavenly strains which filled the churches with an atmosphere of sound more entrancing than incenseall these were hers and her own voice rich full and wellcultivated made a temple of melody of her own home there wasit could not be called a wallbut there was certainly a paling of separation between ethel and clorinda the young english girl could not discover in what it consisted or why she could not pass beyond the more she saw of the neapolitan the more she believed that she liked hercertainly her admiration increasedstill she felt that on the first day that clorinda had visited her with her caressing manners and wellturned flatteries she was quite as intimate with her as now after several weeks she had surely nothing to conceal all was open in her conduct yet often ethel thought of her as a magician guarding a secret treasure something there was that she watched over and hid there was often a look of anxiety about her which ethel unconsciously dispelled by some chance word or a cloud all at once dimmed her face and her magnificent and dazzling eyes flashed sudden fire without apparent cause there was something in her manner that always said you are english i am italian and there is natural war between my fire and your snow but no word no act ever betrayed alienation of feeling thus a sort of mystery pervaded their intercourse which though it might excite curiosity and was not unakin to admiration kept the affections in check sometimes ethel thought that clorinda feared to compromise her salvation for she was a catholic during the revelries of the carnival this difference of religion was not so apparent but when lent began it showed itself and divided them on various occasions more than before at last lent also was drawing to a close and as villiers and ethel were anxious to see the ceremonies of passion week at rome it was arranged that they and mr and mrs saville should visit the eternal city together horatio manifested a distaste even to the short residence that it was agreed they should make together during the month they were to spend at rome but clorinda showed herself particularly anxious for the fulfilment of this plan and the majority prevailing the whole party left naples together full soon was the veil of mystery then withdrawn and villiers and his wife let into the arcana of their cousins life horatio had yielded unwillingly to clorindas intreaties and extracted many promises from her before he gave his consent but all would not dothe natural the uncontrollable violence of her disposition broke down every barrier and in spite of his caution and her struggles with herself the reality opened fearfully upon the english pair the lava torrent of neapolitan blood flowed in her veins and restraining it for some time it at last poured itself forth with volcanic violence it was at the inn at terracina on their way to rome that a scene took place such as an english person must cross alps and apennines to behold ethel had seen that something was wrong she saw the beauty of clorinda vanished changed melted away and awfully transformed into actual ugliness she saw tiger like glances from her eyes and her lips pale and quivering poor saville strove with gentle words to allay the storm to which some jealous freak gave rise perceiving that his endeavours were vain he rose to quit the room they were at dinner she sprung on him with a knife in her hand edward seized her arm and she sunk on the floor in convulsions ethel was scarcely less moved seeing her terrified beyond all expression horatio led her from the room he was palehis voice failed him he left her and sending edward to her returned to his wife the same evening he said to villiersdo not ask me to staylet me go without another word you see how it is with what herculean labour i have concealed this sad truth so long is scarcely conceivable when ethels sweet smile has sometimes reproached my tardiness i have escaped but half alive from a scene like the one you witnessed in a few hours it is true clorinda will be shockedfull of remorseat my feetthat is worse still her repentance is as violent as her rage and both transform her from a woman into something too painful to dwell upon she is generous virtuous full of power and talent but this fatal vehemence more than neutralizes her good qualities i can do nothing i am chained to the oar i have but one hope time reason and steadiness of conduct on my part may subdue her and as she will at no distant period become a mother softer feelings may develop themselves sometimes i am violently impelled to fly from her for ever but she loves me and i will not desert her if she will permit me i will do my duty to the end let us go back now you will return to naples next winter and with this separation which will gall her proud spirit to its core as a lesson i hope by that time that she will prove more worthy of ethels society nothing could be said to this saville though he asked let us go back had decreed irrevocably in his own mind not to advance another step with his companions the parting was melancholy and ominous he would not permit clorinda to appear again for as he said he feared her repentance more than her violence and would not expose ethel as the witness of a scene of humiliation and shame a thousand times over his friends promised to return immediately to naples not deferring their visit till the following winter he was to take a house for them for the summer at castel mare or sorrento and immediately after easter they were to return these kind promises were a balm to his disturbed mind he watched their carriage from the inn at terracina as it skimmed along the level road of the pontine marshes and could not despair while he expected its quick return turning his eyes away he resumed his yoke again and melancholy beyond his wont joined his remorseful wife they were soon on their way back to naplesshe less demonstrative in her repentance because more internally and deeply touched than she had ever been before chapter xii shall i compare thee to a summers day thou art more lovely and more temperate rough winds do shake the darling buds of may and summers lease hath all too short a date but thy eternal summer shall not fade shakspeare parting thus sadly from their unfortunate cousin villiers and ethel were drawn together yet nearer and if possible with a deeper tenderness of affection than before here was an example before their eyes that all their fellowcreatures were not equally fortunate in the lottery of life and that worse than a blank befell many while the ticket which they had drawn was a prize beyond all summing edward felt indeed disappointed at losing his cousins society as well as deeply grieved at the wretched fate which he had selected for himself ethel on the contrary was in her heart glad that he was absent she had no place in that heart to spare away from her husband and however much she liked horatio and worthy as he was of her friendship she felt him as an encroacher now she delivered herself up to edward and to the thought of edward solely with fresh and genuine delight no one stood between her and himnone called off his attention or forced her to pass one second of time unoccupied by his idea when she expressed these feelings to villiers he called her selfish and narrowhearted yet his pride and his affection were gratified for he knew how true was every word she uttered and how without flaw or blot was her faith and her attachment and yet my ethel he said i sometimes ask myself how this boasted affection of yours will stand the trials which i fear are preparing for it what trials she asked anxiously care poverty the want of all the luxuries perhaps of the comforts of life ethel smiled again that is your affair she replied do you rouse your courage if you look upon these as evils i shall feel nothing of all this while near you carepovertywant as if i needed any thing except your loveyou yourselfwho are mine yes dear replied villiers that is all very well at this moment rolling along in a comfortable carriagean hotel ready to receive us with all its luxuries but suppose us without any of these ethelsuppose yourself in a melancholy little dingy abode without servants without carriage going out on foot not alone replied his wife laughing and kissing his hand i shall have you to wait on meto wait upon you take it very well now said edward i hope that you will never be put to the trial i am far from anticipating this excess of wretchedness of course but i cannot help feeling that the prospects of tomorrow are uncertain and i am anxious for my longdelayed letters from england with ethels deep and warm affection had she been ten or only five years older she also must have participated in edwards inquietude but care is a word not an emotion for the very young she was only seventeen she had never attended to the disbursements of moneyshe was ignorant of the mechanism of giving and receiving on which the course of our life depends it was in vain that she sought in the interior of her mind for an image that should produce fear or regret with regard to the absence or presence of money no one reflection or association brought into being an idea on the subject again she kissed edwards hand and looked on him with her soft clear eyes thinking only he is hereand heaven has given me all i ask left again to themselves they were anxious to avoid acquaintances yet this was impossible during the holy week at rome villiers found many persons whom he knew women of high rank and fashion men of wealth or with the appearance of it enjoying the present and while away from england unencumbered by care mr and mrs villiers were among these and of them their rank and their style of living resembling theirs associated them together all this was necessary to edward for he had been accustomed to itit was natural to ethel because being wholly inexperienced she did as others did and as villiers wished her to do without reflection or forethought yet each day added to edwards careful thoughts easter was gone and the period approached when they had talked of returning to naples the covey of english had taken flight towards the north they were almost the only strangers in the ancient and silent city whose every stone breathes of a world gone bywhose surpassing beauty crowns her still the glory of the world the english pair left to themselves roamed through the ruins and loitered in the galleries never weary of the very ocean of beauty and grandeur which they coursed over in their summer bark the weather grew warm for the month of may had commenced and they took refuge in the vast churches from the heat at twilight they sought the neighbouring gardens or scrambled about the coliseum or the more ruined and weedgrown baths of caracalla the fireflies came out and the splashing of the many fountains reached their ears from afar while the clear azure of the roman sky bent over them in beauty and peace ethel never alluded to their proposed return to naplesshe feared each day to hear villiers mention itshe was so happy where she was she shrunk from any change the majesty the simplicity the quiet of rome were in unison with the holy stillness that dwelt in her soul absorbed as it was by one unchanging image she had reached the summit of human happinessshe had nothing more to ask her full heart not bursting yet gently overflowing in its bliss thanked heaven and drew nearer edward and was at peace god help us exclaimed villiers i wonder what on earth will become of us they were sitting together on fragment of the coliseum they had clambered up its fallen wall and reached a kind of weedgrown chasm whose depth as it was moonlight they could not measure by the eye so they sat beside it on a small fragment and villiers held ethel close to him lest she should fall the heartfelt and innocent caress of two united in the sight of heaven wedded together for the endurance of the good and ills of life hallowed the spot and hour and then even while ethel nestled nearer to him in fondness edward made the exclamation that she heard with a wonder which mingled with yet could not disturb the calm joy which she felt what but good can come of us while we are thus she asked you will not listen to me nor understand me replied her husband but i do assure you that our position is more than critical no remittances no letters come from england we are in debt herein debt in italy a thousand miles from our resources i grope in the dark and see no outletevery days post with the nothing that it brings adds to my anxiety all will be well replied ethel gently no real evil will happen to us be assured i wish said villiers your experience instead of your ignorance suggested the assertion i would rather die a thousand deaths than apply to dear horace who is ill enough off himself but every day here adds to our difficulties our only hope is in our instant return to englandand by heavensyou kiss me ethel as if we lived in fairy land and that such were our foodhave you no fears i am sorry to say none she answered in a soft voice i wish i could contrive some because i appear unsympathizing to youbut i cannot fearyou are in health and near me heaven and my dear fathers spirit will watch over us and all will be well this is the end and beginning of my anxiety so dismiss yours lovefor believe me in a day or two these forebodings of yours will be as a dream it is very strange replied edward were you not so close to me i should fancy you a spirit instead of a woman you seem to have no touch of earthly solicitude well i will do as you bid me and hope for tomorrow and now let us get down from this place before the moon sets and leaves us in darkness as if to confirm the auguries of ethel the following morning brought the longexpected letters one contained a remittance another was from colonel villiers to say that edwards immediate presence was requisite in england to make the final arrangements before his marriage with a glad heart villiers turned his steps northward while ethel if she could have regretted aught while with him would have sighed to leave their lonely haunts in rome she well knew that whatever of sublime nature might display or man might congregate of beautiful in art elsewhere there was a calm majesty a silent and awful repose in the ruins of rome joined to the delights of a southern climate and the luxuriant vegetation of a sunny soil more in unison with her single and devoted heart than any other spot in the universe could boast they would both have rejoiced to have seen saville again yet they were unacknowledgedly glad not to pursue their plan of domesticating near him at naples a remediless evil which is for ever the source of fresh disquietude is one that tasks human fortitude and human patience more than those vaster misfortunes which elevate while they wound the proud aspiring spirit of man craves something to raise him from the dust and to adorn his insignificance he seeks to strengthen his alliance with the lofty and the eternal and shrinks from lowborn cares as being the fetters and bolts that link him to his baser origin saville the slave of a violent womans caprice struggling with passions at once so fiery and so feeble as to excite contempt was a spectacle which they were glad to shun their own souls were in perfect harmony and discord was peculiarly abhorrent to them they travelled by the beaten route of mont cenis lyons and calais and in less than a month arrived in england as the presence of villiers was requisite in london after staying a few days at an hotel in brookstreet they took a furnished house in the same street for a short time the london season had passed its zenith but its decline was scarcely perceptible ethel had no wish to enter into its gaieties and it had been edwards plan to avoid them until they were richer but here they were placed by fate in the very midst of them and as when their affairs were settled they intended again to return abroad he could not refuse himself the pleasure of seeing ethel in the first flower of her loveliness mingling with and outshining every other beauty of her country it would have been difficult indeed placed within the verge of the english aristocracy assembled in london to avoid its engagements and pleasuresfor he also was an arcadian and made one of the selfenthroned world the next two months therefore while still every settlement was delayed by his father they spent in the fashionable circles of london they did not indeed enter into its amusements with the zest and resolution of tyros to villiers the scene was not new and therefore not exceedingly enticing and ethels mind was not of the sort to be borne along in the stream of folly they avoided going to crowded entertainmentsthey were always satisfied with one or two parties in the evening nay once or twice in the week they usually remained at home and not unseldom dined ttette the serpent fang of pleasure and the paltry ambition of society had no power over ethel she often enjoyed herself because she often met people of either sex whose fame or wit or manners interested and pleased her but as little vanity as mortal woman ever had fell to her share very young and to use the phrase of the day very new flattery and admiration glanced harmlessly by her her personal vanity was satisfied when villiers was pleased and for the rest she was glad to improve her mind and to wear away the timidity which she felt that her lonely education had induced by mingling with the best society of her country she had also some curiosity and as she promised herself but a brief sojourn in this land of lions she wished to see several things and persons she might never come in contact with again various names which had reached her in the illinois here grew from shadows into real human beingsministers of state beauties authors and wits she visited once or twice the ventilator of st stephens and graced a red bench of the house of lords on the prorogation of parliament villiers was very much pleased with her throughout his pride was gratified by the approval she elicited from all men admired her but distantlyas a being they could not rudely nor impertinently approach women were not afraid of her because they saw that though she made no display of conjugal attachment she loved her husband her extreme youth the perpetual sunshine of her countenance and the gentle grace of her manners won more the liking than the praise of her associates they drew near her as to one too untaught to understand their mysteries and too innocent to judge them severely an atmosphere of kindness and of repose followed her wherever she went this her husband felt more than any other and he prized his ethel at the worth she so truly deserved one of the reasons which caused mrs villiers to avoid large assemblies was that lady lodore was in town and that in such places they sometimes met ethel did not well know how to act youth is ever fearful of making unwelcome demonstration and false shame often acts more powerfully to influence it than the call of duty or the voice of affection villiers had no desire to bring the mother and daughter together and stood neutral lady lodore had once or twice recognized her by a bow and a smile but after such she always vanished and was seen no more that evening ethel often yearned to approach to claim her tenderness and to offer her filial affection villiers laughed at such flights the safe thing to do he said is to take the tone of lady lodore she is held back by no bashfulnessshe does the thing she wishes without hesitation or difficulty did she desire her lovely grownup daughter to play a childs part towards her she would soon contrive to bring it about lady lodore is a woman of the worldshe was nursed in its lessons and piously adheres to its code its ways are hers and the objects of ambition which it holds out are those which she desires to attain she is talked of as admired and followed by the earl of d you may spoil all if you put yourself forward ethel was not quite satisfied the voice of nature was awake within and she yearned to claim her mothers affection until now she had regarded her more as a stranger but at this time a filial instinct stirred her heart impelling her to some outward actsome demonstration of duty whenever she saw lady lodore which was rarely and at a distance she gazed earnestly on her and tried to read within her soul whether villiers was right and her mother happy the shining uniform outside of a woman of fashion baffled her endeavours without convincing her one evening at the opera she discerned lady lodore in the tier below her ethel drew back and shaded herself with the curtain of her box so that she could not be perceived while she watched her mother intently a succession of visitors came into lady lodores box and she spoke to all with the animation of a heart at ease there was an almost voluptuous repose in her manner and appearance that contrasted with while it adorned the easy flow of her conversation and the springtide of wit which to judge from the amusement of her auditors flowed from her lips yet ethel fancied that her smile was often forced so suddenly did it displace an expression of listlessness and languor which when she turned from the people in her box to the stage came across her countenance like a shadow it might be the gas which shadows so unbecomingly the fair audience at the kings theatre it might be the consequences of raking for lady lodore was out every night but ethel thought that she saw a change she was less brilliant her person thinner and had lost some of its exquisite roundness still as her daughter gazed she thought she is not happy yet what could she do how pour sweetness into the bitter stream of life as villiers had said any advance of hers might spoil all the sister of the nobleman he had mentioned was her companion at the opera lord dhimself came though late to fetch her away she had therefore her own prospects her own plans which doubtless she desired to pursue undisturbed however they might fail to charm away the burthen of life once and only once ethel heard her mothers voice and was spoken to by her she had gone to hear the speech from the throne on the prorogation of parliament she got there late so that every bench was filled room was made for her near the throne immediately under the gallery as the house was constructed until last year but she was obliged to be separated from her party and sat half annoyed at being surrounded by strangers a peer whom she recognized as the earl of d came up and entered into conversation with the lady sitting behind her could it be her mother she remembered that as she sat down she had glanced at some one whom she thought she knew and she did not doubt that this was lady lodore a sudden thrill passed as an electric shock through her frame every joint in her body trembled her knees knocked together and the colour forsook her cheeks she tried to rally why should she feel agitated as if possessed by terror on account of this near contact with the dearest relation heaven has bestowed on its creatures why not turn and if she did not speak claim with beseeching eyes her mothers love was it indeed her the lady spoke and her voice entered and stirred ethels beating heart with strange emotion every drop of blood within her seemed to leap at the sound but she sat still as a statue saying to herself when lord dleaves her i will turn and speak after some trivial conversation on topics of the day the peers were ordered to take their seats and lord ddepartedthen ethel tried to summon all her courage but now the doors were thrown open the king entered and every one stood up at this momentas she in the confusion of being called upon while abstracted to do any act however slight had for a moment half forgotten her motherher arm was touched and the same voice which had replied to lord d said to her your earring is unfastened ethel it will fall out ethel could not speak she raised her hands mechanically to arrange the ornament but her trembling fingers refused to perform the office permit me said the lady drawing off her glove and ethel felt her mothers hand touch her cheek her very life stood suspended it was a bitter pain yet a pleasure inconceivable there was a suffocation in her throat and the tears filled her eyes but even the simple words i thank you died on her lipsher voice could frame no sound the world and all within its sphere might have passed away at that moment and she been unconscious of any change yes she will love me was the idea that spoke audibly within and a feeling of confidence a flow of sympathy and enthusiastic affection burst on her heart as soon as she could recollect herself she turned lady lodore was no longer there she had glided from her seat and ethel just caught a glimpse of her as she contrived another for herself behind a column which afterwards so hid her that her daughter could only see the waving of her plumes on these she fixed her eyes until all was over and then lady lodore went out hurriedly with averted face as if to escape her recognition this put the seal on ethels dream she believed that her mother obviously signified her desire that they should continue strangers to each other it was hard but she must submit she had no longer that prejudice against lady lodore that exaggerated notion of her demerits which the long exile of her father and the abhorrence of mrs fitzhenry had before instilled her mother was no longer a semigorgon hid behind a deceptive maska medea without a touch of human pity she was a lovely softvoiced angeliclooking woman whom she would have given worlds to be permitted to love and wait upon she found excuses for her errors she lavished admiration on all her attractions she could do all but muster courage to vanquish the obstacles that existed to their intercourse she fondly cherished her image as an idol placed in the sanctuary of her heart which she could regard with silent reverence and worship but whose concealing veil she could not raise villiers smiled when she spoke in this way to him he saw in her enthusiasm the overflowing of an affectionate heart which longed to exhaust itself in loving he kissed her and bade her think any thing so that she did nothing the time for doing had indeed for the present passed away lady lodore left town and when mother and daughter met again it was not destined to be beneath a palace roof surrounded by the nobility of the land chapter xiii i choose to comfort myself by considering that even while i am lamenting my present uneasiness it is passing away horace walpole an event occurred at this time which considerably altered the plans of mr and mrs villiers they had been invited to spend some time at maristow castle and were about to proceed thither with lord maristow and his daughters when the sudden death of mr saville changed every thing he died of a malignant fever leaving a young widow and no child to inherit his place in society through this unlookedfor event horatio became the immediate heir of his fathers title he stept from the slighted position of a younger son into the rank of the eldest and thus became another being in all mens eyesbut chiefly in his fathers viscount maristow had deeply regretted his sons foreign marriage and argued against his choice of remaining abroad he was a statesman and conceived that horatios talents and eloquence would place him high among the legislators of st stephens the soundness of his understanding and the flowing brilliancy of his language were pledges of his success but saville was not ambitious his imagination rose high above the empty honours of the worldto be useful was a better aim but he did not conceive that his was a mind calculated to lead others in its train its framework was too delicate too finely strung to sound in accord with the many he wanted the desire to triumph and was content to adore truth in the temple of his own mind without defacing its worship by truckling to the many falsehoods and errors which demand subserviency in the world lord maristow had hitherto submitted to his disappointment not without murmurs but without making any great effort at victory he had written many letters intreating his son to cast off the drowsy neapolitan slothhe had besought villiers previous to his departure the preceding year to bring his cousin back with himand this was all the death of his eldest son quickened him to exertion he resolved to trust no longer to written arguments but to go himself to italy and by force of paternal authority or persuasions to induce his son to come back to his native country and to fill with honour the post to which fortune had advanced him he did not doubt that horatio would himself feel the force of his new duties but it would be clenching his purpose and paying an agreeable compliment to clorinda to make this journey and to bring them back with him when he returned whatever mrs savilles distaste to england might be it must yield to the necessity that now drew her thither lord maristow could not imagine any resistance so violent as to impede his wishes the projected journey charmed his daughters saddened as they were by their recent loss lucy was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing her beloved brother she felt sure that clorinda would be brought to reason and thus with their hearts set upon one object one idea they bade adieu to ethel and her husband as if their career was to be as sunny and as prosperous as they doubted not that their own would be lord maristow alone guessed how things might stand edward my dear boy he said give me credit for great anxiety on your account i wish this marriage of yours had not taken place then you might have roughed it as other young men do and have been the better for a little tart experience i do not like this shuffling on your fathers part i hear for a certainty that this marriage of his will come to nothingthe friends of the young lady are against it and she is very young and only an heiress by courtesyher father can give her as many tens of thousands as he pleases but he has sworn not to give her a shilling if she marries without his consent and he has forbidden colonel villiers his house he still continues at cheltenham and assures every one that he is on safe ground that the girl loves him and that when once his the father must yield it is too ridiculous to see him playing a boylovers part at his time of life trying to undermine a daughters sense of dutyhe who may soon be a grandfather the poor little thing i am told is quite fascinated by his dashing manners and station in society we shall see how it will endi fear ill her father might pardon a runaway match with a lover of her own age but he will never forgive the coldblooded villany excuse me of a man of three times her age who for gain and gain only is seeking to steal her from him such is the sum of what i am told by a friend of mine just arrived from cheltenham the whole thing is the farce of the day and the stolen interviews of the lovers and the loud vulgarlyspoken denunciations of her father vary the scene from a travestie of romeo and juliet to the comedies of plautus or molire i beg your pardon edward for my frankness but i am angry i have been used as a catspawi have been treated unfairlyi was told that the marriage wanted but your signaturemy representations induced you to offer to miss fitzhenry and now you are a ruined man i am hampered by my own family and cannot come forward to your assistance my advice is that you wait a little and see what turn matters take once decided however they conclude strong representations shall be made to your father and he shall be forced to render proper assistance then if politics take a better turn i may do something for youor you can live abroad till better times villiers thanked lord maristow for his advice and made no remarks either on his details or promises he saw his own fate stretched drearily before him but his pride made him strong to bear without any outward signs of wincing he would suffer all conceal all and be pitied by none the thought of ethel alone made him weak were she sheltered during the storm which he saw gathering so darkly he would have felt satisfied what was to be done to go abroad was to encounter beggary and famine to remain exposed him to a thousand insults and dangers from which there was no escape such were the whisperings of despairbut brighter hopes often visited him all could not be so evil as it seemed fortune so long his enemy would yield at last one inch of groundone inch to stand upon where he might wait in patience for better days had he indeed done his utmost to avert the calamities he apprehended certainly not thus spoke his sanguine spirit more could and should be done his father might find means he himself be enabled to arrange with his lawyer some mode of raising a sum of money which would at least enable him to go on the continent with his wife he spent his thoughts in wishes for the attainment of this desirable conclusion to his adversity till the very earnestness of his expectations seemed to promise their realization it could not be that the worst would come absurd something must happen to assist them seeking for this unknown something which in spite of all his efforts would take no visible or tangible form he spent weary days and sleepless nights his brain spinning webs of thought not like those of the spider useful to their weavera tangled skein they were rather where the clue was inextricably hid he did not speak of these things to ethel but he grew sad and she was anxious to go out of town to have him all to herself when she promised herself to dispel his gloom and as she darkly guessed at the source of his disquietude by economy and a system of rigid privation to show him how willing and able she was to meet the adversity which he so much dreaded chapter xiv the pure the open prosperous love that pledged on earth and sealed above grows in the worlds approving eyes in friendships smile and homes caress collecting all the hearts sweet ties into one knot of happiness lalla rookh another month withered away in fruitless expectation villiers felt that he was following an ignis fatuus yet knew not how to give up his pursuit at length he listened more docilely to ethels representations of the expediency of quitting town she wished to pay her longpromised visit to her aunt and villiers at last consented to accompany her they gave up their house dispersed a tolerably numerous establishment and left town for their sober and rural seclusion in essex taken from the immediate scene where care met him at every turn edwards spirits rose and the very tranquillity and remoteness of longfield became a relief and an enjoyment it was bright october weather the fields were green the hedges yet in verdant trim the air was so still that the dead leaves hung too lazy to fall from the topmost boughs of the earlier trees the oak was still dressed in a dark sober greenthe fresh july shoot having lost its summer hue was unapparent among the foliage the varying tints of beach ash and elm diversified the woods the morning and evening skies were resplendent with crimson and gold and the moonlight nights were sweeter than the day fatigued by the hurry of town and one at least worn out with care the young pair took a new lease of love in idleness in this lonely spot a slight attack of rheumatism confined aunt bessy to her chimneycorner but in spite of her caution to ethel not to incur the same penalty from all the array of wet walks and damp shoes it was her best pleasure each morning to tie on her bonnet take her husbands arm and they wandered away together returning only to find their horses ready and then they departed for hours coming back late and unwillingly after the sun was down mrs elizabeth wondered where all the beautiful spots were which ethel described so enthusiastically as to be found in the neighbourhood the good lady longed to go out herself to see if she could not reap equal delight from viewing the grouping of trees whose various autumnal tints were painted in ethels speech with hues too bright for earth or to discover what there could be so extraordinarily picturesque in a mossgrown cottage near a brook with a high bank clothed with wood behind which she believed must be one dame nixons cottage in the vale of bewling and which she knew she must have passed a thousand times and yet she had never noticed its beauty very often ethel could give no information of whither they had been only they had lost themselves in majestic woods lingered in winding lanes which led to resplendent views or even reached the margin of the barren sea to behold the enveloping atmosphere reflected in its fitful mirrorto watch the progress of evanescent storms or to see the moon light up her silvery pathway on the dusky waste villiers took his gun with him in his walks but though american bred ethel was so unfeignedly distressed by the sight of death that he never brought down a bird he shot in its direction now and then to keep his pointer in practice and to laugh at his wifes glad triumph when he missed his feathery mark ethel was especially delighted to renew her acquaintance with longfield her fathers boyhood home under such sunny circumstances she had loved it before with anguish in her heart and heavy sadness weighing on her steps she had loved it for his sake but now that it became the home the dedicated garden of love it received additional beauty in her eyes from its association with the memory of lord lodore all things conjoined the season calmed and brightened as if for her especial enjoyment remembrance of the past and the undivided possession of her edwards society combined to steep her soul in happiness even he whose more active and masculine spirit might have fretted in solitude and sloth was subdued by care and uncertainty to look on the peace of the present moment as the dearest gift of the gods both so young and the minds of both open as day to each others eyes no single blot obscured their intercourse they never tired of each other and the teeming spirit of youth filled the empty space of each hour as it came with a new growth of sentiments and ideas the long evening had its pleasures with its closedrawn curtains and cheerful fire even whist with the whitehaired parson and mrs fitzhenry in her spectacles imparted pleasure could any thing duller have been devised which would have been difficult it had not been so to them and a stranger coming in and seeing their animated looks and hearing their cheerful tones and lighthearted laugh must have envied the very elysium of delight which aunt bessys usually so sober drawingroom contained merely to see ethel leaning on her husbands arm and looking up in his face as he drew her yet closer and while his fingers were twined among her silken ringlets kissed so fondly her fair brow must have demonstrated to a worldling the irrefragable truth that happiness is born a twin love being the parent the beauty of a pastoral picture has but short duration in this cloudy landand happiness the sun of our moral existence is yet more fitful in its visitations villiers and his young wife took their accustomed ride through shady lanes and copses and through parks where though the magnificent features of nature were wanting the eye was delighted by a various prospect of wood and lawny upland the soft though wild west wind drove along vast masses of snowy clouds which displayed in their intervals the deep stainless azure of the boundless sky the shadows of the clouds now darkened the pathway of our riders and now they saw the sunlight advance from a distance coming on with steps of light and air till it reached them and they felt the warmth and gladness of sunshine descend on them the various coloured woods were now painted brightly in the beams and now half lost in shadow there was life and action everywhereyet not the awakening activity of spring but rather a vague uneasy restlessness allied to languor and pregnant with melancholy villiers was silent and sad ethel too well knew the cause wherefore he was dispirited he had received letters that morning which stung him into a perception of the bitter realities which were gathering about them one was to say that no communication had been received from his father but that it was believed that he was somewhere in londonthe other was from his banker to remind him that he had overdrawn his creditnearly the most disagreeable intelligence a man can hear when he possesses no immediate means of replenishing his drained purse ethel was grieved to see him pained but she could not acutely feel these pecuniary distresses she tried to divert his thoughts by conversation and pointing out the changes which the advancing season made in the aspect of the country yes said villiers it is a beautiful world poets tell us this and religious men have drawn an argument for their creed from the wisdom and loveliness displayed in the external universe which speaks to every heart and every understanding the azure canopy fretted with golden lights or as now curtained by wondrous shapes which though they are akin to earth yet partake the glory of the skythe green expanse variegated by streams teeming with life and prolific of food to sustain that life and that very food the chief cause of the beauty we enjoywith such magnificence has the creator set forth our tableall this and the winds that fan us so balmily and the flowers that enchant our sightdo not all these make earth a type of heaven ethel turned her eyes on him to read in his face the expression of the enthusiasm and enjoyment that seemed to dictate his words but his countenance was gloomy and as he continued to speak his expressions took more the colour of his uneasy feelings how false and senseless all this really is he pursued find a people who truly make earth its woods and fells and inclement sky their unadorned dwellingplace who pluck the spontaneous fruits of the soil or slay the animals as they find them attending neither to culture nor property and we give them the name of barbarians and savagesuntaught uncivilized miserable beingsand we the wiser and more refined hunt and exterminate themwe who spend so many words either as preachers or philosophers to vaunt that with which they are satisfied we feel ourselves the greater the wiser the nobler the more barriers we place between ourselves and nature the more completely we cut ourselves off from her generous but simple munificence but is this necessary asked the forestbred girl when i lived in the wilds of the illinoisthe simplest abode food and attire were all i knew of human refinements and i was satisfied villiers did not appear to heed her remark but continued the train of his own reflections the first desire of man is not for wealth nor luxury but for sympathy and applause he desires to remove to the furthest extremity of the world contempt and degradation and according to the ideas of the society in which he is bred so are his desires fashioned we the most civilized highbred prosperous people in the world make no account of nature unless we add the ideas of possession and of the labours of man we rate each individual and we all desire to be rated as individuals distinct from and superior to the mass not by himself but by his house his park his income this is a trite observation yet it appears new when it comes home what is lower humbler more despicable than a poor man give him learning give him goodnesssee him with manners acquired in poverty habits dyed in the dusky hues of penury and if we do not despise him yet we do not admit him to our tables or society refinement may only be the varnish of the picture yet it is necessary to make apparent to the vulgar eye even the beauties of raphael to the vulgar eye repeated ethel emphatically and i seem one of those by the way i speak said edward smiling yet indeed i do not despise any man for being poor except myself i can feel pride in showing honour where honour is due even though clad in the uncouth and forbidding garb of plebeianism but i cannot claim this for myselfi cannot demand the justice of men which they would nickname pity the illinois would be preferable far and the illinois might be a paradise said ethel we hope for a betterwe hope for italy do you remember rome and the coliseum my lovenaples the chiaja and san carlothese were better than the savannas of the west our hopes are good it is the present only which is so thorny so worse than barren like the souls of dante we have a fiery pass to get through before we reach our place of bliss that we have it in prospect will gift us with fortitude meanwhile i must string myself to my task ethel dearest i shall go to town tomorrow and i with you surely do not ask it this is your first lesson in the lore you were so ready to learn of bearing all for me with you interrupted his wife with meit shall soon be replied edward but to speak according to the ways of this world my presence in london is necessary for a few daysfor a very few days a journey there and back for me is nothing but it would be a real and useless expense if you went indeed ethel you must submit to my going without youi ask it of you and you will not refuse a few days you say answered ethela very few days it is hard but you will not be angry if i should join you if your return is delayed you will not be so mad said villiers i go with a light heart because i leave you in security and comfort i will returni need not protestyou know that i shall return the moment i can i speak of a few days it cannot be a week let me go then with what satisfaction i may to the den of darkness and toil and not be farther annoyed by the fear that you will not support my absence with cheerfulness as you love me wait for me with patienceremain with your aunt till i return i will stay for a week if it must be so replied ethel indeed my love it mustnor will i task you beyondbefore a week is gone by you shall see me ethel looked wistfully at him but said no more she thought it hardshe did not think it right that he should gothat he should toil and suffer without her but she had no words for argument or contention so she yielded the next morninga cold but cheerful morningat seven oclock she drove over with him in mrs fitzhenrys little pony chaise to the town four miles off through which the stages passed a first parting is a kind of landmark in lifea starting post whence we begin our career out of illusion and the land of dreams into reality and endurance they arrived not a moment too soon she had yet a thousand things to sayone or two very particular things which she had reserved for the last moment there was no time and she was forced to concentrate all her injunctions into one word write every dayand do you it will be my only pleasure replied his wife take care of yourself he was on the top of the stage and gone and ethel felt that a blank loneliness had swallowed up the dearest joy of her life she drew her cloak round hershe gazed along the roadthere were no traces of himshe gave herself up to thought and as he was the object of all her thoughts this was her best consolation she reviewed the happy days they had spent togethershe dwelt on the memory of his unalterable affection and endearing kindness and then tears rushed into her eyes will any ill ever befall him she thought o no none ever can he must be rewarded for his goodness and his love how dear he ought to be to me did he not take the poor friendless girl from solitude and grief and disdaining neither her poverty nor her orphan state give her himself his care his affection o my edward what would ethel have been without you her father was goneher mother repulsed hershe was alone in the wide world till you generously made her your own with the true enthusiasm of passion ethel delighted to magnify the benefits she had received and to make those which she herself conferred nothing that gratitude and love might become yet stronger duties in her heart though she reproached herself for what she termed selfishness she could not regret his poverty and difficulties if thus she should acquire an opportunity of being useful to him but she felt herself defrauded of her best privileges of serving and consoling by their separation thusnow congratulating herself on her husbands attachment now repining at the fate that divided themagitated by various emotions too sweet and bitter for words she returned to longfield aunt bessy was in her armchair waiting for her to begin breakfast edwards seat was emptyhis cup was not placedhe was omitted in the domestic arrangementstears rushed into her eyes and in vain trying to calm herself she sobbed aloud aunt bessy was astonished and when all the explanation she got was he is gone she congratulated herself that her single state had spared her the endurance of these conjugal distresses chapter xv how like a winter hath my absence been from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year what freezings have i felt what dark days seen what old decembers bareness every where shakspeare ethel cheered herself to amuse her aunt and as in her days of hopeless love she tried to shorten the hours by occupation it was difficult for all her thoughts were employed in conjectures as to where edward was what doingin looking at her watch and following in her mind all his actionsor in meditating how hereafter she might remedy any remissness on her part so tender was her conscience and best contribute to his happiness such reveries beguiled many hours and enabled her to endure with some show of courage the pains of absence each day she heard from himeach day she wrote and this entire pouring out of herself on paper formed the charm of her existence she endeavoured to persuade him how fortunate their lot might hereafter behow many of his fears were unfounded or misplaced remember dearest love she said that i have nothing of the fine lady about me i do not even feel the want of those luxuries so necessary to most women this i owe to my father it was his first care while he brought me up in the most jealous retirement to render me independent of the services of others solitude is to me no evil and the delight of my life would be to wait upon you i am not therefore an object of pity when fortunes deprives me of the appurtenances of wealth which rather annoy than serve me my devotion and sacrifice as you are pleased to call the intense wish of my heart to contribute to your happiness are nothing i sacrifice all when i give up one hour of your societythere is the stingthere the merit of my permitting you to go without me i can ill bear it i am impatient and weak do not then edward dearest task me too farrecall me to your side if your return is delayedrecall your fond girl to the place near your heart where she desires to remain for ever villiers answered with few but expressive words of gratitude and fidelity his letters breathed disappointment and anxiety it is too true he said as i found it announced when i first came to town my father is married he got the banns published in an obscure church in london he persuaded miss gregory to elope with him and they are married her father is furious he returns every letter unopened his house and heart he says are still open to his daughterbut the i will not repeat his words who stole her from him shall never benefit by a shilling of his moneylet her return and all shall be pardonedlet her remain with her husband and starve he cares not my father has spent much time and more money on this pursuit in the hope of securing many thousands he raised hundreds at a prodigal and ruinous interest which must now be paid he has not ten pounds in the worldso he says my belief is that he is going abroad to secure to himself the payment of the scanty remnant of his income i have no hopes i would beg at the corner of a street rather than apply to a man who never has been a parent to me and whose last act is that of a villain excuse me you will be angry that i speak thus of my father but i know that he speaks of the poor girl he has deluded with a bitterness and insult which prove what his views were in marrying her in this moment of absolute beggary my only resource is to raise money i believe i shall succeed and the moment i have put things in train with what heartfelt what unspeakable joy shall i leave this miserable place for my own ethels side long to remain villierss letters varied little but yet they got more desponding and ethel grew very impatient to see him again she had counted the days of her weekthey were fulfilled and her husband did not return every thing depended he said on his presence and he must remain yet for another day or two at first he implored her to be patient he besought her as she loved him to endure their separation yet for a few more days his letters were very short but all in this style they were imperative with his wifeshe obeyed yet she did so she told him against her will and against her sense of right she ought to be at his side to cheer him under his difficulties she had married him because she loved him and because the first and only wish of her heart was to conduce to his happiness to travel together to enjoy society and the beauties of nature in each others society were indeed blessings and she valued them but there was another dearer still of which she felt herself defrauded and for which she yearned the aim of my life and its only real joy she said is to make your existence happier than it would have been without me when i know and feel that such a moment or hour has been passed by you with sensations of pleasure and that through me i have fulfilled the purpose of my destiny deprived of the opportunity to accomplish this i am bereft of that for which i breathe you speak as if i were better off here than if i shared the inconveniences of your lotis not this strange language my own edward you talk of security and comfort where can i be so secure as near you and for comfort what heartelevating joy it would be to exchange this barren meagre scene of absence for the delight the comfort of seeing you of waiting on you i do not ask you to hasten your return so as to injure your prospects but permit me to join you would not london itself dismal as you describe it become sunny and glad if ethel were with you to these adjurations villiers scarcely replied time crept on three weeks had already elapsed now and then a day intervened and he did not write and his wifes anxiety grew to an intolerable pitch she did not for an instant suspect his faith but she feared that he must be utterly miserable since he shrunk from communicating his feelings to her his last letter was brief i have just come from my solicitor he said and have but time to say that i must go there again tomorrow so i shall not be with you o the heavy hours in this dark prison you will reward me and make me forget them when i see youbut how shall i pass the time till then these words made ethel conceive the idea of joining him in town he would not he could not be angry he could not bring his mind to ask her to share his discomfortsbut ought she not to volunteerto insist upon his permitting her to come permit the same pride that prevented his asking would induce him to refuse her request but should she do wrong if without his express permission she were to join him a thrill half fear half transport made her hearts blood stand still at the thought the day after this last she got no letter the following day was monday and there would be no post from town her resolution was taken and she told her aunt that she should go up to london the following day mrs elizabeth knew little of the actual circumstances of the young pair villiers had made it an express condition that she should not be informed of their difficulties for he was resolute not to take from her little store which in the way she lived was sufficient yet barely so for her wants she did not question her niece as to her journey she imagined that it was a thing arranged but ethel herself was full of perplexity she remembered what villiers had said of expense she knew that he would be deeply hurt if she used a public conveyance and yet to go post would consume the little money she had left and she did not like to reach london pennyless she began to talk to her aunt and faltered out something about want of money for postingthe good ladys purse was instantly in her hand ethel had not the same horror as her husband of pecuniary obligationshe was too inexperienced to know its annoyances and in the present instance to receive a small sum from her aunt appeared to her an affair that did not merit hesitation she took twenty pounds for her journey and felt her heart lighter there yet remained another question hitherto they had travelled in their own carriage with a valet and ladys maid villiers had taken his servant to town with him in a postscript to one of his letters he said i was able to recommend laurie to a good place so i have parted with him and i shall not take another servant at this moment laurie had been long and faithfully attached to her husband who had never lived without an attendant and who from his careless habits was peculiarly helpless ethel felt that this dismissal was a measure of economy and that she ought to imitate it still as any measure to be taken always frightened her she had not courage to discharge her maid but resolved to go up to town without her aunt bessy was shocked at her going alone but ethel was firm nothing could happen to her and she should prove to edward her readiness to endure privation on monday at eleven in the forenoon on the th of november ethel having put together but a few thingsfor she expected a speedy returnstept into her travelling chariot and began her journey to town she was all delight at the idea of seeing edward she reproached herself for having so long delayed giving this proof of her earnest affection she listened with beaming smiles to all her aunts injunctions and cautions and the carriage once in motion drawing her shawl round her as she sat in the corner looking on the despoiled yet clear prospect her mind was filled with the most agreeable reveriesher heart soothed by the dearest anticipations to pay the posthorsesto gift the postillion herself were all events for her she felt proud edward said i must begin to learn the ways of the world and this is my first lesson in economy and care she thought as she put into the postboys hand just double the sum he had ever received before and how good and attentive and willing every body is i am sure women can very well travel alone every one is respectful and desirous to serve was her next internal remark as she undrew her little silken purse to give a waiter halfacrown who had brought her a glass of water and whose extreme alacrity struck her as so very kindhearted her spirits flagged as the day advanced in spite of herself an uneasy feeling diffused itself through her mind when the sun going down a misty chilly twilight crept over the landscape had she done right she asked herself would edward indeed be glad to see her she felt half frightened at her temerityalarmed at the length of her journeytimid when she thought of the vast london she was about to enter without any certain bourn she supposed that villiers went each day to his club and she knew that he lodged in duke street st jamess but she was ignorant of the number of the house and the street itself was unknown to her she did not remember ever to have been in it in her life her carriage entered labyrinthine london by blackwall and threaded the wilds of lothbury a dense and everthickening mist palpable yellow and impervious to the eye enveloped the whole town ethel had heard of a november fog but she had never witnessed one and the idea of it did not occur to her memory she was halffrightened thinking that some strange phnomena were going on and fancying that her postillion was hurrying forward in terror at last in cheapside they stopped jammed up by carts and coaches and then she contrived to make herself heard asking what was the matter the word eclipse hung upon her lips only maam the street has got blocked up like in the fog we shall get on presently the word fog solved the mystery and again her thoughts were with villiers what a horrible place for him to live in and he had been enduring all this wretchedness while she was breathing the pure atmosphere of the country again they proceeded through the murky air and through an infinitude of mischancesthe noisethe hubbubthe crowd as she could distinguish it as if veiled by dirty gauze by the lights in the shopsall agitated and vexed her through fleet street and the strand they went and it seemed as if their progress would never come to an end the whole previous journey from longfield was short in comparison to this tedious procession twenty times she longed to get out and walk at last they got free and with a quicker pace drove up to the door of the union club in charing cross the postboy called one of the waiters to the carriage door and ethel askedis mr villiers here mr villiers maam has left town ethel was aghast she had watched assiduously along the road yet she had felt certain that if he had meant to come she would have seen him on sunday and till this moment she had not entertained a real doubt but that she should find him she asked falteringly when did he go last week maam last thursday i think it was ethel breathed again the mans information must be false she was too inexperienced to be aware that servants and common people have a singular tact in selecting the most unpleasant intelligence and being very alert in communicating it do you know she inquired where mr villiers lodges cant say indeed maam but the porter knowshere saunders no saunders answered the porter is not in the way but if you can wait maam hell be back presently the waiter disappeared the postboy came uphe touched his hat wait said ethelwe must wait a little and he removed himself to the horses heads ethel sat in her lonely corner shrouded by fog and darkness watching every face as it passed under the lamp near fancying that edward might appear among them the ugly faces that haunt in quick succession the imagination of one oppressed by nightmare might vie with those that passed successively in review before ethel most of them hurried on looking neither to the right nor left some entered the house some glanced at her carriage one or two perceiving a bonnet evidently questioned the waiter he stood there for her own service ethel thought and she watched his every movementhis successive disappearances and returnsthe people he talked to once she signed to him to come butno maam the porter is not come back yetwas all his answer at last after having stood half whistling for some five minutes it appeared to ethel halfanhour without having received any visible communication he suddenly came up to the carriage door saying the porter could not stay to speak to you maam he was in such a hurry he says mr villiers lodges in duke street st jamess he should know the house but has forgotten the number then i must wait till he comes back again i knew all that before will he be long a long time maam two hours at least he said that the woman of the house is a widow womanmrs derham thus as if by torture but as with the whipping boys of old hers was the torture not the delinquents ethel extracted some information from the stupid conceited fellow on she went to duke street to discover mrs derhams residence a few wrong doors were knocked at and a beerboy at last was the mercury that brought the impatient longing wife to the threshold of her husbands residence happy beerboy she gave him a sovereign he had never been so rich in his life beforesuch chancemedleys do occur in this strange world chapter xvi o my reviving joy thy quickening presence makes the sad night sit like a youthful spring upon my blood i cannot make thy welcome rich enough with all the wealth of words middleton the boy knocked at the door a servantgirl opened it does mr villiers lodge here asked the postillion from his horse yes said the girl open the door quickly and let me out cried ethel as her heart beat fast and loud the door was openedthe steps let downoperations tedious beyond measures as she thought she got out and was in the hall going up stairs mr villiers is not at home said the maid through the low blinds of the parlour window mrs derham had been watching what was going on she heard what her servant said and now came out mr villiers is not at home she reiterated will you leave any message no i will wait for him show me into his room i am afraid that it is locked answered mrs derham repulsively perhaps you can call again who shall i say asked for him o no cried ethel i must wait for him will you permit me to wait in your parlour i am mrs villiers i beg pardon said the good woman mrs villiers is in the country and so i am replied ethelat least so i was this morning dont you see my travelling carriagelook you may be sure that i am mrs villiers she took out of her little bag one of edwards letters with the perusal of which she had beguiled much of her way to town mrs derham looked at the directionthe honourable mrs villiersher countenance brightened mrs derham was a little plump wellpreserved woman of fiftyfour or five she was kindhearted and of course shared the worship for rank which possesses every heart born within the four seas she was now all attention villierss room was open he was expected very soonhe is so seldom out in an evening it is very unlucky but he must be back directly said mrs derham as she showed the way up the narrow staircase ethel reached the landing and entered a room of tolerable dimensions considerably encumbered with litter which opened into a smaller room with a tent bed a little bit of fire glimmered in the grate the whole place looked excessively forlorn and comfortless mrs derham bustled about to bestow a little neatness on the room saying something of the untidiness of gentlemen and so many lodgers in the house ethel sat down she longed to be alone there was the postboy to be paid and to be ordered to take the carriage to a coachhouse and thenmrs derham asked her if she would not have something to eat she herself was at tea and offered a cup which ethel thankfully accepted acknowledging that she had not eaten since the morning mrs derham was shocked the rank beauty and sweet manners of ethel had made a conquest which her extreme youth redoubled so young a lady she said to go about alone she did not know how to take care of herself she was sure she must have some supper a roast chicken should be ready in an hourby the time mr villiers came in but the tea said ethel smiling you will let me have that now mrs derham hurried away on this hint and the young wife was left alone she had been married a year but there was still a freshness about her feelings which gave zest to every change in her wedded life this is where he has been living without me she thought poor edward it does not look as if he were very comfortable she rose from her seat and began to arrange the books and papers a glove of her husbands lay on the table she kissed it with a glad feeling of welcome when the servant came in she had the fire replenishedthe hearth swept and in a minute or two the room had lost much of its disconsolate appearance then with a continuation of her feminine love of order she arranged her own dress and hair giving to her attire as much as possible an athome appearance she had just finishedjust sat down and begun to find the time longwhen a quick imperative knock at the door which she recognized at once made her heart beat and her cheek grow pale she heard a stepa voiceand mrs derham answeryes sir the fire is inevery thing comfortableand ethel opened the door as she spoke and in an instant was clasped in her husbands arms it was not a moment whose joy could be expressed by words he had been miserable during her absence and had thought of sending for her but he looked round his single room remembered that he was in lodgings and gave up his purpose with a bitter murmur and here she was uncalled for but most welcome she was here in her youth her loveliness her sweetness these were charms but others more transcendent now attended on and invested herthe sacred tenderness of a wife had led her to his side and love in its most genuine and beautiful shape shed an atmosphere of delight and worship about her not one circumstance could alloy the unspeakable bliss of their meeting poverty and its humiliations vanished from before the eyes of villiers he was overflowingly rich in the possession of her affectionsher presence again and again he thanked her in broken accents of expressive transport nothing in the whole world could make me unhappy now he cried and ethel who had seen his face look elongated and gloomy at the moment he had entered felt indeed that medea with all her potent herbs was less of a magician than she in the power of infusing the sparkling spirit of life into one human frame it was long before either were coherent in their inquiries and replies there was nothing indeed that either wished to know life and its purposes were fulfilled rounded complete without a flaw they loved and were togethertogether not for a transitory moment but for the whole duration of the eternity of love which never could be exhausted in their hearts after more than an hour spent in gradually becoming acquainted and familiar with the transporting change from separate loneliness to mutual society and sympathy the goodnatured face of mrs derham showed itself to announce that ethels supper was ready these words brought back to edwards recollection his wifes journey and consequent fatigues he grew more desirous than mrs derham to feed his poor famished bird whose eyes in spite of the joy that shone in them began to look languid and whose cheek was pale the little suppertable was laid and they sat down together lady mary wortley montagu has recorded the pleasure to be reaped when we meet with champagne and a chicken at last and perhaps social life contains no combination so full of enjoyment as a ttette supper here it was with its highest zest they feared no prying eyesthey knew no ill it was not a scanty hour of joy snatched from an age of paina single spark illuminating a long blank night it came after separation and possessed therefore the charm of novelty but it was the prelude to a long reunionthe seal set on their being once again joined to go through together each hour of the livelong day full of unutterable thankfulness and gladness as were the minds of each there was besides a sacred and homefelt delight a sober certainty of waking bliss which is the crown and fulfilment of perfect human happiness imparadised by each others presenceno doubtno fear of division on the morrowno dread of untoward event suspicion or blame clouded the balmy atmosphere which their hearts created around them no eden was required to enhance their happiness there needed no crisped brooks rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold no happy rural seat with various view decked with flowers of all hue all trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste nor cool recess nor vernal airs breathing the smell of field and grove in their narrow abodetheir nook of a room cut off from the world redolent only of smoke and fogtheir two fond hearts could build up bowers of delight and store them with all of ecstasy which the soul of man can know without any assistance of eye or ear or scent so rich and prodigal and glorious in its gifts is faithful and truehearted lovewhen it knows the sacrifices which it must make to merit them and consents willingly to forego vanity selfishness and the exactions of selfwill in unlimited and unregretted exchange mutual esteem and gratitude sanctified the unreserved sympathy which made each so happy in the other did they love the less for not loving in sin and fear far from it the certainty of being the cause of good to each other tended to foster the most delicate of all passions more than the rougher ministrations of terror and a knowledge that each was the occasion of injury to the other a womans heart is peculiarly unfitted to sustain this conflict her sensibility gives keenness to her imagination and she magnifies every peril and writhes beneath every sacrifice which tends to humiliate her in her own eyes the natural pride of her sex struggles with her desire to confer happiness and her peace is wrecked far different was the happy ethels situationfar otherwise were her thoughts employed than in concealing the pangs of care and shame the sense of right adorned the devotion of love she read approbation in edwards eyes and drew near him in full consciousness of deserving it they sat at their supper and long after by the cheerful fire talking of a thousand things connected with the present and the futurethe long long future which they were to spend together and every now and then their eyes sparkled with the gladness of renewed delight in seeing each other mine my own for everand was this exultation in possession to be termed selfish by no other reasoning surely than that used by a cold and meaningless philosophy which gives this name to generosity and truth and all the nobler passions of the soul they congratulated themselves on this mutual property partly because it had been a free gift one to the other partly because they looked forward to the right it ensured to each of conferring mutual benefits and partly through the instinctive love god has implanted for that which being ours is become the better part of ourselves they were united for better and worse and there was a sacredness in the thought of the worse they might share which gave a mysterious and celestial charm to the present better chapter xvii do you not think yourself truly happy you have the abstract of all sweetness by you the precious wealth youth labours to arrive at nor is she less in honour than in beauty beaumont and fletcher the following day was one of pouring unintermitting rain villiers and ethel drew their chairs near their cheerful fire and were happy edward could not quite conquer his repugnance to seeing his wife in lodgings and in those also of so mean and narrow a description but the spirit of ethel was more disencumbered of earthly particles that had found its rest in the very home of love the rosy light of the divinity invested all things for her cleopatra on the cydnus in the bark which like a burnished throne burnt on the water borne along by purple sails so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them was not more gorgeously attended than ethel was to her own fancy lapped and cradled in all that love has of tender voluptuous and confiding several days past before villiers could withdraw her from this blissful dream to gaze upon the world as it was he could not make her disgusted with her fortunes nor her abode but he awakened anxiety on his own account his father as he had conjectured was gone to paris leaving merely a message for his son that he would willingly join him in any act for raising money by mortgage or the absolute disposal of a part of the estate edward had consulted with his solicitor who was to look over a vast variety of papers to discover the most eligible mode of making some kind of sale delay in all its various shapes waited on these arrangements and villiers was very averse to leaving town till he held some clue to the labyrinth of obstacles which presented themselves at every turn he talked of their taking a house in town but ethel would not hear of such extravagance in the first place their actual means were at a very low ebb with little hope of a speedy supply there was another circumstance the annoyance of which he understood far better than ethel could he had raised money on annuities the interest of which he was totally unable to pay this exposed him to a personal risk of the most disagreeable kind and he knew that his chief creditor was on the point of resorting to harsh measures against him these things dingyvisaged dirtyhanded realities as they were made a strange contrast with ethels feeling of serene and elevated bliss but she with unshrinking heart brought the same fortitude and love into the crooked and sordid ways of modern london which had adorned heroines of old as they wandered amidst trackless forests and over barren mountains several days passed and the weather became clear though cold the young pair walked together in the parks at such morning hours as would prevent their meeting any acquaintances for edward was desirous that it should not be known that they were in town villiers also traced his daily weary disappointing way to his solicitor where he found things look more blank and dismal each day then when evening came and the curtains were drawn they might have been at the top of mount caucasus instead of in the centre of london so completely were they cut off from every thing except each other they then felt absolutely happy the lingering disgusts of edward were washed clean away by the bounteous everspringing love that flowed as waters from a fountain from the heart of ethel in one perpetual tide in those hours of unchecked talk she learned many things she had not known beforethe love of horatio saville for lady lodore was revealed to her but the story was not truly told for the prejudices as well as the ignorance of villiers rendered him blind to the sincerity of cornelias affection and regret ethel wondered and in spite of the charm with which she delighted to invest the image of her mother she could not help agreeing with her husband that she must be irrevocably wedded to the most despicable worldly feelings so to have played with the heart of a man such as horatio a man whose simplest word bore the stamp of truth and genius one of those elected few whom nature elevats to her own high list of nobility and greatness how could she a simple girl interest feelings which were not alive to savilles merits she could only hope that in some dazzling marriage lady lodore would find a compensation for the higher destiny which might have been hers but that like the base indian she had thrown a pearl away richer than all his tribe there was a peaceful quiet in their secluded and obscure life which somewhat resembled the hours spent on board ship when you long for yet fear the conclusion of the voyage and shrink involuntarily from exchanging a state whose chief blessing is an absence of every care for the variety of pains and pleasures which chequer life ethel possessed her allso near so undivided so entirely her own that she could not enter into villierss impatience nor quite sympathize with the disquietude he could not repress after considerable delays his solicitor informed him that his father had so entirely disposed of all his interest in the property that his readiness to join in any act of sale would be useless the next thing to be done was for edward to sell a part of his expectations and the lawyer promised to find a purchaser and begged to see him three days hence when no doubt he should have some proposal to communicate whoever has known what such things arewhoever has waited on the demurs and objections and suffered the alternations of total failure and suddenly renewed hopes which are the tantalusfood held to the lips of those under the circumstances of villiers can follow in imagination his various conferences with his solicitor as day after day something new was discovered still to drag on or to impede the tortoise pace of his negociations it will be no matter of wonder to such that a month instead of three days wasted away and found him precisely in the same position with hopes a little raised though so frequently blasted and nothing done in recording the annoyances or rather the adversity which the young pair endured at this period a risk is run on the one hand of being censured for bringing the reader into contact with degrading and sordid miseries and on the other of laying too much stress on circumstances which will appear to those in a lower sphere of life as scarcely deserving the name of misfortune it is very easy to embark on the wild ocean of romance and to steer a dangerfraught passage amidst giant perilsthe very words employed excite the imagination and give grace to the narrative but all beautiful and fairylike as was ethel villiers in tracing her fortunes it is necessary to descend from such altitudes to employ terms of vulgar use and to describe scenes of commonplace and debasing interest so that if she herself in her youth and feminine tenderness does not shed light and holiness around her we shall grope darkling and fail utterly in the scope which we proposed to ourselves in selecting her history for the entertainment of the reader chapter xviii i saw her upon nearer view a spirit yet a woman too a creature not too bright or good for human natures daily food for transient sorrows simple wiles praise blame love kisses tears and smiles wordsworth the end of december had come new years day found and left them still in duke street on the th of january villiers received a letter from his uncle lord maristow entrusting a commission to him which obliged him to go to the neighbourhood of egham not having a horse he went by the stage he set out so late in the day that there was no chance of his returning the same night and he promised to be back early on the morrow ethel had letters to write to italy and to her aunt and with these she tried to beguile the time she felt lonely the absence of villiers for so many hours engendered an anxiety which she found some difficulty in repressing accustomed to have him perpetually at her side and without any other companion or resource she repined at her solitude there was his empty chair and no hope that he would occupy it and she sat in her little room so near to thousands and yet so cut off from every one with such a sense of desolation as mungo park might have felt in central africa or a shipwrecked mariner on an uninhabited island her pen was taken up but she did not write she could not command her thoughts to express any thing but the overflowing devoted allengrossing affection of her heart her adoration for her husband that would not amuse lucyshe thought and she had commenced another sheet with my dearest aunt when the maidservant ushered a man into her presencea stranger a working man what could he want with her he seemed confused and stammered out mr villiers is not in he will be at home tomorrow if you want him or have you any message that i can give you are mrs villiers maam yes my good man i am mrs villiers if you please maam i am saunders one of the porters at the union club i remember has any message come there or does mr villiers owe you any money and her purse was in her hand o no maam mr villiers is a good gentleman and he has been petiklar generous to meand that is why i come because i am afraid continued the man lowering his tone that he is in danger good heavens where how cried ethel starting from her chair tell me at once yes maam i will so you must know that this evening yes this evening what has happened he left me at six oclockwhat is it nothing i hope this evening maam i am only afraid for tomorrow morning and i will tell you all i know as quick as ever i can the man then proceeded to relate that some one had been inquiring about mr villiers at the club house one of the servants had told him that he lived in duke street st jamess and that was all he knew but saunders came up and the man questioned him he instantly recognized the fellow and knew what his business must be and he tried to deceive him and declared that mr villiers was gone out of town but the fellow said that he knew better than that and that he had been seen that very day in the strand he should look for him no thanks to saunders in duke street and so maam you see theyll be sure to be here early tomorrow morning so dont let mr villiers stay here on no account whatsomever why asked ethel simply they cant hurt him i am sure maam said saunders his face brightening i am very glad to hear thatyou know best they will arrest him for sure but arrest him yes maam for ive seen the tall one before there were two of thembailiffs ethel now began to tremble violently these were strange cabalistic words to her the more awful from their mystery what am i to do she exclaimed mr villiers will be here in the morning he sleeps at egham and will be here early i must go to him directly i am glad to hear he is so far said saunders and if i can be of any use you have but to say it shall i go to egham there are night coaches that go through and i might warn him ethel thoughtshe feared to do any thingshe imagined that she should be watched that all her endeavours would be of no avail she looked at the man honesty was written on his face but there was no intelligence nothing to tell her that his advice was good the possibility of such an event as the present had never occurred to her villiers had been silent with regard to his fears on this head she was suddenly transported into a strange sea hemmed in by danger without a pilot or knowledge of a passage again she looked at the mans face what is best to be done she exclaimed i am sure maam he replied as if she had asked him the question i think what i said is best if you will tell me where i can find mr villiers i should think nothing of going and he could send word by me what he wished you to do yes that would indeed be a comfort i will write three lines and you shall take them in a moment she had written give this note into his own hand he will sleep therei have written the direction of the houseor at some inn at egham do not rest till you have given the letter and here is for your trouble she held out two sovereigns depend on me maam and i will bring an answer to you by nine in the morning mr villiers will pay me what he thinks fityou may want your money only maam dont be frightened when them men come tomorrowif the people here are good sort of folks you had better give them a hintit may save you trouble thank you you are a good man and i will remember you and reward you by nine tomorrowyou will be punctual the man again assured her that he would use all diligence and took his leave ethel felt totally overwhelmed by these tidings the unknown is always terrible and the ideas of arrest and prison and bolts and bars and straw floated before her imagination was villiers safe even where he was would not the men make inquiries learn where he had gone and follow him even if it were to the end of the world she had heard of the activity employed to arrest criminals and mingled every kind of story in her head till she grew desperate from terror not knowing what else to do she became eager for mrs derhams advice and hurried down stairs to ask it she had not seen much of the good lady since her first arrival every day when villiers went out she came up indeed on the momentous question of orders for dinner and then she bestowed the benefit of some five or ten minutes garrulity on her fair lodger ethel learnt that she had seen better days and that were justice done her she ought to be riding in her coach instead of letting lodgings she learnt that she had a married daughter living at kennington poor enough but struggling on cheerfully with her mothers help the best girl in the world she was and a jewel of a wife and had two of the most beautiful children that ever were beheld this was all that ethel knew except that once mrs derham had brought her one of her grandchildren to be seen and admired in all that the good woman said there was so much kindness such a cheerful endurance of the ills of life and she had shown such a readiness to oblige that the idea of applying to her for advice relieved ethels mind of much of its load of anxiety she was too much agitated to think of ringing for the servant to ask to see her but hurried down stairs and knocked at the parlourdoor almost before she was aware of what she was doing come in said a feminine voice ethel entered and started to see one she knewand yet again she doubtedwas it indeed fanny derham whom she beheld the recognition afforded mutual pleasure checked a little on ethels part by her anxieties and on fannys by a feeling that she had been neglected by her friend a few letters had passed between them when first ethel had visited longfield since then their correspondence had been discontinued till after her return to england from italy when mrs villiers had wrote but her letter was returned by the postoffice no such person being to be found according to the address the embarrassment of the moment passed away ethel forgot or rather did not advert to her friends lowly destiny in the joy of meeting her again after a minute or two also they had become familiar with the change that time had operated in their youthful appearance which was not much and most in ethel her marriage and conversance with the world had changed her into a woman and endowed her with easy manners and selfpossession fanny was still a mere girl tall beyond the middle height yet her young ingenuous countenance was unaltered as well as that singular mixture of mildness and independence in her manners which had always characterized her her light blue eyes beamed with intelligence and her smile expressed the complacency and condescension of a superior being her beauty was all intellectual open sincere passionless yet benignant you approached her without fear of encountering any of the baser qualities of human beingstheir hypocrisy or selfishness those who have seen the paintings of the calmvisaged blueeyed deities of the frescos of pompeii may form an idea of the serene beauty of fanny derham when mrs villiers entered she was reading earnestlya large dictionary open before her the book on which she was intent was in greek characters you have not forgotten your old pursuits said ethel smiling say rather i am more wedded to them than ever she replied since more than ever i need them to give light and glory to a dingy world but you dear ethel if so i may call youyou looked anxious as you entered you wish to speak to my mothershe is gone to kennington and will not return tonight can i be of any use her mother how strange and mrs derham while she had dilated with pride on her elder daughter had never mentioned this pearl of price which was hers also alas i fear not replied ethel it is experience i needexperience in things you can know nothing about nor your mother either probably yet she may have heard of such things and know how to advise me mrs villiers then explained the sources of her disquietude fanny listened with looks of the kindest sympathy even in such things she said i have had experience adversity and i are become very close friends since i last saw you we are intimate and i know much good of her so she is grateful and repays me by prolonging her stay be composed no ill will happen i trust to mr villiersat least you need not be afraid of his being pursued it the man you have sent be active and faithful all will be well i will see these troublesome people tomorrow when they come and prevent your being annoyed if saunders returns early and brings tidings of mr villiers you will know what his wishes are you can do nothing more tonight and there is every probability that all will be well do you really think so cried mrs villiers o that i had gone with himnever will i again let him go any where without me fanny entered into more minute explanations and succeeded to a great degree in calming her friend she accompanied her back to her own room and sat with her long she entered into the details of her own historythe illness and death of her father the insulting treatment her mother had met from his family the kindness of a relation of her own who had assisted them and enabled them to pursue their present mode of life which procured them a livelihood fanny spoke generally of these circumstances and in a spirit that seemed to disdain that such things were not because they were degrading in the eyes of others but because they interfered with the philosophic leisure and enjoyment of nature which she so dearly prized she thought nothing of privation or the worlds impertinence but much of being immured in the midst of london and being forced to consider the inglorious necessities of life her desire to be useful to her mother induced her often to spend precious time in making the best of things which she would readily have dispensed with altogether as the easiest as well as the wisest way of freeing herself from their trammels her narration interested ethel and served to calm her mind she thoughtcan i not bear those cares with equanimity for edwards sake which fanny regards as so trivial merely because plato and epictetus bid her do so will not the good god who has implanted in her heart so cheerless a consolation bring comfort to mine which has no sorrow but for anothers sake these reflections tranquillized her when she laid her head on her pillow at night she resigned her being and destiny to a power superior to any earthly authority with a conviction that its most benign influence would be extended over her end of vol ii
