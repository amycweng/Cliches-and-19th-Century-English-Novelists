of this tale took place in a little village on the southern coast of cornwall treby by that name we choose to designate a spot whose true one for several reasons will not be given was indeed rather a hamlet than a village although being at the seaside there were two or three houses which by dint of green paint and chints curtains pretended to give the accommodation of apartments furnished to the few bathers who having heard of its cheapness seclusion and beauty now and then resorted thither from the neighbouring towns this part of cornwall shares much of the peculiar and exquisite beauty which every englishman knows adorns the sweet shire of devon the hedges near treby like those round dawlish and torquay are redolent with a thousand flowers the neighbouring fields are pranked with all the colours of flora its soft air the picturesque bay in which it stood as it were enshrined its red cliff's and verdure reaching to the very verge of the tide all breathe the same festive and genial atmosphere the cottages give the same promise of comfort and are adorned by nature with more luxurious loveliness than the villas of the rich in a less happy climate treby was almost unknown yet whoever visited it might well prefer its sequestered beauties to many more renowned competitors situated in the depths of a little bay it was sheltered on all sides by the cliffs just behind the hamlet the cliff made a break forming a little ravine in the depth of which ran a clear stream on whose banks were spread the orchards of the villagers whence they derived their chief wealth tangled bushes and luxuriant herbage diversified the cliffs some of which were crowned by woods and in every nook and coign of 'vantage were to be seen and scented the glory of that coast its exhaustless store of flowers the village was as has been said in the depth of a bay towards the east the coast rounded off with a broad sweep forming a varied line of bay and headland to the west a little promontory shot out abruptly and at once closed in the view this point of land was the peculiarity of treby the cliff that gave it its picturesque appearance was not high but was remarkable for being crowned by the village church with its slender spire long may it be before the village churchyard ceases to be in england a favoured spot the home of rural and holy seclusion at treby it derived a new beauty from its distance from the village and the eminence on which it was placed overlooking the wide ocean the sands the village itself with its gardens orchards and gayly painted fields from the church a straggling steep yet not impracticable path led down to the sands by way of the beach indeed the distance from the village to the church was scarcely more than half a mile but no vehicle could approach except by the higher road which following the line of coast measured nearly two miles the edifice itself picturesque in its rustic simplicity seemed at the distance to be imbosomed in a neighbouring grove there was no house nor even cottage near the contiguous churchyard contained about two acres a light white paling surrounded it on three sides on the fourth was a high wall clothed thickly with ivy the trees of the near wood overhung both wall and paling except on the side of the cliff' the waving of their branches the murmur of the tide and the occasional scream of seafowl were all the sounds that disturbed or rather harmonized with the repose and solitude of the spot on sunday the inhabitants of several hamlets congregated here to attend divine service those of treby usually approached by the beach and the path of the cliff the old and infirm only taking the longer but more easy road on every other day of the week all was quiet except when the hallowed precincts were visited by happy parents with a newborn babe by bride and bridegroom hastening all gladly to enter on the joys and cares of life or by the train of mourners who attended relation or friend to the last repose of the dead the poor are not sentimental and except on sunday after evening service when a mother might linger for a few moments near the fresh grave of a lately lost child or loitering among the rustic tombs some of the elder peasants told tales of the feats of the dead companions of their youth a race unequalled so they said by the generation around them save on that day none ever visited or wandered among the graves with the one exception of a child who had early learned to mourn yet whose infantine mind could scarcely understand the extent of the cause she had for tears a little girl unnoticed and alone was wont each evening to trip over the sands to scale with light steps the cliff which was of no gigantic height and then unlatching the low white gate of the churchyard to repair to one corner where the boughs of the near trees shadowed over two graves two graves of which one only was distinguished by a simple headstone to commemorate the name of him who mouldered beneath this tomb was inscribed to the memory of edwin raby but the neighbouring and less honoured grave claimed more of the child's attention for her mother lay beneath the unrecorded turf beside this grassy hillock she would sit and talk to herself and play till warned home by the twilight she knelt and said her little prayer and with a good night mamma took leave of a spot with which was associated the being whose caresses and love she called to mind hoping that one day she might again enjoy them her appearance had much in it to invite remark had there been any who cared to notice a poor little orphan her dress in some of its parts betokened that she belonged to the better classes of society but she had no stockings and her little feet peeped from the holes of her well worn shoes her straw bonnet was died dark with sun and sea spray and its blue riband faded the child herself would in any other spot have attracted more attention than the incongruities of her attire there is an expression of face which we name angelic from its purity its tenderness and so to speak plaintive serenity which we oftener see in young children than in persons of a more advanced age and such was hers her hair of a light golden brown was parted over a brow fair and open as day her eyes deep set and earnest were full of thought and tenderness her complexion was pure and stainless except by the roses that glowed in her cheek while each vein could be traced on her temples and you could almost mark the flow of the violet coloured blood beneath her mouth was the very nest of love her serious look was at once fond and imploring but when she smiled it was as if sunshine broke out at once warm and unclouded her figure had the plumpness of infancy but her tiny hands and feet and tapering waist denoted the faultless perfection of her form she was about six years old a friendless orphan cast thus young penniless on a thorny stony hearted world nearly two years previous a gentleman with his wife and little daughter arrived at treby and took up his abode at one of the moderate priced lodging houses before mentioned the occasion of their visit was but too evident the husband mr raby was dying of a consumption the family had migrated early in september so to receive the full benefit of a mild winter in this favoured spot it did not appear to those about him that he could live to see that winter he was wasted to a shadow the hectic in his cheek the brightness of his eyes and the debility apparent in every movement showed that disease was triumphing over the principles of life yet contrary to every prognostic he lived on from week to week from month to month now he was said to be better now worse and thus a winter of extraordinary mildness was passed but with the east winds of spring a great deterioration was visible his invalid walks in the sun grew shorter and then were exchanged for a few minutes passed sitting in his garden soon he was confined to his room then to his bed during the first week of a bleak ungenial may he died the extreme affection that subsisted between the pair rendered his widow an object of interest even to the villagers they were both young and she was beautiful and more beautiful was their offspring the little girl we have mentioned who watched over and attended on by her mother attracted admiration as well as interest by the peculiar style of her childish yet perfect loveliness every one wondered what the bereaved lady would do and she poor soul wondered herself and would sit watching the gambols of her child in an attitude of unutterable despondency till the little girl remarking the sadness of her mother gave over playing to caress and kiss her and to bid her smile at such a word the tears fell fast from the widow's eyes and the frightened child joined her sobs and cries to hers whatever might be the sorrows and difficulties of the unhappy lady it was soon evident to all but herself that her own life was a fragile tenure she had attended on her husband with unwearied assiduity and added to bodily fatigue was mental suffering partly arising from anxiety and grief and partly from the very virtues of the sufferer he knew that he was dying and tried to reconcile his wife to her anticipated loss but his words breathing the most passionate love and purest piety seemed almost to call her also from the desolation to which he was leaving her and to dissolve the ties that held her to earth when he was gone life possessed no one attraction except their child often while her father with pathetic eloquence tried to pour the balm of resignation and hopes of eternal reunion into his wife's heart she had sat on her mother's knee or on a little stool at her feet and looked up with her cherub face a little perplexed a little fearful till at some words of too plain and too dread an import she sprung into her father's arms and clinging to his neck amid tears and sobs cried out you must not leave us papa you must stay you shall not go away consumption in all countries except our own is considered a contagious disorder and it too often proves such here during her close attendance mrs raby had imbibed the seeds of the fatal malady and grief and a delicate texture of nerves caused them to develop with alarming rapidity every one perceived this except herself she thought that her indisposition sprung from over fatigue and grief but that repose would soon restore her and each day as her flesh wasted and her blood flowed more rapidly she said i shall be better to morrow there was no one at treby to advise or assist her she was not one of those who make friends and intimates of all who fall in their way she was gentle considerate courteous but her refined mind shrunk from displaying its deep wounds to the vulgar and unfeeling after her husband's death she had written several letters which she carefully put into the postoffice herself going on purpose to the nearest post town three miles distant she had received one in answer and it had the effect of increasing every fatal symptom through the anguish and excessive agitation it excited sometimes she talked of leaving treby but she delayed till she should be better which time the villagers plainly saw would never come but they were not aware how awfully near the crisis really was one morning her husband had now been dead about four months she called up the woman of the house in which she lodged there was a smile on her face and a pink spot burnt brightly in either cheek while her brow was ashy pale there was something ghastly in the very gladness her countenance expressed yet she felt nothing of all this but said the newspaper you lent me had good news in it mrs baker it tells me that a dear friend of mine is arrived in england whom i thought still on the continent i am going to write to her will you let your daughter take my little girl a walk while i write mrs baker consented the child was equipped and sent out while her mother sat down to write in about an hour she came out of her parlour mrs baker saw her going towards the garden she tottered as she walked so the woman hastened to her thank you she said i feel strangely faint i had much to say and that letter has unhinged me i must finish it to morrow now the air will restore me i can scarcely breathe mrs baker offered her arm the sufferer walked faintly and feebly to a little bench and sitting down supported herself by her companion her breath grew shorter she murmured some words mrs baker bent down but could catch only the name of her child which was the last sound that hovered on the mother's lips with one sigh her heart ceased to beat and life left her exhausted frame the poor woman screamed loudly for help as she felt her press heavily against her and then sliding from her seat sink lifeless on the ground chapter ii it was to mrs baker's credit that she did not attempt to investigate the affairs of her hapless lodger till after the funeral a purse containing twelve guineas which she found on her table served indeed to satisfy her that she would be no immediate loser however as soon as the sod covered the gentle form of the unfortunate lady she proceeded to examine her papers the first that presented itself was the unfinished letter which mrs raby was engaged in writing at the time of her death this promised information and mrs baker read it with eagerness it was as follows my dearest friend a newspaper has just informed me that you are returned to england while i still believed you to be i know not where on the continent dearest girl it is long since i have written for i have been too sad too uncertain about your movements and too unwilling to cloud your happiness by forcing you to remember one so miserable my beloved friend my schoolfellow my benefactress you will grieve to hear of my misfortunes and it is selfish in me even now to intrude upon you with the tale but under heaven i have no hope except in my generous my warm hearted alithea perhaps you have already heard of my disaster and are aware that death has robbed me of the happiness which under your kind fosterage i had acquired and enjoyed he is dead who was my all in this world and but for one tie i should bless the day when i might be permitted to rest for ever beside him i often wonder dear alithea at the heedlessness and want of foresight with which i entered life doomed through poverty and my orphan state to earn my bread as a governess my entrance on that irksome task was only delayed by my visit to you then under your dear roof i saw and was beloved by edwin and his entreaties and your encouragement permitted my trembling heart to dream of to possess happiness timidity of character made me shrink from my career diffidence never allowed me to suppose that any one would interest themselves enough in me to raise the poor trembler from the ground to shelter and protect her and this kind of despondency rendered edwin's love a new glorious and divine joy yet when i thought of his parents i trembled i could not bear to enter a family where i was to be regarded as an unwelcome intruder yet edwin was already an outcast already father and brothers every relation had disowned him and he like i was alone and you alithea how fondly how sweetly did you encourage me making that appear my duty which was the fulfilment of my wildest dreams of joy surely no being ever felt friendship as you have done sympathizing even in the untold secrets of a timid heart enjoying the happiness that you conferred with an ardour few can feel even for themselves your transports of delight when you saw me through your means blessed touched me with a gratitude that can never die and do i show this by asking now for your pity and saddening you by my grief pardon me sweet friend and do not wonder that this thought has long delayed my letter we were happy poor but content poverty was no evil to me and edwin supported every privation as if he had never been accustomed to luxury the spirit that had caused him to shake off the shackles his bigoted family threw over him animated him to exertions beyond his strength he had chosen for himself he wished to prove that his choice was good i do not allude to our marriage but to his desertion of the family religion and determination to follow a career not permitted by the policy of his relations to any younger son he was called to the bar he toiled incessantly he was ambitious and his talents gave every promise of success he is gone gone for ever i have lost the noblest wisest friend that ever breathed the most devoted lover and truest husband that ever blessed woman i write incoherently you know what our life in london was obscure but happy the scanty pittance allowed him seemed to me amply to suffice for all our wants i only then knew of the wants of youth and health which were love and sympathy i had all this crowning to the brim my cup of life the birth of our sweet child filled it to overflowing our dingy lodgings near the courts of law were a palace to me i should have despised myself heartily could i have desired anything beyond what i possessed i never did nor did i fear its loss i was grateful to heaven and thus i fancied that i paid the debt of my unmeasured prosperity can i say what i felt when i marked edwin's restless nights flushed cheek and the cough that would not go away these things i dare not dwell upon my tears overflow my heart beats to bursting the fatal truth was at last declared the fatal word consumption spoken change of air was all the hope held out we came here the churchyard near holds now all earthly that remains of him would that my dust were mingling with his yet i have a child my alithea and you who are incomparable as a mother will feel that i ought not to grieve so bitterly while this dear angel remains to me i know indeed that without her life would at once suspend all its functions why then is it that while she is with me i am not stronger more heroic for to keep her with me i must leave the indolence of my present life i must earn the bread of both i should not repine at this i shall not when i am better but i am very ill and weak and though each day i rise resolving to exert myself before the morning has passed away i lie down exhausted trembling and faint when i lost edwin i wrote to mr raby acquainting him with the sad intelligence and asking for a maintenance for myself and my child the family solicitor answered my letter edwin's conduct had i was told estranged his family from him and they could only regard me as one encouraging his disobedience and apostacy i had no claim on them if my child were sent to them and i would promise to abstain from all intercourse with her she should be brought up with her cousins and treated in all respects like one of the family i answered this letter hastily and proudly i declined their barbarous offer and haughtily and in few words relinquished every claim on their bounty declaring my intention to support and bring up my child myself this was foolishly done i fear but i cannot regret it even now i cannot regret the impulse that made me disdain these unnatural and cruel relatives or that led me to take my poor orphan to my heart with pride as being all my own what had they done to merit such a treasure how did they show themselves capable of replacing a fond and anxious mother how many blooming girls have they sacrificed to their peculiar views with what careless eyes they regard the sweetest emotions of nature never shall my adored girl be made the victim of that loveless race do you remember our sweet child she was lovely from her birth and surely if ever angel assumed an earthly vesture it took a form like my darling her loveliness expresses only the beauty of her disposition so young yet so full of sensibility her temper is without a flaw and her intelligence transcends her age you will not laugh at me for my maternal enthusiasm nor will you wonder at it her endearing caresses her cherub smiles the silver accents of her infantine voice fill me with trembling rapture is she not too good for this bad world i fear it i fear to lose her i fear to die and to leave her yet if i should will you not cherish will you not be a mother to her i may be presumptuous but if i were to die even now i should die in the belief that i left my child another mother in you the letter broke off here and these were the last words of the unfortunate writer it contained a sad but too common story of the hard heartedness of the wealthy and the misery endured by the children of the high born blood is not water it is said but gold with them is dearer far than the ties of nature to keep and augment their possessions being the aim and end of their lives the existence and more especially the happiness of their children appears to them a consideration at once trivial and impertinent when it would compete with family views and family greatness to this common and iniquitous feeling these luckless beings were sacrificed they had endured the worst and could be injured no more but their orphan child was a living victim less thought of than the progeny of the meanest animal which might serve to augment their possessions mrs baker felt some complacency on reading this letter with the common english respect for wealth and rank she was glad to find that her humble roof had sheltered a man who was the son she did not exactly know of whom but of somebody who had younger sons and elder sons and possessed through wealth the power of behaving frightfully ill to a vast number of persons there was a grandeur and dignity in the very idea but the good woman felt less satisfaction as she proceeded in her operations no other letter or paper appeared to inform or to direct every letter had been destroyed and the young pair had brought no papers or documents with them she could not guess to whom the unfinished letter she held was addressed all was darkness and ignorance she was aghast there was none to whom to apply none to whom to send the orphan in a more busy part of the world an advertisement in the newspapers would have presented itself as a resource but treby was too much cut off from the rest of the world for its inhabitants to conceive so daring an idea and mrs baker repining much at the burden fallen upon her and fearful of the future could imagine no means by which to discover the relations of the little orphan and her only notion was to wait in hopes that some among them would at last make inquiries concerning her nearly a year had passed away and no one had appeared the unfortunate lady's purse was soon emptied and her watch with one or two trinkets of slight value disposed of the child was of small cost but still her sordid protectress harped perpetually on her ill luck she had a family of her own and plenty of mouths to feed missy was but little but she would get bigger though for that matter it was worse now as she wanted more taking care of besides she was getting quite a disgrace her bonnet was so shabby and her shoes worn out and how could she afford to buy others for one who was not a bit of her flesh and blood to the evident hurt of her own children it was bad enough now but by and by she saw nothing but the parish though missy was born for better than that and her poor mamma would turn in her grave at the name of such a thing for her part she was to blame she feared and too generous but she would wait yet a little longer before it came to that for who could tell and here mrs baker's prudence dammed up the stream of her eloquence to no living ear did she dare trust her dream of the coach and six that might one day come for her little charge and the remuneration and presents that would be heaped upon her she actually saved the child's best frock though she had quite outgrown it that on such a day her appearance might do her honour but this was a secret she hid these vague but splendid images deep in her heart lest some neighbour might be seized with a noble emulation and through some artifice share in her dreamy gains it was these anticipations that prevented mrs baker from taking any decisive step injurious to her charge but they did not shed any rosy hues over her diurnal complaints they grew more peevish and frequent as time passed away and her visions attained no realization the little orphan grew meanwhile as a garden rose that accident has thrown amid briers and weeds blooming with alien beauty and unfolding its soft petals and shedding its ambrosial odour beneath the airs of heaven unharmed by its strange position lovely as a day of paradise which by some strange chance visits this nether world to gladden every heart she charmed even her selfish protectress and despite her shabby attire her cherub smiles the free and noble steps which her tiny feet could take even now and the music of her voice rendered her the object of respect and admiration as well as love to the whole village the loss of her father had acquainted the poor child with death her mother had explained the awful mystery as well as she could to her infantine intellects and indulging in her own womanish and tender fancies had often spoken of the dead as hovering over and watching around his loved ones even in the new state of existence to which he had been called yet she wept as she spoke he is happy she exclaimed but he is not here why did he leave us ah why desert those who loved him so well who need him so dearly how forlorn and cast away are we without him these scenes made a deep impression upon the sensitive child and when her mother died too and was carried away and placed in the cold earth beside her husband the orphan would sit for hours by the graves now fancying that her mother must soon return now exclaiming why are you gone away come dear mamma come back come quickly young as she was it was no wonder that such thoughts were familiar to her the minds of children are often as intelligent as those of persons of maturer age and differ only by containing fewer ideas but these had so often been presented to her and she so fixed her little heart on the idea that her mother was watching over her that at last it became a part of her religion to visit every evening the two graves and saying her prayers near them to believe that her mother's spirit which was obscurely associated with her mortal remains reposing below listened to and blessed her on that spot at other times neglected as she was and left to wander at will she conned her lesson as she had been accustomed at her mother's feet beside her grave she took her picture books there and even her playthings the villagers were affected by her childish notion of being with mamma and missy became something of an angel in their eyes so that no one interfered with her visits or tried to explain away her fancies she was the nursling of love and nature but the human hearts which could have felt the greatest tenderness for her beat no longer and had become clods of the soil borne round in earth's diurnal course with rocks and stones and trees there was no knee on which she could playfully climb no neck round which she could fondly hang no parent's cheek on which to print her happy kisses these two graves were all of relationship she knew upon the earth and she would kiss the ground and the flowers not one of which she plucked as she sat embracing the sod mamma was everywhere around mamma was there beneath and still she could love and feel herself beloved at other times she played gayly with her young companions in the village and sometimes she fancied that she loved some one among them she made them presents of books and toys the relics of happier days for the desire to benefit which springs up so naturally in a loving heart was strong within her even in that early age but she never took any one with her in her churchyard visits she needed none while she was with mamma once indeed a favourite kitten was carried to the sacred spot and the little animal played amid the grass and flowers and the child joined in its frolics her solitary gay laugh might be heard among the tombs she did not think it solitary mamma was there to smile on her as she sported with her tiny favourite chapter iii towards the end of a hot calm day of june a stranger arrived at treby the variations of calm and wind are always remarkable at the seaside and are more particularly to be noticed on this occasion since it was the stillness of the elements that caused the arrival of the stranger during the whole day several vessels had been observed in the offing lying to for a wind or making small way under press of sail as evening came on the water beyond the bay lay calmer than ever but a slight breeze blew from shore and these vessels principally colliers bore down close under it endeavouring by short tacks to procure a long one and at last to gain searoom to make the eastern headland of the bay the fishermen on shore watched the manuvres of the different craft and even interchanged shouts with the sailors as they lay lazily on the beach at length they were put in motion by a hail for a boat from a small merchantman the call was obeyed the boat neared the vessel a gentleman descended into it his portmanteau was handed after him a few strokes of the oar drove the boat on the beach and the stranger leaped out upon the sands the new comer gave a brief order directing his slight luggage to be carried to the best inn and paying the boatmen liberally strolled away to a more solitary part of the beach a gentleman all the spectators decided him to be and such a designation served for a full description of the new arrival to the villagers of treby but it were better to say a few words to draw him from among a vast multitude who might be similarly named and to bestow individuality on the person in question it would be best so to present his appearance and manner to the mind's eye of the reader that if any met him by chance he might exclaim that is the man yet there is no task more difficult than to convey to another by mere words an image however distinctly it is impressed on our own minds the individual expression and peculiar traits which cause a man to be recognised among ten thousand of his fellow men by one who has known him though so palpable to the eye escape when we would find words whereby to delineate them there was something in the stranger that at once arrested attention a freedom and a command of manner self possession joined to energy it might be difficult to guess his age for his face had been exposed to the bronzing influence of a tropical climate and the smoothness of youth was exchanged for the deeper lines of maturity without anything being as yet taken from the vigour of the limbs or the perfection of those portions of the frame and face which so soon show marks of decay he might have reached the verge of thirty but he could not be older and might be younger his figure was active sinewy and strong upright as a soldier indeed a military air was diffused all over his person he was tall and to a certain degree handsome his dark gray eyes were piercing as an eagle's and his forehead high and expansive though somewhat distorted by various lines that spoke more of passion than thought yet his face was eminently intelligent his mouth rather too large in its proportions yet grew into beauty when he smiled indeed the remarkable trait of his physiognomy was its great variation restless and even fierce the expression was often that of passionate and unquiet thoughts while at other times it was almost bland from the apparent smoothness and graceful undulation of the lines it was singular that when communing only with himself storms appeared to shake his muscles and disfigure the harmony of his countenance and that when he addressed others all was composed full of meaning and yet of repose his complexion naturally of an olive tint had grown red and adust under the influence of climate and often flushed from the inroads of vehement feeling you could not doubt at the instant of seeing him that many singular perhaps tragical incidents were attached to his history but conviction was enforced that he reversed the line of shakspeare and was less sinned against than sinning or at least that he had been the active machinator of his fate not the passive recipient of disappointment and sorrow when he believed himself to be unobserved his face worked with a thousand contending emotions fiery glances shot from his eyes he appeared to wince from sudden anguish to be transported by a rage that changed his beauty into utter deformity was he spoken to all these tokens vanished on the instant dignified calm and even courteous though cold he would persuade those whom he addressed that he was one of themselves and not a being transported by his own passions and actions into a sphere which every other human being would have trembled to approach a superficial observer had pronounced him a good fellow though a little too stately a wise man had been pleased by the intelligence and information he displayed the variety of his powers and the ease with which he brought forward the stores of his intellect to enlighten any topic of discourse an independent and a gallant spirit he surely had what then had touched it with destruction shaken it to ruin and made him while yet so young abhorrent even to himself such is an outline of the stranger of treby and his actions were in conformity with the incongruities of his appearance outwardly unemployed and tranquil inwardly torn by throes of the most tempestuous and agonizing feelings after landing he had strolled away and was soon out of sight nor did he return till night when he looked fatigued and depressed for form's sake or for the sake of the bill at the inn he allowed food to be placed before him but he neither ate nor drank soon he hurried to the solitude of his chamber not to bed he paced the room for some hours but as soon as all was still when his watch and the quiet stars told him that it was midnight he left the house he wandered down to the beach he threw himself upon the sands and then again he started up and strode along the verge of the tide and then sitting down covering his face with his hands remained motionless early dawn found him thus but on the first appearance of a fisherman he left the neighbourhood of the village nor returned till the afternoon and now when food was placed before him he ate like one half famished but after the keen sensation of extreme hunger was satisfied he left the table and retired to his own room taking a case of pistols from his portmanteau he examined the weapons with care and putting them in his pocket walked out upon the sands the sun was fast descending in the sky and he looked with varying glances at it and at the blue sea which slumbered peacefully giving forth scarcely any sound as it receded from the shore now he seemed wistful now impatient now struck by bitterer pangs that caused drops of agony to gather on his brow he spoke no word but these were the thoughts that hovered though unexpressed upon his lips another day another sun oh never never more for me shall day or sun exist coward why fear to die and do i fear no no i fear nothing but this pain this unutterable anguish this image of fell despair if i could feel secure that memory would cease when my brain lies scattered on the earth i should again feel joy before i die yet that is false while i live and memory lives and the knowledge of my crime still creeps through every particle of my frame i have a hell around me even to the last pulsation for ever and for ever i see her lost and dead at my feet i the cause the murderer my death shall atone and yet even in death the curse is on me i cannot give back the breath of life to her sweet pale lips oh fool oh villain haste to the last act linger no more lest you grow mad and fetters and stripes become your fitter punishment than the death you covet yet after a pause his thoughts thus continued not here nor now there must be darkness on the earth before the deed is done hasten and hide thyself oh sun thou wilt never be cursed by the sight of my living form again thus did the transport of passion embrace the universe in its grasp and the very sunlight seemed to have a pulse responsive to his own the bright orb sunk lower and the little western promontory with its crowning spire was thrown into bold relief against the glowing sky as if some new idea were awakened the stranger proceeded along the sands towards the extremity of the headland a short time before unobserved by him the little orphan had tripped along and scaling the cliff had seated herself as usual beside her mother's grave the stranger proceeded slowly and with irregular steps he was waiting till darkness should blind the eyes of day which now appeared to gaze on him with intolerable scrutiny and to read his very soul that sickened and writhed with its burden of sin and sorrow when out of the immediate neighbourhood of the village he threw himself upon a fragment of rock and he could not be said to meditate for that supposes some sort of voluntary action of the mind while to him might be applied the figure of the poet who represented himself as hunted by his own thoughts pursued by memory and torn to pieces as acton by his own hounds a troop of horrid recollections assailed his soul there was no shelter no escape various passions by turns fastened themselves upon him jealousy disappointed love rage fear and last and worst remorse and despair no bodily torture invented by revengeful tyrant could produce agony equal to that which he had worked out for his own mind his better nature and the powers of his intellect served but to sharpen and strike deeper the pangs of unavailing regret fool he had foreseen nothing of all this he had fancied that he could bend the course of fate to his own will and that to desire with energy was to ensure success and to what had the immutable resolve to accomplish his ends brought him she was dead the loveliest and best of created beings torn from the affections and the pleasures of life from her home her child he had seen her stretched dead at his feet he had heaped the earth upon her clay cold form and he the cause he the murderer stung to intolerable anguish by these ideas he felt hastily for his pistols and rising pursued his way evening was closing in yet he could distinguish the winding path of the cliff he ascended opened the little gate and entered the churchyard oh how he envied the dead the guiltless dead who had closed their eyes on this mortal scene surrounded by weeping friends cheered by religious hope all that imaged innocence and repose appeared in his eyes so beautiful and desirable and how could he the criminal hope to rest like one of these a star or two came out in the heavens above and the church spire seemed almost to reach them as it pointed upward the dim silent sea was spread beneath the dead slept around scarcely did the tall grass bend its head to the summer air soft balmy peace possessed the scene with what thrilling sensations of self enjoyment and gratitude to the creator might the mind at ease drink in the tranquil loveliness of such an hour the stranger felt every nerve wakened to fresh anguish his brow contracted convulsively shall i ever die he cried will not the dead reject me he looked round with the natural instinct that leads a human being at the moment of dissolution to withdraw into a cave or corner where least to offend the eyes of the living by the loathsome form of death the ivied wall and paling overhung by trees formed a nook whose shadow at that hour was becoming deep he approached the spot for a moment he stood looking afar he knew not at what and drew forth his pistol cocked it and throwing himself on the grassy mound raised the mouth of the fatal instrument to his forehead oh go away go away from mamma were words that might have met his ear but that every sense was absorbed as he drew the trigger his arm was pulled the ball whizzed harmlessly by his ear but the shock of the sound the unconsciousness that he had been touched at that moment the belief that the mortal wound was given made him fall back and as he himself said afterward he fancied that he had uttered the scream he heard which had indeed proceeded from other lips in a few seconds he recovered himself yet so had he worked up his mind to die so impossible did it appear that his aim should fail him that in those few seconds the earth and all belonging to it had passed away and his first exclamation as he started up was where am i something caught his gaze a little white figure which lay but a few paces distant and two eyes that gleamed on him the horrible thought darted into his head had another instead of himself been the victim and he exclaimed in agony gracious god who are you speak what have i done still more was he horror struck when he saw that it was a little child who lay before him he raised her but her eyes had glared with terror not death she did not speak but she was not wounded and he endeavoured to comfort and reassure her till she a little restored began to cry bitterly and he felt thankfully that her tears were a pledge that the worst consequences of her fright had passed away he lifted her from the ground while she in the midst of her tears tried to get him away from the grave he desecrated the twilight scarcely showed her features but her surpassing fairness her lovely countenance and silken hair so betokened a child of love and care that he was more the surprised to find her alone at that hour in the solitary churchyard he soothed her gently and asked how came you here what could you be doing so late so far from home i came to see mamma to see mamma where how your mother is not here yes she is mamma is there and she pointed with her little finger to the grave the stranger started up there was something awful in this childish simplicity and affection he tried to read the inscription on the stone near he could just make out the name of edwin raby that is not your mother's grave he said no papa is there mamma is here next to him the man just bent on self destruction with a conscience burning him to the heart's core all concentrated in the omnipotence of his own sensations shuddered at the tale of dereliction and misery these words conveyed he looked earnestly on the child and was fascinated by her angel look she spoke with a pretty seriousness shaking her head her lips trembling her large eyes shining in brimming tears my poor child he said your name is raby then mamma used to call me baby she replied they call me missy at home my name is elizabeth well dear elizabeth let me take you home you cannot stay all night with mamma oh no i was just going home when you frightened me you must forget that i will buy you a doll to make it up again and all sorts of toys see here is a pretty thing for you and he took the chain of his watch and threw it over her head he wanted so to distract her attention as to make her forget what had passed and not to tell a shocking story when she got home but she said looking up into his face you will not be so naughty again and sit down where mamma is lying the stranger promised and kissed her and taking her hand they walked together to the village she prattled as she went and he sometimes listened to her stories of mamma and answered and sometimes thought with wonder that he still lived that the ocean's tide still broke at his feet and the stars still shone above he felt angry and impatient at the delay as if it betokened a failing of purpose they walked along the sands and stopped at last at mrs baker's door she was standing at it and exclaimed here you are missy at last what have you been doing with yourself i declare i was quite frightened it is long past your bedtime you must not scold her said the stranger i detained her but why do you let her go out alone it is not right lord sir she replied there is none hereabouts to do her a harm and she would not thank me if i kept her from going to see her mamma as she calls it i have no one to spare to go with her it's hard enough on me to keep her on charity as i do but and her voice changed as a thought flashed across her i beg your pardon sir perhaps you come for missy and know all about her i am sure i have done all i can it's a long time since her mamma died and but for me she must have gone to the parish i hope you will judge that i have done my duty towards her you mistake said the stranger i know nothing of this young lady nor of her parents who it would seem are both dead of course she has other relations that she has and rich ones too replied mrs baker if one could but find them out it's hard upon me who am a widow woman with four children of my own to have other people's upon me very hard sir as you must allow and often i think that i cannot answer it to myself taking the bread from my own children and grandchildren to feed a stranger but to be sure missy has rich relations and some day they will inquire for her though come the tenth of next august and it's a year since her mother died and no one has come to ask good or bad about her or missy her father died also in this village asked the stranger true enough said the woman both father and mother died in this very house and lie up in the churchyard yonder come missy don't cry that's an old story now and it's no use fretting the poor child who had hitherto listened in simple ignorance began to sob at this mention of her parents and the stranger shocked by the woman's unfeeling tone said i should like to hear more of this sad story pray let the poor dear child be put to bed and then if you will relate what you know of her parents i dare say i can give you some advice to enable you to discover her relations and relieve you from the burden of her maintenance these are the first comfortable words i have heard a long time said mrs baker come missy nancy shall put you to bed it's far past your hour don't cry dear this kind gentleman will take you along with him to a fine house among grand folks and all our troubles will be over be pleased sir to step into the parlour and i will show you a letter of the lady and tell you all i know i dare say if you are going to london you will find out that missy ought to be riding in her coach at this very moment this was a golden idea of mrs baker and in truth went a little beyond her anticipations but she had got tired of her first dreams of greatness and feared that in sad truth the little orphan's relations would entirely disown her but it struck her that if she could persuade this strange gentleman that all she said was true he might be induced to take the little girl with him when he went away and undertake the task of restoring her to her father's family by which means she at least would be released from all further care on her account upon this hint she spake she related how mr and mrs raby had arrived with their almost infant child death already streaked the brow of the dying man each day threatened to be his last yet he lived on his sufferings were great and night and day his wife was at his side waiting on him watching each turn of his eye each change of complexion or of pulse they were poor and had only one servant hired at the village soon after their arrival when mrs raby found herself unable to bestow adequate attention on both husband and child yet she did so much as evidently to cause her to sink beneath her too great exertions she was delicate and fragile in appearance but she never owned to being fatigued or relaxed in her attentions her voice was always attuned to cheerfulness her eyes beaming with tenderness she doubtless wept in secret but when conversing with her husband or playing with her child a natural vivacity animated her that looked like hope indeed it was certain that in spite of every fatal symptom she did not wholly despair when her husband declared himself better and resumed for a day his task of instructer to his little girl she believed that his disorder had taken a favourable turn and would say oh mrs baker please god he is really better doctors are not infallible he may live and as she spoke her eyes swam in tears while a smile lay like a sunbeam on her features she did not sink till her husband died and even then struggled both with her grief and the wasting malady already at work within her with a fortitude a mother only could practise for all her exertions were for her dear child and she could smile on her a wintry smile yet sweet as if warmed by seraphic faith and love she lingered thus hovering on the very limits of life and death her heart warm and affectionate and hoping and full of fire to the end for her child's sake while she herself pined for the freedom of the grave and to soar from the cares and sorrows of a sordid world to the heaven already open to receive her in homely phrase mrs baker dwelt upon this touching mixture of maternal tenderness and soft languor that would not mourn for him she was so soon to join the woman then described her sudden death and placed the fragment of her last letter before her auditor deeply interested the stranger began to read when suddenly he became ghastly pale and trembling all over he asked to whom was this letter addressed ah sir replied mrs baker would that i could tell and all my troubles would be over read on sir and you will see that mrs raby feels sure that the lady would have been a mother to poor missy but who or where she is is past all my guessing the stranger strove to read on but violent emotion and the struggle to hide what he felt hindered him from taking in the meaning of a single word at length he told mrs baker that with her leave he would take the letter away and read it at his leisure he promised her his aid in discovering mrs raby's relatives and assured her that there would be small difficulty in so doing he then retired and mrs baker exclaimed please god this will prove a good day's work a voice from the grave had spoken to the stranger it was not the dead mother's voice she whatever her merits and sufferings had been was to him an image of the mind only he had never known her but her benefactress her hope and trust who and where was she alithea the warm hearted friend the incomparable mother she to whom all hearts in distress turned sure of relief who went before the desires of the necessitous whose generous and free spirit made her emperess of all hearts who while she lived spread as does the sun radiance and warmth around her pulses were stilled her powers cribbed up in the grave she was nothing now and he had reduced to this nothing the living frame of this glorious being the stranger read the letter again and again again he writhed as her name appeared traced by her friend's delicate hand and the concluding hope seemed the acme of his despair she would indeed have been a mother to the orphan he remembered expressions that told him that she was making diligent inquiry for her friend whose luckless fate had not reached her yes it was his alithea he could not doubt his fatal mistake his she had never been and the wild resolve to make her such had ended in death and ruin the stranger had taken the letter to his inn but any roof seemed to imprison and oppress him again he sought relief in the open air and wandered far along the sands with the speed of a misery that strove to escape from itself the whole night he spent thus sometimes climbing the jagged cliffs then descending to the beach and throwing himself his length upon the sands the tide ebbed and flowed the roar of ocean filled the lone night with sound the owl flapped down from its home in the rock and hooted hour after hour passed and driven by a thousand thoughts tormented by the direst pangs of memory still the stranger hurried along the winding shores morning found him many miles from treby he did not stop till the appearance of another village put a limit to solitude and he returned upon his steps those who could guess his crime could alone divine the combat of life and death waging in his heart he had through accident and forgetfulness left his pistols on the table of his chamber at the inn or in some of the wildest of the paroxysms of despair they had ended all to die he fondly hoped was to destroy memory and to defeat remorse and yet there arose within his mind that feeling mysterious and inexplicable to common reason which generates a desire to expiate and to atone should he be the cause of good to the friendless orphan bequeathed so vainly to his victim would not that in some sort compensate for his crime would it not double it to have destroyed her and also the good of which she would have been the author the very finger of god pointed to this act since the child's little hand had arrested his arm at the fatal moment when he believed that no interval of a second's duration intervened between him and the grave then to aid those dim religious misgivings came the manly wish to protect the oppressed and assist the helpless the struggle was long and terrible now he made up his mind that it was cowardice to postpone his resolve that to live was to stamp himself poltron and traitor and now again he felt that the true cowardice was to die to fly from the consequences of his actions and the burden of existence he gazed upon the dim waste of waters as if from its misty skirt some vision would arise to guide or to command he cast his eyes upward to interrogate the silent stars the roaring of the tide appeared to assume an inorganic voice and to murmur hoarsely live miserable wretch dare you hope for the repose which your victim enjoys know that the guilty are unworthy to die that is the reward of innocence the cool air of morning chilled his brow and the broad sun arose from the eastern sea as pale and haggard he retrod many a weary step towards treby he was faint and weary he had resolved to live yet a little longer till he had fulfilled some portion of his duty towards the lovely orphan so resolving he felt as if he paid a part of the penalty due a soothing feeling which resembled repentance stole over his heart already rewarding him how swiftly and audibly does the inner voice of our nature speak telling us when we do right besides he believed that to live was to suffer to live therefore was in him a virtue and the exultation the balmy intoxication which always follows our first attempt to execute a virtuous resolve crept over him and elevated his spirits though body and soul were alike weary arriving at treby he sought his bed he slept peacefully and it was the first slumber he had enjoyed since he had torn himself from the spot where she lay whom he had loved so truly even to the death to which he had brought her chapter iv two days after the stranger and the orphan had departed for london when it came to the point of decision mrs baker's conscience began to reproach her and she doubted the propriety of intrusting her innocent charge to one totally unknown but the stranger satisfied her doubts he showed her papers betokening his name and station as john falkner captain in the native cavalry of the east india company and moreover possessed of such an independence as looked like wealth in the eyes of mrs baker and at once commanded her respect his own care was to collect every testimony and relic that might prove the identity of the little elizabeth her unfortunate mother's unfinished letter her bible and prayer book in the first of which was recorded the birth of her child and a seal which mrs baker's prudence had saved when her avarice caused her to sell the watch with mr raby's coat of arms and crest engraved a small desk containing a few immaterial papers and letters from strangers addressed to edwin raby such was elizabeth's inheritance in looking over the desk mr falkner found a little foreign almanac embellished with prints and fancifully bound on the first page of which was written in a woman's elegant hand to dearest isabella from her a r had falkner wanted proof as to the reality of his suspicions with regard to the friend of mrs raby here was conviction he was about to press the dear handwriting to his lips when feeling his own unworthiness he shuddered through every limb and thrusting the book into his bosom he by a strong effort prevented every outward mark of the thrilling agony which the sight of his victim's writing occasioned it gave at the same time fresh firmness to his resolve to do all that was requisite to restore the orphan daughter of her friend to her place in society she was as a bequest left him by whom he last saw pale and senseless at his feet who had been the dream of his life from boyhood and was now the phantom to haunt him with remorse to his latest hour to replace the dead to the lovely child was impossible he knew the incomparable virtues of her to whom her mother bequeathed her while every thought that tended to recall her to his memory was armed with a double sting regret at having lost horror at the fate he had brought upon her by what strange incalculable and yet sure enchainment of events had he been brought to supply her place she was dead through his accursed machinations she no longer formed a portion of the breathing world how marvellous that he flying from memory and conscience resolved to expiate his half involuntary guilt by his own death should have landed at treby still more wondrous were the motives hair slight in appearance yet on which so vast a weight of circumstance hung that led him to the twilight churchyard and had made mrs raby's grave the scene of the projected tragedy which had brought the orphan to guard that grave from pollution caused her to stay his upraised hand and gained for herself a protector by the very act whoever has been the victim of a tragic event whoever has experienced life and hope the past and the future wrecked by one fatal catastrophe must be at once dismayed and awestruck to trace the secret agency of a thousand foregone disregarded and trivial events which all led to the deplored end and served as it were as invisible meshes to envelop the victim in the fatal net had the meanest among these been turned aside the progress of the destroying destiny had been stopped but there is no voice to cry hold no prophesying eye to discern the unborn event and the future inherits its whole portion of wo awed by the mysteries that encompassed and directed his steps which used no agency except the unseen but not unfelt power which surrounds us with motive as with an atmosphere falkner yielded his hitherto unbending mind to control he was satisfied to be led and not to command his impatient spirit wondered at this new docility while yet he felt some slight self satisfaction steal over him and the prospect of being useful to the helpless little being who stood before him weak in all except her irresistible claim to his aid imparted such pleasure as he was surprised to feel once again he visited the churchyard of treby accompanied by the orphan she was loath to quit the spot she could with difficulty consent to leave mamma but mrs baker had made free use of a grown up person's much abused privilege of deceit and told her lies in abundance sometimes promising that she should soon return sometimes assuring her that she would find her mother alive and well at the grand place whither she was going yet despite the fallacious hopes she cried and sobbed bitterly during her last visits to her parents' graves falkner tried to sooth her saying we must leave papa and mamma dearest god has taken them from you but i will be a new papa to you the child raised her head which she had buried in his breast and in infantine dialect and accent said will you be good to her and love baby as papa did yes dearest child i promise always to love you will you love me and call me your papa papa dear papa she cried clinging round his neck my new good papa and then whispering in his ear she softly but seriously added i can't have a new mamma i won't have any but my own mamma no pretty one said falkner with a sigh you will never have another mamma she is gone who would have been a second mother and you are wholly orphaned an hour after they were on the road to london and full of engrossing and torturing thoughts as falkner was still he was called out of himself and forced to admire the winning ways the enchanting innocence and loveliness of his little charge we human beings are so unlike one to the other that it is often difficult to make one person understand that there is any force in an impulse which is omnipotent with another children to some are mere animals unendued with instinct troublesome and unsightly with others they possess a charm that reaches to the heart's core and stirs the purest and most generous portions of our nature falkner had always loved children in the indian wilds which for many years he had inhabited the sight of a young native mother with her babe had moved him to envious tears the fair fragile offspring of european women with blooming faces and golden hair had often attracted him to bestow kind offices on parents whom otherwise he would have disregarded the fiery passions of his own heart caused him to feel a soothing repose while watching the innocent gambols of childhood while his natural energy which scarcely ever found sufficient scope for exercise led him to delight in protecting the distressed if the mere chance spectacle of infant helplessness was wont to excite his sympathy this sentiment by the natural workings of the human heart became far more lively when so beautiful and perfect a creature as elizabeth raby was thrown upon his protection no one could have regarded her unmoved her silver toned laugh went to the heart her alternately serious or gay looks each emanating from the spirit of love her caresses her little words of endearment the soft pressure of her tiny hand and warm rosy lips were all as charming as beauty and the absence of guile could make them and he the miserable man was charmed and pitied the mother who had been forced to desert so sweet a flower leaving to the bleak elements a blossom which it had been paradise for her to have cherished and sheltered in her own bosom for ever at each moment falkner became more enchanted with his companion sometimes they got out of the chaise to walk up a hill then taking the child in his arms he plucked flowers for her from the hedges or she ran on before and gathered them for herself now pulling ineffectually at some stubborn parasite now pricking herself with brier when his help was necessary to assist and make all well again when again in the carriage she climbed on his knee and stuck the flowers in his hair to make papa fine and as trifles affect the mind when rendered sensitive by suffering so was he moved by her trying to remove the thorns of the wild roses before she decorated him with them at other times she twisted them among her own ringlets and laughed to see herself mirrored in the front glasses of the chaise sometimes her mood changed and she prattled seriously about mamma asked if he did not think that she was sorry at baby's going so far far away or remembering the fanciful talk of her mother when her father died she asked whether she were not following them through the air as evening closed in she looked out to see whether she could not perceive her i cannot hear her she does not speak to me she said perhaps she is a long way off in that tiny star but then she can see us are you there mamma artlessness and beauty are more truly imaged on the canvass than in the written page were we to see the lovely orphan thus pictured and italian artists and our own reynolds have painted such with uplifted finger her large earnest eyes looking inquiringly and tenderly for the shadowy form of her mother as she might fancy it descending towards her from the little star her childish fancy singled out a half smile on her lips contrasted with the seriousness of her baby brow if we could see such visibly presented on the canvass the world would crowd round to admire this pen but feebly traces the living grace of the little angel but it was before falkner it stirred him to pity first and then to deeper regret he strained the child to his breast thinking oh yes i might have been a better and a happy man false alithea why through your inconstancy are such joys buried for ever in your grave a few minutes after and the little girl fell asleep nestled in his arms her attitude had all the inartificial grace of childhood her face hushed to repose yet breathed of affection falkner turned his eyes from her to the starry sky his heart swelled impatiently his past life lay as a map unrolled before him he had desired a peaceful happiness the happiness of love his fond aspirations had been snakes to destroy others and to sting his own soul to torture he writhed under the consciousness of the remorse and horror which were henceforth to track his path of life yet even while he shuddered he felt that a revolution was operating within himself he no longer contemplated suicide that which had so lately appeared a mark of courage wore now the guise of cowardice and yet if he were to live where and how should his life be passed he recoiled from the solitude of the heart which had marked his early years and yet he felt that he could never more link himself in love or friendship to any he looked upon the sleeping child and began to conjecture whether he might not find in her the solace he needed should he not adopt her mould her heart to affection teach her to lean on him only be all the world to her while her gentleness and caresses would give life a charm without which it were vain to attempt to endure existence he reflected what elizabeth's probable fate would be if he restored her to her father's family personal experience had given him a horror for the forbidding ostentatious kindness of distant relations that hers resembled such as he had known and were imperious and cold hearted their conduct not only to mrs raby but previously to a meritorious son did not permit him to doubt if he made the orphan over to them their luxuries and station would ill stand instead of affection and heartfelt kindness soft delicate and fond she would pine and die with him on the contrary she would be happy he would devote himself to her every wish gratified her gentle disposition carefully cultivated no rebuke no harshness his arms ever open to receive her in grief his hand to support her in danger was not this a fate her mother would have preferred in bequeathing her to her friend she showed how little she wished that her sweet girl should pass into the hands of her husband's relations could he not replace that friend of whom he had so cruelly robbed her whose loss was to be attributed to him alone we all are apt to think that when we discard a motive we cure a fault and foster the same error from a new cause with a safe conscience thus even now aching and sore from the tortures of remorse for past faults falkner indulged in the same propensity which apparently innocent in its commencement had led to fatal results he meditated doing rather what he wished than what was strictly just he did not look forward to the evils his own course involved while he saw in disproportionate magnitude those to be brought about if he gave up his favourite project what ills might arise to the orphan from his interweaving her fate with his he a criminal in act if not in intention who might be called upon hereafter to answer for his deeds and who at least must fly and hide himself of this he thought not while he determined that fostered and guarded by him elizabeth must be happy and under the tutelage of her relations she would become the victim of hardhearted neglect these ideas floated somewhat indistinctly in his mind and it was half unconsciously that he was building from them a fabric for the future as deceitful as it was alluring after several days' travelling falkner found himself with his young charge in london and then he began to wonder wherefore he had repaired thither and to consider that he must form some settled scheme for the future he had in england neither relation nor friend whom he cared for orphaned at an early age neglected by those who supported him at least as far as the affections were concerned he had even in boyhood known intimately and loved but one person only she who had ruled his fate to this hour and was now among the dead sent to india in early youth he had there to make his way in defiance of poverty of want of connexion of his own overbearing disposition and the sense of wrong early awakened that made him proud and reserved at last most unexpectedly the death of several relations caused the family estate to devolve upon him and he had sold his commission in india and hastened home with his heart so set upon one object that he scarcely reflected or reflected only to congratulate himself on how alone he stood and now that his impetuosity and ill regulated passions had driven the dear object of all his thoughts to destruction still he was glad that there were none to question him none to wonder at his resolves to advise or to reproach still a plan was necessary the very act of his life which had been so big with ruin and remorse enjoined some forethought it was probable that he was already suspected if not known detection and punishment in a shape most loathsome would overtake him did he not shape his measures with prudence and as hate as well as love had mixed strongly in his motives he was in no humour to give his enemies the triumph of visiting his crime on him what is written in glaring character in our own consciousness we believe to be visible to the whole world and falkner after arriving in london after leaving elizabeth at an hotel and walking into the streets felt as if discovery was already on him when he was accosted by an acquaintance who asked him where he had been what he had been doing and why he was looking so deusedly ill he stammered some reply and was hastening away when his friend passing his arm through his said i must tell you the strangest occurrence i ever heard of i have just parted from a man do you remember a mr neville whom you dined with at my house when last in town falkner at this moment exercised with success the wonderful mastery which he possessed over feature and voice and coldly replied that he did remember and do you remember our conversation after he left us said his friend and my praises of his wife whom i exalted as the pattern of virtue who can know woman i could have bet any sum that she would preserve her good name to the end and she has eloped well said falkner is that all is that the most wonderful circumstance ever heard had you known mrs neville replied his companion you would be as astonished as i with all her charms all her vivacity never had the breath of scandal reached her she seemed one of those whose hearts though warm are proof against the attacks of love and with ardent affections yet turn away from passion superior and unharmed yet she has eloped with a lover there is no doubt of that fact for he was seen they were seen going off together and she has not been heard of since did mr neville pursue them asked falkner he is even now in full pursuit vowing vengeance more enraged than i ever beheld man unfortunately he does not know who the seducer is nor have the fugitives yet been traced the whole affair is the most mysterious a lover dropped from the clouds an angel of virtue subdued almost before she is sought still they must be found out they cannot hide themselves for ever and then there will be a duel to the death asked falkner in the same icy accents no replied the other mrs neville has no brother to fight for her and her husband breathes law only whatever vengeance the law will afford that he will use to the utmost he is too angry to fight the poltron exclaimed falkner and thus he loses his sole chance of revenge i know not that replied his companion he has formed a thousand schemes of chastisement for both offenders more dread than the field of honour there is to be sure a mean as well as an indignant spirit in him that revels rather in the thought of inflicting infamy than death he utters a thousand mysterious threats i do not see exactly what he can do but when he discovers his injurer as he must some day and i believe there are letters that afford a clew he will wreak all that a savage and yet a sordid desire of vengeance can suggest poor mrs neville after all she must have lived a sad life with such a fellow and here we part said falkner i am going another way you have told me a strange story it will be curious to mark the end farewell brave to rashness as falkner was yet there was much in what he had just heard that made him recoil and almost tremble what the vengeance was that mr neville could take he too well knew and he resolved to defeat it his plans before vague were formed on the instant his lip curled with a disdainful smile when he recollected what his friend had said of the mystery that hung over the late occurrences he would steep them all in tenfold obscurity to grieve for the past was futile or rather nothing he could do would prevent or alleviate the piercing regret that tortured him but that need not influence his conduct to leave his arch enemy writhing from injury yet powerless to revenge himself blindly cursing he knew not who and removing the object of his curses from all danger of being hurt by them was an image not devoid of satisfaction acting in conformity with these ideas the next morning saw him on the road to dover elizabeth still his companion resolved to seek oblivion in foreign countries and far climes and happy at the same time to have her with him whose infantine caresses already poured balm upon his rankling wounds chapter v paris was the next but transient resting place of the travellers here falkner made such arrangements with regard to remittances as he believed would best ensure his scheme of concealment he laid the map of europe before him and traced a course with his pencil somewhat erratic yet not without a plan paris hamburgh stockholm st petersburgh moscow odessa constantinople through hungary to vienna how many thousand miles miles which while he traversed he could possess his soul in freedom fear no scrutiny be asked no insidious questions he could look each man in the face and none trace his crime in his own it was a wild scheme to make so young a child as elizabeth the companion of these devious and long wanderings yet it was her idea that shed golden rays on the boundless prospect he contemplated he could not have undertaken this long journey alone memory and remorse his only companions he was not one of those unfortunately whom a bright eye and kindly smile can light at once into a flame soon burnt out it is true but warming and cheering and yet harmless while it lasted he could not among strangers at once discern the points to admire and make himself the companion of the intelligent and good through a sort of freemasonry some spirits possess this was a great defect of character he was proud and reserved his esteem must be won long habits of intimacy formed his fastidious taste never wounded his imagination never balked without this he was silent and wrapped in himself all his life he had cherished a secret and ardent passion beyond whose bounds everything was steril this had changed from the hopes of love to the gnawing pangs of remorse but still his heart fed on itself and unless that was interested and by the force of affection he were called out of himself he must be miserable to arrive unwelcomed at an inn to wander through unknown streets and cities without any stimulus of interest or curiosity to traverse vast tracts of country useless to others a burden to himself alone this would have been intolerable but elizabeth was the cure she was the animating soul of his project her smiles her caresses the knowledge that he benefited her was the life blood of his design he indulged with a sort of rapture in the feeling that he loved and was beloved by an angel of innocence who grew each day into a creature endowed with intelligence sympathies hopes fears and affections all individually her own and yet all modelled by him centred in him to whom he was necessary who would be his not like the vain love of his youth only in imagination but in every thought and sensation to the end of time nor did he intend to pursue his journey in such a way as to overtask her strength or injure her health he cared not how much time elapsed before its completion it would certainly employ years it mattered not how many when winter rendered travelling painful he could take up his abode in a metropolis abounding in luxuries during the summer heats he might fix himself in some villa where the season would be mitigated to pleasantness if impelled by a capricious predilection he could stay for months in any chance selected spot but his home was with elizabeth beside him in his travelling carriage perpetual change would baffle pursuit if any were set on foot while the restlessness of his life the petty annoyances and fleeting pleasures of a traveller's existence would serve to occupy his mind and prevent its being mastered by those passions to which one victim had been immolated and which rendered the remnant of his days loathsome to himself i have determined to live he thought and i must therefore ensure the means of life i must adopt a method by which i can secure for each day that stock of patience which is necessary to lead me to the end of it in the plan i have laid down every day will have a task to be fulfilled and while i employ myself in executing it i need look neither before nor behind and each day added thus one by one to one another will form months and years and i shall grow old travelling post over europe his resolution made he was eager to enter on his travels which singular to say he performed even in the very manner he had determined for the slight changes in the exact route introduced afterward from motives of convenience or pleasure might be deemed rather as in accordance with than deviating from his original project falkner was not a man ordinarily met with he possessed wild and fierce passions joined to extreme sensibility beneficence and generosity his boyhood had been rendered miserable by the violence of a temper roused to anger even from trifles collision with his fellow creatures a sense of dignity with his equals and of justice towards his inferiors had subdued this still his blood was apt to boil when roused by any impediment to his designs or the sight of injury towards others and it was with great difficulty that he kept down the outward marks of indignation or contempt to tame the vehemence of his disposition he had endeavoured to shackle his imagination and to cultivate his reason and perhaps he fancied that he succeeded best when in fact he entirely failed as now when he took the little orphan with him away from all the ties of blood the manners and customs of her country from the discipline of regular education and the society of others of her sex had not elizabeth been the creature she was with a character not to be disharmonized by any circumstances this had been a fearful experiment yet he fondly hoped to derive happiness from it traversing long tracts of country with vast speed cut off from intercourse with every one but her and she endearing herself more daily by extreme sweetness of disposition he began almost to forget the worm gnawing at his bosom and feeling himself free to fancy himself happy unfortunately it was not so he had passed the fatal rubicon placed by conscience between innocence and crime and however much he might for a time deaden the stings of feeling or baffle the inevitable punishment hereafter to arise from the consequences of his guilt still there was a burden on his soul that took all real zest from life and made his attempts at enjoyment more like the experiments of a physician to dissipate sickness than the buoyant sensations of one in health but then he thought not of himself he did not live in himself but in the joyous being at his side her happiness was exuberant she might be compared to an exotic lately pinched and drooping from the effects of the wintry air transported back in the first opening of a balmy southern spring to its native clime the young and tender green leaves unfolded themselves in the pleasant air blossoms appeared among the foliage and sweet fruit might be anticipated nor was it only the kindness of her protector that endeared him to her much of the warm sentiment of affection arose from their singular modes of life had they continued at a fixed residence in town or country in a civilized land elizabeth had seen her guardian at stated periods have now and then taken a walk with him or gambolled in the garden at his side while for the chief part their occupation and pursuits being different they had been little together as it was they were never apart side by side in a travelling carriage now arriving now departing now visiting the objects worthy of observation in various cities they shared in all the pleasures and pains of travel and each incident called forth her sense of dependance and his desire to protect or changing places even at that early age she soothed his impatience while he was beguiled of his irritability by her cheerful voice and smiling face in all this elizabeth felt most strongly the tie that bound them sometimes benighted sometimes delayed by swollen rivers reduced to bear together the miseries of a bad inn or at times of no inn at all sometimes in danger often worn by fatigue elizabeth found in her adopted parent a shelter a support and a preserver creeping close to him her little hand clasped in his or carried in his arms she feared nothing because he was there during storms at sea he had placed his own person between her and the bitter violence of the wind and had often exposed himself to the inclemency of the weather to cover her and save her from wet and cold at all times he was on the alert to assist and his assistance was like the coming of a superior being sufficient to save her from harm and inspire her with courage such circumstances had perhaps made a slight impression on many children but elizabeth had senses and sensibilities so delicately strung as to be true to the slightest touch of harmony she had not forgotten the time when neglected and almost in rags she only heard the voice of complaint or chiding when she crept alone over the sands to her mother's grave and did a tempest overtake her there was none to shield or be of comfort she remembered little accidents that had at times befallen her which to her infantine feelings seemed mighty dangers but there had been none as now to pluck her from peril and ensure her safety she recollected when on one occasion a thunder storm had overtaken her in the churchyard when hurrying home her foot slipped as she attempted to descend the wet path of the cliff frightened she clambered up again and returning home by the upper road had lost her way and found night darkening round her wet tired and shivering with fear and cold and then on her return her welcome had been a scolding well meant perhaps but vulgar loud and painful and now the contrast her wishes guessed her thoughts divined ready succour and perpetual vigilance were for ever close at hand and all this accompanied by a gentleness kindness and even by a respect which the ardent yet refined feelings of her protector readily bestowed thus a physical gratitude so to speak sprung up in her child's heart a precursor to the sense of moral obligation to be developed in after years every hour added strength to her affection and habit generated fidelity and an attachment not to be shaken by any circumstances nor was kindness from him the only tie between them elizabeth discerned his sadness and tried to cheer his gloom now and then the fierceness of his temper broke forth towards others but she was never terrified and grieved for the object of his indignation or if she felt it to be unjust she pleaded the cause of the injured and by her caresses brought him back to himself she early learned the power she had over him and loved him the more fondly on that account thus there existed a perpetual interchange of benefit of watchful care of mutual forbearance of tender pity and thankfulness if all this seems beyond the orphan's years it must be remembered that peculiar circumstances develop peculiar faculties and that besides what is latent does not the less exist on that account elizabeth could not have expressed and was indeed unconscious of the train of feeling here narrated it was the microcosm of a plant folded up in its germe sometimes looking at a green unformed bud we wonder why a particular texture of leaves must inevitably spring from it and why another sort of plant should not shoot out from the dark stem but as the tiny leaflet uncloses it is there in all its peculiarity and endowed with all the especial qualities of its kind thus with elizabeth however in the thoughtlessness and inexperience of childhood small outward show was made of the inner sense yet in her heart tenderness fidelity and unshaken truth were folded up to be developed as her mind gained ideas and sensation gradually verged into sentiment the course of years also is included in this sketch she was six years old when she left paris she was nearly ten when after many wanderings and a vast tract of country overpassed they arrived at odessa there had always been a singular mixture of childishness and reflection in her and this continued even now as far as her own pleasures were concerned she might be thought behind her age to chase a butterfly to hunt for a flower to play with a favourite animal to listen with eagerness to the wildest fairy tales such were her pleasures but there was something more as she watched the turns of countenance in him she named her father adapted herself to his gloomy or communicative mood pressed near him when she thought he was annoyed and restrained every appearance of discomfort when he was distressed by her being exposed to fatigue or the inclement sky when at st petersburgh he fell ill she never left his bedside and remembering the death of her parents she wasted away with terror and grief at another time in a wild district of russia she sickened of the measles they were obliged to take refuge in a miserable hovel and despite all his care the want of medical assistance endangered her life while her convalescence was rendered tedious and painful by the absence of every comfort her sweet eyes grew dim her little head drooped no mother could have attended on her more assiduously than falkner and she long after remembered his sitting by her in the night to give her drink her pillow smoothed by him and when she grew a little better his carrying her in his arms under a shady grove so to give her the benefit of the air in a manner that would least incommode her these incidents were never forgotten they were as the colour and fragrance to the rose the very beauty and delight of both their lives falkner felt a half remorse at the too great pleasure he derived from her society while hers was a sort of rapturous thrilling adoration that dreamed not of the necessity of a check and luxuriated in its boundless excess chapter vi it was late in the autumn when the travellers arrived at odessa whence they were to embark for constantinople in the neighbourhood of which city they intended to pass the winter it must not be supposed that falkner journeyed in the luxurious and troublesome style of a milord anglais a calche was his only carriage he had no attendant for himself and was often obliged to change the woman hired for the service of elizabeth the parisian with whom they commenced their journey was reduced to despair by the time they arrived at hamburgh the german who replaced her was dismissed at stockholm the swede next hired became homesick at moscow and they arrived at odessa without any servant falkner scarcely knew what to do being quite tired of the exactions caprices and repinings of each expatriated menial yet it was necessary that elizabeth should have a female attendant and on his arrival at odessa he immediately set on foot various inquiries to procure one several presented themselves who proved wholly unfit and falkner was made angry by their extortionate demands and total incapacity at length a person was ushered in to him who looked who was english she was below the middle stature spare and upright in figure with a composed countenance and an appearance of tidiness and quiet that was quite novel and by no means unpleasing contrasted with the animated gestures loud voices and exaggerated protestations of the foreigners i hear sir she began that you are inquiring for an attendant to wait on miss falkner during your journey to vienna i should be very glad if you would accept my services are you a lady's maid in any english family here asked falkner i beg your pardon sir continued the little woman primly i am a governess i lived many years with a russian lady at st petersburgh she brought me here and is gone and left me indeed exclaimed falkner that seems a very unjust proceeding how did it happen on our arrival at odessa sir the lady who had no such notion before insisted on converting me to her church and because i refused she used me i may say very ill and hiring a greek girl left me here quite destitute it seems that you have the spirit of a martyr observed falkner smiling i do not pretend to that she replied but i was born and brought up a protestant and i did not like to pretend to believe what i could not falkner was pleased with the answer and looked more scrutinizingly on the applicant she was not ugly but slightly pitted with the smallpox and with insignificant features her mouth looked obstinate and her light gray eyes though very quick and intelligent yet from their smallness and the lids and brows being injured by the traces of the malady did not redeem her countenance from an entirely commonplace appearance which might not disgust but could not attract do you understand asked falkner that i need a servant and not a governess i have no other attendant for my daughter and you must not be above waiting on her as she has been accustomed i can make no objection she replied my first wish is to get away from this place free from expense at vienna i can find a situation such as i have been accustomed to now i shall be very glad to reach germany safely in any creditable capacity and i shall be grateful to you sir if you do not consider my being destitute against me but be willing to help a country woman in distress there was a simplicity though a hardiness in her manner and an entire want of pretension or affectation that pleased falkner he inquired concerning her abilities as a governess and began to feel that in that capacity also she might be useful to elizabeth he had been accustomed on all convenient occasions to hire a profusion of masters but this desultory sort of teaching did not inculcate those habits of industry and daily application which it is the best aim of education to promote at the same time he much feared an improper female companion for the child and had suffered a good deal of anxiety on account of the many changes he had been forced to make he observed the lady before him narrowly there was nothing prepossessing but all seemed plain and unassuming though formal she was direct her words few her voice quiet and low without being soft or constrained he asked her what remuneration she would expect she said that her present aim was to get to vienna free of expense and she did not expect much beyond she had been accustomed to receive eighty pounds a year as governess but as she was to serve miss falkner as maid she would only ask twenty but as i wish you to act as both said falkner we must join the two sums and i will pay you a hundred a ray of pleasure actually for a second illuminated the little woman's face while with an unaltered tone of voice she replied i shall be very thankful sir if you think proper you must however understand our conditions said falkner i talk of vienna but i travel for my pleasure with no fixed bourn or time i am not going direct to germany i spend the winter at constantinople it may be that i shall linger in those parts it may be that from greece i shall cross to italy you must not insist on my taking you to vienna it is enough for your purpose i suppose if you reach a civilized part of the world and are comfortably situated till you find some other family going whither you desire she was acquiescent she insisted however with much formality that he should make inquiries concerning her from several respectable families at odessa otherwise she said he could not fitly recommend her to any other situation falkner complied every one spoke of her in high terms lauding her integrity and kindness of heart miss jervis is the best creature in the world said the wife of the french consul only she is english to the core so precise and formal and silent and quiet and cold nothing can persuade her to do what she does not think right after being so shamefully deserted she might have lived in my house or four or five others doing nothing but she chose to have pupils and to earn money by teaching this might have been merely for the sake of paying for her journey but besides this we discovered that she supports some poor relation in england and while cast away here she still remembered and sent remittances to one whom she thought in want she has a heart of gold though it does not shine pleased with this testimony falkner thought himself fortunate in securing her services at the same time that he feared he should find her presence a considerable encumbrance a servant was a cipher but a governess must receive attention she was an equal who would perpetually form a third with him and elizabeth his reserve his love of independence and his regard for the feelings of another would be perpetually at war to be obliged to talk when he wished to be silent to listen to and answer frivolous remarks to know that at all times a stranger was there all this seemed to him a gigantic evil but it vanished after a few days' trial of their new companion's qualities whatever miss jervis's latent virtues might be she thought that the chief among them was to be content to dwell in decencies for ever her ambition was to be unimpeachably correct in conduct it a little jarred with her notions to be in the house of a single gentleman but her desolate situation at odessa allowed her no choice and she tried to counterbalance the evil by seeing as little of her employer as possible brought up from childhood to her present occupation she was moulded to its very form and her thoughts never strayed beyond her theory of a good governess her methods were all straightforward pointing steadily to one undisguised aim no freak of imagination ever led her out of one hard defined unerratic line she had no pretension even in the innermost recess of her heart beyond her station to be diligent and conscientious in her task of teaching was the sole virtue to which she pretended and possessed of much good sense great integrity and untiring industry she succeeded beyond what could have been expected from one apparently so insignificant and taciturn she was at the beginning limited very narrowly in the exercise of any authority over her pupil she was obliged therefore to exert herself in winning influence instead of controlling by reprimands she took great pains to excite elizabeth to learn and once having gained her consent to apply to any particular study she kept her to it with patience and perseverance and the very zeal and diligence she displayed in teaching made elizabeth ashamed to repay her with an inattention that looked like ingratitude soon also curiosity and a love of knowledge developed themselves elizabeth's mind was of that high order which soon found something congenial in study the acquirement of new ideas the sense of order and afterward of power awoke a desire for improvement falkner was a man of no common intellect but his education had been desultory and he had never lived with the learned and well informed his mind was strong in its own elements but these lay scattered and somewhat chaotic his observation was keen and his imagination fervid but it was inborn uncultivated and unenriched by any vast stores of reading he was the very opposite of a pedant miss jervis was much of the latter but the two served to form elizabeth to something better than either she learned from falkner the uses of learning from miss jervis she acquired the thoughts and experience of other men like all young and ardent minds which are capable of enthusiasm she found infinite delight in the pages of ancient history she read biography and speedily found models for herself whereby she measured her own thoughts and conduct rectifying her defects and aiming at that honour and generosity which made her heart beat and cheeks glow when narrated of others there was another very prominent distinction between falkner and the governess it made a part of the system of the latter never to praise all that she tasked her pupil to do was a duty when not done it was a deplorable fault when executed the duty was fulfilled and she need not reproach herself that was all falkner on the contrary fond and eager soon looked upon her as a prodigy and though reserved as far as his own emotions were concerned he made no secret of his almost adoration of elizabeth his praise was enthusiastic it brought tears into her eyes and yet strange to say it is doubtful whether she ever strived so eagerly or felt so satisfied with it as for the parsimonious expressions of bare satisfaction from miss jervis they excited two distinct sensations she loved her protector the more for his fervid approbation it was the crown of all his gifts she wept sometimes only to remember his ardent expressions of approbation but miss jervis inspired self diffidence and with it a stronger desire for improvement thus the sensibility of her nature was cultivated while her conceit was checked to feel that to be meritorious with miss jervis was impossible not to be faulty was an ambitious aim she easily discovered that affection rather than discernment dictated the approbation of falkner and loved him better but did not prize herself the more he indeed was transported by the progress she made like most self educated or uneducated men he had a prodigious respect for learning and was easily deceived into thinking much of what was little he felt elated when he found elizabeth eager to recite the wonders recorded in history and to delineate the characters of ancient heroes narrating their achievements and quoting their sayings his imagination and keen spirit of observation were at the same time of the utmost use he analyzed with discrimination the actions of her favourites brought the experience of a mind full of passion and reflection to comment upon every subject and taught her to refer each maxim and boasted virtue to her own sentiments and situation thus to form a store of principle by which to direct her future life nor were these more masculine studies the only lessons of miss jervis needlework entered into her plan of education as well as the careful inculcation of habits of neatness and order and thus elizabeth escaped for ever the danger she had hitherto run of wanting those feminine qualities without which every woman must be unhappy and to a certain degree unsexed the governess meanwhile was the most unobtrusive of human beings she never showed any propensity to incommode her employer by making him feel her presence seated in a corner of the carriage with a book in her hand she adopted the ghostly rule of never speaking except when spoken to when stopping at inns or when on arriving at constantinople they became stationary she was even less obtrusive at first falkner had deemed it proper to ask her to accompany them in their excursions and drives but she was so alive to the impropriety of being seen with a gentleman with only a young child for their companion that she always preferred staying at home after ranging a beautiful landscape after enjoying the breezes of heaven and the sight of the finest views in the world when elizabeth returned she always found her governess sitting in the same place away from the window because when in london she had been told that it was not proper to look out of a window even though the sublimest objects of nature were spread for her view and employed on needlework or the study of some language that might hereafter serve to raise her in the class of governesses she had travelled over half the habitable globe and part of the uninhabited but she had never diverged from the prejudices and habits of home no gleam of imagination shed its golden hue over her drab coloured mind whatever of sensibility existed to soften or dulcify she sedulously hid yet such was her serenity her justice her trustworthiness and total absence of pretension that it was impossible not to esteem and almost to like her the trio thus diverse in disposition yet by the force of a secret harmony never fell into discord miss jervis was valued and by elizabeth obeyed in all that concerned her vocation she therefore was satisfied falkner felt her use and gladly marked the good effects of application and knowledge on the character of his beloved ward it was the moulding of a block of parian marble into a muse all corners all superfluous surface all roughness departed the intelligent noble brow the serious inquiring eye the mouth seat of sensibility all these were developed with new beauty as animated by the aspiring soul within her gentleness and sweetness increased with the cultivation of her mind to be wise and good was her ambition partly to please her beloved father partly because her young mind perceived the uses and beauty of knowledge if anything could have cured the rankling wounds of falkner's mind it was the excellence of the young elizabeth again and again he repeated to himself that brought up among the worldly and cold her noblest qualities would either have been destroyed or produced misery in contributing to her happiness and goodness he hoped to make some atonement for the past there were many periods when remorse and regret and self abhorrence held powerful sway over him he was indeed during the larger portion of his time in the fullest sense of the word miserable yet there were gleams of sunshine he had never hoped to experience again and he readily gave way to this relief while he hoped that the worst of his pains were over in this idea he was egregiously mistaken he was allowed to repose for a few years but the cry of blood was yet unanswered the evil he had committed unatoned though they did not approach him the consequences of his crime were full of venom and bitterness to others and unawares and unexpectedly he was brought to view and feel the wretchedness of which he was the sole author chapter vii three more years passed thus over the head of the young elizabeth when during the warm summer months the wanderers established themselves for a season at baden they had hitherto lived in great seclusion and falkner continued to do so but he was not sorry to find his adopted child noticed and courted by various noble ladies who were charmed by the pure complexion the golden hair and spirited though gentle manners of the young english girl elizabeth's characteristic was an enthusiastic affectionateness every little act of kindness that she received excited her gratitude she felt as if she never could though she would constantly endeavour repay the vast debt she owed her benefactor she loved to repass in her mind those sad days when under the care of the sordid mrs baker she ran every hazard of incurring the worst evils of poverty ignorance and blunted sensibility she had preserved her little well worn shoes full of holes and slipping from her feet as a sort of record of her neglected situation she remembered how her hours had been spent loitering on the beach sometimes with her little book from which her mother had taught her oftener in constructing sand castles decorated with pebbles and broken shells she recollected how she had thus built an imitation of the church and churchyard with its shady corner and single stone marking two graves she remembered the vulgar loud voice that called her from her employment with come missy come to your dinner the lord help me i wonder when anybody else will give you a dinner she called to mind the boasts of mrs baker's children contrasting their sunday frock with hers the smallest portion of cake given to her last and with a taunt that made her little heart swell and her throat feel choked so that she could not eat it but scattered it to the birds on which she was beat for being wasteful all this was contrasted with the vigilance the tenderness the respect of her protector she brooded over these thoughts till he became sacred in her eyes and young as she was her heart yearned and sickened for an occasion to demonstrate the deep and unutterable thankfulness that possessed her soul she was not aware of the services she rendered him in her turn the very sight of her was the dearest almost the only joy of his life devoured by disappointment gloom and remorse he found no relief except in her artless prattle or the consciousness of the good he did her she perceived this and was ever on the alert to watch his mood and to try by every art to awaken complacent feelings she did not know it is true the cause of his sufferings the fatal memories that haunted him in the silence of night and threw a dusky veil over the radiance of day she did not see the fair reproachful figure that was often before him to startle and appal she did not hear the shrieks that rung in his ears nor behold her floating away lifeless on the turbid waves who but a little before had stood in all the glow of life and beauty before him all these agonizing images haunted silently his miserable soul and elizabeth could only see the shadow they cast over him and strive to dissipate it when she could perceive the dark hour passing off chased away by her endeavours she felt proud and happy and when he told her that she had saved his life and was his only tie to it that she alone prevented his perishing miserably or lingering in anguish and despair her fond heart swelled with rapture and what soul felt vows she made to remain for ever beside him and pay back to the last the incalculable debt she owed if it be true that the most perfect love subsists between unequals no more entire attachment ever existed than that between this man of sorrows and the happy innocent child he worn by passion oppressed by a sense of guilt his brow trenched by the struggles of many years she stepping pure and free into life innocent as an angel animated only by the most disinterested feelings the link between them of mutual benefit and mutual interest had been cemented by time and habit by each waking thought and nightly dream what is so often a slothful unapparent sense of parental and filial duty was with them a living active spirit for ever manifesting itself in some new form it woke with them went abroad with them attuned the voice and shone brightly in the eyes it is a singular law of human life that the past which apparently no longer forms a portion of our existence never dies new shoots as it were spring up at different intervals and places all bearing the indelible characteristics of the parent stalk the circular emblem of eternity is suggested by this meeting and recurrence of the broken ends of our life falkner had been many years absent from england he had quitted it to get rid of the consequences of an act which he deeply deplored but which he did not wish his enemies to have the triumph of avenging so completely during this interval had he been cut off from any even allusion to the past that he often tried to deceive himself into thinking it a dream often into the persuasion that tragical as was the catastrophe he had brought about it was in its result for the best the remembrance of the young and lovely victim lying dead at his feet prevented his ever being really the dupe of these fond deceits but still memory and imagination alone ministered to remorse it was brought home to him by none of the effects from which he had separated himself by a vast extent of sea and land the sight of the english at baden was exceedingly painful to him they seemed so many accusers and judges he sedulously avoided their resorts and turned away when he saw any approach yet he permitted elizabeth to visit among them and heard her accounts of what she saw and heard even with pleasure for every word showed the favourable impression she made and the simplicity of her own tastes and feelings it was a new world to her to find herself talked to praised and caressed by decrepit painted but courteous old princesses dowagers and all the tribe of german nobility and english fashionable wanderers she was much amused and her lively descriptions often made falkner smile and pleased him by proving that her firm and unsophisticated heart was not to be deluded by adulation soon however she became more interested by a strange tale she brought home of a solitary boy he was english handsome and well born but savage and secluded to a degree that admitted of no attention being paid him she heard him spoken of at first at the house of some foreigners they entered on a dissertation on the peculiar melancholy of the english that could develop itself in a lad scarcely sixteen he was a misanthrope he was seen rambling the country either on foot or on a pony but he would accept no invitations shunned the very aspect of his fellows never appearing by any chance in the frequented walks about the baths was he deaf and dumb some replied in the affirmative and yet this opinion gained no general belief elizabeth once saw him at a little distance seated under a wide spreading tree in a little dell to her he seemed more handsome than anything she had ever seen and more sad one day she was in company with a gentleman who she was told was his father a man somewhat advanced in years of a stern saturnine aspect whose smile was a sneer and who spoke of his only child calling him that unhappy boy in a tone that bespoke rather contempt than commiseration it soon became rumoured that he was somewhat alienated in mind through the ill treatment of his parent and elizabeth could almost believe this she was so struck by the unfeeling and disagreeable appearance of the stranger all this she related to falkner with peculiar earnestness if you could only see him she said if we could only get him here we would cure his misery and his wicked father should no longer torment him if he is deranged he is harmless and i am sure he would love us it is too sad to see one so gentle and so beautiful pining away without any to love him falkner smiled at the desire to cure every evil that crossed her path which is one of the sweetest illusions of youth and asked has he no mother no replied elizabeth he is an orphan like me and his father is worse than dead as he is so inhuman oh how i wish you would save him as you saved me that i am afraid would be out of my power said falkner yet if you can make any acquaintance with him and can bring him here perhaps we may discover some method of serving him for falkner had with all his sufferings and his faults much of the don quixote about him and never heard a story of oppression without forming a scheme to relieve the victim on this permission elizabeth watched for some opportunity to become acquainted with the poor boy but it was vain sometimes she saw him at a distance but if walking in the same path he turned off as soon as he saw her or if sitting down he got up and disappeared as if by magic miss jervis thought her endeavours by no means proper and would give her no assistance if any lady introduced him to you she said it would be very well but to run after a young gentleman only because he looks unhappy is very odd and even wrong still elizabeth persisted she argued that she did not want to know him herself but that her father should be acquainted with him and either induce his father to treat him better or take him home to live with them they lived at some distance from the baths in a shady dell whose sides a little farther on were broken and abrupt one afternoon they were lingering not far from their house when they heard a noise among the underwood and shrubs above them as if some one was breaking his way through it is he look cried elizabeth and there emerged from the covert on to a more open but still more precipitous path the youth they had remarked he was urging his horse with wilful blindness to danger down a declivity which the animal was unwilling to attempt falkner saw the danger and was sure that the boy was unaware of how steep the path grew at the foot of the hill he called out to him but the lad did not heed his voice in another minute the horse's feet slipped the rider was thrown over his head and the animal himself rolled over with a scream elizabeth sprang to the side of the fallen youth but he rose without any appearance of great injury or any complaint evidently displeased at being observed his sullen look merged into one of anxiety as he approached his fallen horse whom together with falkner he assisted to rise the poor thing had fallen on a sharp point of a rock and his side was cut and bleeding the lad was now all activity he rushed to the stream that watered the little dell to procure water which he brought in his hat to wash the wound and as he did so elizabeth remarked to her father that he used only one hand and that the other arm was surely hurt meanwhile falkner had gazed on the boy with a mixture of admiration and pain he was wondrously handsome large deep set hazel eyes shaded by long dark lashes full at once of fire and softness a brow of extreme beauty over which clustered a profusion of chestnut coloured hair an oval face a person light and graceful as a sculptured image all this added to an expression of gloom that amounted to sullenness with which despite the extreme refinement of his features a certain fierceness even was mingled formed a study a painter would have selected for a kind of ideal poetic sort of bandit stripling but besides this there was resemblance strange and thrilling that struck falkner and made him eye him with a painful curiosity the lad spoke with fondness to his horse and accepted the offer made that it should be taken to falkner's stable and looked to by his groom and you too said elizabeth you are in pain you are hurt that is nothing said the youth let me see that i have not killed this poor fellow and i am not hurt to signify elizabeth felt by no means sure of this and while the horse was carefully led home and his wound visited she sent a servant off for a surgeon believing in her own mind that the stranger had broken his arm she was not far wrong he had dislocated his wrist it were better had it been my neck he muttered as he yielded his hand to the gripe of the surgeon nor did he seem to wince during the painful operation far more annoyed was he by the eyes fixed upon him and the questions asked his manner which had become mollified as he waited on his poor horse resumed all its former repulsiveness he looked like a young savage surrounded by enemies whom he suspects yet is unwilling to assail and when his hand was bandaged and his horse again and again recommended to the groom he was about to take leave with thanks that almost seemed reproaches for having an obligation thrust on him when miss jervis exclaimed surely i am not mistaken are you not master neville falkner started as if a snake had glided across his path while the youth colouring to the very roots of his hair and looking at her with a sort of rage at being thus in a matter detected replied my name is neville i thought so said the other i used to see you at lady glenfell's how is your father sir boyvill but the youth would answer no more he darted at the questioner a look of fury and rushed away poor fellow cried miss jervis he is wilder than ever he is a very sad case his mother was the mrs neville talked of so much once she deserted him and his father hates him the young gentleman is half crazed by ill treatment and neglect dearest father are you ill cried elizabeth for falkner had turned ashy pale but he commanded his voice to say that he was well and left the room a few minutes afterward he had left the house and seeking the most secluded pathways walked quickly on as if to escape from himself it would not do the form of her son was before him a ghost to haunt him to madness her son whom she had loved with passion inexpressible crazed by neglect and unkindness crazed he was not every word he spoke showed a perfect possession of acute faculties but it was almost worse to see so much misery in one so young in person he was a model of beauty and grace his mind seemed formed with equal perfection a quick apprehension a sensibility all alive to every touch but these were nursed in anguish and wrong and strained from their true conclusions into resentment suspicion and a fierce disdain of all who injured which seemed to his morbid feelings all who named or approached him falkner knew that he was the cause of this evil how different a life he had led if his mother had lived the tenderness of her disposition joined to her great talents and sweetness rendered her unparalleled in the attention she paid to his happiness and education no mother ever equalled her for no woman ever possessed at once equal virtues and equal capacities how tenderly she had reared him how devotedly fond she was falkner too well knew and tones and looks half forgotten were recalled vividly to his mind at the sight of this poor boy wretched and desolate through his rashness what availed it to hate to curse the father he had never been delivered over to this father had never been hated by him had his mother survived all these thoughts crowded into falkner's mind and awoke an anguish which time had rendered to a certain degree torpid he regarded himself with bitter contempt and abhorrence he feared with a kind of insane terror to see the youth again whose eyes so like hers he had robbed of all expression of happiness and clouded by eternal sorrow he wandered on shrouded himself in the deepest thickets and clambered abrupt hills so that by breathless fatigue of body he might cheat his soul of its agony night came on and he did not return home elizabeth grew uneasy till at last on making more minute inquiry she found that he had come back and was retired to his room it was the custom of falkner to ride every morning with his daughter soon after sunrise and on the morrow elizabeth had just equipped herself her thoughts full of the handsome boy whose humanity to his horse combined with fortitude in enduring great personal pain rendered far more interesting than ever she felt sure that having once commenced their acquaintance would go on and that his savage shyness would be conquered by her father's kindness to alleviate the sorrows of his lot to win his confidence by affection and to render him happy was a project that was occupying her delightfully when the tramp of a horse attracted her attention and looking from the window she saw falkner ride off at a quick pace a few minutes afterward a note was brought to her from him it said dear elizabeth some intelligence which i received yesterday obliges me unexpectedly to leave baden you will find me at mayence request miss jervis to have everything packed up as speedily as possible and to send for the landlord and give up the possession of our house the rent is paid come in the carriage i shall expect you this evening yours dearest j falkner nothing could be more disappointing than this note her first fairy dream beyond the limits of her home to be thus brushed away at once no word of young neville no hope held out of return for a moment an emotion ruffled her mind very like ill humour she read the note again it seemed yet more unsatisfactory but in turning the page she found a postscript pardon me it said for not seeing you last night i was not well nor am i now these few words instantly gave a new direction to her thoughts her father not well and she absent was very painful then she recurred to the beginning of the note intelligence received yesterday some evil news surely since the result was to make him ill at such a word the recollection of his sufferings rushed upon her and she thought no more of the unhappy boy but hurrying to miss jervis entreated her to use the utmost expedition that they might depart speedily once she visited neville's horse it was doing well and she ordered it to be led carefully and slowly to sir boyvill's stables so great was her impatience that by noon they were in the carriage and in a few hours they joined falkner at mayence elizabeth gazed anxiously on him he was an altered man there was something wild and haggard in his looks that bespoke a sleepless night and a struggle of painful emotion by which the very elements of his being were convulsed you are ill dear father cried elizabeth you have heard some news that afflicts you very much i have he replied but do not regard me i shall recover the shock soon and then all will be as it was before do not ask questions but we must return to england immediately to england such a word falkner had never before spoken miss jervis looked almost surprised and really pleased a return to her native country so long deserted and almost forgotten was an event to excite elizabeth even to agitation the very name was full of so many associations were they hereafter to reside there should they visit treby what was about to happen she was bid ask no questions and she obeyed but her thoughts were the more busy she remembered also that neville was english and she looked forward to meeting him and renewing her projects for his welfare chapter viii in the human heart and if observation does not err more particularly in the heart of man the passions exert their influence fitfully with some analogy to the laws which govern the elements they now sleep in calm and now arise with the violence of furious winds falkner had latterly attained a state of feeling approaching to equanimity he displayed more cheerfulness a readier interest in the daily course of events a power to give himself up to any topic discussed in his presence but this had now vanished gloom sat on his brow he was inattentive even to elizabeth sunk back in the carriage his eyes bent on vacancy he was the prey of thoughts each of which had the power to wound it was a melancholy journey and when they arrived in london falkner became still more absorbed and wretched the action of remorse which had been for some time suspended renewed its attacks and made him look upon himself as a creature at once hateful and accursed we are such weak beings that the senses have power to impress us with a vividness which no mere mental operation can produce falkner had been at various times haunted by the probable consequences of his guilt on the child of his victim he recollected the selfish and arrogant character of his father and conscience had led him to reproach himself with the conviction that whatever virtues young neville derived from his mother or had been implanted by her care must have been rooted out by the neglect or evil example of his surviving parent the actual effect of her loss he had not anticipated there was something heart breaking to see a youth nobly gifted by nature and fortune delivered over to a sullen resentment for unmerited wrongs to dejection if not to despair an uninterested observer must deeply compassionate him elizabeth had done so child as she was with a pity almost painful from its excess what then must he feel who knew himself to be the cause of all his wo falkner was not a man to sit quietly under these emotions in their first onset they had driven him to suicide preserved as by a miracle he had exerted strong self command and by dint of resolution forced himself to live year after year had passed and he abided by the sentence of life he had passed on himself and like the galley slave the iron which had eaten into the flesh galled less than when newly applied but he was brought back from the patience engendered by custom at the sight of the unfortunate boy he felt himself accursed god reprobated mankind though they knew it not abhorred him he would no longer live for he deserved to die he would not again raise his hand against himself but there are many gates to the tomb he found no difficulty in selecting one by which to enter he resolved to enter upon a scene of desperate warfare in a distant country and to seek a deliverance from the pains of life by the bullet or the sword on the field of battle above all he resolved that elizabeth's innocence should no longer be associated with his guilt the catastrophe he meditated must be sought alone and she whom he had lived to protect and foster must be guarded from the hardships and perils to which he was about to deliver himself up meditation on this new course absorbed him for some days at first he had been sunk in despondency as the prospect opened before him of activity allied to peril and sought for the sake of the destruction to which it unavoidably led his spirits rose like a war horse dreaming of the sound of a trumpet his heart beat high in the hope of forgetting the consciousness of remorse in all the turbulence of battle or the last forgetfulness of the grave still it was a difficult task to impart his plan to the orphan and to prepare her for a separation several times he had tried to commence the subject and felt his courage fail him at length being together one day some weeks after their arrival in london when indeed many steps had been already taken by him in furtherance of his project at twilight as they sat together near the window which looked upon one of the london squares and they had been comparing this metropolis with many foreign cities falkner abruptly fearful if he lost this occasion of not finding another so appropriate said i must bid you good by to night elizabeth to morrow early i set out for the north of england you mean to leave me behind she asked but you will not be away long i am going to visit your relations he replied to disclose to them that you are under my care and to prepare them to receive you i hope soon to return either to conduct you to them or to bring one among them to welcome you here elizabeth was startled many years had elapsed since falkner had alluded to her alien parentage she went by his name she called him father and the appellation scarcely seemed a fiction he had been the kindest fondest parent to her nor had he ever hinted that he meant to forego the claim his adoption had given him and to make her over to those who were worse than strangers in her eyes if ever they had recurred to her real situation he had not been chary of expressions of indignation against the raby family he had described with warm resentment the selfishness the hardness of heart and disdain of the well being of those allied to them by blood which too often subsists in aristocratic english families when the first bond has been broken by any act of disobedience he grew angry as he spoke of the indignity with which her mother had been treated and the barbarous proposition of separating her from her only child and he had fondly assured her that it was his dearest pride to render her independent of these unworthy and inhuman relations why were his intentions changed his voice and look were ominous elizabeth was hurt she did not like to object she was silent but falkner deciphered her wounded feelings in her ingenuous countenance and he too was pained he could not bear that she should think him ungrateful mindless of her affection her filial attentions and endearing virtues he felt that he must to a certain degree explain his views difficult as it was to make a segment of his feelings in any way take a definite or satisfactory shape do not think hardly of me my own dear girl he began for wishing that we should separate god knows that it is a blow that will visit me far more severely than you you will find relations and friends who will be proud of you whose affections you will win wherever you are you will meet with love and admiration and your sweet disposition and excellent qualities will make life happy i depart alone you are my only tie my only friend i break it and leave you never can i find another henceforth alone i shall wander into distant and uncivilized countries enter on a new and perilous career during which i may perish miserably you cannot share these dangers with me but why do you seek them exclaimed elizabeth alarmed by this sudden prophecy of ill do you remember the day when we first met replied falkner when my hand was raised against my own life because i knew myself unworthy to exist it is the same now it is cowardly to live feeling that i have forfeited every right to enjoy the blessings of life i go that i may die not by my own hand but where i can meet death by the hand of others strangely and frightfully did these words fall on the ear of his appalled listener he went on rapidly for having once begun the words he uttered relieved in some degree the misery that burdened his soul this idea cannot astonish you my love you have seen too much of the secret of my heart you have witnessed my fits of distress and anguish and are not now told for the first time that grief and remorse weigh intolerably on me i can endure the infliction no longer may god forgive me in another world the light of this i will see no more falkner saw the sort of astonished distress her countenance depicted and angry with himself for being its cause was going on in a voice changed to one less expressive of misery but elizabeth seized with dismay the unbidden tears pouring from her eyes her young her child's heart bursting with a new sense of horror cast herself at his feet and embracing his knees as he sat exclaimed my dear dear father my more than father and only friend you break my heart by speaking thus if you are miserable the more need that your child the creature you preserved and taught to love you should be at your side to comfort i had almost said to help you you must not cast me off were you happy you might desert me but if you are miserable i cannot leave you you must not ask me it kills me to think of it the youthful who have no experience of the changes of life regard the present with far more awe and terror than those who have seen one turn in the hourglass suffice to change and change again the colour of their lives to be divided from falkner was to have the pillars of the earth shaken under her and she clung to him and looked up imploringly in his face as if the next word he spoke were to decide all he kissed her and seating her on his knee said let us talk of this more calmly dearest i was wrong to agitate you or to mix the miserable thoughts forced on me by my wretchedness with the prudent consideration of your future destiny i feel it to be unjust to keep you from your relations they are rich we are ignorant of what changes and losses may have taken place among them to soften their hearts which after all were never shut against you you may have become of importance in their eyes raby is a proud name and we must not heedlessly forego the advantages that may belong to your right to it my dear father replied elizabeth this talk is not for me i have no wish to claim the kindness of those who treated my true parents ill you are everything to me i am little more than a child and cannot find words to express all i mean but my truest meaning is to show my gratitude to you till my dying day to remain with you for ever while you love me and to be the most miserable creature in the world if you drive me from you have we not lived together since i was a little thing no higher than your knee and all the time you have been kinder than any father when we have been exposed to storms you have wrapped me round in your arms so that no drop could fall on my head do you remember that dreadful evening when our carriage broke down in the wide dark steppe and you covering me up carried me in your arms while the wind howled and the freezing rain drove against you you could hardly bear up and when we arrived at the post house you strong man as you are fainted from exhaustion while i sheltered in your arms was as warm and well as if it had been a summer's day you have earned me you have bought me by all this kindness and you must not cast me away she clung round his neck her face bathed in tears sobbing and speaking in broken accents as she saw him soften she implored him yet more earnestly till his heart was quite subdued and clasping her to his heart he showered kisses on her head and neck while to his surprise forgotten tears sprung to his own eyes for worlds i would not desert you he cried it is not casting you away that we should separate for a short time for where i go indeed dearest you cannot accompany me i cannot go on living as i have done for many years now my life has been spent in pleasantness and peace i have no right to this hardship and toil and death i ought to repay i abhor myself for a coward when i think of what others suffer through my deeds while i am scathless you can scarcely remember the hour when the touch of your little hand saved my life my heart is not changed since then i am unworthy to exist dear elizabeth you may one day hate me when you know the misery i have caused to those who deserved better at my hands the cry of my victim rings in my ears and i am base to survive my crime let me dearest make my own the praise that nothing graced my life more than the leaving it to live a coward and a drone suits vilely with my former acts of violence and ill let me gain peace of mind by exposing my life to danger by advocating a just cause i may bring a blessing down upon my endeavours i shall go to greece theirs is a good cause that of liberty and christianity against tyranny and an evil faith let me die for it and when it is known as it will one day be that the innocent perished through me it will be added that i died in the defence of the suffering and the brave but you cannot go with me to greece dearest you must await my return in this country you go to die she exclaimed and i am to be far away no dear father i am a little girl but no harm can happen to me the ionian isles are under the english government there at least i may go athens too i dare say is safe dear athens we spent a happy winter there before the revolution began you forget what a traveller i am how accustomed to find my home among strangers in foreign and savage lands no dear father you will not leave me behind i am not unreasonable i do not ask to follow you to the camp but you must let me be near in the same country as yourself you force me to yield against my better reason said falkner this is not right i feel that it is not so one of your sex and so young ought not to be exposed to all i am about to encounter and if i should die and leave you there desolate there are good christians everywhere to protect the orphan persisted elizabeth as if you could die when i am with you and if you died while i was far what would become of me am i to be left like a poor sailor's wife to get a shocking black sealed letter to tell me that while i was enjoying myself and hoping that you had long been it is wicked to speak of these things but i shall go with my own dear dear father and he shall not die falkner yielded to her tears her caresses and persuasions he was not convinced but he could not withstand the excess of grief she displayed at the thought of parting it was agreed that she should accompany him to the ionian isles and take up her residence there while he joined the patriot band in greece this point being decided upon he was anxious that their departure should not be delayed a single hour for most earnest was he to go to throw off the sense of the present to forget his pangs in anticipated danger falkner played no false part with himself he longed to die nor did the tenderness and fidelity of elizabeth disarm his purpose he was convinced that she must be happier and more prosperous when he was removed his tortured mind found relief when he thought of sacrificing his life and quitting it honourably on the field of battle it was only by the prospect of such a fate that he shut his eyes to sterner duties in his secret heart he knew that the course demanded of him by honour and conscience was to stand forth declare his crime and reveal the mysterious tragedy of which he was the occasion to the world but he dared not accuse himself and live it was this that urged him to the thoughts of death when i am no more he told himself let all be declared let my name be loaded with curses but let it be added that i died to expiate my guilt i cannot be called upon to live with a brand upon my name soon it will be all over and then let them heap obloquy pyramid high upon my grave poor elizabeth will become a raby and once cold beneath the sod no more misery will spring from acts of mine actuated by these thoughts falkner drew up two narratives both short the tenour of one need not be mentioned in this place the other stated how he had found elizabeth and adopted her he sealed up with this the few documents that proved her birth he also made his will dividing his property between his heir at law and adopted child and smiled proudly to think that dowered thus by him she would be gladly received into her father's family every other arrangement for their voyage was quickly made and it remained only to determine whether miss jervis should accompany them elizabeth's mind was divided she was averse to parting with an unoffending and kind companion and to forego her instructions though in truth she had got beyond them but she feared that the governess might hereafter shackle her conduct every word falkner had let fall concerning his desire to die she remembered and pondered upon to watch over and to serve him was her aim in going with him child as she was a thousand combinations of danger presented themselves to her imagination when her resolution and fearlessness might bring safety the narrow views and timid disposition of miss jervis might impede her grievously the governess herself was perplexed she was startled when she heard of the new scheme she was pleased to find herself once again in england and repugnant to the idea of leaving so soon again for so distant a region where a thousand perils of war and pestilence would beset every step she was sorry to part with elizabeth but some day that time must come and others dearer from ties of relationship lived in england from whom she had been too long divided weighing these things she showed a degree of hesitation that caused falkner to decide as his heart inclined and to determine that she should not accompany him she went with them as far as plymouth where they embarked elizabeth so long a wanderer felt no regret in leaving england she was to remain with one who was far more than country who was indeed her all falkner felt a load taken from his heart when his feet touched the deck of the vessel that was to bear them away half his duty was accomplished the course begun which would lead to the catastrophe he coveted the sun shone brightly on the ocean the breeze was fresh and favourable miss jervis saw them push from shore with smiles and happy looks she saw them on the deck of the vessel which with sails unfurled had already begun its course over the sea elizabeth waved her handkerchief all grew confused the vessel itself was sinking beneath the horizon and long before night no portion of her canvass could be perceived i wonder thought miss jervis whether i shall ever see them again chapter ix three years from this time elizabeth found herself in the position she had vaguely anticipated at the outset but which every day spent in greece showed her as probable if not inevitable these three years brought falkner to the verge of the death he had gone out to seek he lay wounded a prey of the greek fever to all appearance about to die while she watched over him striving not only to avert the fatal consequences of disease but also to combat the desire to die which destroyed him in describing elizabeth's conduct during these three years it may be thought that the type is presented of ideal and almost unnatural perfection she was it is true a remarkable creature and unless she had possessed rare and exalted qualities her history had not afforded a topic for these pages she was intelligent warm hearted courageous and sincere her lively sense of duty was perhaps her chief peculiarity it was that which strung to such sweet harmony the other portions of her character this had been fostered by the circumstances of her life her earliest recollection was of her dying parents their mutual consolations the bereaved widow's lament and her talk of another and a better world where all would meet again who fulfilled their part virtuously in this world she had been taught to remember her parents as inheriting the immortal life promised to the just and to aspire to the same she had learned from her mother's example that there is nothing so beautiful and praiseworthy as the sacrifice of life to the good and happiness of one beloved she never forgot her debt to falkner she felt herself bound to him by stronger than filial ties a father performs an imperious duty in cherishing his child but all had been spontaneous benevolence in falkner his very faults and passions made his sacrifice the greater and his generosity the more conspicuous elizabeth believed that she could never adequately repay the vast obligation which she was under to him miss jervis also had conduced to perfectionize her mind by adding to its harmony and justness miss jervis it is true might be compared to the rough handed gardener whose labours are without elegance and yet to whose waterings and vigilance the fragrant carnation owes its peculiar tint and the wax like camellia its especial variety it was through her that she had methodised her mind through her that she had learned to concentrate and prolong her attention and to devote it to study she had taught her order and industry and without knowing it she had done more she had inspired ardour for knowledge delight in its acquisition and a glad sense of self approbation when difficulties were conquered by perseverance and when by dint of resolution ignorance was exchanged for a clear perception of any portion of learning it has been said that every clever person is to a certain degree mad by which it is to be understood that every person whose mind soars above the vulgar has some exalted and disinterested object in view to which they are ready to sacrifice the common blessings of life thus from the moment that elizabeth had brought falkner to consent to her accompanying him to greece she had devoted herself to the task first of saving his life if it should be in danger and secondly of reconciling him in the end to prolonged existence there were many difficulties which presented themselves since she was unaware of the circumstances that drove him to seek death as a remedy and an atonement nor had she any desire to pry into her benefactor's secrets in her own heart she suspected an overstrained delicacy or generosity of feeling which exaggerated error and gave the sting to remorse but whatever was the occasion of his sufferings she dedicated herself to their relief and resolved to educate herself so as to fulfil the task of reconciling him to life to the best of her ability left at zante while he proceeded to join the patriot bands of greece she boarded in the house of a respectable family but lived in the most retired manner possible her chief time was spent in study she read to store her mind to confirm its fortitude to elevate its tone she read also to acquire such precepts of philosophy and religion as might best apply to her peculiar task and to learn those secrets of life and death which falkner's desire to die had brought so home to her juvenile imagination if a time is to be named when the human heart is nearest moral perfection most alive and yet most innocent aspiring to good without a knowledge of evil the period at which elizabeth had arrived from thirteen to sixteen is it vague forebodings are awakened a sense of the opening drama of life unaccompanied with any longing to enter on it that feeling is reserved for the years that follow but at fourteen and fifteen we only feel that we are emerging from childhood and we rejoice having yet a sense that as yet it is not fitting that we should make one of the real actors on the world's stage a dreamy delicious period when all is unknown and yet we feel that all is soon to be unveiled the first pang has not been felt for we consider childhood's woes real and frightful as those sometimes are as puerile and no longer belonging to us we look upon the menaced evils of life as a fiction how can care touch the soul which places its desires beyond low minded thought ingratitude deceit treason these have not yet engendered distrust of others nor have our own weaknesses and errors planted the thorn of self disapprobation and regret solitude is no evil for the thoughts are rife with busy visions and the shadows that flit around and people our reveries have almost the substance and vitality of the actual world elizabeth was no dreamer though brought up abstracted from common worldly pursuits there was something singularly practical about her she aimed at being useful in all her reveries this desire was rendered still more fervent by her affection for falkner by her fears on his account by her ardent wish to make life dear to him all her employments all her pleasures referred themselves as it were to this primary motive and were entirely ruled by it she portioned out the hours of each day and adhered steadily to her self imposed rules to the early morning's ride succeeded her various studies of which music for which she developed a true ear and delicate taste formed one one occupation relieved the other from her dear books she had recourse to her needle and bending over her embroidery frame she meditated on what she read or occupied by many conjectures and many airy dreams concerning falkner she became absorbed in revery sometimes from the immediate object of these her memory reverted to the melancholy boy she had seen at baden his wild eyes his haughty glance his lively solicitude about the animal he had hurt and uncomplaining fortitude with which he had endured bodily pain were often present to her she wished that they had not quitted baden so suddenly if they had remained but a few days longer he might have learned to love them and even now he might be with falkner sharing his dangers it is true but also each guarding the other from that rash contempt of life in which they both indulged her whole mind being filled by duties and affection each day seemed short yet each was varied at dawn she rose lightly from her bed and looked out over the blue sea and rocky shore she prayed as she gazed for the safety of her benefactor and her thoughts soaring to her mother in heaven asked her blessing to descend upon her child morning was not so fresh as her as she met its first sweet breath and cantering along the beach she thought of falkner his absence his toils and dangers with resignation mingled with a hope that warmed into an ardent desire to see him again surely there is no object so sweet as the young in solitude in after years when death has bereaved us of the dearest when cares and regrets and fears and passions evil either in their nature or their results have stained our lives with black solitude is too sadly peopled to be pleasing and when we see one of mature years alone we believe that sadness must be the companion but the solitary thoughts of the young are glorious dreams their state like to a lark at break of day arising from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate to behold this young and lovely girl wandering by the lonely shore her thoughts her only companions love for her benefactor her only passion no touch of earth and its sordid woes about her it was as if a new eve watched over by angels had been placed in the desecrated land and the very ground she trod grew into paradise sometimes the day was sadly checkered by bad news brought from the continent of greece sometimes it was rendered joyous by the arrival of a letter from her adored father sometimes he was with her and he animated by the sense of danger and the knowledge of his usefulness to the cause he espoused was eloquent in his narrations overflowing in his affection to her and almost happy in the belief that he was atoning for the past the idea that he should fall in the fields of greece and wash out with his heart's blood the dark blot on his name gave an elevation to his thoughts a strained and eager courage and fortitude that accorded with his fiery character he was born to be a soldier not the military man of modern days but the hero who exposed his life without fear and found joy in battle and hard earned victory when these were sought and won for a good cause from the cruel oppressor chapter x during falkner's visits to zante elizabeth had been led to remark the faithful attentions of his chief follower an albanian greek this man had complained to his young mistress of the recklessness with which falkner exposed himself of the incredible fatigue he underwent and his belief that he must ere long fall a victim to his disdain of safety and repose which while it augmented the admiration his courage excited was yet not called for by the circumstances of the times he would have been termed rash and fool hardy but that he maintained a dignified composure throughout joined to military skill and fertility of resource and while contempt of life led him invariably to select the post of danger for himself he was sedulous to preserve the lives of those under his command his early life had familiarized him with the practices of war he was a valuable officer kind to his men and careful to supply their wants while he contended for no vain distinctions and was ready on all occasions to undertake such duties as others shrunk from as leading to certain death elizabeth listened to vasili's account of his hairbreadth escapes his toils and desperate valour with tearful eyes and an aching heart oh that i could attach him to life she thought she never complained to him nor persuaded him to alter his desperate purpose but redoubled her affectionate attentions when he left her after a hurried visit she did not beseech him to preserve himself but her tearful eyes the agony with which she returned his parting embrace her despondent attitude as his bark left the shore and when he returned her eager joy her eye lighted up with thankful love all bespoke emotions that needed no other interpreter and which often made him half shrink from acting up to the belief he had arrived at that he ought to die and that he could only escape worse and ignominious evils by a present and honourable death as time passed on as by the arrival of the forces from egypt the warfare grew more keen and perilous as vasili renewed the sad tale of his perils at each visit with some added story of lately and narrowly escaped peril fear began to make too large and engrossing a portion of her daily thoughts she ceased to take in the ideas as she read her needle dropped from her hand and as she played the music brought streams of tears from her eyes to think of the scene of desolation and suffering in which she felt that she should soon be called upon to take a part there was no help or hope and she must early learn the woman's first and hardest lesson to bear in silence the advance of an evil which might be avoided but for the unconquerable will of another almost she could have called her father cruel had not the remembrance of the misery that drove him to desperation inspired pity instead of selfish resentment he had passed a few days with her and the intercourse they held had been more intimate and more affectionate than ever as she grew older her mind enriched by cultivation and developed by the ardour of her attachment grew more on an equality with his experienced one than could have been the case in mere childhood they did not take the usual position of father and child the instructer and instructed the commander and the obedient they talked with open heart and tongue affectionate and true a pair of friends and the inequality which made her depend on him and caused him to regard her as the creature who was to prolong his existence as it were beyond the grave into which he believed himself to be descending gave a touch of something melancholy to their sympathy without which in this shadowy world nothing seems beautiful and enduring he left her and his little bark under press of sail sped merrily through the waves she stood to watch her heart warmed by the recollection of his fervent affection his attentive kindness he had ever been brave and generous but now he had become so sympathizing and gentle that she hoped that the time was not far off when moral courage would spring from that personal hardihood which is at once so glorious and so fearful god shield you my father she thought god preserve you my more than father for happier thoughts and better days for the full enjoyment of and control over those splendid qualities with which nature has gifted you such was the tenour of her thoughts enthusiasm mingled with fond solicitude and thus she continued her anxious watchings by every opportunity she received brief letters breathing affection yet containing no word of self sometimes a phrase occurred directing her what to do if anything fatal occurred to him which startled and pained her but there was nothing else that spoke of death nor any allusion to his distaste for life autumn was far advanced the sounds of war were somewhat lulled and except in small skirmishing parties that met and fought under cover of the ravines and woods all was quiet elizabeth felt less fearful than usual she wrote to ask when falkner would again visit her and he in reply promised so to do immediately after a meditated attack on a small fortress the carrying of which was of the first import to the safe quartering of his little troop during the winter she read this with delight she solaced herself with the prospect of a speedier and longer visit than usual with childish thoughtlessness she forgot that the attack on the town was a work of war and might bring with it the fatal results of mortal struggle a few days after a small ill looking letter was put into her hands it was written in romaic and the meaning of its illegible ciphers could only be guessed at by a greek it was from vasili to tell her in a few words that falkner was lying in a small village not far from the seacoast opposite zante it mentioned that he had been long suffering from a greek fever and having been badly wounded in the late attack the combined effects of wound and malady left little hopes of recovery while the fatal moment was hastened by the absence of all medical assistance the miserable state of the village where he was lying and the bad air of the country around elizabeth read as if in a dream the moment then had come the fatal moment which she had often contemplated with terror and prayed heaven to avert she grew pale and trembling but again in a moment she recalled her presence of mind and summoned all the resolution she had endeavoured to store up to assist her at this extremity she went herself to the chief english authority in the island and obtained an order for a vessel to bring him off instantly she embarked she neither wept nor spoke but sitting on the deck tearless and pale she prayed for speed and that she might not find him dead a few hours brought her to the desired port here a thousand difficulties awaited her but she was not to be intimidated by all the threatened dangers and only besought the people about her to admit of no excuses for delay she was accompanied by an english surgeon and a few attendants she longed to outspeed them all and yet she commanded herself to direct everything that was done nor did her heart quail when a few shot and the cry of the men about her spoke of the neighbourhood of the enemy it proved a false alarm the shots came from a straggling party of greeks salutations were exchanged and still she pushed on her only thought was let me but find him alive and then surely he will live as she passed along the sallow countenances and wasted figures of the peasants spoke of the frightful ravages of the epidemic by which falkner was attacked and the squalidness of the cabins and the filth of the villages were sights to make her heart ache at length they drew near one which the guide told her was that named by vasili on inquiring they were directed down a sort of lane to a wretched dilapidated dwelling in the courtyard of which were a party of armed greeks gathered together in a sort of ominous silence this was the abode of falkner she alighted and in a few minutes vasili presented himself his face painted with every mark of apprehension and sorrow he led her on the house was desolate beyond expression there was no furniture no glass in the windows no token of human habitation beyond the weather stained walls she entered the room where her father lay some mattresses placed on the divan were all his bed and there was nothing else in the room except a brazier to heat his food elizabeth drew near and gazed in awe and grief already he was so changed that she could scarcely know him his eyes sunk his cheeks fallen his brow streaked with pallid hues a ghastly shadow lay upon his face the apparent forerunner of death he had scarcely strength sufficient to raise his hand and his voice was hollow yet he smiled when he saw her and that smile the last refuge of the soul that informs our clay and even sometimes survives it was all his own it struck her to the heart and her eyes were dimmed with tears while vasili cast a wistful glance on her as much as to say i have lost hope thank you for coming yet you ought not to be here hoarsely murmured the sick man elizabeth kissed his hand and brow in answer and despite of all her endeavours the tears fell from her eyes on his sunken cheek again he smiled it is not so bad he said do not weep i am willing to die i do not suffer very much though i am weary of life the surgeon was now admitted he examined the wound which was of a musket bullet in his side he dressed it and administered some potion from which the patient received instant relief and then joined the anxious girl who had retired to another room he is in a very dangerous state the surgeon remarked in reply to her anxious looks nothing certain can be pronounced yet but our first care must be to remove him from this pestiferous place the fever and wound combined must destroy him change of air may produce an amelioration in the former with all the energy which was her prominent characteristic elizabeth caused a litter to be prepared horses hired and everything arranged so that their journey might be commenced at daybreak every one went early to rest to enjoy some repose before the morrow's journey except elizabeth she spent the livelong night watching beside falkner marking each change tortured by the groans that escaped him in his sleep or the suppressed complaints that fell from his lips by the restlessness and fever that rendered each moment full of fate the glimmering and dreary light of the lamp increased even the squalid and bare appearance of the wretched chamber in which he lay elizabeth gazed for a moment from the casement to see how moved the stars and there without nature asserted herself and it was the lovely land of greece that met her eyes the southern night reigned in all its beauty the stars hung refulgent lamps in the transparent ether the fire flies darted and wheeled among the olive groves or rested in the myrtle hedges flashing intermittingly and filling for an instant a small space around them with fairy brightness each form of tree of rocky fragment and broken upland lay in calm and beautiful repose she turned to the low couch on which lay all her hope her idolized father the streaked brow the nerveless hand half open eye and hard breathing betokened a frightful stage of weakness and suffering the scene brought unsought into her mind the lines of the english poet which so touchingly describes the desolation of greece blending the idea of mortal suffering with the long drawn calamities of that oppressed country the words the lines crowded on her memory and a chord was struck in her heart as she ejaculated no no not so not the first day of death not now or ever as she spoke she dissolved in tears and weeping long and bitterly she became afterward calmer the rest of her watch passed more peacefully even the patient suffered less as night verged into morning at an early hour all was ready falkner was placed in the litter and the little party gladly leaving the precincts of the miserable village proceeded slowly towards the seashore every step was replete with pain and danger elizabeth was again all herself self possessed and vigilant she seemed at once to attain years of experience no one could remember that it was a girl of sixteen who directed them hovering round the litter of the wounded man and pointing out how best to carry him so that he might suffer least as the inequalities of the ground the heights to climb and the ravines to cross made it a task of difficulty now and then the report of a musket was heard sometimes a greek cap not unoften mistaken for a turban peered above the precipice that overlooked the road frequent alarms were given but she was frightened by none her large eyes dilated and darkened as she looked towards the danger pointed out and she drew nearer the litter as a lonely mother might to the cradle of her child when in the stillness of night some ravenous beast intruded on a savage solitude but she never spoke except to point out the mistakes she was the first to perceive or to order the men to proceed lightly but without fear nor to allow their progress to be checked by vain alarms at length the seashore was gained and falkner at last placed on the deck of the vessel reposing after the torture which despite every care the journey had inflicted already elizabeth believed that he was saved and yet one glance at his wan face and emaciated figure reawakened every fear he looked and all around believed him to be a dying man chapter xi arrived at zante placed in a cool and pleasant chamber attended by a skilful surgeon and watched over by the unsleeping vigilance of elizabeth falkner slowly receded from the shadow of death whose livid hue had sat upon his countenance still health was far his wound was attended by bad symptoms and the fever eluded every attempt to dislodge it from his frame he was but half saved from the grave emaciated and feeble his disorder even tried to vanquish his mind but that resisted with more energy than his prostrate body the death he had gone out to seek he awaited with courage yet he no longer expressed an impatience of existence but struggled to support with manly fortitude at once the inroads of disease and the long nourished sickness of his soul it had been a hard trial to elizabeth to watch over him while each day the surgeon's serious face gave no token of hope but she would not despond and in the end his recovery was attributed to her careful nursing she never quitted his apartment except for a few hours' sleep and even then her bed was placed in the chamber adjoining his if he moved she was roused and at his side divining the cause of his uneasiness and alleviating it there were other nurses about him and vasili the most faithful of all but she directed them and brought that discernment and tact of which a woman only is capable her little soft hand smoothed his pillow or placed upon his brow cooled and refreshed him she scarcely seemed to feel the effects of sleepless nights and watchful days every minor sensation was merged in the hope and resolution to preserve him several months were passed in a state of the utmost solicitude at last he grew a little better the fever intermitted and the wound gave signs of healing on the first day that he was moved to an open alcove and felt some enjoyment from the soft air of evening all that elizabeth had gone through was repaid she sat on a low cushion near and his thin fingers now resting on her head now playing with the ringlets of her hair gave token by that caress that though he was silent and his look abstracted his thoughts were occupied upon her at length he said elizabeth you have again saved my life she looked up with a quick glad look and her eyes brightened with pleasure you have saved my life twice he continued and through you it seems i am destined to live i will not quarrel again with existence since it is your gift i will hope prolonged as it has been by you that it will prove beneficial to you i have but one desire now it is to be the source of happiness to you live dear father live and i must be happy she exclaimed god grant that it prove so he replied pressing her hand to his lips the prayers of such as i too often turn to curses but you my own dearest must be blessed and as my life is preserved i must hope that this is done for your sake and that you will derive some advantage from it can you doubt it said elizabeth could i ever be consoled if i lost you i have no other tie on earth no other friend nor do i wish for any only put aside your cruel thoughts of leaving me for ever and every blessing is mine dear generous faithful girl yet the time will come when i shall not be all in all to you and then will not my name my adoption prove a stumbling block to your wishes how could that happen she said but do not dear father perplex yourself with looking either forward or backward repose on the present which has nothing in it to annoy you or rather your gallantry your devotion to the cause of an injured people must inspire you with feelings of self gratulation and speak peace to your troubles let the rest of your life pass away as a dream banish quite those thoughts that have hitherto made you wretched your life is saved despite yourself accept existence as an immediate gift from heaven and begin life from this moment with new hopes new resolves whatever your error was which you so bitterly repent it belonged to another state of being your remorse your resignation has effaced it or if any evil results remain you will rather exert yourself to repair them than uselessly to lament to repair my error my crime cried falkner in an altered voice while a cloud gathered over his face no no that is impossible never till we meet in another life can i offer reparation to the dead but i must not think of this now it is too ungrateful to you to dwell upon thoughts which would deliver me over to the tomb yet one thing i would say i left a short detail in england of the miserable event that must at last destroy me but it is brief and unsatisfactory during my midnight watchings in greece i prepared a longer account you know that little rosewood box which even when dying i asked for it is now close to my bed the key is here attached to my watch chain that box contains the narrative of my crime when i die you will read it and judge me never never exclaimed elizabeth earnestly dear father how cruelly you have tormented yourself by dwelling upon and writing about the past and do you think that i would ever read accusations against you the guardian angel of my life even though written by yourself let me bring the box let me burn the papers let no word remain to tell of misery you repent and have atoned for falkner detained her as she would have gone to execute her purpose not alone for you my child he said did i write though hereafter when you hear me accused it may be satisfactory to learn the truth from my own hand but there are others to satisfy an injured angel to be vindicated a frightful mystery to be unveiled to the world i have waited till i should die to fulfil this duty and still for your sake i will wait for while you love me and bear my name i will not cover it with obloquy but if i die this secret must not die with me i will say no more now nor ask any promises when the time comes you will understand and submit to the necessity that urged me to disclosure you shall be obeyed i promise you she replied i will never set my reason above yours except in asking you to live for the sake of the poor little thing you have preserved have i preserved you dearest i often fear i did wrong in not restoring you to your natural relations in making you mine and linking you to my blighted fortunes i may have prepared unnumbered ills for you oh how sad a riddle is life we hear of the straight and narrow path of right in youth and we disdain the precept and now would i were sitting among the nameless crowd on the common road side instead of wandering blindly in this dark desolation and you i have brought you with me into the wilderness of error and suffering it was wrong it was mere selfishness yet who could foresee talk not of foreseeing said elizabeth soothingly as she pressed his thin hand to her warm young lips think only of the present you have made me yours for ever you cannot cast me off without inflicting real pangs of misery instead of those dreamy ills you speak of i am happy with you attending on being of use to you what would you more perhaps it is so replied falkner and your good and grateful heart will repay itself for all its sacrifices i never can henceforth i will be guided by you my elizabeth i will no longer think of what i have done and what yet must be suffered but wrap up my existence in you live in your smiles your hopes your affections this interchange of heartfelt emotions did good to both perplexed nay tormented by conflicting duties falkner was led by her entreaties to dismiss the most painful of his thoughts and to repose at last on those more healing the evil and the good of the day he resolved should henceforth be sufficient his duty towards elizabeth was a primary one and he would restrict himself to the performing it there is a magic in sympathy and the heart's overflowing that we feel as bliss though we cannot explain it this sort of joy elizabeth felt after this conversation with her father their hearts had united they had mingled thought and sensation and the intimacy of affection that resulted was an ample reward to her for every suffering she loved her benefactor with inexpressible truth and devotedness and their entire and full interchange of confidence gave a vivacity to this sentiment which of itself was happiness chapter xii though saved from immediate death falkner could hardly be called convalescent his wound did not heal healthily and the intermitting fever returning again and again laid him prostrate after he had acquired a little strength after a winter full of danger it was pronounced that the heats of a southern summer would probably prove fatal to him and that he must be removed without delay to the bracing air of his native country towards the end of the month of april they took their passage to leghorn it was a sad departure the more so that they were obliged to part with their greek servant on whose attachment elizabeth so much depended vasili had entered into falkner's service at the instigation of the protokleft or chief of his clan when the englishman was obliged to abandon the cause of greece and return to his own country vasili though loath and weeping went back to his native master the young girl being left without any attendant on whom she could wholly rely felt singularly desolate for as her father lay on the deck weak from the exertion of being removed she felt that his life hung by a very slender thread and she shrank half affrighted from what might ensue to her friendless and alone her presence of mind and apparent cheerfulness was never however diminished by these secret misgivings and she sat by her father's low couch and placed her hands in his speaking encouragingly while her eyes filled with tears as the rocky shores of zante became indistinct and vanished their voyage was without any ill accident except that the warm southeast wind which favoured their navigation sensibly weakened the patient and elizabeth grew more and more eager to proceed northward at leghorn they were detained by a long and vexatious quarantine the summer had commenced early with great heats and the detention of several weeks in the lazaretto nearly brought about what they had left greece to escape falkner grew worse the seabreezes a little mitigated his sufferings but life was worn away by repeated struggles and the most frightful debility threatened his frame with speedy dissolution how could it be otherwise he had wished to die he sought death where it lurked insidiously in the balmy airs of greece or met it openly armed against him on the field of battle death wielded many weapons and he was struck by many and the most dangerous elizabeth hoped in spite of despair yet if called away from him her heart throbbed wildly as she re entered his apartment there was no moment when the fear did not assail her that she might on a sudden hear and see that all was over an incident happened at this period to which elizabeth paid little attention at the time engrossed as she was by mortal fears they had been in quarantine about a fortnight when one day there entered the gloomy precincts of the lazaretto a tribe of english people such a horde of men women and children as gives foreigners a lively belief that we islanders are all mad to migrate in this way with the young and helpless from comfortable homes in search of the dangerous and comfortless this roving band consisted of the eldest son of an english nobleman and his wife four children the eldest being six years old a governess three nursery maids two lady's maids and a sufficient appendage of men servants they had all just arrived from viewing the pyramids of egypt the noise and bustle the servants insisting on making everybody comfortable where comfort was not the spreading out of all their own camp apparatus joined to the seeming indifference of the parties chiefly concerned and the unconstrained astonishment of the italians was very amusing lord cecil a tall thin plain quiet aristocratic looking man of middle age dropped into the first chair called for his writing case began a letter and saw and heard nothing that was going on lady cecil who was not pretty but lively and elegant was surrounded by her children they seemed so many little angels with blooming cheeks and golden hair the youngest cherub slept profoundly amid the din the others were looking eagerly out for their dinner elizabeth had seen their entrance she saw them walking in the garden of the lazaretto one figure the governess though disguised by a green shade over her eyes she recognised it was miss jervis desolate and sad as the poor girl was a familiar face and voice was a cordial drop to comfort her and miss jervis was infinitely delighted to meet her former pupil she usually looked on those intrusted to her care as a part of the machinery that supported her life but elizabeth had become dear to her from the irresistible attraction that hovered round her arising from her carelessness of self and her touching sensibility to the sufferings of all around she had often regretted having left her and she now expressed this and even her silence grew into something like talkativeness upon the unexpected meeting i am very unlucky she said i would rather if i could with propriety live in the meanest lodging in london than in the grandest tumbledown palace of the east which people are pleased to call so fine i am sure they are always dirty and out of order lady glenfell recommended me to lady cecil and certainly a more generous and sweet tempered woman does not exist and i was very comfortable living at the earl of g 's seat in hampshire and having almost all my time to myself one day to my misfortune lady cecil made a scheme to travel to get out of her father in law's way i believe he is rather a tiresome old man lord cecil does anything she likes all was arranged and i really thought i should leave them i so hated the idea of going abroad again but lady cecil said that i should be quite a treasure having been everywhere and knowing so many languages and that she should have never thought of going but from my being with her so in short she was very generous and i could not say no accordingly we set out on our travels and went first to portugal where i had never been and do not know a word of portuguese and then through spain and spanish is greek to me and worse for i do know a good deal of romaic i am sure i do not know scarcely where we went but our last journey was to see the pyramids of egypt only unfortunately i caught the ophthalmia the moment we got to alexandria and could never bear to see a ray of light the whole time we were in that country as they talked lady cecil came to join her children she was struck by elizabeth's beaming and noble countenance which bore the impress of high thought and elevated sentiments her figure too had sprung up into womanhood tall and graceful there was an elasticity joined to much majesty in all her appearance not the majesty of assumption but the stamp of natural grandeur of soul refined by education and softened by sympathetic kindness for the meanest thing that breathed her dignity did not spring in the slightest degree from self worship but simply from a reliance on her own powers and a forgetfulness of every triviality which haunts the petty minded no one could chance to see her without stopping to gaze and her peculiar circumstances the affectionate and anxious daughter of a dying man without friend or support except her own courage and patience never daunted yet always fearfully alive to his danger rendered her infinitely interesting to one of her own sex lady cecil was introduced to her by miss jervis and was eager to show her kindness she offered that they should travel together but as elizabeth's quarantine was out long before that of the new comers and she was anxious to reach a more temperate climate she refused yet she was thankful and charmed by the sweetness and cordiality of her new acquaintance lady cecil was not handsome but there was something not exactly amounting to fascination but infinitely taking in her manner and appearance her cheerfulness good nature and high breeding diffused a grace and a pleasurable easiness over her manners that charmed everybody good sense and vivacity never loud nor ever dull rendered her spirits agreeable she was apparently the same to everybody but she well knew how to regulate the inner spirit of her attentions while their surface looked so equal no one ventured to go beyond her wishes and where she wished any one was astonished to find how far they could depend on her sincerity and friendliness had elizabeth's spirit been more free she had been delighted as it was she felt thankful merely for a kindness that availed her nothing lady cecil viewed the dying falkner and his devoted affectionate daughter with the sincerest compassion dying she thought him for he was wasted to a shadow his cheeks colourless his hands yellow and thin he could not stand upright and when in the cool of evening he was carried into the open air he seemed scarcely able to speak from very feebleness elizabeth's face bespoke continual anxiety her vigilance her patience her grief and her resignation formed a touching picture which it was impossible to contemplate without admiration lady cecil often tried to win her away from her father's couch and to give herself a little repose from perpetual attendance she yielded but for a minute while she conversed she assumed cheerfulness but in a moment after she had glided back and taken her accustomed place at her father's pillow at length their prison gates were opened and falkner was borne on board a felucca bound for genoa elizabeth took leave of her new friend and promised to write but while she spoke she forgot what she said for dreading at each moment the death of her benefactor she did not dare look forward and had little heart to go beyond the circle of her immediate though dreary sensations a fair wind bore them to genoa and falkner sustained the journey very well at genoa they transferred themselves to another vessel and each mile they gained towards france lightened the fears of elizabeth but this portion of their voyage was not destined to be so prosperous they had embarked at night and had made some way during the first hours but by noon on the following day they were becalmed the small vessel the burning sun the shocking smells the want of all comfortable accommodation combined to bring on a relapse and again falkner seemed dying the very crew were struck with pity while elizabeth wild almost with terror and the impotent wish to save preserved an outward calm more shocking almost than shrieks and cries at evening she caused him to be carried on the deck and placed on a couch with a little sort of shed prepared for him there he was too much debilitated to feel any great degree of relief there was a ghastly hue settled on his face that seemed gradually sinking into death elizabeth's courage almost gave way there was no physician no friend the servants were frightened the crew pitying but none could help as this sense of desertion grew strong a despair she had never felt before invaded her and it was as she thus hung over falkner's couch the tears fast gathering in her eyes and striving to check the convulsive throb that rose in her throat that a gentle voice said let me place this pillow under your father's head he will rest more quietly the voice came as from a guardian angel she looked up thankfully the pillow was placed some drink administered a sail extended so as to shield him from the evening sun and a variety of little attentions paid which evidently solaced the invalid and the evening breeze rising as the sun went down the air grew cool and he sunk at last into a profound sleep when night came on the stranger conjured elizabeth to take some repose promising to watch by falkner she could not resist the entreaty which was urged with sincere earnestness going down she found a couch had been prepared for her with almost a woman's care by the stranger and before she slept he knocked at her door to tell her falkner having awoke expressed himself as much easier and very glad to hear that elizabeth had retired to rest after this he had dropped asleep again it was a new and pleasant sensation to the lone girl to feel that there was one sharing her task on whom she might rely she had scarcely looked at or attended to the stranger while on deck she only perceived that he was english and that he was young but now in the quiet that preceded her falling asleep his low melodious voice sounded sweetly in her ears and the melancholy and earnest expression of his handsome countenance reminded her of some one she had seen before probably a greek for there was something almost foreign in his olive complexion his soft dark eyes and the air of sentiment mingled with a sort of poetic fervour that characterized his countenance with these thoughts elizabeth fell asleep and when early in the morning she rose and made what haste she could to visit the little sort of hut erected for her father on deck the first person she saw was the stranger leaning on the bulwark and looking on the sea with an air of softness and sadness that excited her sympathy he greeted her with extreme kindness your father is awake and has inquired for you he said elizabeth after thanking him took her accustomed post beside falkner he might be better but he was too weak to make much sign and one glance at his colourless face renewed all her half forgotten terrors meanwhile the breeze freshened and the vessel scudded through the blue sparkling waves the heats of noon though tempered by the gale still had a bad effect on falkner and when at about five in the evening often in the south the hottest portion of the day the air being thoroughly penetrated by the sun's rays they arrived at marseilles it became a task of some difficulty to remove him elizabeth and the stranger had interchanged little talk during the day but he now came forward to assist in removing him to the boat acting without question as if he had been her brother guessing as if by instinct the best thing to be done and performing all with activity and zeal poor elizabeth cast on these difficult circumstances without relation or friend looked on him as a guardian angel consulted him freely and witnessed his exertions in her behalf in a transport of gratitude he did everything for her and would sit for hours in the room at the hotel next to that in which falkner lay waiting to hear how he was and if there was anything to be done elizabeth joined him now and then they were in a manner already intimate though strangers he took a lively interest in her anxieties and she looked towards him for advice and help relied on his counsels and was encouraged by his consolations it was the first time she had felt any friendship or confidence except in falkner but it was impossible not to be won by her new friend's gentleness and almost feminine delicacy of attention joined to all a man's activity and readiness to do the thing that was necessary to be done i have an adopted father thought elizabeth and this seems a brother dropped from the clouds he was of an age to be her brother but few years older in all the ardour and grace of early manhood when developed in one of happy nature unsoiled by the world elizabeth however remained but a few days at marseilles it was of the first necessity to escape the southern heats and falkner was pronounced able to bear the voyage up the rhone the stranger showed some sadness at the idea of being left behind in truth if elizabeth was gladdened and comforted by her new friend he felt double pleasure in the contemplation of her beauty and admirable qualities no word of self ever passed her lips all thought all care was spent on him she called her father and the stranger was deeply touched by her demonstrations of filial affection her total abnegation of every feeling that did not centre in his comfort and recovery he had been present one evening though standing apart when falkner awakening from sleep spoke with regret of the fatigue elizabeth endured and the worthlessness of his life compared with all that she went through for his sake elizabeth replied at once with such energy of affection such touching representation of the comfort she derived from his returning health and such earnest entreaties for him to love life that the stranger listened as if an angel spoke falkner answered but the remorse that burdened his heart gave something of bitterness to his reply and her eloquent though gentle solicitations that he would look on life in a better and nobler light not rashly to leave its duties here to encounter those he knew not of in an existence beyond and kind intimations which exalting his repentance into a virtue might reconcile him to himself all this won the listener to a deep and wondering admiration not in human form had he ever seen imbodied so much wisdom and so much strong yet tender emotion none but woman could feel thus but it was beyond woman to speak and to endure as she did she spoke only just so openly remembering the stranger's presence as to cast a veil over her actual relationship to falkner whom she called and wished to have believed to be her true father the fever of the sufferer being abated a day was fixed for their departure from marseilles their new friend appeared to show some inclination to accompany them in their river navigation as far as lyons elizabeth thanked him with her gladdened eyes she had felt the want of support or rather she had experienced the inestimable benefit of being supported during the sad crisis now and then brought about by falkner's changeful illness there was something too in the stranger very attractive not the less so for the melancholy which often quenched the latent fire of his nature that his disposition was really ardent and even vivacious many little incidents when he appeared to forget himself evinced nay sometimes his very gloom merged into sullen savageness that showed that coldness was not the secret of his frequent fits of abstraction once or twice on these occasions elizabeth was reminded she knew not of whom but some one she had seen before till one day it flashed across her could it be the sullen solitary boy of baden singularly enough she did not even know her new friend's name to those accustomed to foreign servants this will not appear strange he was their only visiter and le monsieur was sufficient announcement when he arrived but elizabeth remembered well that the youth's name was neville and on inquiry she learned that this also was the appellation of her new acquaintance she now regarded him with greater interest she recalled her girlish wish that he should reside with them and benefit by the kindness of falkner hoping that his sullenness would be softened and his gloom dissipated by the affectionate attentions he would receive she wished to discover in what degree time and other circumstances had operated to bring about the amelioration she had wished to be an instrument in achieving he was altered he was no longer fierce nor sullen yet he was still melancholy and still unhappy and she could discern that as his former mood had been produced by the vehemence of his character fretting against the misfortunes of his lot so it was by subduing every violence of temper that the change was operated and she suspected that the causes that originally produced his unhappiness still remained yet violence of temper is not a right word to use his temper was eminently sweet he had a boiling ardour within a fervent and a warm heart which might produce vehemence of feeling but never asperity of temper all this elizabeth remarked and as before she longed to dissipate the melancholy that so evidently clouded his mind and again she indulged fancies that if he accompanied them and was drawn near them the affection he would receive must dissipate a sadness created by unfortunate circumstances in early youth but not the growth of a saturnine disposition she pitied him intensely for she saw that he was often speechlessly wretched but she reverenced his self control and the manner in which he threw off all his own engrossing feelings to sympathize with and assist her they were now soon to depart and elizabeth was not quite sure whether neville was to accompany them he had gone to the boat to look after some arrangements made for the patient's comfort and she sat with the invalid expecting his return falkner reclined near a window clasping her hand looking on her with fondness and speaking of all he owed her and how he would endeavour to repay by living and making life a blessing to her i shall live he said i feel that this malady will pass away and i shall live to devote myself to rewarding you for all your anxieties to dissipating the cloud with which i have so cruelly overshadowed your young life and to making all the rest sunshine i will think only of you all the rest all that grieves me and all that i repent i cast even now into oblivion at this moment the stranger entered and drew near elizabeth saw him and said and here dearest father is another to whom you owe more than you can guess for kindness to me and the help to you i do not think i should have preserved you without mr neville the young man was standing near the couch looking on the invalid and rejoicing in the change for the better that appeared falkner turned his eyes on him as elizabeth spoke a tremour ran through all his limbs he grew ghastly pale and fainted an evil change from this time appeared in his state and the physician was afraid of the journey attributing his fainting to his inability to bear any excitement while falkner who was before passive grew eager to depart change of scene and moving will do me good he said so that no one comes near me no one speaks to me but elizabeth at one time the idea of neville's accompanying them was alluded to he was greatly disturbed and seriously implored elizabeth not to allow it it was rather hard on the poor girl who found so much support and solace in her new friend's society but falkner's slightest wish was with her a law and she submitted without a murmur do not let me even see him before we go said falkner act on this wish dearest without hurting his feelings without betraying to him that i have formed it it would be an ungracious return for the services he has rendered you for which i would fain show gratitude but that cannot be you alone can repay do so as you best may with thanks but do not let me see him more elizabeth wondered and as a last effort to vanquish his dislike she said do you know that he is the same boy who interested us so much at baden he is no longer savage as he was then but i fear that he is as unhappy as ever too well do i know it replied falkner do not question me do not speak to me again of him he spoke in disjointed sentences a cold dew stood on his brow and elizabeth who knew that a mysterious wound rankled in his heart more painful than any physical injury was eager to calm him something she might wonder but she thought more of sparing falkner pain than of satisfying her curiosity and she mentally resolved never to mention the name of neville again they were to embark at sunrise in the evening her new friend came to take leave she having evaded the notion of his accompanying them and insisted that he should not join them in the morning to assist at their departure though she had done this with sweetness and so much cordiality of manner as prevented his feeling any sort of slight yet in some sort he guessed that they wished to dismiss him and this notion added to his melancholy while some latent feeling made him readily acquiesce in it elizabeth was told that he had come and left falkner to join him it was painful to her to take leave to feel that she should see him no more and to know that their separation was not merely casual but occasioned by her father's choice which hereafter might again and again interfere to separate them as she entered the room he was leaning against the casement and looking on the sea which glanced before their windows still as a lake blue as the twilight sky that bent over it it was a july evening soft genial and soothing but no portion of the gladness of nature was reflected in the countenance of neville his large dark eyes seemed two wells of unfathomable sadness the drooping lids gave them an expression of irresistible softness which added interest to their melancholy earnestness his complexion was olive but so clear that each vein could be discerned his full and finely shaped lips bespoke the ardour and sensibility of his disposition while his slim youthful form appeared half bending with a weight of thought and sorrow elizabeth's heart beat as she came near and stood beside him neither spoke but he took her hand and they both felt that each regretted the moment of parting too deeply for the mere ceremony of thanks and leave taking i have grieved said neville as if answering her though no word had been said very much grieved at the idea of seeing you no more and yet it is for the best i feel and am sure you do not know the usual unhappy tenour of my thoughts nor the cause i have to look on life as an unwelcome burden this is no new sentiment it has been my companion since i was nine years old at one time before i knew how to rein and manage it it was more intolerable than now as a boy it drove me to solitude to abhorrence of the sight of man to anger against god for creating me these feelings have passed away nay more i live for a purpose a sacred purpose that shall be fulfilled despite of every obstacle every seeming impossibility too often indeed the difficulties in my way have made me fear that i should never succeed and i have desponded but never till i saw you did i know pleasure unconnected with my ultimate object with you i have been at times taken out of myself and i have almost forgotten this must not be i must resume my burden nor form one thought beyond the resolution i have made to die if need be to secure success you must not speak thus said elizabeth looking at once with pity and admiration on a face expressive of so much sensitive pride and sadness springing from a sense of injury if your purpose is a good one as i must believe that it is you will either succeed or receive a compensation from your endeavours equivalent to success we shall meet again and i shall see you happier when i am happier he said with more than his usual earnestness we shall indeed meet for i will seek you at the farthest end of the globe till then i shrink from seeing any one who interests me or from renewing sentiments of friendship which had better end here you are too good and kind not to be made unhappy by the sight of suffering and i must suffer till my end is accomplished even now i regret that i ever saw you though that feeling springs from a foolish pride for hereafter you will hear my name and if you already do not know you will learn the miserable tale that hangs upon it you will hear me commiserated you will learn why and share the feeling i would even avoid your pity judge then how loathsome it is to receive that of others and yet i must bear it or fly them as i do this will change i have the fullest confidence that one day i may throw back on others the slur now cast upon me this confidence this full and sanguine trust has altered me from what i once was it has changed the impatience the almost ferocity i felt as a boy into fortitude and resolution yes said elizabeth i remember once i saw you a long time since when i was a mere girl at baden were you not there about four years ago do you not remember falling with your horse and dislocating your wrist a tracery of strange wild thought came over the countenance of neville do i remember he cried yes and i remember a beautiful girl and i thought such would have been my sister and i had not been alone if fate if cruel inexorable horrible destiny had not deprived me of her as well as all all that made my childish existence paradise it is so and i see you again whom then my heart called sister it is strange did you give me that name said elizabeth ah if you knew the strange ideas i then had of giving you my father for your friend instead of one spoken harshly perhaps unjustly of as she spoke he grew gloomy again his eyes drooped and the expression of his face became at first despondent then proud and even fierce it reminded her more forcibly than it had ever done before of the boy of baden it is better as it is he continued much better that you do not share the evil that pursues me you ought not to be humiliated pressed down goaded to hatred and contempt farewell i grieve to leave you yet i feel deeply how it is for the best hereafter you will acknowledge your acquaintance with me when we meet in a happier hour god preserve you and your dear father as he will for your sake twice we have met the third time if sibyls' tales are true is the test of good or evil in our friendship till then farewell thus they parted had elizabeth been free from care with regard to falkner she had regretted the separation more and pondered more over the mysterious wretchedness that darkened the lives of the only two beings the inner emotions of whose souls had been opened to her as it was she returned to watch and fear beside her father's couch and scarcely to remember that a few minutes before she had been interested by another so entirely were her feelings absorbed by her affection and solicitude for him chapter xiii from this time their homeward journey was more prosperous they arrived safely at lyons and thence proceeded to basle to take advantage again of river navigation the motion of a carriage being so inimical to the invalid they proceeded down the rhine to rotterdam and crossing the sea returned at last to england after an absence of four years this journey though at first begun in terror and danger grew less hazardous at each mile they traversed towards the north and while going down the rhine falkner and his adopted daughter spent several tranquil and happy hours comparing the scenery they saw to other and distant landscapes and recalling incidents that had occurred many years ago falkner exerted himself for elizabeth's sake she had suffered so much and he had inflicted so much anguish upon her while endeavouring to free himself from the burden of life that he felt remorse at having thus trifled with the deepest emotions of her heart and anxious to recall the more pleasurable sensations adapted to her age the listless yet pleasing feelings attendant on convalescence influenced his mind also and he enjoyed a peace to which he had long been a stranger elizabeth it is true had another source of revery besides that ministered to her by her father she often thought of neville and though he was sad the remembrance of him was full of pleasure he had been so kind so sympathizing so helpful besides there was a poetry in his very gloom that added a charm to every thought spent upon him she did not only recall his conversation but conjectured the causes of his sorrow and felt deeply interested by the mystery that hung about him so young and so unhappy and he had been long so he was more miserable when they saw him roving wildly among the alsatian hills what could it mean she strove to recollect what miss jervis mentioned at that time she remembered only that he had no mother and that his father was severe and unkind yet why when nature is so full of joyousness when at the summer season vegetation basks in beauty and delight and the very clouds seem to enjoy their aerial abode in upper sky why should misery find a home in the mind of man a misery which the balmy winds will not lull nor the verdant landscape and its winding river dissipate she thought thus as she saw falkner reclining apart a cloud gathered on his brow his piercing eyes fixed in vacancy as if it beheld there a heart moving tragedy but she was accustomed to his melancholy she had ever known him as a man of sorrows he had lived long before she knew him and the bygone years were filled by events pregnant with wretchedness nay if he spoke truth with guilt but neville the young the innocent who had been struck in boyhood through no fault of his own nor any act in which he bore a part was there no remedy for him and would not friendship and kindness and the elastic spirit of youth suffice to cure his wound she remembered that he declared that he had an aim in view in which he resolved to succeed and succeeding he should be happy a noble aim doubtless for his soft eyes lighted joyously up and his face expressed a glad pride when he prognosticated ultimate triumph her heart went with him in his efforts she prayed earnestly for his success and was as sure as he that heaven would favour an object which she felt certain was generous and pure a sigh a half groan from falkner called her to his side while she meditated on these things both suffer she thought would that some link united them so that both might find relief in the accomplishment of the same resolves little did she think of the real link that existed mysterious yet adamantine that to pray for the success of one was to solicit destruction for the other a dark veil was before her eyes totally impervious nor did she know that the withdrawing it as was soon to be would deliver her over to conflicting duties sad struggles of feeling and stain her life with the dark hues that now missing her blotted the existence of the two upon earth for whom she was most interested they arrived in london falkner's fever was gone but his wound was rankling painful and even dangerous the bullet had grazed the bone and this at first neglected and afterward improperly treated now betrayed symptoms of exfoliation his sufferings were great he bore them patiently he looked on them as an atonement he had gone out in his remorse to die he was yet to live broken and destroyed and if suffered to live was it not for elizabeth's sake and having bound her fate to his what right had he to die the air of london being injurious and yet it being necessary to continue in the vicinity of the most celebrated surgeons they took a pleasant villa on wimbledon common situated in the midst of a garden and presenting to the eye that mixture of neatness seclusion and comfort that renders some of our smaller english country houses so delightful elizabeth despite her wanderings had a true feminine love of home she busied herself in adding elegance to their dwelling by a thousand little arts which seem nothing and are everything in giving grace and cheerfulness to an abode their life became tranquil and a confidence and friendship existed between them the source of a thousand pleasant conversations and happy hours one subject it is true was forbidden the name of neville was never mentioned perhaps on that very account it assumed more power over elizabeth's imagination a casual intercourse with one however interesting might have faded into the common light of day had not the silence enjoined kept him in that indistinct mysterious darkness so favourable to the processes of the imagination on every other subject the so called father and daughter talked with open heart and falkner was totally unaware of a secret growth of unspoken interest which had taken root in separation and secrecy elizabeth accustomed to fear death for one dearest to her and to contemplate its near approaches so often had something holy and solemn kneaded into the very elements of her mind that gave sublimity to her thoughts resignation to her disposition and a stirring inquiring spirit to her conversation which separated as they were from the busy and trivial duties of life took from the monotony and stillness of their existence by bringing thoughts beyond the world to people the commonplace of each day's routine falkner had not much of this but he had a spirit of observation a ready memory and a liveliness of expression and description which corrected her wilder flights and gave the interest of flesh and blood to her fairy dreams when they read of the heroes of old or the creations of the poets she dwelt on the moral to be deduced the theories of life and death religion and virtue therein displayed while he compared them to his own experience criticised their truth and gave pictures of real human nature either contrasting with or resembling those presented on the written page their lives thus spent would have been equable and pleasant but for the sufferings of falkner and as those diminished another evil arose in his eyes of far more awful magnitude they had resided at wimbledon about a year when elizabeth fell ill her medical advisers explained her malady as the effect of the extreme nervous excitement she had gone through during the last years which borne with a patience and fortitude almost superhuman had meanwhile undermined her physical strength this was a mortal blow to falkner while with self absorbed and he now felt criminal pertinacity he had sought death he had forgotten the results such acts of his might have on one so dear and innocent he had thought that when she lost him elizabeth would feel a transitory sorrow while new scenes another family and the absence of his griefs would soon bring comfort but he lived and the consequences of his resolve to die fell upon her she was his victim there was something maddening in the thought he looked at her dear face grown so pale viewed her wasting form watched her loss of appetite and nervous tremours with an impatient agony that irritated his wound and brought back malady on himself all that the physicians could order for elizabeth was change of air added to an intimation that an entirely new scene and a short separation from her father would be of the utmost benefit where could she go it was not now that she drooped and trembled at every sound that he could restore her to her father's family no time ought to be lost he was told and the word consumption mentioned the deaths of her parents gave a sting to that word which filled him with terror something must be done immediately what he knew not and he gazed on his darling whom he felt that by his own act he had destroyed with an ardour to save that he felt was impotent and he writhed beneath the thought one morning while falkner was brooding over these miserable ideas and elizabeth was vainly trying to assume a look of cheerfulness and health which her languid step and pale cheek belied a carriage entered their quiet grounds and a visiter was announced it was lady cecil elizabeth had nearly forgotten nor ever expected to see her again but that lady whose mind was at ease at the period of their acquaintance and who had been charmed by the beauty and virtues of the devoted daughter had never ceased to determine at some time to seek her and renew their acquaintance she indeed never expected to see falkner again and she often wondered what would be his daughter's fate when he died she and her family had remained abroad till the present spring when being in london she by miss jervis's assistance learned that he still lived and that they were both at wimbledon lady cecil was a welcome visiter wherever she went for there was an atmosphere of cheerful and kindly warmth around her that never failed to communicate pleasure falkner who had not seen her at leghorn and had scarcely heard her name mentioned was won at once and when she spoke with ardent praise of elizabeth and looked upon her altered appearance with undisguised distress his heart warmed towards her and he was ready to ask her assistance in his dilemma that was offered however before it was asked she heard that change of air was recommended she guessed that too great anxiety for her father had produced her illness she felt sure that her own pleasant residence and cheerful family was the best remedy that could be administered i will not be denied she said after having made her invitation that both father and daughter should pay her a visit you must come to me lord cecil is gone to ireland for two months to look after his estate there and our little julius being weakly i could not accompany him i have taken a house near hastings the air is salubrious the place beautiful i lead a domestic quiet life and i am sure miss falkner will soon be well with me as her invitation was urged with warmth and sincerity falkner did not hesitate to accept it to a certain degree he modified it by begging that elizabeth should accompany lady cecil in the first place alone as the visit was to be for two months he promised after the first was elapsed to join them he alleged various reasons for this arrangement his real one being that he had gathered from the physicians that they considered a short separation from him as essential to the invalid's recovery she acceded for she was anxious to get well and hoped that the change would restore her everything was therefore soon agreed upon and two days afterward the two ladies were on their road to hastings where lady cecil's family already was she having come to town with her husband only who by this time had set out on his irish tour i feel convinced that three days of my nursing will make you quite well said lady cecil as they were together in her travelling carriage i wish you to look as you did in italy one so young and naturally so healthy will soon recover strength you overtasked yourself and your energetic mind is too strong for your body but repose and my care will restore you i am sure we shall be very happy my children are dear little angels and will entertain you when you like and never be in your way i shall be your head nurse and miss jervis dear odd soul will act under my orders the situation of my house is enchanting and to add to our family circle i expect my brother gerard whom i am sure you will like did i ever mention him to you perhaps not but you must like gerard and you will delight him he is serious nay to say the truth sad but it is a sadness a thousand times more interesting than the gayety of commonplace worldly men it is a seriousness full of noble thoughts and affectionate feelings i never knew i never dreamed that there was a creature resembling or to be compared to him in the world till i saw you you have the same freedom from worldliness the same noble and elevated ideas feeling for others and thinking not of the petty circle of ideas that encompasses and presses down every other mind so that they cannot see or feel beyond their lilliputian selves in one thing you do not resemble gerard you though quiet are cheerful while he naturally more vivacious is melancholy you look an inquiry but i cannot tell you the cause of my brother's unhappiness for his friendship for me which i highly prize depends upon my keeping sacredly the promise i have given never to make his sorrows a topic of conversation all i can say is that they result from a sensibility and a delicate pride which is overstrained yet which makes me love him ten thousand times more dearly he is better now than he used to be and i hope that time and reason will altogether dissipate the vain regrets that imbitter his life some new some strong feeling may one day spring up and scatter the clouds i pray for this for though i love him tenderly and sympathize in his grief yet i think it excessive and deplorable and alas never to be remedied though it may be forgotten elizabeth listened with some surprise to hear of another so highly praised and yet unhappy while in her heart she thought though this sound like one to be compared to neville yet when i see him how i shall scorn the very thought of finding another as high minded kind and interesting as he she gave no utterance however to this reflection and merely asked is your brother older than you no younger he is only two and twenty but passion and grief endured almost since infancy prevented him when a child from being childish and now he has all that is beautiful in youth with none of its follies pardon my enthusiasm but you will grow enthusiastic also when you see gerard i doubt that thought elizabeth my enthusiasm is spent and i should hate myself if i could think of another as of neville this latent thought made the excessive praises which lady cecil bestowed on her brother sound almost distastefully her thoughts flew back to marseilles to his sedulous attentions their parting interview and fixed at last upon the strange emotion falkner had displayed when seeing him and his desire that his name even should not be mentioned again she wondered what this meant and her thoughts became abstracted lady cecil conjectured that she was tired and permitted her to indulge in her silent reveries chapter xiv lady cecil's house was situated on the heights that overlook fairlight bay near hastings any one who has visited that coast knows the peculiar beauty of the rocks downs and groves of fairlight the oak which clothes each dell and in a dwarf and clipped state forms the hedges imparts a richness not only to the wide landscape but to each broken nook of ground and sequestered corner the fern which grows only in contiguity to the oak giving a wild forest appearance to the glades the mansion itself was large convenient and cheerful the grounds were extensive and from points of view you could see the wide sea the more picturesque bay and the undulating varied shore that curves in towards winchelsea it was impossible to conceive a scene more adapted to revive the spirits and give variety and amusement to the thoughts elizabeth grew better as by a miracle the very day after her arrival and within a week a sensible change had taken place in her appearance as well as her health the roses bloomed in her cheeks her step regained its elasticity her spirits rose even to gayety all was new and animating lady cecil's beautiful and spirited children delighted her it was a domestic scene adorned by elegance and warmed by affection elizabeth had despite her attachment to her father often felt the weight of loneliness when left by him at zante or when his illness threw her back entirely on herself now on each side there were sweet kind faces playful tender caresses and a laughing mirth cheering in its perfect innocence the only annoyance she suffered arose from the great influx of visiters having lived a life disjoined from the crowd she soon began to conceive the hermitess delight in loneliness and the vexation of being intruded upon by the frivolous and indifferent she found that she loved friends but hated acquaintance nor was this strange her mind was quite empty of conventional frivolities she had not been at a ball twice in her life and then only when a mere child yet all had been interest and occupation to unbend with her was to converse with a friend to play with children or to enjoy the scenes of nature with one who felt their beauties with her it was hard labour she often said to talk with people with whom she had not one pursuit one taste in common often when a barouche crowded with gay bonnets appeared she stole away lady cecil could not understand this brought up in the thick of fashionable life no person of her clique was a stranger and if any odd people called on her still they were in some way entertaining or if bores bores are an integral portion of life not to be shaken off with impunity for as oysters they often retain the fairest pearls in close conjunction you are wrong said lady cecil you must not be a savage i cannot have mercy on you this little jagged point in your character must be worn off you must be as smooth and glossy in exterior as you are incalculably precious in the substance of your mind elizabeth smiled but not the less when a sleek self satisfied dowager all smiles to those she knew all impertinent scrutiny to the unknown and a train of ugly old women in embryo called for the present misses followed each honouring her with an insolent stare there was a spirit in her feet and she could not stay but hurried out into the woodland dells and with a book her own reveries and the beautiful objects around her as her companions and feeling ecstatically happy both at what she possessed and what she had escaped from thus it was one day that she deserted lady cecil who was smiling sweetly on a red faced gouty squire and listening placidly to his angry wife who was complaining that her name had been put too low down in some charity list she stole out from the glass door that opened on the lawn and delighted that her escape was secure hurried to join the little group of children whom she saw speeding beyond into the park without a bonnet miss falkner cried miss jervis yes and the sun is warm you are not using your parasol miss jervis lend it me and let us go into the shade then taking her favourite child by the hand she said come let us pay visits mamma has got some visiters so we will go and seek for some there is my lord deer and pretty lady doe ah pretty miss fawn what a nice dappled frock you have on the child was enchanted and they wandered on through the glades among the fern into a shady dell quite at the other side of the park and sat down beneath a spreading oak tree by this time they had got into a serious talk of where the clouds were going and where the first tree came from when a gentleman who had entered the park gates unperceived rode by and pulling up his horse suddenly with a start and an exclamation of surprise he and elizabeth recognised each other mr neville she cried and her heart was full in a moment of a thousand recollections of the gratitude she owed their parting scene and the many conjectures she had formed about him since they separated he looked more than pleased and the expression of gloomy abstraction which his face too often wore was lighted up by a smile that went straight to the heart he sprung from his horse gave the rein to his groom and joining elizabeth and her little companion walked towards the house explanations and surprise followed he was the praised expected brother of lady cecil how strange that elizabeth had not discovered this relationship at marseilles and yet at that time she had scarcely a thought to spare beyond falkner his recovery surprised neville and he expressed the warmest pleasure he looked with tenderness and admiration at the soft and beautiful creature beside him whose courage and unwearied assiduity had preserved her father's life it was a bewitching contrast to remember her face shadowed by fear her vigilant anxious eyes fixed on her father's wan countenance her thoughts filled with one sad fear and now to see it beaming in youthful beauty animated by the happy generous feelings which were her nature yet this very circumstance had a sad reaction upon neville his heart still bore the burden of its sorrow and he felt more sure of the sympathy of the afflicted mourner than of one who looked untouched by any adversity the sentiment was transitory for elizabeth with that delicate tact which is natural to a feeling mind soon gave such a subdued tone to their conversation as made it accord with the mysterious unhappiness of her companion when near the house they were met by lady cecil who smiled at what she deemed a sudden intimacy naturally sprung between two who had so many qualities in common lady cecil really believed them made for each other and had been anxious to bring them together for being passionately attached to her brother and grieving at the melancholy that darkened his existence she thought she had found a cure in her new friend and that the many charms of elizabeth would cause him to forget the misfortunes on which he so vainly brooded she was still more pleased when an explanation was given and she found that they were already intimate already acquainted with the claims each possessed to the other's admiration and interest and each naturally drawn to seek in the other that mirror of their better nature that touch of kindred soul which showed that they were formed to share existence or separated to pine eternally for a reunion lady cecil with playful curiosity questioned why they had concealed their being acquainted elizabeth could not well tell she had thought much of neville but first the prohibition of falkner and then the excessive praises lady cecil bestowed upon her brother chained her tongue the one had accustomed her to preserve silence on a subject deeply interesting to her the other jarred with any confidence for there would have been a comparing neville with the gerard which was indeed himself and elizabeth neither wished to have her friend depreciated nor to struggle against the enthusiasm felt by the lady for her brother the forced silence of to day on such a subject renders the silence of to morrow almost a matter of necessity and she was ashamed to mention one she had not already named it may be remarked that this sort of shame arises in all dispositions it is the seal and symbol of love shame of any kind was not akin to the sincere and ingenuous nature of elizabeth but love though young and unacknowledged will tyrannise from the first and produce emotions never felt before neville hoarded yet more avariciously the name of elizabeth there was delight in the very thought of her but he shrunk from being questioned he had resolved to avoid her for till his purpose was achieved and the aim of his existence fulfilled he would not yield to the charms of love which he felt hovered round the beautiful elizabeth sworn to a sacred duty no self centred or self prodigal passion should come between him and its accomplishment but meeting her thus unawares he could not continue guarded his very soul drank in gladness at the sight of her he remarked with joy the cheerfulness that had replaced her cares he looked upon her open brow her eyes of mingled tenderness and fire her figure free and graceful in every motion and felt that she realized every idea he had formed of feminine beauty he fancied indeed that he looked upon her as a picture that his heart was too absorbed by its own griefs to catch a thought beyond he was unmindful while he gazed of that emanation that shadow of the shape which the latin poet tells us flows from every object that impalpable impress of her form and being which the air took and then folded round him so that all he saw entered as it were into his own substance and became mingled up for evermore with his identity chapter xv three or four days passed in great tranquillity and lady cecil rejoiced that the great medicine acted so well on the rankling malady of her brother's soul it was the leafy month of june and nature was as beautiful as these lovely beings themselves who enjoyed her sweets with enthusiastic and new sprung delight they sailed on the sunny sea or lingered by the summer brooks and among the rich woodlands ignorant why all appeared robed in a brightness which before they had never observed elizabeth had little thought beyond the present hour except to wish for the time when falkner was to join them neville rebelled somewhat against the new law he obeyed but it was a slothful rebellion till on the day he was awakened from his dream of peace one morning elizabeth on entering the breakfast room found lady cecil leaning discontentedly by the window resting her cheek on her hand and her brow overcast he is gone she exclaimed it is too provoking gerard is gone a letter came and i could not detain him it will take him probably to the other end of the kingdom and who knows when we shall see him again they sat down to breakfast but lady cecil was full of discontent it is not only that he is gone she continued but the cause of his going is full of pain and care and unfortunately you cannot sympathize with me for i have not obtained his consent to confide his hapless story to you would that i might you would feel for him for us all he has been unhappy since childhood observed elizabeth he has it is true but how did you learn that has he ever told you anything i saw him many years ago at baden how wild how sullen he was unlike his present self for then there was a violence and a savageness in his gloom which has vanished poor boy said lady cecil i remember well and it is a pleasure to think that i am to a great degree the cause of the change he had no friend at that time none to love to listen to him and foster hopes which however vain diminish his torments and are all the cure he can obtain till he forgets them but what can this mean she continued starting up what can bring him back it is gerard returned she threw open the glass door and went out to meet him as he rode up the avenue he threw himself from his horse and advanced exclaiming is my father here sir boyvill no is he coming oh yes we shall see him soon i met a servant with a letter sent express the post was too slow he will be here soon he left london last night you know with what speed he travels but why this sudden visit can you not guess he received a letter from the same person containing the same account he knew i was here he comes to balk my purpose to forbid to storm to reproach to do all that he has done a thousand times before with the same success neville looked flushed and disturbed his face usually more in sorrow than in anger now expressed the latter emotion mingled with scorn and resolution he gave the letter he had received to lady cecil i am wrong perhaps in returning at his bidding since i do not mean ultimately to obey yet he charges me on my duty to hear him once again so i am come to hear to listen to the old war of his vanity with what he calls my pride his vindictiveness with my sense of duty his vituperation of her i worship and i must bear this lady cecil read the letter and neville pressed elizabeth's hand and besought her excuse while she much bewildered was desirous to leave the room at this moment the noise of a carriage was heard on the gravel he is here said neville see him first sophia tell him how resolved i am how right in my resolves try to prevent a struggle as disgraceful as vain and most so to my father since he must suffer defeat with a look of much distress lady cecil left the room to receive her new guest while elizabeth stole out by another door into the grove and mused under the shady covert on what had passed she felt curious yet saddened concord affection and sympathy are so delightful that all that disturbs the harmony is eminently distasteful family contentions are worst of all yet she would not prejudge neville he felt in its full bitterness the pain of disobeying his parent and whatever motive led to such a mode of action it hung like an eclipse over his life what it might be she could not guess but it was no ignoble self centred passion hope and joy were sacrificed to it she remembered him as she first saw him a boy driven to wildness by a sense of injury she remembered him when reason and his better nature had subdued the selfish portion of his feeling grown kind as a woman active friendly and sympathizing as few men are she recollected him by falkner's sick couch and when he took leave of her auguring that they should meet in a happier hour that hour had not yet come and she confessed to herself that she longed to know the cause of his unhappiness and wondered whether by counsel or sympathy she could bring any cure she was plunged in revery walking slowly beneath the forest trees when she heard a quick step brushing the dead leaves and fern and neville joined her i have escaped he cried and left poor sophy to bear the scoldings of an unjust and angry man i could not stay it was not cowardice but i have recollections joined to such contests that make my heart sick besides i should reply and i would not willingly forget that he is my father it must be indeed painful said elizabeth to quarrel with to disobey a parent yet there are motives that might that must excuse it do you remember the character of hamlet miss falkner perfectly it is the imbodying of the most refined the most genuine and yet the most harrowing feelings and situation that the imagination ever conceived i have read that play said neville till each word seems instinct with a message direct to my heart as if my own emotions gave a conscious soul to every line hamlet was called upon to avenge a father in execution of his task he did not spare a dearer a far more sacred name if he used no daggers with his mother he spoke them nor winced though she writhed beneath his hand mine is a lighter yet a holier duty i would vindicate a mother without judging my father without any accusation against him i would establish her innocence is this blameable what would you do miss falkner if your father were accused of a crime my father and a crime impossible exclaimed elizabeth for strange to say all the self accusations of falkner fell empty on her ear it was a virtue in him to be conscience stricken for an error of any real guilt she would have pledged her life that he was free yes impossible cried neville doubtless it is so but did you hear his name stigmatized shame attend your very kindred to him what would you do defend him prove his innocence would you not a life were well sacrificed to such a duty and to that very duty mine is devoted in childhood i rebelled against the accusation with vain but earnest indignation now i am calmer because i am more resolved but i will yield to no impediment be stopped by no difficulty not even by my father's blind commands my mother dear name dearer for the ills attached to it my angel mother shall find an unfaltering champion in her son you must not be angry he continued in reply to her look of wonder that i mention circumstances which it is customary to slur over and conceal it is shame for me to speak for you to hear my mother's name that very thought gives a keener edge to my purpose god knows what miserable truth is hidden by the veils which vanity revenge and selfishness have drawn around my mother's fate but that truth though it be a bleeding one shall be disclosed and her innocence be made as clear as the sun now shining above us it is dreadful very dreadful to be told to be persuaded that the idol of one's thoughts is corrupt and vile it is no new story it is true wives have been false to their husbands ere now and some have found excuses and sometimes been justified it is the manner makes the thing that my mother should have left her happy home which under her guardian eye was paradise have deserted me her child whom she so fondly loved and who even in that unconscious age adored her and her poor little girl who died neglected that year after year she has never inquired after us nor sent nor sought a word while following a stranger's fortune through the world that she whose nightly sleep was broken by her tender cares whose voice so often lulled me and whose every thought and act was pure as an angel's that she tempted by the arch fiend strayed from hell for her destruction should leave us all to misery and her own name to obloquy no no the earth is yet sheltered by heaven and sweet and good things abide in it and she was and is among them sweetest and best neville was carried away by his feelings while elizabeth overpowered by his vehemence astonished by the wild strange tale he disclosed listened in silence yet an eloquent silence for her eyes filled with tears and her heart burned in her bosom with a desire to show how entirely she shared his deep emotion i have made a vow he continued it is registered in heaven and each night as i lay my head on my pillow i renew it and beside you the best of earthly things now that my dear mother is gone i repeat that i devote my life to vindicate her who gave me life and my selfish revengeful father is here to impede to forbid but i trample on such obstacles as on these dead leaves beneath our feet you do not speak miss falkner did you ever hear of mrs neville i have spent all my life out of england replied elizabeth yet i have some recollection i do not doubt it to the ends of the earth the base minded love to carry the tale of slander and crime you have heard of mrs neville who for the sake of a stranger deserted her home her husband her helpless children and has never been heard of since who unheard and undefended was divorced from her husband whose miserable son was brought to witness against her it is a story well fitted to raise vulgar wonder vulgar abhorrence do you wonder that i who since i was nine years old have slept and waked on the thought should have been filled with hate rancour and every evil passion till the blessed thought dawned on my soul that i would prove her innocence and that she should be avenged for this i live and now i must leave you i received yesterday a letter which promises a clew to guide me through this labyrinth wherever it leads there i follow my father has come to impede me but i have after using unavailing remonstrance told him that i will obey a sense of duty independent of parental authority i do not mean to see him again i now go but i could not resist the temptation of seeing you before i went and proving to you the justice of my resolves if you wish for further explanation ask sophia tell her that she may relate all there is not a thought or act of my life with which i would have you unacquainted if you will deign to listen thank you for this permission said elizabeth lady cecil is desirous i know of telling me the cause of a melancholy which good and kind as you are you ought not to suffer alas this is a miserable world and when i hear of your sorrows and remember my dear father's i think that i must be stone to feel no more than i do and yet i would give my life to assist you in your task i know well how generous you are though i cannot now express how my heart thanks you i will return before you leave my sister wherever fate and duty drives me i will see you again they returned towards the house and he left her his horse was already saddled and standing at the door he was on it and gone in a moment elizabeth felt herself as in a dream when he was gone yet her heart and wishes went with him for she believed the truth of all he said and revered the enthusiasm of affection that impelled his actions there was something wild and proud in his manner which forcibly reminded her of the boy of sixteen who had so much interested her girlish mind and his expressions indignant and passionate as they were yet vouched by the very sentiment they conveyed for the justice of his cause gallant noble hearted being god assist your endeavours god and every good spirit that animates this world thus her soul spoke as she saw him ride off and turning into the house a half involuntary feeling made her take up the volume of shakspeare containing hamlet and she was soon buried not only in the interest of the drama itself but in the various emotions it excited by the association it now bore to one she loved more even than she knew it was nothing strange that neville essentially a dreamer and a poet should have identified himself with the prince of denmark while the very idea that he took to himself and acted on sentiments thus high souled and pure adorned him yet more in her eyes endowing him in ample measure with that ideality which the young and noble love to bestow on the objects of their attachment after a short time she was interrupted by lady cecil who looked disturbed and vexed she said little except to repine at gerard's going and sir boyvill's stay he also was to depart the following morning but sir boyvill was a man who made his presence felt disagreeably even when it was limited to a few hours strangers acknowledged this no one liked the scornful morose old man and a near connexion who was open to so many attacks and sincerely loved one whom sir boyvill pretended most to depreciate was even more susceptible to the painful feelings he always contrived to spread round him to despise everybody to contradict everybody with marks of sarcasm and contempt to set himself up for an idol and yet to scorn his worshippers these were the prominent traits of his character added to a galled and sore spirit which was for ever taking offence which discerned an attack in every word and was on the alert to repay these fancied injuries with real and undoubted insult he had been a man of fashion and retained as much good breeding as was compatible with a techy and revengeful temper this was his only merit he was nearly seventy years of age remarkably well preserved but with strongly marked features and a countenance deeply lined set off by a young looking wig which took all venerableness from his appearance without bestowing juvenility his lips were twisted into a sneer and there was something in his evident vanity that might have provoked ridicule but that traces of a violent unforgiving temper prevented him from being merely despicable while they destroyed every particle of compassion with which he might have been regarded for he was a forlorn old man separating himself from those allied to him by blood or connexion excellent as they were his only pleasure had been in society secluding himself from that or presenting himself only in crowds where he writhed to find that he went for nothing he was miserable yet not to be comforted for the torments he endured were integral portions of his own nature he looked surprised to see elizabeth and was at first very civil to her with a sort of oldfashioned gallantry which had it been good humoured might have amused but as it was appeared forced misplaced and rendered its object very uncomfortable whatever lady cecil said he contradicted he made disagreeable remarks about her children prophesying in them so much future torment and when not personally impertinent amused them by recapitulating all the most scandalous stories rife in london of unfaithful wives and divided families absolutely gloating with delight when he narrated anything peculiarly disgraceful after half an hour elizabeth quite hated him and he extended the same sentiment to her on her bestowing a meed of praise on his son yes he said in reply gerard is a very pleasant person if i said he was half madman half fool i should certainly say too much and appear an unkind father but the sort of imbecility that characterizes his understanding is i think only equalled by his self willed defiance of all laws which society has established in conduct he very much resembles a lunatic armed with a weapon of offence which he does not fear himself and deals about on those unfortunately connected with him with the same indifference to wounds on this speech lady cecil coloured and rose from the table and her friend gladly followed leaving sir boyvill to his solitary wine never had elizabeth experienced before the intolerable weight of an odious person's society she was stunned we have but one resource said lady cecil you must sit down to the piano sir boyvill is too polite not to entreat you to play on and too weary not to fall asleep he is worse than ever but he is your father cried elizabeth astonished no thank heaven said lady cecil what could have put that into your head oh i see i call gerard my brother sir boyvill married my poor mother who is since dead we are only connected i am happy to say there is no drop of his blood in my veins but i hear him coming do play something of herz the noise will drown every other sound and even astonish my father in law the evening was quickly over for sir boyvill retired early the next morning he was gone and the ladies breathed freely again it is impossible to attempt to describe the sort of moral nightmare the presence of such a man produces do you remember in madame de svign's letters said lady cecil where she observes that disagreeable society is better than good because one is so pleased to get rid of it in this sense sir boyvill is the best company in the whole world we will take a long drive to day to get rid of the last symptoms of the sir boyvill fever and you will tell me what all this mystery means said elizabeth mr neville gave some hints yesterday but referred me to you you may tell me all yes i am aware replied lady cecil this one good at least i have reaped from sir boyvill's angry visit i am permitted to explain to you the causes of our discord and of dear gerard's sadness i shall win your sympathy for him and exculpate us both it is a mournful tale full of unexplainable mystery shame and dreaded ill it fills me perpetually with wonder and regret nor do i see any happy termination except in the oblivion in which i wish that it was buried here is the carriage we will not take any of the children with us that we may suffer no interruption elizabeth's interest was deeply excited and she was as eager to listen as her friend to tell the story outlasted a long drive it was ended in the dusky twilight as they sat after dinner looking out on the summer woods while the stars came out twinkling amid the foliage of the trees and the deer kept close to graze the hour was still and was rendered solemn by a tale as full of heartfelt sorrow and generous enthusiasm as ever won maiden's attention and bespoke her favour for him who loved and suffered chapter xvi lady cecil began i have already told you that though i call gerard my brother and he possesses my sisterly affection we are only connexions by marriage and not the least related in blood his father married my mother but gerard is the offspring of a former marriage as i am also sir boyvill's first wife is the unfortunate lady who is the heroine of my tale sir boyvill then mr neville for he inherited his baronetcy only a few years ago had advanced beyond middle age when he first married he was a man of the world and of pleasure and being also clever handsome and rich had great success in the circles of fashion he was often involved in liaisons with ladies whose names were rife among the last generation for loving notoriety and amusement better than duty and honour as he made a considerable figure he conceived that he had a right to entertain a high opinion of himself and not without some foundation his good sayings were repeated his songs were set to music and sung with enthusiasm in his own set he was courted and feared favoured by women imitated by men he reached the zenith of a system any connexion with which is considered as enviable he was some five and forty when he fell in love and married like many dissipated men he had a mean idea of female virtue and especially disbelieved that any portion of it was to be found in london so he married a country girl without fortune but with beauty and attractions sufficient to justify his choice i never saw his lady but several of her early friends have described her to me she was something like gerard yet how unlike in the colour of the eyes and hair and the formation of the features they resembled but the expression was wholly different her clear complexion was tinged by a pure blood that ebbed and flowed rapidly in her veins driven by the pulsations of her soul rather than of her body her large dark eyes were irresistibly brilliant and opened their lids on the spectator with an effect such as the sun has when it drops majestically below a heavy cloud and dazzles the beholder with its unexpected beams she was vivacious nay wild of spirit but though raised far above the dull monotony of common life by her exuberant joyousness of soul yet every thought and act was ruled by a pure unsullied heart her impulses were keen and imperative her sensibility true to the touch of nature was tremblingly alive but their more dangerous tendencies were guarded by excellent principles and a truth never shadowed by a cloud her generous and confiding heart might be duped might spring forward too eagerly and she might be imprudent but she was never false an ingenuous confession of error if ever she fell into it purged away all suspicion that anything mysterious or forbidden lurked in her most thoughtless acts other women who like her are keenly sensitive and who are driven by ungovernable spirits to do what they afterward repent and are endowed as she was with an aptitude to shame when rebuked guard their dignity or their fears by falsehood and while their conduct is essentially innocent immesh themselves in such a web of deceit as not only renders them absolutely criminal in the eyes of those who detect them but in the end hardens and perverts their better nature alithea neville never sheltered herself from the consequences of her faults rather she met them too eagerly acknowledged a venial error with too much contrition and never rested till she had laid her heart bare to her friend and judge and vindicated its every impulse to this admirable frankness soft tenderness and heart cheering gayety was added a great store of common sense her fault if fault it could be called was a too earnest craving for the sympathy and affection of those she loved to obtain this she was unwearied nay prodigal in her endeavours to please and serve her generosity was a ready prompter while her sensibility enlightened her she sought love and not applause and she obtained both from all who knew her to sum up all with the mention of a defect though she could feel the dignity which an adherence to the dictates of duty imparts yet sometimes going wrong sometimes wounded by censure and always keenly alive to blame she had a good deal of timidity in her character she was so susceptible to pain that she feared it too much too agonizingly and this terror of meeting anything harsh or grating in her path rendered her too diffident of herself too submissive to authority too miserable and too yielding when anything disturbed the harmony with which she desired to be surrounded it was these last qualities probably that led her to accept mr neville's offer her father wished it and she obeyed he was a retired lieutenant in the navy sir boyvill got him raised to the rank of post captain and what naval officer but would feel unbounded gratitude for such a favour he was appointed to a ship sailed and fell in an engagement not many months after his daughter's marriage grateful even in his last moments that he died commanding the deck of a man of war meanwhile his daughter bore the effects of his promotion in a less gratifying way yet at first she loved and esteemed her husband he was not then what he is now he was handsome and his good breeding had the polish of the day he was popular through a sort of liveliness which passes for wit though it was rather a conventional ease in conversation than the sparkle of real intellect besides he loved her to idolatry whatever he is now still vehemence of passion forms his characteristic and though the selfishness of his disposition gave an evil bias even to his love yet it was there and for a time it shed its delusions over his real character while her artless and sweet caresses could create smiles while he played the slave at her feet or folded her in his arms with genuine and undisguised transport even his darker nature was adorned by the to him alien and transitory magic of love but marriage too soon changed sir boyvill for the worse close intimacy disclosed the distortions of his character he was a vain and a selfish man both qualities rendered him exacting in the extreme and the first gave birth to the most outrageous jealousy alithea was too ingenuous for him to be able to entertain suspicions but his jealousy was nourished by the difference of their age and temper she was nineteen in the first bloom of loveliness in the freshest spring of youthful spirits too innocent to suspect his doubts too kind in her most joyous hour to fancy that she could offend he was a man of the world a thousand times had seen men duped and women deceive he did not know of the existence of a truth as spotless and uncompromising as existed in alithea's bosom he imagined that he was marked out as the old husband of a young wife he feared that she would learn that she might have married more happily and desirous of engrossing her all to himself a smile spent on another was treason to the absolute nature of his rights at first she was blind to his bad qualities a thousand times he frowned when she was gay a thousand times ill humour and cutting reproofs were the results of her appearing charming to others before she discovered the selfish and contemptible nature of his passion and became aware that to please him she must blight and uproot all her accomplishments all her fascinations that she must for ever curb her wish to spread happiness around that she the very soul of generous unsuspecting goodness must become cramped in a sort of bed of procrustes now having one portion lopped off and then another till the maimed and half alive remnant should resemble the soulless niggard tyrant whose every thought and feeling centred in his lilliputian self that she did at last make this discovery cannot be doubted though she never disclosed her disappointment nor complained of the tyranny from which she suffered she grew heedful not to displease guarded in her behaviour to others and so accommodated her manner to his wishes as showed that she feared but concealed that she no longer esteemed him a new reserve sprang up in her character which after all was not reserve for it was only the result of her fear to give pain and of her unalterable principles had she spoken of her husband's faults it would have been to himself but she had no spirit of governing and quarrelling and contention were the antipodes of her nature if indeed this silent yielding to her husband's despotism was contrary to her original frankness it was a sacrifice made to what she esteemed her duty and never went beyond the silence which best becomes the injured it cannot be doubted that she was alive to her husband's faults generous she was restrained by his selfishness enthusiastic she was chilled by his worldly wisdom sympathetic she was rebuked by a jealousy that demanded every feeling she was like a poor bird that with untired wing would mount gayly to the skies when on each side the wires of the aviary impede its flight still it was her principle that we ought not to endeavour to form a destiny for ourselves but to act well our part on the scene where providence has placed us she reflected seriously and perhaps sadly for the first time in her life and she formed a system for herself which would give the largest extent to the exercise of her natural benevolence and yet obviate the suspicions and cure the fears of her narrow minded self engrossed husband in pursuance of her scheme she made it her request that they should take up their residence entirely at their seat in the north of england giving up london society and transforming herself altogether into a country lady in her benevolent schemes in the good she could there do and in the few friends she could gather round her against whom her husband could form no possible objection she felt certain of possessing a considerable share of rational happiness exempt from the hurry and excitement of town for which her sensitive and ardent mind rendered her very unfit under the guidance of a man who at once desired that she should hold a foremost place and was yet disturbed by the admiration which she elicited sir boyvill complied with seeming reluctance but real exultation he possesses a delightful seat in the southern part of cumberland here amid a simple hearted peasantry and in a neighbourhood where she could cultivate many social pleasures she gave herself up to a life which would have been one of extreme happiness had not the exactions the selfishness the uncongenial mind of sir boyvill debarred her from the dearest blessings of all sympathy and friendship with the partner of her life still she was contented her temper was sweet and yielding she did not look on each cross in circumstance as an injury or a misfortune but rather as a call on her philosophy which it was her duty to meet cheerfully her heart was too warm not to shrink with pain from her husband's ungenerous nature but she had a resource to which she gave herself up with ardour she turned the full but checked tide of affections from her husband to her son gerard was all in all to her her hope her joy her idol and he returned her love with more than a child's affection his sensibility developed early and she cultivated it perhaps too much she wished to secure a friend and the temptation afforded by the singular affectionateness of his disposition and his great intelligence was too strong mr neville strongly objected to the excess to which she carried her maternal cares and augured ill of the boy's devotion to her but here his interference was vain the mother could not alter and the child standing at her side eyed his father even then with a sort of proud indignation on his daring to step in between them to mrs neville this boy was as an angel sent to comfort her she could not bear that any one should attend on him except herself she was his playmate and instructress when he opened his eyes from sleep his mother's face was the first he saw she hushed him to rest at night did he hurt himself she flew to his side in agony did she utter one word of tender reproach it curbed his childish passions on the instant he seldom left her side but she was young enough to share his pastimes her heart overflowed with its excess of love and he even as a mere child regarded her as something to protect as well as worship mr neville was angry and often reproved her too great partiality though by degrees it won some favour in his eyes gerard was his son and heir and he might be supposed to have a share in the affection lavished on him he respected also the absence of frivolous vanity that led her to be happy with her child contented away from london satisfied in fulfilling the duties of her station though his eyes only were there to admire he persuaded himself that there must exist much latent attachment towards himself to reconcile her to this sort of exile and her disinterestedness received the reward of his confidence he who never before believed or respected woman he began to yield to her more than he was wont and to consider that he ought now and then to show some approbation of her conduct when gerard was about six years old they went abroad on a tour travelling was a mode of passing the time that accorded well with mr neville's matrimonial view of keeping his wife to himself in the travelling carriage he only was beside her in seeing sights he who had visited italy before and had some taste could guide and instruct her and short as their stay in each town was there was no possibility of forming serious attachments or lasting friendships at the same time his vanity was gratified by seeing his wife and son admired by strangers and natives while abroad mrs neville bore another child a little girl this added greatly to her domestic happiness her husband grew extremely fond of his baby daughter there was too much difference of age to set her up as a rival to gerard she was by contradistinction the father's darling it is true but this rather produced harmony than discord for the mother loved both children too well to feel hurt by the preference and softened by having an object he really loved to lavish his favour on sir boyvill grew much more of a tender father and indulgent husband than he had hitherto shown himself chapter xvii it was not until a year after their return from abroad that the events happened which terminated so disastrously mrs neville's career in her own family i am perplexed how to begin the narration the story is so confused and obscure the mystery that envelops the catastrophe so impenetrable the circumstances that we really know so few and these gleaned as it were ear by ear as dropped in the passage of the event so making if you will excuse my rustic metaphor a meager ill assorted sheaf mrs neville had been a wife nearly ten years never had she done one act that could be disapproved by the most circumspect never had she swerved from that veracity and open line of conduct which was a safeguard against the mingled ardour and timidity of her disposition it required extraordinary circumstances to taint her reputation as to say the least it is tainted and we are still in the dark as to the main instrument by which these circumstances were brought about their result is too obvious at one moment mrs neville was an honoured and beloved wife a mother whose heart's pulsations depended on the well being of her children and whose fond affection was to them as the sun's warmth to the opening flower at the next where is she silence and mystery wrap her from us and surmise is busy in tracing shapes of infamy from the fragments of truth that we can gather on the return of the family from abroad they again repaired to their seat of dromore and at the time to which i allude mr neville had left them there to go to london on business he went for a week but his stay was prolonged to nearly two months he heard regularly from his wife her letters were more full of her children and household than herself but they were kind and her maternal heart warmed as she wrote into anticipations of future happiness in her children greater even than she now enjoyed every line breathed of home and peace every word seemed to emanate from a mind in which lurked no concealed feeling no one thought unconfessed or unapproved to such a home cheered by so much beauty and excellence sir boyvill returned as he declares with eager and grateful affection the time came when he was expected at home and true both to the day and to the hour he arrived it was at eleven at night his carriage drove through the grounds the doors of the house were thrown open several eager faces were thrust forward with more of curiosity and anxiety than is at all usual in an english household and as he alighted the servants looked aghast and exchanged glances of terror the truth was soon divulged at about six in the evening mrs neville who dined early in the absence of her husband had gone to walk in the park with gerard since then neither had returned when the darkness which closed in with a furious wind and thunder storm rendered her prolonged absence a matter of solicitude the servants had gone to seek her in the grounds they found their mistress's key in the lock of a small masked gate that opened on a green lane they went one way up the lane to meet her but found no trace they followed the other with like ill success again they searched the park with more care and again resorted to the lanes and fields but in vain the obvious idea was that she had taken shelter from the storm and a horrible fear presented itself that she might have found no better retreat than a tree or hay rick and that she had been struck by the lightning a slight hope remained that she had gone along the high road to meet her husband and would return with him his arrival alone took from them this last hope the country was now raised servants and tenants were sent divers ways some on horseback some on foot though summer time the night was inclement and tempestuous a furious west wind swept the earth high trees were bowed to the ground and the blast howled and roared at once baffling and braving every attempt to hear cries or distinguish sounds dromore is situated in a beautiful but wild and thinly inhabited part of cumberland on the verge of the plain that forms the coast where it first breaks into uplands dingles and ravines there is no high road towards the sea but as they took the one that led to lancaster they approached the ocean and the distant roar of its breakers filled up the pauses of the gale it was on this road at the distance of some five miles from the house that gerard was found he was lying on the road in a sort of stupor which could be hardly called sleep his clothes were drenched by the storm and his limbs stiff from cold when first found and disturbed he looked wildly around and his cry was for his mother terror was painted in his face and his intellects seemed deranged by a sudden and terrific shock he was taken home his father hurried to him questioning him eagerly but the child only raved that his mother was being carried from him and his pathetic cry of 'come back mamma stop stop for me' filled every one with terror and amazement as speedily as possible medical assistance was sent for the physician found the boy in a high fever the result of fright exposure to the storm and subsequent sleep in his wet clothes in the open air it was many days before his life could be answered for or the delirium left him and still he raved that his mother was being carried off and would not stop for him and often he tried to rise from his bed under the notion of pursuing her at length consciousness returned consciousness of the actual objects around him mingled with an indistinct recollection of the events that immediately preceded his illness his pulse was calm his reason restored and he lay quietly with open eyes fixed on the door of his chamber at last he showed symptoms of uneasiness and asked for his mother mr neville was called as he had desired he might be the moment his son showed signs of being rational gerard looked up in his father's face with an expression of disappointment and again murmured 'send mamma to me' fearful of renewing his fever by awakening his disquietude his father told him that mamma was tired and asleep and could not be disturbed 'then she has come back' he cried 'that man did not take her quite away the carriage drove here at last' such words renewed all their consternation afraid of questioning the child himself lest he should terrify him mr neville sent the nurse who had been with him from infancy to extract information his story was wild and strange and here i must remark that the account drawn from him by the woman's questions differs somewhat from that to which he afterward adhered though not so much in actual circumstances as in the colouring given this his father attributes to his subsequent endeavours to clear his mother from blame while he asserts and i believe with truth that time and knowledge by giving him an insight into motives threw a new light on the words and actions which he remembered and that circumstances which bore one aspect to his ignorance became clearly visible in another when he was able to understand the real meaning of several fragments of conversation which had at first been devoid of sense all that he could tell during this first stage of inquiry was that his mother had taken him to walk with her in the grounds that she had unlocked the gate that opened out on the lane with her own key and that a gentleman was without waiting had he ever seen the gentleman before never he did not know him and the stranger took no notice of him he heard his mamma call him rupert his mother took the stranger's arm and walked on through the lane while he sometimes ran on before and sometimes remained at her side they conversed earnestly and his mother at one time cried he gerard felt very angry with the gentleman for making her cry and took her hand and begged her to leave him and come away but she kissed the boy told him to run on and they would return very soon yet they did not return but walked on to where the lane was intersected by the high road here they stopped and continued to converse but it seemed as if she were saying good by to the stranger when a carriage driven at full speed was seen approaching it stopped close to them it was an open carriage a sort of calche with the head pulled forward low down as it stopped his mother went up to it when the stranger pulling the child's hand from hers hurried her into the carriage and sprang in after crying out to him 'jump in my boy' but before he could do so the postillion whipped the horses who started forward almost with a bound and were in a gallop on the instant he heard his mother scream the words 'my child my son' reached his ears shrieked in agony he ran wildly after the carriage it disappeared but still he ran on it must stop somewhere and he would reach it his mother had called for him and thus crying breathless panting he ran along the high road the carriage had long been out of sight the sun had set the wind rising in gusts brought on the thunder storm yet still he pursued till nature and his boyish strength gave way and he threw himself on the ground to gain breath at every sound which he fancied might be that of carriage wheels he started up but it was only the howling of the blast in the trees and the hoarse muttering of the now distant thunder twice and thrice he rose from the earth and ran forward till wet through and utterly exhausted he lay on the ground weeping bitterly and expecting to die this was all his story it produced a strict inquiry among the servants and then circumstances scarcely adverted to were remembered and some sort of information gained about a week or ten days before a gentleman on horseback unattended by any servant had called he asked for mrs neville the servant requested his name but he muttered that it was no matter he was ushered into the room where their mistress was sitting he stayed at least two hours and when he was gone they remarked that her eyes were red as if she had been weeping the stranger called again and mrs neville was denied to him inquiries were now instituted in the neighbourhood one or two persons remembered something of a stranger gentleman who had been seen riding about the country mounted on a fine bay horse one evening he was seen coming from the masked gate in the park which caused it to be believed that he was on a visit at dromore nothing more was known of him the servants tasked themselves to remember more particularly the actions of their lady and it was remembered that one evening she went to walk alone in the grounds some accident having prevented gerard from accompanying her she returned very late at ten o'clock and there was her maid declared a good deal of confusion in her manner she threw herself on a sofa ordered the lights to be taken away and remained alone for two hours past her usual time for retiring for the night till at last her maid ventured in to ask her if she needed anything she was awake and when lights were brought had evidently been weeping after this she only went out in the carriage with the children until the fatal night of her disappearance it was remembered also that she received several letters brought by a strange man who left them without waiting for any answer she received one the very morning of the day when she left her home and this last note was found it threw some light on the fatal mystery it was only dated with the day of the week and began abruptly 'on one condition i will obey you i will never see you more i will leave the country i will forget my threats against the most hated life in the world he is safe on one condition you must meet me this evening i desire to see you for the last time come to the gate of your park that opens on the lane which you opened for me a few nights ago you will find me waiting outside i will not detain you long a farewell to you and to my just revenge shall be breathed at once if you do not come i will wait till night till i am past hope and then enter your grounds wait till he returns and oh do not force me to say what you will call wicked and worse than unkind but come come and prevent all ill i charge you come and hereafter you shall if you please be for ever delivered from your 'rupert on this letter she went yet in innocence for she took her child with her could any one doubt that she was betrayed carried off the victim of the foulest treachery no one did doubt it police were sent from london the country searched the most minute inquiries set on foot sometimes it was supposed that a clew was found but in the end all failed month after month passed hope became despair pity merged into surmise and condemnation quickly followed if she had been carried forcibly from her home still she could not forever be imprisoned and debarred from all possibility at least of writing she might have sent tidings from the ends of the earth nay it was madness to think that she could be carried far against her own will in any town in any village she might appeal to the justice and humanity of her fellow creatures and be set free she would not have remained with the man of violence who had torn her away unless she had at last become a party in his act and lost all right to return to her husband's roof such suspicions began to creep about rather felt in men's minds than inferred in their speech till her husband first uttered the fatal word and then as if set free from a spell each one was full of indignation at her dereliction and his injuries sir boyvill was beyond all men vain vanity rendered him liable to jealousy and when jealous full of sore and angry feelings his selfishness and unforgiving nature which had been neutralized by his wife's virtues now quickened by the idea of her guilt burst forth and engrossed every other emotion he was injured there where the pride of man is most accessible branded by pity the tale of the world he had feared such a catastrophe during the first years of his wedded life being conscious of the difference which age and nature had placed between him and his wife in the recesses of his heart he had felt deeply grateful to her for having dissipated these fears from the moment that her prudent conduct had made him secure he had become another man as far as his defective nature and narrow mind permitted he had grown virtuous and disinterested but this fabric of good qualities was the result of her influence and it was swept away and utterly erased from the moment she left him and that love and esteem were exchanged for contempt and hatred soon very soon had doubts of his wife's allegiance and a suspicion of her connivance insinuated themselves like all evilly inclined persons he jumped at once into a belief of the worst her taking her son with her was a mere contrivance or worse since her design had probably been to carry him with her a design frustrated by accident and the lukewarmness of her lover on that point the letter left behind he looked on as a fabrication left there to gloss over her conduct he forgot her patient goodness her purity of soul her devoted attachment to her children her truth and attributed at once the basest artifice the grossest want of feeling want of feeling in her she whose pulses quickened and whose blushes were called up at a word she who idolized her child even to a fault and whose tender sympathy was alive to every call but these demonstrations of sensibility grew into accusations her very goodness and guarded propriety were against her why appear so perfect except to blind why seclude herself except from fears which real virtue need never entertain why foster the morbid sensibility of her child except from a craving for that excitement which is a token of depravity in this bad world we are apt to consider every deviation from stony apathy as tending at last to the indulgence of passions against which society has declared a ban and thus with poor alithea all could see it was said that a nature so sensitive must end in ill at last and that if tempted she must yield to an influence which few even of the coldest natures can resist while sir boyvill revolved these thoughts he grew gloomy and sullen at first his increased unhappiness was attributed to sorrow but a little word betrayed the real source a little word that named his wife with scorn that word turned the tide of public feeling and she who had been pitied and wept as dead was now regarded as a voluntary deserter from her home her virtues were remembered against her and surmises which before would have been reprobated almost as blasphemy became current as undoubted truths it was long before gerard became aware of this altered feeling the minds of children are such a mystery to us they are so blank yet so susceptible of impression that the point where ignorance ends and knowledge is perfected is an enigma often impossible to solve from the time that he rose from his sick bed the boy was perpetually on the watch for intelligence eagerly inquiring what discoveries were made what means were used for what hopes entertained of his mother's rescue he had asked his father whether he should not be justified in shooting the villain who had stolen her if ever he met him he had shed tears of sorrow and pity until indignation swallowed up each softer feeling and a desire to succour and to avenge became paramount his dear dear mother that she should be away kept from him by force that he could not find not get at her were ideas to incense his young heart to its very height of impatience and rage every one seemed too tame too devoid of expedients and energy it appeared an easy thing to measure the whole earth step by step and inch by inch leaving no portion uninspected till she was found and liberated he longed to set off on such an expedition it was his dream by night and day and he communicated these bursting feelings to every one with an overflowing eloquence inexpressibly touching from its truth and earnestness suddenly he felt the change perhaps some officious domestic suggested the idea he says himself it came on him as infection may be caught by one who enters an hospital he saw it in the eyes he felt it in the air and manner of all his mother was believed to be a voluntary fugitive of her own accord she went and never would return at the thought his heart grew sick within him 'to see his nobleness conceiving the dishonour of his mother he straight declined upon't drooped took it deeply fastened and fixed the shame on't in himself threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep and downright languished' he refused food and turned in disgust from every former pursuit hitherto he had ardently longed for the return of his mother and it seemed to him that give his limbs but a manlier growth let a few years go over and he should find and bring her back in triumph but that contumely and disgrace should fall on that dear mother's head how could he avert that the evil was remediless and death was slight in comparison one day he walked up to his father and fixing his clear young eyes upon him said 'i know what you think but it is not true mamma would come back if she could when i am a man i will find and bring her back and you will be sorry then' what more he would have said was lost in sobs his heart had beat impetuously as he had worked on himself to address his father and assert his mother's truth but the consciousness that she was indeed gone and that for years there was no hope of seeing her broke in his throat swelled he felt suffocated and fell down in a fit chapter xviii lady cecil had broken off her tale on their return from their morning drive she resumed it in the evening as she and elizabeth sat looking on the summer woods and the soft but dim twilight better accorded with her melancholy story poor gerard his young heart was almost broken by struggling passions and the want of tenderness in those about him after this scene with his father his life was again in the greatest danger for some days but at last health of body returned he lay on his little couch pale and wasted an altered child but his heart was the same and he adhered tenaciously to one idea 'nurse' he said one day to the woman who had attended him from his birth 'i wish you would take pen and paper and write down what i am going to say or if that is too much trouble i wish you would remember every word and repeat it to my father i cannot speak to him he does not love mamma as he used he is unjust and i cannot speak to him but i wish to tell every little thing that happened that people may see that what i say is true and be as sure as i am that mamma never meant to go away 'when we met the strange gentleman first we walked along the lane and i ran about gathering flowers yet i remember i kept thinking why is mamma offended with that gentleman what right has he to displease her and i came back with it in my mind to tell him that he should not say anything to annoy mamma but when i took her hand she seemed no longer angry but very very sorry i remember she said i grieve deeply for you rupert and then she added my good wishes are all i have to give i remember the words for they made me fancy in a most childish manner mamma must have left her purse at home and i began to think of my own but seeing him so well dressed i felt a few shillings would do him no good mamma talked on very softly looking up in the stranger's face he was tall taller younger and better looking than papa and i ran on again for i did not know what they were talking about at one time mamma called me and said she would go back and i was very glad for it was growing late and i felt hungry but the stranger said only a little farther to the end of the lane only so we walked on and he talked about her forgetting him and she said something that was best and he ought to forget her on this he burst forth very angrily and i grew angry too but he changed and asked her to forgive him and so we reached the end of the lane 'we stopped there and mamma held out her hand and said farewell and something more when suddenly we heard the sound of wheels and a carriage came at full speed round from a turn in the road it stopped close to us her hand trembled which held mine and the stranger said you see i said true i am going and shall soon be far distant i ask but for one half hour sit in the carriage it is getting cold mamma said no no it is late farewell but as she spoke the stranger as it were led her forward and in a moment lifted her up he seemed stronger than any two men and put her in the carriage and got in himself crying to me to jump after which i would have done but the postillion whipped the horses i was thrown almost under the wheel by the sudden motion i heard mamma scream but when i got up the carriage was already a long way off and though i called as loud as i could and ran after it it never stopped and the horses were going at full gallop i ran on thinking it would stop or turn back and i cried out on mamma while i ran so fast that i was soon breathless and she was out of hearing and then i shrieked and cried and threw myself on the ground till i thought i heard wheels and i got up and ran again but it was only the thunder and that pealed and the wind roared and the rain came down and i could keep my feet no longer but fell on the ground and forgot everything except that mamma must come back and i was watching for her and this nurse is my story every word is true and is it not plain that mamma was carried away by force' 'yes' said the woman 'no one doubts that master gerard but why does she not come back no man could keep her against her will in a christian country like this' 'because she is dead or in prison' cried the boy bursting into tears 'but i see you are as wicked as everybody else and have wicked thoughts too and i hate you and everybody except mamma' from that time gerard was entirely altered his boyish spirit was dashed he brooded perpetually over the wrong done his mother and was irritated to madness by feeling that by a look and a word he could not make others share his belief in her spotless innocence he became sullen shy shut up in himself above all he shunned his father months passed away requisitions set on foot at first from a desire to succour were continued from a resolve to revenge no pains or expense were spared to discover the fugitives and all in vain the opinion took root that they had fled to america and who on that vast continent could find two beings resolved on concealment inquiries were made at new york and other principal towns but all in vain the strangest and most baffling circumstance in this mystery was that no guess could be formed as to who the stranger was though he seemed to have dropped from the clouds he had evidently been known long before to mrs neville his name it appeared was rupert no one knew of any bearing that name had alithea loved before her marriage such a circumstance must have been carefully hidden for her husband had never suspected it her childhood had been spent with her mother her father being mostly at sea when sixteen she lost her mother and after a short interval resided with her father then retired from service he had assured sir boyvill that his daughter had never loved and the husband jealous as he was had never seen cause to doubt the truth of this statement had she formed any attachment during the first years of her married life was it to escape the temptation so held out that she secluded herself in the country rupert was probably a feigned name and sir boyvill tried to recollect who her favourites were so to find a clew by their actions to her disappearance it was in vain that he called to mind every minute circumstance and pondered over the name of each visiter he could remember nothing that helped discovery yet the idea that she had several years ago conceived a partiality for some man who as it proved loved her to distraction became fixed in sir boyvill's mind the thought poured venom on the time gone by it might have been a virtue in her to banish him she loved and to seclude herself but this mystery where all seemed so frank and open this defalcation of the heart this inward thought which made no sign yet ruled every action was gall and wormwood to her proud susceptible husband that in her secret soul she loved this other was manifest for though it might be admitted that he used art and violence to tear her from her home yet in the end she was vanquished and even maternal duties and affections sacrificed to irresistible passion can you wonder that such a man as sir boyvill ever engrossed by the mighty idea of self yet fearful that that self should receive the minutest wound proud of his wife because being so lovely and so admired she was all his grateful to her for being so glorious and enviable a possession can you wonder that this vain but sensitive man should be wound up to the height of jealous rage by the loss of such a good accompanied by circumstances of deception and dishonour he had been fond of his wife in return for her affection while she in reality loved another he had respected the perfection of her truth and there was falsehood at the core had she avowed the traitor passion declared her struggles and laying bare her heart confessed that while she preferred his honour and happiness yet in the weakness of her nature another had stolen a portion of that sentiment which she desired to consecrate to him then with what tenderness he had forgiven her with what soothing forbearance he had borne her fault how magnanimous and merciful he had shown himself but she had acted the generous part thanks had come from him the shows of obligation from her he fancied that he held a flower in his hand from which the sweetest perfume alone could be extracted but the germe was blighted and the very core turned to bitter ashes and dust such a theme is painful howsoever we view it it is scarcely possible to imagine any event in life more desolating to be happy is to attain one's wishes and to look forward to the lastingness of their possession sir boyvill had long been skeptical and distrusting but at last he was brought to believe that he had drawn the fortunate ticket that his wife's faith was a pure and perfect chrysolite and if in his heart he deemed that she did not regard him with all the reverence that was his due if she did not nurture all the pride of place and disdain of her fellow creatures which he thought that his wife ought to feel yet her many charms and virtues left him no room for complaint her sensibility her vivacity her wit her accomplishments her exceeding loveliness they were all undeniably his and all made her a piece of enchantment this merit was laid low deprived of its crown her fidelity to him and the selfish the heartless and the cold whom she reproved and disliked were lifted to the eminence of virtue while she lay fallen degraded worthless sir boyvill was in his own conceit for ever placed on a pedestal and he loved to imagine that he could say 'look at me you can see no defect i am a wealthy and a well born man i have a wife the envy of all children who promise to inherit all our virtues i am prosperous no harm can reach me look at me' he was still on his pedestal but had become a mark for scorn for pity oh how he loathed himself how he abhorred her who had brought him to this pass he had in her best days often fancied that he loved her too well yielded too often his pride nurtured schemes to her soft persuasions he had indeed believed that providence had created this exquisite and most beautiful being that life might be made perfect to him besides his months and days and hours had been replete with her image her very admirable qualities accompanied as they were by the trembling delicacy that droops at a touch and then revives at a word her quickness not of temper but of feeling which received such sudden and powerful impression formed her to be at once admired and cherished with the care a sweet exotic needs when transplanted from its sunny native clime to the ungenial temperature of a northern land it was madness to recollect all the fears he had wasted on her he had foregone the dignity of manhood to wait on her he had often feared to pursue his projects lest they should jar some delicate chord in her frame to his own recollection it seemed that he had become but the lackey to her behests and all for the sake of a love which she bestowed on another to preserve that honour which she blasted without pity it were in vain to attempt to delineate the full force of jealousy natural sorrow at losing a thing so sweet and dear was blended with anger that he should be thrown off by her the misery of knowing that he should never see her more was mingled with a ferocious desire to learn that every disaster was heaped on one whom hitherto he had as well as he could guarded from every ill to this we may add commiseration for his deserted children his son late so animated so free spirited and joyous a more promising child had never blessed a father's hopes was changed into a brooding grief struck blighted visionary his little girl the fairy thing he loved best of all she was taken from him the carelessness of a nurse during a childish illness caused her death within a year after her mother's flight had that mother remained such carelessness had been impossible sir boyvill felt that all good fell from him the only remaining golden fruit dropped from the tree calamity encompassed him with his whole soul he abhorred and desired to wreak vengeance on her who caused the ill after two years were passed and no tidings were received of the fugitives it seemed plain that there could be but one solution to the mystery no doubt she and her lover concealed themselves in some far land under a feigned name if indeed it were if it be so it might move any heart to imagine poor alithea's misery the obloquy that mantles over her remembrance at home while she broods over the desolation of the hearth she so long adorned and the pining impatient anguish of her beloved boy what could or can keep her away is matter of fearful conjecture but this much is certain that at that time at least and now if she survives she must be miserable sir boyvill if he deigned to recollect these things enjoyed the idea of her anguish but without adverting to her state and feelings he was desirous of obtaining what reparation he could and to dispossess her of his name endeavours to find the fugitives in america and false hopes held out had delayed the process he at last entered on it with eagerness a thousand obvious reasons rendered a divorce desirable and to him with all his pride then only would his pillow be without a thorn when she lost his name and every right or tie that bound them together under the singular circumstances of the case he could only obtain a divorce by a bill in parliament and to this measure he resorted there was nothing reprehensible in this step self defence as well as revenge suggested its expediency besides this it may be said that he was glad of the publicity that would ensue that he might be proved blameless to all the world he accused his wife of a fault so great as tarnished irrecoverably her golden name he accused her of being a false wife and an unnatural mother under circumstances of no common delinquency but he might be mistaken he might view his injuries with the eye of passion and others more disinterested might pronounce that she was unfortunate but not guilty by means of the bill for divorce the truth would be investigated and judged by several hundred of the best born and best educated of his countrymen the publicity also might induce discovery it was fair and just and though his pride rebelled against becoming the tale of the day he saw no alternative indeed it was reported to him by some officious friend that many had observed that it was strange that he had not sought this remedy before something of wonder or blame or both was attached to his passiveness such hints galled him to the quick and he pursued his purpose with all the obstinacy and imperious haste peculiar to him when every other preliminary had been gone through it was deemed necessary that gerard should give his evidence at the bar of the house of lords sir boyvill looked upon his lost wife as a criminal so steeped in deserved infamy so odious and so justly condemned that none could hesitate in siding with him to free him from the bondage of those laws which while she bore his name might be productive of incalculable injury his honour too was wounded his honour which he would have sacrificed his life to have preserved untainted he had intrusted to alithea and loved her the more fervently that she regarded the trust with reverence she had foully betrayed it and must not all who respected the world's customs and the laws of social life above all must not any who loved him be forward to cast her out from any inheritance of good that could reach her through him above all must not their son his son share his indignation and assist his revenge gerard was but a boy but his mother's tenderness his own quick nature and lastly the sufferings he had endured through her flight had early developed a knowledge of the realities of life and so keen a sense of right and justice as made his father regard him as capable of forming opinions and acting from such motives as usually are little understood by one so young and true it was that gerard fostered sentiments independent of any teaching and cherished ideas the more obstinately because they were confined to his single breast he understood the pity with which his father was regarded the stigma cast upon his mother the suppressed voice the wink of the eye the covert hint he understood it all and like the poet longed for a word sharp as a sword to pierce the falsehood through and through for many months he and his father had seen little of each other sir boyvill had not a mind that takes pleasure in watching the ingenuous sallies of childhood or the development of the youthful mind the idea of making a friend of his child which had been alithea's fond and earnest aim could never occur to his self engrossed heart since his illness gerard had been weakly or he would have been sent to school as it was a tutor resided in the house this person was written to by sir boyvill's man of business and directed to break the matter to his pupil to explain the formalities to sooth and encourage any timidity he might show and to incite him if need were to a desire to assist in a measure whose operation was to render justice to his father the first allusion to his mother made by mr carter caused the blood to rush from the boy's heart and to die crimson his cheeks his temples his throat then he grew deadly pale and without uttering a word listened to his preceptor till suddenly taking in the nature of the task assigned to him every limb shook and he answered by a simple request to be left alone and he would consider no more was thought by the unapprehensive people about than that he was shy of being spoken to on the subject that he would make up his mind in his own way and mr carter at once yielded to his request the reserve which had shrouded him since he lost his mother had accustomed those about him to habitual silence none no one watchful attached intelligent eye marked the struggles which shook his delicate frame blanched his cheek took the flesh from his bones and quickened his pulse into fever none marked him as he lay in bed the livelong night with open eyes and beating heart a prey to contending emotion he was passed carelessly by as he lay on the dewy grass from morn to evening his soul torn by grief uttering his mother's name in accents of despair and shedding floods of tears i said that these signs of intense feeling were not remarked and yet they were in a vulgar way by the menials who said it would be well when the affair was over master neville took it so to heart and was sadly frightened frightened such a coarse undistinguishing name was given to the sacred terror of doing his still loved mother an injury which heaved his breast with convulsive sobs and filled his veins with fire the thought of what he was called upon to do haunted him day and night with agony he her nursling her idol her child he who could not think of her name without tears and dreamed often that she kissed him in his sleep and woke to weep over the delusion he was to accuse her before an assembled multitude to give support to the most infamous falsehoods to lend his voice to stigmatize her name and wherever she was kept from him by some irresistible power but innocent as an angel and still loving him she was to hear of him as her enemy and receive a last wound from his hand such appeared the task assigned to him in his eyes for his blunt witted tutor had spoken of the justice to be rendered his father by freeing him from his fugitive wife without regarding the inner heart of his pupil or being aware that his mother sat throned there an angel of light and goodness the victim of ill but doing none soon after mrs neville's flight the family had abandoned the seat in cumberland and inhabited a house taken near the thames in buckinghamshire here gerard resided while his father was in town watching the progress of the bill at last the day drew near when gerard's presence was required the peers showed a disposition either from curiosity or a love of justice to sift the affair to the uttermost and the boy's testimony was declared absolutely necessary mr carter told gerard that on the following morning they were to proceed to london in pursuance of the circumstances which he had explained to him a few days before 'is it then true' said the boy 'that i am to be called upon to give evidence as you call it against my mother' 'you are called upon by every feeling of duty' replied the sapient preceptor 'to speak the truth to those whose decision will render justice to your father if the truth injure mrs neville that is her affair' again gerard's cheeks burned with blushes and his eyes dimmed as they were with tears flashed fire 'in that case' he said 'i beg to see my father' 'you will see him when in town' replied mr carter 'come neville you must not take the matter in this girlish style show yourself a man your mother is unworthy ' 'if you please sir' said gerard half choked yet restraining himself 'i will speak to my father i do not like any one else to talk to me about these things' 'as you please sir' said mr carter much offended no more was said it was evening the next morning they set out for london the poor boy had lain awake the whole night but no one knew or cared for his painful vigils chapter xix on the following day the journey was performed and it had been arranged that gerard should rest on the subsequent one the third being fixed for his attendance in the house of lords sir boyvill had been informed how sullenly that was the word they used the boy had received the information conveyed him by his tutor he would rather have been excused saying a word himself to his son on the subject but this account and the boy's request to see him forced him to change his purpose he did not expect opposition but he wished to give a right turn to gerard's expressions the sort of cold distance that separation and variance of feeling produced rendered their intercourse little like the tender interchange of parental and filial love 'gerard my boy' sir boyvill began 'we are both sufferers and you like me are not of a race tamely to endure injury i would willingly have risked my life to revenge the ruin brought on us so i believe would you child as you are but the skulking villain is safe from my arm the laws of his country cannot even pursue him yet what reparation is left i must endeavour to get' sir boyvill showed tact in thus bringing forward only that party whose act none could do other than reprobate and who was the object of gerard's liveliest hatred his face lightened up with something of pleasure his eye flashed fire to prove to the world the guilt and violence of the wretch who had torn his mother from him was indeed a task of duty and justice a little more forbearance on his father's part had wound him easily to his will but the policy sir boyvill displayed was involuntary and his next words overturned all 'your miserable mother' he continued 'must bear her share of infamy and if she be not wholly hardened it will prove a sufficient punishment when the events of to morrow reach her she will begin to taste of the bitter cup she has dealt out so largely to others it were folly to pretend to regret that i own that i rejoice' every idea now suffered revulsion and the stream of feeling flowed again in its old channels what right had his father to speak thus of the beloved and honoured parent he had so cruelly lost his blood boiled within him and despite childish fear and reverence he said 'if my mother will grieve or be injured by my appearing to morrow i will not go i cannot' 'you are a fool to speak thus' said his father 'a galless animal without sense of pride or duty come sir no more of this you owe me obedience and you must pay it on this occasion you are only bid speak the truth and that you must speak i had thought notwithstanding your youth higher and more generous motives might be urged a father's honour vindicated a mother's vileness punished' 'my mother is not vile' cried gerard and there stopped for a thousand things restrain a child's tongue inexperience reverence ignorance of the effect his words may produce terror at the mightiness of the power with which he has to contend after a pause he muttered 'i honour my mother i will tell the whole world that she deserves honour' 'now gerard on my soul' cried sir boyvill roused to anger as parents too easily are against their offspring when they show any will of their own while they expect to move them like puppets 'on my soul my fine fellow i could find it in my heart to knock you down enough of this i don't want to terrify you be a good boy to morrow and i will forgive all' 'forgive me now father' cried the youth bursting into tears 'forgive me and spare me i cannot obey you i cannot do anything that will grieve my mother she loved me so much i am sure she loves me still that i cannot do her a harm i will not go to morrow' 'this is most extraordinary' said sir boyvill controlling as well as he could the rage swelling within him 'and are you such an idiot as not to know that your wretched mother has forfeited all claim to your affection and am i of so little worth in your eyes i your father who have a right to your obedience from the justice of my cause not to speak of parental authority am i nothing to receive no duty expect no service i was indeed mistaken i thought you were older than your years and had that touch of gentlemanly pride about you that would have made you eager to avenge my injuries to stand by me as a friend and ally compensating as well as you could for the wrongs done me by your mother i thought i had a son in whose veins my own blood flowed who would be ready to prove his true birth by siding with me are you stone or a baseborn thing that you cannot even conceive what thing honour is' gerard listened he wept the tears poured in torrents from his eyes but as his father continued and heaped many an opprobrious epithet on him a proud and sullen spirit was indeed awakened he longed to say 'abuse me strike me but i will not yield' yet he did not speak he dried his eyes and stood in silence before his parent his face darkening and something ferocious gleaming in eyes hitherto so soft and sorrowing sir boyvill saw that he was far from making the impression he desired but he wished to avoid reiterated refusals to obey and he summed up at last with vague but violent threats of what would ensue exile from his home penury nay starvation the abhorrence of the world his own malediction and after having worked himself up into a towering rage and real detestation of the shivering feeble yet determined child before him he left him to consider and to be vanquished far other thoughts occupied gerard 'i had thought' he has told me 'once or twice to throw myself into his arms and pray for mercy to kneel at his feet and implore him to spare me one kind word had made the struggle intolerable but no kind word did he say and while he stormed it seemed to me as if my dear mother were singing as she was used while i gathered flowers and played beside her in the park and i thought of her not of him the words kick me out of doors suggested but the idea i shall be free and i will find my mother i feel intensely now but surely a boy's feelings are far wilder far more vehement than a man's for i cannot now violent as you think me call up one sensation so whirlwind like as those that possessed me while my father spoke' thus has gerard described his emotions his father ordered him to quit the room and he went to brood upon the fate impending over him on the morrow early he was bid prepare to attend the house of lords his father did not appear he thought that the boy was terrified and would make no further resistance gerard indeed obeyed in silence he disdained to argue with strangers and hirelings he had an idea that if he openly rebelled he might be carried by force and his proud heart swelled at the idea of compulsion he got into the carriage and as he went mr carter who was with him thought it advisable to explain the forms and give some instructions gerard listened with composure nay asked a question or two concerning the preliminaries he was told of the oath that would be administered and how the words he spoke after taking that oath would be implicitly believed and that he must be careful to say nothing that was not strictly true the colour not an indignant blush but a suffusion as of pleasure mantled over his cheeks as this was explained they arrived they were conducted into some outer room to await the call of the peers what tortures the boy felt as strangers came up some to speak and others to gaze all of indignation resolution grief and more than manhood's struggles that tore his bosom during the annoying delays that always protract this sort of scenes none cared to scan he was there unresisting apparently composed if now his cheek flushed and now his lips withered into paleness if now the sense of suffocation rose in his throat and now tears rushed into his eyes as the image of his sweet mother passed across his memory none regarded none cared when i have thought of the spasms and throes which his tender and highwrought soul endured during this interval i often wonder his heart strings did not crack or his reason for ever unsettle as it is he has not yet escaped the influence of that hour it shadows his life with eclipse it comes whispering agony to him when otherwise he might forget some author has described the effect of misfortune on the virtuous as the crushing of perfumes so to force them to give forth their fragrance gerard is all nobleness all virtue all tenderness do we owe any part of his excellence to this hour of anguish if so i may be consoled but i can never think of it without pain he says himself 'yes without these sharp goadings i had not devoted my whole life to clearing my mother's fame' is this devotion a good as yet no apparent benefit has sprung from it at length he was addressed 'young gentleman are you ready' and he was led into that stately chamber fit for solemn and high debate thronged with the judges of his mother's cause there was a dimness in his eye a tumult in his heart that confused him while on his appearance there was first a murmur then a general hush each regarded him with compassion as they discerned the marks of suffering in his countenance a few moments passed before he was addressed and when it was supposed that he had had time to collect himself the proper officer administered the oath and then the barrister asked him some slight questions not to startle but to lead back his memory by insensible degrees to the necessary facts the boy looked at him with scorn he tried to be calm to elevate his voice twice it faltered the third time he spoke slowly but distinctly 'i have sworn to speak the truth and i am to be believed my mother is innocent' 'but this is not the point young gentleman' interrupted his interrogator 'i only asked if you remembered your father's house in cumberland' the boy replied more loudly but with broken accents 'i have said all i mean to say you may murder me but i will say no more how dare you entice me into injuring my mother' at the word uncontrollable tears burst forth pouring in torrents down his burning cheeks he told me that he well remembers the feeling that rose to his tongue instigating him to cry shame on all present but his voice failed his purpose was too mighty for his young heart he sobbed and wept the more he tried to control the impulse the more hysterical the fit grew he was taken from the bar and the peers moved by his distress came to a resolve that they would dispense with his attendance and be satisfied by hearing his account of the transaction from those persons to whom he made it at the period when it occurred i will now mention that the result of this judicial inquiry was a decree of divorce in sir boyvill's favour gerard removed from the bar and carried home recovered his composure but he was silent revolving the consequences which he expected would ensue from disobedience his father had menaced to turn him out of doors and he did not doubt but that this threat would be put into execution so that he was somewhat surprised that he was taken home at all perhaps they meant to send him to a place of exile of their own choosing perhaps to make the expulsion public and ignominious the powers of grown up people appear so illimitable in a child's eyes who have no data whereby to discover the probable from the improbable at length the fear of confinement became paramount he revolted from it his notion was to go and seek his mother and his mind was quickly made up to forestall their violence and to run away he was ordered to confine himself to his own room his food was brought to him this looked like the confirmation of his fears his heart swelled high 'they think to treat me like a child but i will show myself independent wherever my mother is she is better than they all if she is imprisoned i will free her or i will remain with her how glad she will be to see me how happy shall we be again together my father may have all the rest of the world to himself when i am with my mother in a cavern or a dungeon i care not where' night came on he went to bed he even slept and awoke terrified to think that the opportune hour might be overpassed daylight was dawning faintly in the east the clocks of london struck four he was still in time every one in the house slept he rose and dressed he had nearly ten guineas of his own this was all his possession he had counted them the night before he opened the door of his chamber daylight was struggling with darkness and all was very still he stepped out he descended the stairs he got into the hall every accustomed object seemed new and strange at that early hour and he looked with some dismay at the bars and bolts of the house door he feared making a noise and rousing some servant still the thing must be attempted slowly and cautiously he pushed back the bolts he lifted up the chain it fell from his hands with terrific clatter on the stone pavement his heart was in his mouth he did not fear punishment but he feared ill success he listened as well as his throbbing pulses permitted all was still the key of the door was in the lock it turned easily at his touch and in another moment the door was open the fresh air blew upon his cheeks the deserted street was before him he closed the door after him and with a sort of extra caution locked it on the outside and then took to his heels throwing the key down a neighbouring street when out of sight of his home he walked more slowly and began to think seriously of the course to pursue to find his mother all the world had been trying to find her and had not succeeded but he believed that by some means she would hear of his escape and come to him but whither go in the first instance his heart replied to cumberland to dromore there he had lived with his mother there had he lost her he felt assured that in its neighbourhood he should again be restored to her travelling had given him some idea of distance and of the modes of getting from one place to another he felt that it would be a task of too great difficulty to attempt walking across england he had no carriage he knew of no ship to take him some conveyance he must get so he applied to a hackney coach it was standing solitary in the middle of the street the driver asleep on the steps the skeleton horses hanging down their heads with the peculiarly disconsolate look these poor hacked animals have gerard as the son of a wealthy man was accustomed to consider that he had a right to command those whom he could pay yet fear of discovery and being sent back to his father filled him with unusual fears he looked at the horses and the man he advanced nearer but he was afraid to take the decisive step till the driver awaking started up and shook himself stared at the boy and seeing him well dressed and he looked too older than his years from being tall he asked 'do you want me sir' 'yes' said gerard 'i want you to drive me' 'get in then where are you going' 'i am going a long way to dromore that is in cumberland ' the boy hesitated it struck him that those miserable horses could not carry him far 'then you want me to take you to the stage' said the man 'it goes from piccadilly at five we have no time to lose' gerard got in on they jumbled and arriving at the coach office saw some half dozen stages ready to start the name of liverpool on one struck the boy by the familiar name if he could get to liverpool it were easy afterward even to walk to dromore so getting out of the hackney coach he went up to the coachman who was mounting his box and asked 'will you take me to liverpool' 'yes my fine fellow if you can pay the fare' 'how much is it' drawing out his purse 'inside or outside' from the moment he had addressed these men and they began to talk of money gerard calling to mind the vast disbursements of gold coin he had seen made by his father and the courier on their travels began to fear that his little stock would ill suffice to carry him so far and the first suggestion of prudence the little fellow ever experienced made him now answer 'whichever costs least' 'outside then' 'oh i have that i can pay you' 'jump up then my lad lend me your hand here by me that's right all's well you're just in the nick we are off directly' he cracked his whip and away they flew and as they went gerard felt free and going to his mother such in these civilized times are the facilities offered to the execution of our wildest wishes the consequences the moral consequences are still the same still require the same exertions to overcome them but we have no longer to fight with physical impediments if gerard had begun his expedition from any other town curiosity had perhaps been excited but in the vast busy metropolis each one takes care of himself and few scrutinize the motives or means of others perched up on the coach box gerard had a few questions to answer was he going home did he live in liverpool but the name of dromore was a sufficing answer the coachman had never heard of such a place but it was a gentleman's seat and it was gerard's home and that was enough some day you must ask gerard to relate to you his adventures during this journey they will come warmly and vividly from him while mine as a mere reflex must be tame it is his mind i would describe and i will not pause to narrate the tantalizing cross questioning that he underwent from a scotchman nor the heart heavings with which he heard allusions made to the divorce case before the lords a newspaper describing his own conduct was in the hands of one of the passengers he heard his mother lightly alluded to he would have leaped from the coach but that was to give up all he pressed his hands to his ears he scowled on those around his heart was on fire yet he had one consolation he was free he was going to her he resolved never to mingle with his fellow creatures more buried in some rural retreat with his mother it mattered little what the vulgar and the indifferent said about either some qualms did assail him should he find his dear mother where was she his childish imagination refused to paint her distant from dromore his own removal from that mansion so soon after losing her associated her indelibly with the mountains the ravines the brawling streams and clustering woods of his natal county she must be there he would drive away the man of violence who took her from him and they would be happy together a day and a night brought him to liverpool and the coachman hearing whither he wished to go deposited him in the stage for lancaster on his arrival he went inside this time and slept all the way at lancaster he was recognised by several persons and they wondered to see him alone he was annoyed at their recognition and questionings and though it was night when he arrived instantly set off to walk to dromore for two months from this time he lived wandering from cottage to cottage seeking his mother the journey from lancaster to dromore he performed as speedily as he well could he did not enter the house that would be delivering himself up as a prisoner by night he clambered the park railings and entered like a thief the demesnes where he had spent his childhood each path was known to him and almost every tree here he sat with his mother there they found the first violet of spring his pilgrimage was achieved but where was she his heart beat as he reached the little gate whence they had issued on that fatal night all the grounds bore marks of neglect and the master's absence and the lock of this gate was spoiled a sort of rough bolt had been substituted gerard pushed it back the rank grass had gathered thick on the threshold but it was the same spot how well he remembered it two years only had since passed he was still a child yet to his own fancy how much taller how much more of a man he had become besides he now fancied himself master of his own actions he had escaped from his father and he who had threatened to turn him out of doors would not seek to possess himself of him again he belonged to no one he was cared for by no one by none but her whom he sought with firm yet anxious expectation there he had seen her last he stepped forward he followed the course of the lane he came to where the road crossed it where the carriage drove up where she had been torn from him it was daybreak a june morning all was golden and still a few birds twittered but the breeze was hushed and he looked out on the extent of country commanded from the spot where he stood and saw only nature the rugged hills the green corn fields the flowery meads and the umbrageous trees in deep repose how different from the wild tempestuous night when she whom he sought was torn away he could then see only a few yards before him now he could mark the devious windings of the road and afar off distinguish the hazy line of the ocean he sat down to reflect what was he to do in what nook of the wide expanse was his mother hid that some portion of the landscape he viewed harboured her was his fixed belief a belief founded in inexperience and fancy but not the less deep rooted he meditated for some time and then walked forward he remembered when he ran panting and screaming along that road he was a mere child then and what was he now a boy of eleven yet he looked back with disdain to the endeavours of two years before he walked along in the same direction that he had at that time pursued and soon found that he reached the turnpike road to lancaster he turned off and went by the cross road that leads to the wild and dreary plains that form the coast the inner range of picturesque hills on the declivity of which dromore is situated is not more than five miles from the sea but the shore itself is singularly blank and uninteresting varied only by sand hills thrown up to the height of thirty or forty feet intersected by rivers which at low water are fordable even on foot but which when the tide is up are dangerous to those who do not know the right track from the holes and ruts which render the bed of the river uneven in winter indeed at the period of spring tides or in stormy weather with a west wind which drives the ocean towards the shore the passage is often exceedingly dangerous and except under the direction of an experienced guide fatal accidents occur gerard reached the borders of the ocean near one of these streams behind him rose his native mountains range above range divided by tremendous gulfs varied by the shadows of the clouds and the gleams of sunlight close to him was the waste seashore the ebbing tide gave a dreary sluggish appearance to the ocean and the river a shallow rapid stream emptied its slender pittance of mountain water noiselessly into the lazy deep it was a scene of singular desolation on the other side of the river not far from the mouth was a rude hut unroofed and fallen to decay erected perhaps as the abode of a guide near it grew a stunted tree withered moss covered spectre like the sand hills lay scattered around the seagull screamed above and skimmed over the waste gerard sat down and wept motherless escaped from his angry father even to his young imagination his fate seemed as drear and gloomy as the scene around chapter xx i do not know why i have dwelt on these circumstances so long let me hasten to finish for two months gerard wandered in the neighbourhood of dromore if he saw a lone cottage imbowered in trees hidden in some green recess of the hills sequestered and peaceful he thought perhaps my mother is there and he clambered towards it finding it at last probably a mere shepherd's hut poverty stricken and tenanted by a noisy family his money was exhausted he made a journey to lancaster to sell his watch and then returned to cumberland his clothes his shoes were worn out often he slept in the open air ewes' milk cheese and black bread were his fare his hope was to find his mother his fear to fall again into his father's hands but as the first sentiment failed his friendless condition grew more sad he began to feel that he was indeed a feeble helpless boy abandoned by all he thought nothing was left for him but to lie down and die meanwhile he was noticed and at last recognised by some of the tenants and information reached his father of where he was unfortunately the circumstance of his disappearance became public it was put into the newspapers as a mysterious occurrence and the proud sir boyvill found himself not only pitied on account of his wife's conduct but suspected of cruelty towards his only child at first he was himself frightened and miserable but when he heard where gerard was and that he could be recovered at any time these softer feelings were replaced by fury he sent the tutor to possess himself of his son's person he was seized with the help of a constable treated more like a criminal than an unfortunate erring child carried back to buckinghamshire shut up in a barricadoed room debarred from air and exercise lectured menaced treated with indignity the boy hitherto accustomed to more than usual indulgence and freedom was at first astonished and then wildly indignant at the treatment he suffered he was told that he should not be set free till he submitted he believed that to mean until he could give testimony against his mother he resolved rather to die several times he endeavoured to escape and was brought back and treated with fresh barbarity his hands bound and stripes inflicted by menials till driven to despair he at one time determined to starve himself and at another tried to bribe a servant to bring him poison the trusting piety inculcated by his gentle mother was destroyed by the ill judged cruelty of his father and his doltish substitute it is painful to dwell on such circumstances to think of a sensitive helpless child treated with the brutality exercised towards a galley slave under this restraint gerard grew such as you saw him at baden sullen ferocious plunged in melancholy delivered up to despair it was some time before he discovered that the submission demanded of him was not to run away again on learning this he wrote to his father he spoke with horror of the personal indignities he had endured of his imprisonment of the conduct of mr carter he did not mean it as such but his letter grew into an affecting irresistible appeal that even moved sir boyvill his stupid pride prevented him from showing the regret he felt he still used the language of reproof and conditional pardon but the tutor was dismissed and gerard restored to liberty had his father been generous or just enough to show his regret he might probably have obliterated the effects of his harshness as it was gerard gave no thanks for a boon which saved his life but restored him to none of its social blessings he was still friendless still orphaned in his affections still the memory of intolerable tyranny the recurrence of which was threatened if he made an ill use of the freedom accorded him clung like the shirt of nessus and his noble ardent nature was lacerated by the intolerable recollection of slavish terrors you saw him at baden and it was at baden that i also first knew him you had left the baths when my mother and i arrived we became acquainted with sir boyvill he was still handsome he was rich and those qualities of mind which ill agreed with alithea's finer nature did not displease a fashionable woman of the world such was my mother something that was called an attachment sprang up and they married she preferred the situation of wife to that of widow and he having been accustomed to the social comforts of a domestic circle despite his disasters disliked his bachelor state they married and i just then eighteen just out as it is called became the sister of my beloved gerard i feel pride when i think of the services that i have rendered him he had another fall from his horse not long after or rather again urging the animal down a precipice it fell he was underneath and his leg was broken during the long confinement that ensued i was his faithful nurse and companion naturally lively yet i could sympathize in his sorrows by degrees i won his confidence he told me all his story all his feelings he grew mild and soft under my influence he grew to regret that he had been vanquished by adversity so as to become almost what he was accused of being a frantic idiot as he talked of his mother and the care she bestowed on his early years he wept to think how unlike he was to the creature she had wished him to become a desire to reform to repair past faults to school himself grew out of such talk he threw off his sullenness and gloom he became studious at the same time that he grew gentle his education which had proceeded but badly while he refused to lend his mind to improvement was now the object of his own thoughts and exertions instead of careering wildly over the hills or being thrown under some tree delivered up to miserable revery he asked for masters and was continually seen with a book in his hands the passion of his soul still subsisted modulated by his new feelings he continued to believe in the innocence of his mother though he often doubted her existence he longed inexpressibly to unveil the mystery that shrouded her fate he devoted himself in his heart to discovering the truth he resolved to occupy his whole life in the dear task of reinstating her in that cloudless purity of reputation which he intimately felt she had never deserved to forfeit he considered the promise exacted from him by his father as preventing him from following up his design and as binding him till he was twenty one till then he deferred his endeavours no young spendthrift ever aspired for the attainment of the age of freedom and the possession of an estate as vehemently as did gerard for the hour which was to permit him to deliver himself wholly up to this task before that time arrived i married i wished to take him abroad with us but the unfounded as i believe notion that the secret of his mother's fate is linked to the english shores made him dislike to leave his native country it was only on our return that he consented to come as far as marseilles to meet us when he had reached the age of twenty one he announced to his father his resolve to discover his mother's fate sir boyvill was highly indignant the only circumstance that at all mitigated the disgrace of his wife's flight was the oblivion into which she and all concerning her had sunk to have new inquiries set on foot and the forgotten shame recalled to the memories of men appeared not less wicked than insane he remonstrated he grew angry he stormed he forbade but gerard considered that time had set a limit to his authority and only withdrew in silence not the less determined to pursue his own course i need not say that he met with no success a mystery so impenetrable at first does not acquire clearness after time has obscured the little ever known whatever were the real circumstances and feelings that occasioned her flight however innocent she might then be time has cemented his mother's union with another and made her forget those she left behind or may i not say what i am inclined to believe that though the violence of another was the cause at last of guilt in her yet she pined for those she deserted that her heart was soon broken that the sod has long since covered her form while the miserable man who caused all this evil is but too eager to observe a silence which prevents his name from being loaded with the execrations he deserves i cannot help therefore regretting that gerard insists upon discovering the obscure grave of his miserable mother while he who whether living or dead believes her to have been always innocent is to be dissuaded by no arguments still less by the angry denunciations of sir boyvill whose conduct throughout he looks on as being the primal cause of his mother's misfortunes i have told you the tale as nearly as i can in the spirit in which gerard himself would have communicated it such was my tacit pledge to him nor do i wish by my suspicions or conjectures to deprive him of your sympathy and the belief he wishes you to entertain of his mother's innocence but truth will force its way and who can think her wholly guiltless would to god oh how often and how fervently have i prayed that gerard were cured of the madness which renders his life a wild unprofitable dream and looking soberly on the past consent to bury in oblivion misfortunes and errors which are beyond all cure and which it is worse than vain to remember chapter xxi there was to elizabeth a fascinating interest in the story related by lady cecil elizabeth had no wild fairy like imagination her talents which were remarkable her serious thoughtful mind was warmed by the vital heat emanating from her affections whatever regarded these moved her deeply here was a tale full of human interest of love error of filial tenderness and deep rooted uneradicable fidelity elizabeth who knew little of life except through such experience as she gathered from the emotions of her own heart and the struggling passions of falkner could not regard the story in the same worldly light as lady cecil there was an unfathomable mystery but was there guilt as far as regarded mrs neville elizabeth could not believe it she believed that in a nature as finely formed as hers was described to have been maternal love and love for such a child as gerard must have risen paramount to every other feeling philosophers have said that the most exalted natures are endowed with the strongest and deepest seated passions it is by combating and purifying them that the human being rises into excellence and the combat is assisted by setting the good in opposition to the evil perhaps mrs neville had loved though even that seemed strange but her devoted affection to her child must have been more powerful than a love which did it exist appeared unaccompanied by one sanctifying or extenuating circumstance thus thought elizabeth gerard appeared in a beautiful and heroic light bent on his holy mission of redeeming his mother's name from the stigma accumulated on it her heart warmed within her at the thought that such a task assimilated to hers she was endeavouring to reconcile her benefactor to life and to remove from his existence the stings of unavailing remorse she tried to fancy that some secret tie existed between their two distinct tasks and that a united happy end would spring up for both after musing for some time in silence at length she said but you do not tell me whither mr neville is now gone and what it is that has so newly awakened his hopes you remind me replied lady cecil of what i had nearly forgotten it is a provoking and painful circumstance the artifice of cupidity to dupe enthusiasm you must know that gerard in furtherance of his wild project has left an intimation among the cottages and villages near dromore and in lancaster itself that he will give two hundred pounds to any one who shall bring any information that will conduce to the discovery of mrs neville's fate this is a large bribe to falsehood and yet until now no one has pretended to have anything to tell but the other day he received a letter and the person who wrote it was so earnest that he sent a duplicate to sir boyvill this letter stated that the writer gregory hoskins believed himself to be in possession of some facts connected with mrs neville of dromore and on the two hundred pounds being properly secured to him by a written bond he would communicate them this letter was dated lancaster thither gerard is gone does it speak of mrs neville as still alive asked elizabeth it says barely the words which i have repeated lady cecil replied sir boyvill knowing his son's impetuosity hurried down here to stop if he could his reviving through such means the recollection of his unfortunate lady with what success you have seen gerard is gone nor can any one guess what tale will be trumped up to deceive and rob him elizabeth could not feel as secure as her friend that nothing would come of the promised information this was not strange besides the different view taken by a worldly and an experienced person the tale with all its mystery was an old one to lady cecil while to her friend it bore the freshness of novelty to the one it was a story of the dead and the forgotten to the other it was replete with living interest the enthusiasm of gerard communicated itself to her and she felt that his present journey was full of event the first step in a discovery of all that hitherto had been inscrutable a few days brought a letter from gerard lady cecil read it and then gave it to her young friend to peruse it was dated lancaster it said my journey has hitherto been fruitless this man hoskins has gone from lancaster leaving word that i should find him in london but in so negligent a way as to lower my hopes considerably his chief aim must be to earn the promised reward and i feel sure that he would take more pains to obtain it did he think that it was really within his grasp he arrived but a few weeks since it seems from america whither he migrated some twenty years ago from ravenglass how can he bring news of her i seek from across the atlantic the very idea fills me with disturbance has he seen her great god does she yet live did she commission him to make inquiries concerning her abandoned child no sophia my life on it it is not so she is dead my heart too truly reveals the sad truth to me can i then wish to hear that she is no more my dear dear mother were all the accusations true which are brought against you still would i seek your retreat endeavour to assuage your sorrows wherever whatever you are you are of more worth to me methinks that you must still be more worthy of affection than all else that the earth contains but it is not so i feel it i know it she is dead yet when where how oh my father's vain commands i would walk barefoot to the summit of the andes to have these questions answered the interval that must elapse before i reach london and see this man is hard to bear what will he tell nothing often in my lucid intervals as my father would call them in my hours of despondency i fear nothing you have not played me false dearest sophy in telling your lovely friend the strange story of my woes you have taught her to mourn my mother's fate not to suspect her goodness i am half angry with myself for devolving the task upon you for despite your kind endeavours i read your heart my worldly wise sister and know its unbelief i forgive you for you never saw my mother's face nor heard her voice had you ever beheld the purity and integrity that sat upon her brow and listened to her sweet tones she would visit your dreams by day and night as she does mine in the guise of an angel robed in perfect innocence i cannot forgive my father for his accusations his own heart must be bad or he could not credit that any evil inhabited hers for how many years that guileless heart was laid bare to him and if it was not so fond and admiring towards himself as he could have wished still there was no concealment no tortuosity he saw it all though now he discredits the evidence of his senses shuts his eyes 'and hooting at the glorious sun in heaven cries out where is it' for truth was her attribute the open heart which made the brow the eyes the cheerful mien the sweet loving smile and thrilling voice all transcripts of its pure emotions it was this that rendered her the adorable being which all who knew her acknowledge that she was i am solicitous beyond measure that miss falkner should receive no false impression her image is before me when i saw her first pale in the agony of fear bending over her dying father by day and by night she forgot herself to attend on him she who loves a parent so well can understand me better than any other she i am convinced will form a true judgment she will approve my perseverance and share my doubts and fears will she not ask her or am i too vain too credulous is there in the whole world one creature who will join with me in my faith and my labours you do not sophia that i have long known and the feeling of disappointment is already blunted but it will revive it will be barbed with a new sting if i am deceived in my belief that elizabeth falkner shares my convictions and appreciates the utility the necessity of my endeavours i do not desire her pity that you give me but at this moment i am blessed by the hope that she feels with me i cannot tell you the good this idea does me it spurs me to double energy in my pursuit and it sustains me during the uncertainty that attends it it makes me inexpressibly more anxious to clear my mother's name in her eyes since she deigns to partake my griefs i desire that she should hereafter share in the triumph of my success my success the word throws me ten thousand fathoms deep from the thoughts of innocence and goodness to those of wrongs death or living misery farewell dearest sophia this letter is written at night to morrow early i set out by a fast coach to london i shall write again or you will see me soon keep miss falkner with you till i return and write me a few words of encouragement not a line in this letter but interested and gratified elizabeth and lady cecil saw the blush of pleasure mantle over her speaking countenance she was half glad half sorry she looked on elizabeth as she who could cure gerard of his quixotic devotion by inspiring him with feelings which while they had all the enthusiasm natural to his disposition would detach him from his vain endeavours and centre his views and happiness in the living instead of the dead lady cecil knew that gerard already loved her friend he had never loved before and the tenderness of his manner and the admiration that lighted up his eyes whenever he looked on her revealed the birth of passion elizabeth less quick to feel or at least more tranquil in the display of feeling yet sympathized too warmly with him felt too deeply interested in all he said and did not to betray that she was touched by the divine fire that smooths the ruggedness of life and fills with peace and smiles a darkling stormy world but instead of weaning gerard from his madness she encouraged him in it as she well knew for when she wrote to gerard she asked elizabeth to add a few lines and thus she wrote i thank you for the confidence you repose in me and more than that i must express how deeply i feel for you the more that i think that justice and truth are on your side whether you succeed or not i confess that i think you are right in your endeavours your aim is a noble and a sacred one and like you i cherish the hope that it will end in the exculpation of one deeply injured and your being rewarded for your fidelity to her memory god bless you with all the happiness you deserve no subsequent letter arrived from gerard lady cecil wondered and conjectured and expected impatiently she and her friend could talk of nothing else the strange fact that a traveller from america proclaimed that he had tidings of the lost one offered a fertile field for suppositions had mrs neville been carried across the atlantic how impossible was this against her own consent no pirate's bark was there with a crew experienced in crime ready to acquiesce in a deed of violence no fortalice existed in whose impenetrable walls she could have been immured yet so much of strange and fearful must belong to her fate which the imagination mourned to think of love though in these days it carries on its tragedies more covertly and kills by the slow untold pang by the worm in the bosom and exerts its influence rather by teaching deceit than instigating to acts of violence yet love reigns in the hearts of men as tyrannically and fiercely and causes as much evil as much ruin and as many tears as when in the younger world hecatombs were slain in his honour in former days mortals wasted rather life than feeling and every blow was a physical one now the heart dies though the body lives and a miserable existence is dragged out after hope and joy have ceased to adorn it yet love is still despite the schoolmaster and the legislator the prime law of human life and alithea neville was well fitted to inspire an ardent passion she had a sensibility which while it gave strength to her affections yet diffused a certain weakness over the mechanism of her being that made those around her tremble she had genius which added lustre to her eye and shed around her a fascination of manner which no man could witness without desiring to dedicate himself to her service she seemed the very object whom sheridan addressed when he said for friends in every age you'll meet and lovers in the young that she should be loved to desperation could excite no wonder but what had been the effects of this love a distant home across the ocean a home of privation and sorrow the yearning for her lost children the slow breaking of the contrite heart a life dragged on despite the pangs of memory or a nameless grave such were the conjectures caused by the letter of the american at length neville returned each turned her eye on his face to read the intelligence he had acquired in his speaking countenance it was sad she lives and is lost thought lady cecil he mourns her dead was the supposition of the single minded elizabeth at first he avoided the subject of his inquiry and his companions did not question him till at last he suddenly exclaimed do you not wish to learn something sophia have you forgotten the object of my journey dear gerard replied lady cecil these walls and woods had they a voice could tell you that we have thought and spoken of nothing else she is dead he answered abruptly a start an exclamation was the reply he continued if there be any truth in the tale i have heard my dear injured mother is dead that is if what i have heard concern her mean anything or is not a mere fabrication you shall hear all by and by i will relate all i have been told it is a sad story if it be hers if it be a true story at all these disjointed expressions raised the curiosity and interest of his auditors to their height it was evening instead of going on with his account he passed into the adjoining room opened the glass door and stepped out into the open air it was dark scarcely could you see the dim outline of the woods yet far on the horizon where sky and sea met there was a streak of light sophia and elizabeth followed to the room whence he had gone and drew their chairs near the open window and pressed each other's hands what can it all mean at length said lady cecil hush whispered elizabeth he is here i saw him cross the streak of light true said gerard's voice his person they could not distinguish for they were in darkness i am here and i will tell you now all i have heard i will sit at your feet give me your hand sophy that i may feel that you are really present it is too dark to see anything he did not ask for elizabeth's hand but he took it and placing it on lady cecil's gently clasped both i cannot see either of you but indulge my wayward humour so much of coarse and commonplace has been thrown on the most sacred subject in the world that i want to bathe my soul in darkness a darkness as profound as that which wraps my mother's fate now for my story chapter xxii you know that i did not find this man this hoskins at lancaster by his direction i sought him in london and after some trouble found him he was busy in his own affairs and it was difficult to get at him but by perseverance and asking him to dine with me at a coffee house i at last succeeded he is a native of ravenglass a miserable town on the seashore of cumberland with which i am well acquainted for it is not far from dromore he emigrated to america before i was born and after various speculations is at last settled at boston in some sort of trade the exigences of which brought him over here and he seized the opportunity to visit his family there they were still inhabiting the forlorn town of ravenglass their cottage still looking out on a dreary extent of sand mud and marsh and the far mountains which would seem to invite the miserable dwellers of the flats to shelter themselves in their green recesses but they invite in vain hoskins found his mother a woman nearly a hundred years of age alive and a widowed sister living with her surrounded by a dozen children of all ages he passed two days with them and naturally recurred to the changes that had taken place in the neighbourhood he had at one time had dealings with the steward of dromore and had seen my father when he emigrated sir boyvill had just married hoskins asked how it went on with him and his bride it is our glorious fate to be in the mouths of the vulgar so he heard the story of my mother's mysterious flight and in addition to this he was told of my boyish wanderings my search for my mother and my declaration that i would give two hundred pounds to any one through whose means i should discover her fate the words fell at first upon a heedless ear but the next morning it all at once struck him that he might gain the reward and he wrote to me and as i was described as a wanderer without a home he wrote also to my father when i saw him in town he seemed ashamed of the trouble i had taken 'it is i who am to get the two hundred pounds' he said 'not you the chance was worth wasting a little breath but you may not think the little i have to tell worth your long journey' at length i brought him to the point at one period a good many years ago he was a settler in new york and by some chance he fell in with a man lately arrived from england who asked his advice as to obtaining employment he had some little money some few hundred pounds but he did not wish to sink it in trade or the purchase of land but to get some situation with a tolerable salary and keep his little capital at command a strange way of using money and time in america but such was the fancy of the stranger he said he should not be easy unless he could draw out his money at any time and emigrate at an hour's notice this man's name was osborne he was shrewd ready witted and good natured but idle and even unprincipled 'he did me a good turn once' said hoskins 'which makes me unwilling to do him a bad one but you cannot injure him i think in america he has risen in the world since the time i mention and has an employment under our minister at mexico after all he did not tell me much and what i learned came out in long talks by degrees during a journey or two we took together to the west he had been a traveller a soldier in the east indies and unlucky everywhere and it had gone hard with him at one time in bengal but for the kindness of a friend he was a gentleman far above him in station who got him out of trouble and paid his passage to england and afterward when this gentleman returned himself to the island he found osborne in trouble again and again he assisted him in short sir it came out that if this gentleman osborne would never tell his name stood his friend it was not for nothing this time there was a lady to be carried off osborne swore he did not know who he thought it a runaway match but it turned out something worse for never did girl take on so for leaving her home with a lover i tell the story badly for i never got the rights of it it ended tragically the lady died was drowned as well as i could make out in some river you know how dangerous the streams are on our coast 'it was the naming cumberland and our estuaries that set me asking questions which frightened osborne when he found that i was a native of that part of the world he grew as mute as a fish and never a word more of lady or friend did i get from him except as i guessed he was well rewarded and sent over the water out of the way and he swore he believed that the gentleman was dead too it was no murder that he averred but a sad tragic accident that might look like one and he grew as white as a sheet if ever i tried to bring him to speak of it again it haunted his thoughts nevertheless and he would talk in his sleep and dream of being hanged and mutter about a grave dug in the sands and there being no parson and the dark breakers of the ocean and horses scampering away and the lady's wet hair nothing regular but such as often made me waken him for in wild nights such mutterings were no lullaby 'now sir whether the lady he spoke of were your lady mother is more than i can say but the time and place tally it is twelve years this summer since he came out and it had just happened for his heart and head were full of horrors and he feared every vessel from europe brought out a warrant to arrest him or the like he was a chicken hearted fellow and i have known him hide himself for a week when a packet came from liverpool but he got courage as time went on when i saw him last he had forgotten all about it and when i jeered him about his terrors he laughed and said all was well and he should not care going to england for that the story was blown over and neither he nor his friend even so much as suspected 'this sir is my story and i don't think he ever told me any more or that i can remember anything else but such as i tell it i can swear to it there was a lady run off with and she died by fair means or foul before she quitted the coast and was buried as we might bury in the far west without bell or prayer book and osborne does not know the name of the lady but the gentleman he knew though he has never since heard of him and believes him to be dead you best know whether my story is worth the two hundred pounds' such sophia is the tale i heard such is the coarse hand and vulgar tongue that first touches the veil that conceals my mother's fate it is a strange story said lady cecil shuddering but on my life a true one cried neville as i will prove osborne is now at mexico i have inquired at the american consul's he is expected back to washington at the end of this summer in a few weeks i shall embark and see this man who now bears a creditable character and learn if there is any foundation for hoskins's conjectures if there is and can i doubt it if my mother died as he says i shall learn the manner of her death and who is the murderer murderer echoed both his auditors yes i cannot retract the word murderer in effect if not in deed remember i witnessed the act of violence which tore my mother from me he who carried her away is in all justice an assassin even if his hands be not imbrued with blood blood did i say nay none was shed i know the spot i have viewed the very scene our waste and desolate coast the perilous deceitful rivers in one of which she perished the very night so tempestuous the wild west wind bearing the tide with irresistible impetuosity up the estuaries he seeking the solitary sands perhaps some smuggling vessel lying in wait to carry her off unseen unheard to me it is as if i knew each act of the tragedy and heard her last sigh beneath the waves breathed for me she was dragged out by these men buried without friend without decent rites her tomb the evil report her enemy raised above her her grave the sands of that dreary shore oh what wild what miserable thoughts are these this tale instead of alleviating my anxious doubts has taken the sleep out from my eyes images of death are for ever passing before me i think of the murderer with a heart that pants for revenge and of my beloved mother with such pity such religious wo that i would spend my life on that shore seeking her remains so that at last i might shed my tears above them and bear them to a more sacred spot there is an easier way to gain both ends it is a sad but a wild and uncertain story remarked lady cecil and not sufficiently plain i think to take you away from us all across the atlantic a far slighter clew would take me so far replied gerard as you well know it is not for a traveller to egypt to measure miles with such timidity my dear sophy you would indeed think me mad if after devoting my life to one pursuit i were now to permit a voyage across the atlantic to stand between me and the slightest chance of having my doubts cleared up it is a voyage which thousands take every week for their interest or their pleasure i do much i think in postponing my journey till this man returns to washington at first i had thought of taking my passage on the instant and meeting him on his journey homeward from mexico but i might miss him yet i long to be on the spot in america for if anything should happen to him if he should die and his secret die with him how for ever after i should be stung by self reproach but there seems to me so little foundation lady cecil began neville made an impatient gesture exclaiming are you not unreasonable sophy my father has made a complete convert of you elizabeth interposed and asked you saw this man more than once who hoskins yes three times and he always told the same story he persisted in the main points that the scene of the carrying off of the lady was his native shore the coast of cumberland that the act immediately preceded osborne's arrival in america twelve years ago and that she died miserably the victim of her wretched lover he knew osborne immediately on his coming to new york when he was still suffering from the panic of such a tragedy dreading the arrival of every vessel from england at that time he concealed carefully from his new friend what he afterward in the overflow of his heart communicated so freely and in after times he reminded him how when an emissary of the police came from london to seek after some fraudulent defaulter he only hearing vaguely that there was search made for a criminal hid himself for several days that osborne was privy to was participator in a frightful tragedy which to my eyes bears the aspect of murder seems certain i do not i cannot doubt that my mother died then and there how the blood curdles to ask but i would compass the earth to learn to vindicate her name to avenge her death elizabeth felt gerard's hand tremble and grow cold he rose and led the way into the drawing room while lady cecil whispered to her friend i am so very very sorry to go to america on such a story as this a story which if it bear any semblance to the truth had better be for ever buried in oblivion dear elizabeth dissuade him i entreat you do you think mr neville so easy of persuasion or that he ought to be replied her companion certainly all that he has heard is vague coming as it does from a third and an interested person but his whole life has been devoted to the exculpation of his mother and if he believes that this tale affords a clew to lead to discovery he is a son and the nature that stirs within him may gift him with a clearer vision and a truer instinct than we can pretend to who can say but that a mysterious yet powerful hand is at last held out to guide him to the completion of his task oh dear lady cecil there are secrets in the moral sentient world of which we know nothing such as brought hamlet's father before his eyes such as now may be stirring in your brother's heart revealing to him the truth almost without his own knowledge you are as mad as he said lady cecil peevishly i thought you a calm and reasonable being who would co operate with me in weaning gerard from his wild fancies and in reconciling him to the world as it is but you indulge in metaphysical sallies and sublime flights which my commonplace mind can only regard as a sort of intellectual will o' the wisp you betray instead of assisting me peace be with mrs neville whether in her grave or in some obscure retreat she grieves over the follies of her youth she has been mourned for as never mother was mourned before but be reasonable dear elizabeth and aid me in putting a stop to gerard's insane career you can if you will he reveres you he would listen to you do not talk of mysterious hands and hamlet's ghost and all that is to carry us away to fairyland but of the rational duties of life and the proper aim of a man to be useful to the living and not spend the best years of his life in dreams of the dead what can i say replied elizabeth you will be angry but i sympathize with mr neville and i cannot help saying though you scoff at me that i think that in all he is doing he is obeying the most sacred law of our nature exculpating the innocent and rendering duty to her who has a right living or dead to demand all his love well said lady cecil i have managed very ill i had meant to make you my ally and have failed i do not oppose gerard in sir boyvill's open angry manner but it has been my endeavour throughout to mitigate his zeal and to change him from a wild sort of visionary into a man of this world he has talents he is the heir to large possessions his father would gladly assist any rational pursuit he might make a figure in his country he might be anything he pleased and instead of this all is wasted on the unhappy dead you do wrong to encourage him think of what i say and use your influence in a more beneficial manner during the following days this sort of argument was several times renewed lady cecil who had heretofore opposed neville covertly with some show of sympathy the fallacy of which he easily detected and who had striven rather to lead him to forget than to argue against his views now openly opposed his voyage to america gerard heard in silence he would not reply nothing she said carried the slightest weight with him and he had long been accustomed to opposition and to take his own way in spite of it he was satisfied to do so now without making an effort to convince her yet he was hurt and turned gladly to elizabeth for consolation her avowed and warm approval her anxious sympathy the certainty she expressed that in the end he would succeed and that his enthusiasm and zeal were implanted in his heart for the express purpose of his mother's vindication and that he would fail in every higher duty if he now held back all this echoed so faithfully his own thoughts that she already appeared a portion of his existence that he could never part from the dear and promised reward of all his exertions in the ardour of her sympathy elizabeth wrote to falkner she had before written to tell him that she had seen again her friend of marseilles she wrote trembling fearful of being recalled home for she remembered the mysterious shrinking of her father from the name of neville his replies however only spoke of a short journey he was making and a delay in his own joining her now again she wrote to speak of neville's filial piety his mother's death her alleged dishonour his sufferings and heroism she dilated on this subject with fond approval and expressed her wishes for his success in warm and eager terms for many days she had no reply a letter came at last it was short it besought her instantly to return this is the last act of duty of affection i shall ever ask falkner wrote comply without demurring come at once come and hear the fatal secret that will divide us for ever come i ask but for a day the eternal future you may you will pass with your new friends had the writing not been firm and clear such words had seemed to portend her benefactor's death wondering struck by fear inexpressibly anxious to comply with his wishes pale and trembling she besought lady cecil to arrange for her instant return gerard heard with sorrow but without surprise he knew if her father demanded her presence her first act would be obedience but he grieved to see her suffer and he began also to wonder by what strange coincidence they should both be doomed to sorrow through the disasters of their parents chapter xxiii falkner had parted with his dear adopted child under a strong excitement of fear concerning her health the change of air and scene restored her so speedily that his anxieties were of short duration he was however in no hurry to rejoin her as he was taught to consider a temporary separation from him as important to her convalescence for the first time after many years falkner was alone true he was so in greece but there he had an object in greece also it is true that he had dwelt on the past writing even a narrative of his actions and that remorse sat heavy at his heart while he pursued this task yet he went to greece to assist in a glorious cause and to redeem his name from the obloquy his confession would throw on it by his gallantry and death there was something animating in these reflections then also disease had not attacked him nor pain made him its prey his sensations were healthful and if his reflections were melancholy and self condemning yet they were attended by grandeur and even by sublimity the result of the danger that surrounded him and the courage with which he met it now he was left alone broken in health dashed in spirit consenting to live wishing to live for elizabeth's sake yet haunted still by one pale ghost and the knowledge that his bosom contained a secret which if divulged would acquire for him universal detestation he did not fear discovery but little do they know the human heart who are not aware of the throes of shame and anguish that attend the knowledge that we are in reality a cheat that we disguise our own real selves and that truth is our worst enemy left to himself falkner thought of these things with bitterness he loathed the burden that sat upon his soul he longed to cast it off yet when he thought of elizabeth her devoted affection and earnest entreaties he was again a coward how could he consent to give her up and plant a dagger in her heart there was but one cure to the irritation that his spirit endured which was to take refuge in her society and he was about to join her when a letter came speaking of gerard neville the same wild boy they had seen at baden the kind friend of marseilles still melancholy still stricken by adversity but endowed with a thousand qualities to attract love and admiration full of sentiment and poetry kind and tender as woman resolute and independent as a man elizabeth said little remembering falkner's previous restriction upon his name but she considered it her duty to mention him to her benefactor and that being her duty to him it became another to her new friend to assert his excellence lest by some chance falkner had mistaken and attributed qualities that did not belong to him falkner's thoughts became busy on this with new ideas it was at once pleasing and painful to hear of the virtues of gerard neville the pleasure was derived from the better portion of human nature the pain from the worst a lurking envy and dislike to excellence derived in any degree from one he hated and with such sentiment he regarded the father of gerard still he was the son of the angel he worshipped and had destroyed she had loved her child to adoration and to know that he grew up all she would have wished would console her wandering unappeased spirit he remembered his likeness to her and that softened him even more yet he thought of the past and what he had done and the very idea of her son lamenting for ever his lost mother filled him with renewed and racking remorse that elizabeth should now for the third time be thrown in his way was strange and his first impulse was to recall her it was well that gerard should be noble minded endowed with talent a rare and exalted being but that she should be brought into near contact with him was evil between falkner and gerard neville there existed a gulf unfathomable horrific deadly and any friendship between him and his adopted child must cause disunion between her and falkner he had suffered much but this last blow a cause for disuniting them would tax his fortitude too much yet thus it was to be taxed he received a letter from lady cecil of which elizabeth was ignorant its ostensible object was to give good tidings of her fair guest's health and to renew her invitation to him but there was a covert meaning which falkner detected lady cecil though too young to be an inveterate matchmaker yet conceived and cherished the idea of the marriage of neville and elizabeth in common parlance gerard might look higher but so also might elizabeth apparently the only daughter and heiress of a man of good birth and easy fortune but this went for little with lady cecil gerard's peculiar disposition his devotion to his dead mother his distaste to all society the coldness he had hitherto manifested to feminine attractions made the choice of a wife difficult for him elizabeth's heroic and congenial character her total inexperience in the world and readiness to sympathize with sentiments which to the ordinary class of women would appear extravagant and foolish all this suited them for each other lady cecil saw them together and felt that intimacy would produce love she was delighted but thinking it right that the father should have a voice she wrote to falkner scarcely alluding to these things but with a delicate tact that enabled her to convey her meaning and falkner jumping at once to the conclusion saw that his child was lost to him for ever there arose from this idea a convulsion of feeling that shook him as an earthquake shakes the firm land making the most stable edifices totter a chill horror ran through his veins a cold dew broke out on his forehead it was unnatural it was fatal it must bring on all their heads tenfold ruin yet wherefore elizabeth was no child of his elizabeth falkner could never wed gerard neville but between him and elizabeth raby there existed no obstacle nay how better could he repay the injury he had done him in depriving him of his mother than by bestowing on him a creature perhaps more perfect to be his solace and delight to the end of his life so must it be here falkner's punishment would begin to exile himself for ever from her who was the child of his heart the prop of his existence it was dreadful to think of but it must be done and how was the sacrifice to be fulfilled by restoring elizabeth to her father's family and then withdrawing himself to a distant land he need not add to this the confession of his crime no thus should he compensate to gerard for the injury done him and burning his papers leaving still in mystery the unknown past die without its ever being known to elizabeth that he was the cause of her husband's sorrows it was travelling fast to arrange this future for all three but there are moments when the future with all its contingences and possibilities becomes glaringly distinct to our foreseeing eye and we act as if that was which we believe must be he would become a soldier once again and the boon of death would not be for ever denied to him to restore elizabeth to her family was at any rate but doing her a long withheld justice the child of honour and faithful affection who bore a proud name whose loveliness of person and mind would make her a welcome treasure in any family she despite her generous sacrifices should follow his broken fortunes no longer if the notion of her marrying neville were a mere dream still to give back to her name and station was a benefit which it was unjust any longer to withhold nor should it be a question between them they were now divided so should they remain he would reveal her existence to her family claim their protection and then withdraw himself while she occupied by a new and engrossing sentiment would easily get reconciled to his absence the first step he took in furtherance of this new resolution was to make inquiries concerning the present state of elizabeth's family of which hitherto he knew no more than what he gathered from her mother's unfinished letter and this was limited to their being a wealthy catholic family proud of their ancestry and devoted to their faith through his solicitor he gained intelligence of their exact situation he heard that there was a family of that name in northumberland it was roman catholic and exceedingly rich the present head of the family was an old man he had long been a widower left with a family of six sons the eldest had married early and was dead leaving his widow with four daughters and one son yet a child who was the heir of the family honours and estates and resided with his mother for the most part at the mansion of his grandfather of the remaining sons little account could be gained it was the family custom to concentrate all its prosperity and wealth on the head of the eldest son and the younger precluded by their religion at that time from advancement in their own country entered foreign service one only had exempted himself from the common lot and become an outcast and in the eyes of his family a reprobate edwin raby had apostatized from the catholic faith he had married a portionless girl of inferior birth and entered the profession of the law his parents looked with indignation on the dishonour entailed on their name through his falling off but his death relieved their terrors he died leaving a widow and an infant daughter as the marriage had never been acknowledged and female offspring were held supernumerary and an encumbrance in the raby family they had refused to receive her and never heard of her more she was it was conjectured living in obscurity among her own relations falkner at once detected the truth the despised deserted widow had died in her youth and the daughter of edwin raby was the child of his adoption on this information falkner regulated his conduct and finding that elizabeth's grandfather old oswi raby resided habitually at his seat in the north of england he his health now restored sufficiently to make the journey without inconvenience set out for northumberland to communicate the existence and claim his acknowledgment of his granddaughter there are periods in our lives when we seem to run away from ourselves and our afflictions to commence a new course of existence upon fresh ground towards a happier goal sometimes on the contrary the stream of life doubles runs back to old scenes and we are constrained to linger amid the desolation we had hoped to leave far behind thus was it with falkner the past clung to him inextricably what had he to do with those who had suffered through his misdeed he had fled from them he had traversed a quarter of the earth he had placed a series of years between them but there he was again in the same spot the same forms before him the same names sounding in his ears the effects of his actions impending darkly and portentously over him seeing no escape but by casting away the only treasure of his life his adopted child and becoming again a solitary miserable wanderer no man ever suffered more keenly than falkner the stings of remorse no man ever resolved more firmly to meet the consequences of his actions systematically and without outward flinching it was perseverance to one goal that had occasioned all his sin and wo it followed him in his repentance and though misery set a visible mark on his brow he did not hesitate nor delay the journey to northumberland was long for he could only proceed by short stages and all the time miserable reflection doubled every mile and stretched each hour into twice its duration he was alone to look back was wretchedness to think of elizabeth was no solace hereafter they were to be divided hereafter no voice of love or gentle caress would chase the darkness from his brow he was to be for ever alone at length he arrived at his destination and reached the entrance to belleforest the mansion a fine old gothic building adorned by the ruins of an ancient abbey was in itself venerable and extensive and surrounded by a princely demesne this was the residence of elizabeth's ancestors of her nearest relations here her childhood would have been spent under these venerable oaks within these ancestral walls falkner was glad to think that in being forced to withdraw from her his own protection she would take a higher station and in the world's eye become more on an equality with gerard neville everything around denoted grandeur and wealth the very circumstance that the family adhered to the ancient faith of the land to a form of worship which though evil in its effects on the human mind is to the eye imposing and magnificent shed a greater lustre round the place on inquiry falkner heard that the old gentleman was at belleforest indeed he never quitted it but that his daughter in law with her family were in the south of england mr raby was very accessible on asking for him falkner was instantly ushered in he entered a library of vast dimensions and fitted up with a sort of heavy splendour very imposing but very sombre the high windows painted ceiling and massy furniture bespoke an oldfashioned but almost regal taste falkner for a moment thought himself alone when a slight noise attracted his attention to a diminutive and very white old gentleman who advanced towards him the mansion looked built for a giant race and falkner expecting the majesty of size could hardly contract his view to the slender and insignificant figure of the present possessor oswi raby looked shrivelled not so much by age as the narrowness of his mind to whose dimensions his outward figure had contracted itself his face was pale and thin his light blue eyes grown dim you might have thought that he was drying up and vanishing from the earth by degrees contrasted with this slight shadow of a man was a mind that saw the whole world almost concentrated in himself he oswi raby he head of the oldest family in england was first of created beings without being assuming in manner he was self important in heart and there was an obstinacy and an incapacity to understand that anything was of consequence except himself or rather except the house he represented that gave extreme repulsion to his manners it is always awkward to disclose an errand such as falkner's it was only by plunging at once into it and warming himself by his own words that he contrived to throw grace round his subject a cloud gathered over the old man's features he grew whiter and his thin lips closed as if they had never opened except with a refusal you speak of very painful circumstances he said i have sometimes feared that i should be intruded upon in behalf of this person yet after so many years there is less pretence than ever for encroaching upon an injured family edwin himself broke the tie he was rebellious and apostate he had talents and might have distinguished himself to his honour he preferred irreparable disgrace he abandoned the religion which we consider as the most precious part of our inheritance and he added imprudence to guilt by he being himself unprovided for marrying a portionless low born girl he never hoped for my forgiveness he never even asked it his death it is hard for a father to feel thus but his death was a relief we were applied to by his widow but with her we could have nothing to do she was the partner of his rebellion nay we looked upon her as its primal cause i was willing to take charge of my grandchild if delivered entirely up to me she did not even think proper to reply to the letter making this concession i had indeed come to the determination of continuing to her a portion of the allowance i made to my son despite his disobedience but from that time to this no tidings of either mother or daughter have reached us death must bear the blame of that negligence said falkner mastering his rising disgust mrs raby was hurried to the grave but a few months after your son's death the victim of her devoted affection to her husband their innocent daughter was left among strangers who did not know to whom to apply she at least is free from all fault and has every claim on her father's family she is nothing and has no claim interrupted mr raby peevishly beyond a bare maintenance even if she be the person you represent i beg your pardon sir but you may be deceived yourself on this subject but taking it for granted that this young person is the daughter of my son what is she to me a granddaughter is a relation falkner began a near and dear one under such circumstances interrupted mr raby under the circumstances of a marriage to which i gave no consent and her being brought up at a distance from us all i should rather call her a connexion than a relation we cannot look with favour on the child of an apostate educated in a faith which we consider pernicious i am an oldfashioned man accustomed only to the society of those whose feelings coincide with mine and i must apologize sir if i say anything to shock you but the truth is self evident a child of a discarded son may have a slender claim for support none for favour or countenance this young person has no right to raise her eyes to us she must regulate her expectations by the condition of her mother who was a sort of servant a humble companion or governess in the house of mrs neville of dromore falkner grew pale at the name but commanding himself replied i believe she was a friend of that lady i have said i was unacquainted with the parents of miss raby i found her an orphan subsisting on precarious charity her few years her forlorn situation her beauty and sweetness claimed my compassion i adopted her and would now throw her off again interrupted the ill tempered old man had you restored her to us in her childhood had she been brought up in our religion among us she would have shared this home with her cousins as it is you must yourself be aware that it will be impossible to admit as an inmate a stranger a person ignorant of our peculiar systems an alien from our religion mrs raby would never consent to it and i would on no account annoy her who as the mother and guardian of my heir merits every deference i will however consult with her and with the gentleman who has the conduct of my affairs and as you wish to get rid of an embarrassment which pardon me if i say you entirely brought on yourself we will do what we judge due to the honour of the family but i cannot hold out any hopes beyond a maintenance unless this young person whom i should then regard as my granddaughter felt a vocation for a religion out of whose pale i will never acknowledge a relation at every word falkner grew more angry he always repressed any manifestation of passion and only grew pale and spoke in a lower calmer voice there was a pause he glanced at the white hair and attenuated form of the old man so to acquire a sufficient portion of forbearance and then replied it is enough forget this visit you shall never hear again of the existence of your outraged grandchild could you for a moment comprehend her worth you might feel regret at casting from you one whose qualities render her the admiration of all who know her some day when the infirmities of age increase upon you you may remember that you might have had a being near the most compassionate and kind that breathes if ever you feel the want of an affectionate hand to smooth your pillow you may remember that you have shut your heart to one who would have been a daily blessing i do not wish to disembarrass myself of miss raby miss falkner rather let me call her she has borne my name as my daughter for many years and shall continue to retain it together with my paternal guardianship while i live i have the honour to wish you a good morning falkner hastily departed and as he threw himself on his horse and at a quick pace traversed the long avenues of belleforest he felt that boiling of the blood that inexpressible bursting and tumult of the heart that accompanies fierce indignation and disdain a vehement desire to pour out the cataract of his contempt and anger on the offender was mingled with redoubled tenderness for elizabeth with renewed gratitude for all he owed her and a yearning heart warming desire to take her again to the shelter of his love from whence she should never more depart chapter xxiv falkner's mind had undergone a total change he had gone to belleforest believing it to be his duty to restore to its possessors a dearer treasure than any held by them he left it resolved never to part from his adopted child get rid of an embarrassment he repeated to himself get rid of elizabeth of tender affection truth and fidelity of the heart's fondest ties my soul's only solace how often has my life been saved and cheered by her only and when i would sacrifice blessings of which i hold myself unworthy i hear the noblest and most generous being in the world degraded by the vulgar sordid prejudices of that narrow minded bigot how paltry seems the pomp of wealth or the majesty of these ancient woods when it is recollected that they are lorded over by such a thing as that falkner's reflections were all painful his heavily burdened conscience weighed him to the earth he felt that there was justice in a part of mr raby's representations that if elizabeth had been brought up under his care in a religion which because it was persecuted was the more valuable in their eyes participating in their prejudices and endeared to them by habit she would have had claims which as she was unseen unknown and totally disjoined from them in opinions and feelings she could never possess he was the cause of this having in her infancy chosen to take her to himself to link his desolate fate to her brighter one and now he could only repent for her sake yet for her sake he did repent when looking forward he thought of the growing attachment between her and the son of his victim what could he do recall her forbid her again to see gerard neville unexplained commands are ever unjust and had any strong feeling sprung up in either of their hearts they could not be obeyed should he tell her all and throw himself on her mercy he would thus inflict deep irreparable pangs and besides place her in a painful situation where duty would struggle with inclination and pride and affection both made it detestable to him to create such a combat in her heart and cause her to feel pangs and make sacrifices for him what other part was there to take to remain neuter let events take their course if it ended as he foresaw when a marriage was mentioned he could reveal her real birth married to gerard neville her relations would gladly acknowledge her and then he could withdraw for ever he should have much to endure meanwhile to hear a name perpetually repeated that thrilled to the very marrow of his bones perhaps to see the husband and son of her he had destroyed he felt sick at heart at such a thought he put it aside it was not to day it could not be to morrow that he should be called upon to encounter these evils meanwhile he would shut his eyes upon them returning homeward he felt impelled to prolong his tour he visited some of the lakes of westmoreland and the mountain scenery of derbyshire the thought of return was painful so he lingered on the way and wrote for his letters to be forwarded to him he had been some weeks without receiving any from elizabeth and he felt extreme impatience again to be blessed with the sight of her handwriting he felt how passionately he loved her how to part from her was to part from every joy of life he called himself her father his heart acknowledged the tie in every pulsation no father ever worshipped a child so fervently her voice her smile and dear loving eyes where were they they were far but here was something a little packet of letters that must for the present stand in lieu of the dearer blessing of her presence he looked at the papers with delight he pressed them to his lips he delayed to open them as if he did not deserve the joy they would communicate as if its excess would overpower him i purpose parting from her he thought but still she is mine mine when she traced those lines mine as i read the expressions of her affection there are hours of delight garnered for me in those little sealed talismans that nothing future or past can tarnish and yet the name of neville will be there the thought brought a cold chill with it and he opened the letters hastily to know the worst elizabeth had half forgotten the pain with which falkner had at one time shrunk from a name become so dear to her when she wrote her heart was full of gerard's story and besides she had had letters from her father speaking of him with kindness so that she indulged herself by alluding to it to the disappearance of his mother and gerard's misery the trial the brutality of sir boyvill and last to the resolution formed in childhood brooded over through youth now acted upon to discover his mother's destroyer nor is it she wrote any vulgar feeling of vengeance that influences him but the purest and noblest motives she is stigmatized as unworthy he would vindicate her fame when i hear the surmises the accusations cast on her i feel with him to hear a beloved parent accused of guilt must indeed be the most bitter wo to believe her innocent and to prove her such the only alleviation god grant that he may succeed and though i wish no ill to any human being yet rather may the height of evil fall on the head of the true criminal than continue to cloud the days of a being whose soul is moulded in sensibility and honour thus do you pray heedless elizabeth may the true criminal feel the height of evil may he whom you have saved from death endure tortures compared to which a thousand deaths were nothing be it so you shall have your wish impetuous as fire falkner did not pause something some emotion devouring as fire was lighted up in his heart there must be no delay never had he seen the effects of his crime in so vivid a light avoiding the name of neville he had never heard that of his victim coupled with shame she was unfortunate but he persuaded himself that she was not thought guilty dear injured saint had then her sacred name been bandied about by the vulgar she pronounced unworthy by the judges of her acts ignominy heaped upon the grave he had dug for her was her beloved son the victim of his belief in her goodness had his youthful life been blighted by his cowardly concealments oh rather a thousand deaths than such a weight of sin upon his soul he would declare all offer his life in expiation what more could be demanded and again this might be thought a more sordid motive and yet it was not gerard was vowed to the discovery of the true criminal he would discover him earth would render up her secrets heaven lead the son to the very point by slow degrees his crime would be unveiled elizabeth called upon to doubt and to believe his vehement disposition was not calculated to bear the slow process of such discoveries he would meet them avow all let the worst fall on him it was happiness to know and feel the worst lost for ever he would deliver himself up to reprobation and the punishment of his guilt too long he had delayed now all his motives for concealment melted away like snow overspread by volcanic fire fierce hurrying destiny seized him by the hair of his head crying aloud murderer offer up thy blood shade of alithea take thy victim he wrote instantly to elizabeth to meet him at their home at wimbledon and proceeded thither himself unfortunately the tumult of his thoughts acted on his health after he had proceeded a few miles he was taken ill for three days he was confined to his bed in a high fever he thought he was about to die his secret untold copious bleeding however subdued the violence of the attack and weak and faint he despite his physician's advice proceeded homeward weak and faint an altered man life had no charms no calls but one duty hitherto he had lived in contempt of the chain of effects which ever links pain to evil and of the providence which will not let the innocent be for ever traduced it had fallen on him now his punishment had begun not as he in the happier vehemence of passion had determined not by sudden self inflicted or glorious death but the slow grinding of the iron wheels of destiny as they passed over him crushing him in the dust yet his heart despite its sufferings warmed with something like pleasure when after a tedious journey of three days he drew near his home where he hoped to find elizabeth he had misgivings he had asked her to return but she might have written to request a delay no she was there she had been there two days anxiously expecting him it is so sweet a thing to hear the voice of one we love welcoming us on our return home it seems to assure us of a double existence not only in our own identity which we bear perpetually about with us but in the heart we leave behind which has thought of us lived for us and now beats with warm pleasure on beholding the expected one on the whole earth falkner loved none but elizabeth he hated himself the past the present the future as they appertained to him were all detestable remorse grief and loathsome anticipation made up the sum of feelings with which he regarded them but here bright and beautiful without taint all affection and innocence a monument of his own good feelings a lasting rock to which to moor his every hope stood before him the child of his adoption his heart felt bursting when he thought of all she was to him yet a doubt entered to mar his satisfaction was she changed if love had insinuated itself into her heart he was rejected at least the plenteous abundant fountain that gave from its own source would be changed to the still waters that neither received increase nor bestowed any overflowing worse than this she loved gerard neville the son of his victim he whose life was devastated by him who would regard him with abhorrence he would teach elizabeth to partake this feeling the blood stood chilled in falkner's heart when he thought of thus losing the only being he loved on earth he mastered these feelings when he saw her the first moment indeed when she flew to his arms and expressed with eager fondness her delight in seeing him again was all happiness she perceived the traces of suffering on his brow and chided herself for having remained away so long she promised never to absent herself thus again every remembered look and tone of her dear face and voice now brought palpably before him was a medicine to falkner he repressed his uneasiness he banished his fears for a few hours he made happiness his own again the evening was passed in calm and cheering conversation no word was said of the friends whom elizabeth had left she had forgotten them during the first few hours she spent with her father and when she did allude to her visit falkner said we will talk of these things to morrow to night let us only think of ourselves elizabeth felt a little mortified the past weeks the fortunes of her friends and the sentiments they excited had become a part of herself and she was pained that so much of disjunction existed between her and falkner as to make that which was so vivid and present to her vacant of interest to him but she checked her disappointment soon he would know her new friend sympathize in his devotion towards his injured mother enter as warmly as she did into the result of his endeavours for her exculpation meanwhile she yielded to his wish and they talked of scenes and countries they had visited together and all the feelings and opinions engendered by the past as they were wont to do in days gone by before a stranger influence had disturbed a world in which they lived for each other only father and daughter without an interest beyond nothing could be more pure and entire than their affection and there was between them that mingling of hearts which words cannot describe but which whenever it is experienced in whatever relation in life is unalloyed happiness there was a total absence of disguise of covert censure of mutual diffidence perfect confidence gave rise to the fearless utterance of every idea and there was a repose and yet an enjoyment in the sense of sympathy and truth which filled and satisfied falkner was surprised at the balmy sense of joy that despite everything stole over him and he kissed and blessed his child as she retired for the night with more grateful affection a fuller sense of her merits and a more fervent desire of preserving her always near him than he had ever before been conscious of experiencing chapter xxv elizabeth rose on the following morning her bosom glowing with a sensation of acknowledged happiness so much of young love brooded in her heart as quickened its pulsations as gave lightness and joy to her thoughts she had no doubts nor fears nor even hopes she was not aware that love was the real cause of the grateful sense of happiness with which she avowed to heaven and herself that all was peace she was glad to be reunited to falkner for whom she felt an attachment at once so respectful and yet on account of his illness and melancholy so watchful and tender as never allowed her to be wholly free from solicitude when absent from him also she expected on that morning to see gerard neville when falkner's letter came to hasten her departure from oakly she felt grieved at the recall at the moment when she was expecting him to join her so to fill up the measure of her enjoyments with all this she was eager to obey and anxious to be with him again lady cecil deputed miss jervis to accompany her on the very morning of their departure neville asked for a seat in the carriage they travelled to town together and when they separated neville told her of his intention of immediately securing a passage to america and since then had written a note to mention that he should ride over to wimbledon on that morning the deep interest that elizabeth took in his enterprise made her solicitous to know whether he had procured any further information but her paramount desire was to introduce him to falkner to inspire him with her sentiments of friendship and to see two persons whom she considered superior to the rest of the world bound to each other by a mutual attachment she wanted to impart to her father a pity for alithea's wrongs and an admiration for her devoted son she walked in the shrubbery before breakfast enjoying nature with the enthusiasm of love she gathered the last roses of the departing season and mingling them with a few carnations hung with a new sense of rapture over these fairest children of nature for it is the property of love to enhance all our enjoyments to paint the lily and add a perfume to the rose when she returned to the house she was told that falkner still slept and begged not to be disturbed she breakfasted therefore by herself sitting by the open casement and looking on the waving trees her flowers shedding a sweet atmosphere around sometimes turning to her open book where she read of the heavenly una with her milk white lamb and sometimes leaning her cheek upon her hand in one of those reveries where we rather feel than think and every articulation of the frame thrills with a living bliss the quick canter of a horse the stopping at the gate the ringing of the bell and the entrance of neville made her heart beat and her eyes light up with gladness he entered with a lighter step a more cheerful and animated mien than usual he was aware that he loved he was assured that elizabeth was the being selected from the whole world who could make him happy while he regarded her with all the admiration the worship due to her virtues he had never loved before the gloom that absorbed him the shyness inspired by his extreme sensitiveness had hitherto made him avoid the society of women their pleasures their gayety their light airy converse were a blank to him it was elizabeth's sufferings that first led him to remark her the clearness of her understanding her simplicity tenderness and dignity of soul won him and lastly the unbounded undisguised sympathy she felt for his endeavours which all else regarded as futile and insane riveted him to her indissolubly events were about to separate them but her thoughts would accompany him across the atlantic stand suspended while his success was dubious and hail his triumph with a joy equal to his own the very thought gave fresh ardour to his desire to fulfil his task he had no doubt of success and though the idea of his mother's fate was still a cloud in the prospect it only mellowed without defacing the glowing tints shed over it by love they met with undisguised pleasure he sat near her and gazed with such delight as to one less inexperienced than elizabeth would have at once betrayed the secret of his heart he told her that he had found a vessel about to sail for new york and that he had engaged a passage on board he was restless and uneasy he feared a thousand chances he felt as if he were neglecting his most sacred duty by any delay there was something in him urging him on telling him that the crisis was at hand and yet that any neglect on his part might cause the moment to slip by for ever when arrived at new york he should proceed with all speed to washington and then if osborne had not arrived he should set forward to meet him so much might intervene to balk his hopes osborne might die and his secret die with him every moment's delay was crime the vessel was to drop down the river that very night and to morrow he was to join her at sheerness he had come to say farewell this sudden departure led to a thousand topics of interest to his hopes his certainty that all would soon be revealed and he rewarded for his long suffering such ideas led him to speak of the virtues of his mother which were the foundation of his hopes he spoke of her as he remembered her he described her watchful tenderness her playful but well regulated treatment of himself still in his dreams he said he sometimes felt pressed in her arms and kissed with all the passionate affection of her maternal heart in such sweet visions her cry of agony would mingle it seemed the last shriek of wo and death can you wonder continued neville can my father can sophia wonder that recollecting all these things i will not bear without a struggle that my mother's name should be clouded her fate encompassed by mystery and blame her very warm kind feelings and enchanting sensibility turned into accusations against her i do indeed hope and believe that i shall learn the truth whither i am going and that the unfortunate victim of lawless violence of whom osborne spoke is my lost mother but if i am disappointed in this expectation i shall not for that give up my pursuit it will only whet my purpose to seek the truth elsewhere and that truth may be less sad than you anticipate said elizabeth yet i cannot help fearing that the miserable tragedy which you have heard is connected with your mother's fate that it is a tragedy may well dash my eagerness replied neville for right or wrong i cannot help feeling that to see her again to console her for her sufferings to show that she is remembered loved idolized by her son would be a dearer reward to me than triumph over the barbarous condemnation of the world if that triumph is to be purchased by having lost her for ever this is not an heroic feeling i confess if it be heroism said elizabeth to find our chief good in serving others if compassion sympathy and generosity be greater virtues as i believe than cold self absorbed severity then is your feeling founded on the purest portion of our nature while they were thus talking seated near each other elizabeth's face beaming with celestial benignity and neville in the warmth of his gratitude for her approval had taken her hand and pressed it to his lips the door opened and falkner slowly entered he had not heard of the arrival of the stranger but seeing a guest with elizabeth he divined in a moment who it was the thought ran through his frame like an ice bolt his knees trembled under him cold dew gathered on his brow for a moment he leaned against the doorway unable to support himself while elizabeth perceiving his entrance blushing she knew not why and now frightened by the ghastly pallor of his face started up exclaiming my father are you ill falkner struggled a moment longer and then recovered his self possession the disordered expression of his countenance was replaced by a cold and stern look which aided by the marble paleness that settled over it looked more like the chiselling of a statue than mortal endurance a lofty resolve to bear unflinchingly was the spirit that moulded his features into an appearance of calm from this moment he acquired the strength of body as well as of mind to meet the destiny before him the energy of his soul did not again fail every instant every word seemed to add to his courage to nerve him to the utmost height of endurance to make him ready to leap without one tremour into the abyss which he had so long and so fearfully avoided the likeness of neville to his mother had shaken him more than all his voice whose tones were the same with hers was another shock his very name jarred upon his sense but he betrayed no token of suffering mr neville said elizabeth is come to take leave of me to morrow he sails to america to america wherefore asked falkner i wrote to you she replied i explained the motives of this voyage you know i know all said falkner and this voyage to america is superfluous neville echoed the word with surprise while elizabeth exclaimed do you think so you must have good reasons for this opinion tell them to mr neville your counsels i am sure will be of use to him i have often wished that you had been with us i am so glad that he sees you before he goes if he does go you say his voyage is superfluous tell him wherefore advise him your advice will i am sure be good i would give the world that he did the exact thing that is best that is most likely to succeed neville looked gratefully at her as she spoke thus eagerly while falkner still standing his eyes fixed on and scanning the person of the son of his victim marble pale but displaying feeling by no other outward sign scarcely heard what she said till her last words drew his attention he smiled as in scorn and said oh yes i can advise and he shall succeed and he will not go i shall be happy said neville with surprise i am willing to be advised that is if your advice coincides with my wishes it shall do so interrupted falkner then exclaimed neville impetuously the moments that i linger here will appear to you too many you will desire that i should be on board already already under sail already arrived you will wish the man whom i seek should be waiting on the sands when i reach the shore he is much nearer said falkner calmly he is before you i am he neville started you what mean you you are not osborne i am rupert falkner your mother's destroyer neville glanced at elizabeth his eye met hers their thought was the same that this declaration proceeded from insanity the fire that flashed from falkner's eyes as he spoke the sudden crimson that died his cheeks the hollow though subdued tone of his voice gave warrant for such a suspicion elizabeth gazed on him with painful solicitude i will not stay one moment longer continued falkner to pain you by the sight of one so accursed as i you will hear more from me this very evening you will hear enough to arrest your voyage and remember that i shall remain ready to answer any call to make any reparation any atonement you may require he was gone the door closed it was as if a dread spectre had vanished and neville and elizabeth looked at each other to read in the face of either whether both were conscious of having been visited by the same vision what does he mean can you tell me what to think cried neville almost gasping for breath i will tell you in a few hours said elizabeth i must go to him now i fear he is very ill this is madness when your mother died mr neville my father and i were travelling together in russia or poland i remember dates i am sure that it was so this is too dreadful farewell you sail to morrow you shall hear from me to night be sure that i do said neville for there is a method in his speech a dignity and a composure in his manner that enforces a sort of belief what can he mean do you imagine cried elizabeth that there is any truth in these unhappy ravings that my father who would not tread upon a worm whose compassionate disposition and disinterestedness have been known to me since early childhood the noblest and yet the gentlest of human beings do you imagine that he is a murderer dear mr neville he never could have seen your mother is it indeed so said neville yet he said one word did you not remark he called himself rupert but i will not distress you you will write or rather as my time will be occupied in preparations for my voyage and i scarcely know where the day will be spent i will call here this evening at nine if you cannot see me send me a note to the gate containing some information either to expedite or delay my journey even if this strange scene be the work of insanity how can i leave you in distress and if it be true what he says if he be the man i saw tear my mother from me how altered how turned to age and decrepitude yet if he be that man then i have a new and horrible course to take is it so cried elizabeth with indignation and can a man so cloud his fair fame so destroy his very existence by the wild words of delirium that my dear father should be accused of being the most odious criminal nay replied neville i make no accusation do not part from me in anger you are right i do not doubt and i am unjust i will call to night do so without fail do not lose your passage i little knew that personal feeling would add to my eagerness to learn the truth do not stay for my sake come to night and learn how false and wild my father's words were and then hasten to depart to see osborne to learn all farewell till this evening she hurried away to falkner's room while stunned doubting forced by elizabeth to entertain doubts and yet convinced in his heart for the name of rupert brought conviction home neville left the house he had entered it fostering the sweetest dreams of happiness and now he dared not look at the reverse elizabeth filled with the most poignant inquietude with regard to his health hastened to the sitting room which falkner usually occupied she found him seated at the table with a small box a box she well remembered open before him he was looking over the papers it contained his manner was perfectly composed the natural hue had returned to his cheeks his look was sedate he was indeed very different from the man who thirteen years before had landed in cornwall he was then in the prime of life and if passion defaced his features still youth and health and power animated his frame long years of grief and remorse with sickness superadded had made him old before his time the hair had receded from the temples and what remained was sprinkled with gray his figure was bent and attenuated his face careworn yet at this moment he had regained a portion of his former self there was an expression on his face of satisfaction almost of triumph and when he saw elizabeth the old sweet smile she knew and loved so well lighted up his countenance he held out his hand she took it there was no fever in the palm his pulse was equable and when he spoke his voice did not falter he said this blow has fallen heavily on you my dear girl yet all will be well soon i trust meanwhile it cannot be quite unexpected elizabeth looked her astonishment he continued you have long known that a heavy crime weighs on my conscience it renders me unfit to live yet i have not been permitted to die i sought death but we are seldom allowed to direct our fate i do not however complain i am well content with the end which will speedily terminate all my dearest father cried elizabeth i cannot guess what you mean i thought but no you are not ill you are not not mad dearest was that your thought it is a madness at least that has lasted long since first you stayed my hand on your mother's grave you are too good too affectionate to regret having saved me even when you hear who i am you are too resigned to providence not to acquiesce in the way chosen to bring all things to their destined end elizabeth put her arm round his neck and kissed him thank you said falkner and god bless you for this kindness i shall indeed be glad if you from your heart pardon and excuse me meanwhile my love there is something to be done these papers contain an account of the miserable past you must read them and then let mr neville have them without delay nay said elizabeth spare me this one thing do not ask me to read the history of any one error of yours in my eyes you must ever be the first and best of human beings if it has ever been otherwise i will not hear of it you shall never be accused of guilt before me even by yourself call it then my justification said falkner but do not refuse my request it is necessary if it be pain pardon me for inflicting it but bear it for my sake i wrote this narrative when i believed myself about to die in greece for the chief purpose of disclosing the truth to you i have told my story truly and simply you can have it from no one else for no human being breathes who knows the truth except myself yield then you have ever been yielding to me yield i beseech you to my solemn request do not shrink from hearing of my crimes i hope soon to atone them and then perform one other duty send these papers to your friend you know where he is he will call here this evening at nine by that time you will have finished i am going to town now but shall return to night mr neville will be come and gone before then and you will know all i do not doubt but that you will pity me such is your generosity that perhaps you may love me still but you will be shocked and wretched and i the cause alas how many weapons do our errors wield and how surely does retribution aim at our defenceless side to know that i am the cause of unhappiness to you my sweet girl inflicts a pang i cannot endure with any fortitude but there is a remedy and all will be well in the end elizabeth hung over him as he spoke and he felt a tear warm on his cheek fallen from her eye he was subdued by this testimony of her sympathy he strained her to his heart but in a moment after he reassumed his self command and kissing her bade her farewell and then left her to the task of sorrow he had assigned she knew not what to think what image to conjure up his words were free from all incoherence before her also were the papers that would tell all she turned from them with disgust and then again she thought of neville his departure his promised return and what she could say to him it was a hideous dream but there was no awakening she sat down she took out the papers the number of pages written in her father's hand seemed a reprieve she should not hear all the dreadful truth in a few short piercing words there was preparation for a moment she paused to gather her thoughts to pray for fortitude to hope that the worst was not there but in its stead some venial error that looked like crime to his sensitive mind and then she began to read chapter xxvi falkner's narrative to palliate crime and by investigating motive to render guilt less odious such is not the feeling that rules my pen to confer honour upon innocence to vindicate virtue and announce truth though that offer my own name as a mark for deserved infamy such are my motives and if i reveal the secrets of my heart and dwell on the circumstances that led to the fatal catastrophe i record so that though a criminal i do not appear quite a monster let the egotism be excused for her dear sake within whose young and gentle heart i would fain that my memory should be enshrined without horror though with blame the truth the pure and sacred truth will alone find expression in these pages i write them in a land of beauty but of desolation in a country whose inhabitants are purchasing by blood and misery the dearest privileges of human nature where i have come to die it is night the cooing aziolo the hooting owl the flashing fire fly the murmur of time honoured streams the moonlit foliage of the gray olive woods dark crags and rugged mountains throwing awful shadows and the light of the eternal stars such are the objects around me can a man speak false in the silence of night when god and his own heart alone keep watch when conscience hears the moaning of the dead in the pauses of the breeze and sees one pale lifeless figure float away on the current of the stream my heart whispers that before such witnesses the truth will be truly recorded and my blood curdles and my nerves so firm amid the din of battle shrink and shudder at the tale i am about to narrate what is crime a deed done injurious to others forbidden by religion condemned by morality and which human laws are enacted to punish a criminal feels all mankind to be his foes the whole frame of society is erected for his especial ruin before he had a right to choose his habitation in the land of his forefathers and placing the sacred name of liberty between himself and power none dared check his freeborn steps his will was his law the limits of his physical strength were the only barriers to his wildest wanderings he could walk erect and fear the eye of no man he who commits a crime forfeits these privileges men from out the lowest grade of society can say to him 'you must come with us' they can drag him from those he loves immure him in a loathsome cell dole out scant portions of the unchartered air make a show of him lead him to death and throw his body to the dogs and society which for the innocent would have raised one cry of horror against the perpetrators of such outrages look on and clap their hands with applause this is a vulgar aspect of the misery of which i speak a crime may never be discovered mine lies buried in my own breast years have passed and none point at me and whisper 'there goes the murderer' but do i not feel that god is my enemy and my own heart whispers condemnation i know that i am an impostor that any day may discover the truth but more heavy than any fear of detection is the secret hidden in my own heart the icy touch of the death i caused creeps over me during the night i am pursued by the knowledge that naught i do can prosper for the cry of innocence is raised against me and the earth groans with the secret burden i have committed to her bosom that the death blow was not actually dealt by my hand in no manner mitigates the stings of conscience my act was the murderer though my intention was guiltless of death is there a man who at some time has not desired to possess by illegal means a portion of another's property or to obey the dictates of an animal instinct and plant his foot on the neck of his enemy few are so cold of blood or temperate of mood as not at some one time to have felt hurried beyond the demarcations set up by conscience and law few but have been tempted without the brink of the forbidden but they stopped while i leaped beyond there is the difference between us falsely do they say who allege that there is no difference in guilt between the thought and act to be tempted is human to resist temptation surely if framed like me such is to raise us from our humanity into the sphere of angels many are the checks afforded us some are possessed by fear others are endowed by a sensibility so prophetic of the evil that must ensue that perforce they cannot act the thing they desire they tremble at the idea of being the cause of events over whose future course they can have no control they fear injuring others and their own remorse but i disdained all these considerations they occurred but faintly and ineffectually to my mind piety conscience and moral respect yielded before a feeling which decked its desires in the garb of necessity oh how vain it is to analyze motive each man has the same motives but it is the materials of each mind the plastic or rocky nature the mild or the burning temperament that rejects the alien influence or receives it into its own essence and causes the act such an impulse is as a summer healthy breeze just dimpling a still lake to one while to another it is the whirlwind that rouses him to spread ruin around the almighty who framed my miserable being made me a man of passion they say that of such are formed the great and good i know not that i am neither but i will not arraign the creator i will hope that in feeling my guilt in acknowledging the superexcellence of virtue i fulfil in part his design after me let no man doubt but that to do what is right is to ensure his own happiness or that self restraint and submission to the voice of conscience implanted in our souls impart more dignity of feeling more true majesty of being than a puerile assertion of will and a senseless disregard of immutable principles is passion known in these days such as i felt has any other experienced it the expression has fled from our lips but it is as deep seated as ever in our hearts who of created beings has not loved who of my sex has not felt the struggle and the yielding in the struggle of the better to the worse parts of our nature who so dead to nature's influence as not at least for some brief moments to have felt that body and soul were a slight sacrifice to obtain possession of the affections of her he loved who for some moments in his life would not have seen his mistress dead at his feet rather than wedded to another to feel this tyranny of passion is to be human to conquer it is to be virtuous he who conquers himself is in my eyes the only true hero alas i am not such i am among the vanquished and view the wretch i am and learn that there is nothing so contemptible so pitiable so eternally miserable as he who is defeated in his conflict with passion that i am such this very scene this very occupation testifies once the slave of headlong impulse i am now the victim of remorse i am come to seek death because i cannot retrieve the past i long for the moment when the bullet shall pierce my flesh and the pains of dissolution gather round me then i may hope to be that for which i thirst free there is one who loves me she is pure and kind as a guardian angel she is as my own child she implores me to live with her my days might pass in a peace and innocence that saints might envy but so heavy are the fetters of memory so bitter the slavery of my soul that even she cannot take away the sting from life death is all i covet when these pages are read the hand that traces them will be powerless the brain that dictates will have lost its functions this is my last labour my legacy to my fellow beings do not let them disdain the outpourings of a heart which for years has buried its recollections and remorse in silence the waters were pent up by a dam now they rush impetuously forth they roar as if pursued by a thousand torrents their turmoil deafens heaven and what though their sound be only conveyed by the little implement that traces these lines not less headlong than the swelling waves is the spirit that pours itself out in these words i am calmer now i have been wandering beside the stream and despite the lurking foe and deceptive moonbeams i have ascended the steep mountain's side and looked out on the misty sea and sought to gain from reposing nature some relief to my sense of pain the hour of midnight is at hand all is still i am calm and with deliberation begin to narrate that train of circumstances or rather of feelings that hurried me first to error then to crime and lastly brought me here to die i lost my mother before i can well remember i have a confused recollection of her crying and of her caressing me and i can call to mind seeing her ill in bed and her blessing me but these ideas are rather like revelations of an ante natal life than belonging to reality she died when i was four years old my childhood's years were stormy and drear my father a social and i believe even a polite man in society was rough and ill tempered at home he had gambled away his own slender younger brother's fortune and his wife's portion and was too idle to attend to a profession and yet not indolent enough for a life devoid of purpose and pursuit our family was a good one it consisted of two brothers my father and my uncle this latter favoured of birth and fortune remained long unmarried and was in weak health my father expected him to die his death and his own consequent inheritance of the family estate was his constant theme but the delayed hope irritated him to madness i knew his humour even as a child and escaped it as i could his voice calling my name made my blood run cold his epithets of abuse so frequently applied filled me with boiling but ineffectual rage i am not going to dwell on those painful days when a weak tiny boy i felt as if i could contend with the paternal giant and did contend till his hand felled me to the ground or cast me from his threshold with scorn and seeming hate i dare say he did not hate me but certainly no touch of natural love warmed his heart one day he received a letter from his brother i was but ten years old but rendered old and careworn by suffering i remember that i looked on him as he took it and exclaimed 'from uncle john what have we here' with a nervous tremour as to the passions the perusal of it might excite he chuckled as he broke the seal he fancied that he called him to his dying bed 'and that well over you shall go to school my fine fellow' he cried 'we shall have no more of your tricks at home' he broke the seal he read the letter it announced his brother's marriage and asked him to the wedding i let fall the curtain over the scene that ensued you would have thought that a villanous fraud had been committed in which i was implicated he drove me with blows from his door i foamed with rage and then i sat down and wept and crept away to the fields and wondered why i was born and longed to kill my uncle who was the cause to me of so much misery everything changed for the worse now hitherto my father had lived on hope now he despaired he took to drinking which exalted his passions and debased his reason this at times gave me a superiority over him when tipsy i could escape his blows which yet when sober fell on me with double severity but even the respite i gained through his inebriety afforded me no consolation i felt at once humbled and indignant at the shame so brought on us i child as i was expostulated with him i was knocked down and kicked from the room oh what a world this appeared to me a war of the weak with the strong and how i despised everything except victory time wore on my uncle's wife bore him in succession two girls this was a respite my father's spirits rose but fallen as he was he could only celebrate his reawakened hopes by deeper potations and coarse jokes the next offspring was a boy he cost my father his life habits of drink had inflamed his blood and his violence of temper made him nearly a maniac on hearing of the birth of the heir he drank to drown thought wine was too slow a medicine he quaffed deeply of brandy and fell into a sleep or rather torpor from which he never after awoke it was better so he had spent everything he was deeply in debt he had lost all power of raising himself from the state of debasement into which he had fallen the next day would have seen him in prison i was taken in by my uncle at first the peace and order of the household seemed to me paradise the comfort and regularity of the meals was a sort of happy and perpetual miracle my eye was no longer blasted by the sight of frightful excesses nor my ear wounded by obstreperous shouts i was no longer reviled i no longer feared being felled to the ground i was not any more obliged to obtain food by stratagem or by expostulations which always ended by my being the victim of personal violence the mere calm was balmy and i fancied myself free because i was no longer in a state of perpetual terror but soon i felt the cold and rigid atmosphere that as far as regarded me ruled this calm no eye of love ever turned on me no voice ever spoke a cheering word i was there on sufferance and was quickly deemed a troublesome inmate while the order and regularity required of me and the law passed that i was never to quit the house alone became at last more tormenting than the precarious but wild and precious liberty of my former life my habits were bad enough my father's vices had fostered my evil qualities i had never learned to lie or cheat for such was foreign to my nature but i was rough self willed lazy and insolent i have a feeling such was my sense of bliss on first entering the circle of order and peace that a very little kindness would have subdued my temper and awakened a desire to please it was not tried from the very first i was treated with a coldness to which a child is peculiarly sensitive the servants by enforcing the rules of the house became first my tormentors and then my enemies i grew imperious and violent complaint reprehension and punishment despoiled my paradise of its matin glow and then i returned at once to my own bad self i was disobedient and reckless soon it was decreed that i was utterly intolerable and i was sent to school this a boy's common fate i had endured without a murmur had it not been inflicted as a punishment and i made over to my new tyrants even in my own hearing as a little blackguard quite irreclaimable and only to be kept in order by brute force it is impossible to describe the effect of this declaration of my uncle followed up by the master's recommendation to the usher to break my spirit if he could not bend it had on my heart which was bursting with a sense of injury panting for freedom and resolved not to be daunted by the menaces of the tyrants before me i declared war with my whole soul against the world i became all i had been painted i was sullen vindictive desperate i resolved to run away i cared not what would befall me i was nearly fourteen i was strong and could work i could join a gang of gipsies i could act their life singly and subsisting by nightly depredation spend my days in liberty it was at an hour when i was meditating flight that the master sent for me i believed that some punishment was in preparation i hesitated whether i should not instantly fly a moment's thought told me that was impossible and that i must obey i went with a dogged air and a determination to resist i found my tyrant with a letter in his hand 'i do not know what to do with you' he said 'i have a letter here from a relation asking you to spend the day you deserve no indulgence but for this once you may go remember any future permission depends upon your turning over an entirely new leaf go sir and be grateful to my lenity if you can remember you are to be home at nine' i asked no questions i did not know where i was to go yet i left him without a word i was sauntering back to the prison yard which they called a playground when i was told that there was a pony chaise at the door ready to take me my heart leaped at the word i fancied that by means of this conveyance i could proceed on the first stage of my flight the pony carriage was of the humblest description an old man drove i got in and away we trotted the little cob that drew it going much faster than his looks gave warrant the driver was deaf i was sullen not a word did we exchange my plan was that he should take me to the farthest point he intended and then that i should leap out and take to my heels as we proceeded however my rebel fit somewhat subsided we left the town in which the school was situated and the dreary dusty roads i was accustomed to perambulate under the superintendence of the ushers we entered shady lanes and umbrageous groves we perceived extensive prospects and saw the winding of romantic streams a curtain seemed drawn from before the scenes of nature and my spirits rose as i gazed on new objects and saw earth spread wide and free around at first this only animated me to a keener resolve to fly but as we went on a vague sentiment possessed my soul the skylarks winged up to heaven and the swallows skimmed the green earth i felt happy because nature was gay and all things free and at peace we turned from a lane redolent with honeysuckle into a little wood whose short thick turf was interspersed with moss and starred with flowers just as we emerged i saw a little railing a rustic green gate and a cottage clustered over with woodbine and jessamine standing secluded among yet peeping out from the overshadowing trees a little peasant boy threw open the gate and we drove up to the cottage door at a low window which opened on the lawn in a large arm chair sat a lady evidently marked by ill health yet with something so gentle and unearthly in her appearance as at once to attract and please her complexion had faded into whiteness her hair was nearly silver yet not a grizzly grayish white but silken still in its change her dress was also white and there was something of a withered look about her redeemed by a soft but bright gray eye and more by the sweetest smile in the world which she wore as rising from her chair she embraced me exclaiming 'i know you from your likeness to your mother dear dear rupert' that name of itself touched a chord which for many years had been mine my mother had called me by that name so indeed had my father when any momentary softness of feeling allowed him to give me any other appellation except 'you sir' 'you dog you' my uncle after whom i was also called john chose to drop what he called a silly romantic name and in his house and in his letters i was always john rupert breathed of a dear home and my mother's kiss and i looked inquiringly on her who gave it me when my attention was attracted riveted by the vision of a lovely girl who had glided in from another room and stood near us radiant in youth and beauty she was indeed supremely lovely exuberant in all the charms of girlhood and her beauty was enhanced by the very contrast to the pale lady by whom she stood an houri she seemed standing by a disimbodied spirit black soft large eyes overpowering in their lustre and yet more so from the soul that dwelt within a cherub look a fairy form with a complexion and shape that spoke of health and joy what could it mean who could she be and who was she who knew my name it was an enigma but one full of promise to me who had so long been exiled from the charities of life and who 'as the hart panteth for the water brooks' panted for love chapter xxvii after a little explanation i discovered who my new friends were the lady and my mother were remotely related but they had been educated together and separated only when they married my mother's death had prevented my knowing that such a relation existed far less that she took the warmest interest in the son of her earliest friend mrs rivers had been the poorer of the two and for a long time considered that her childhood's companion was moving in an elevated sphere of life while she had married a lieutenant in the navy and while he was away attending the duties of his profession she lived in retirement and economy in the rustic low roofed yet picturesque and secluded cottage whose leaf shrouded casements and flowery lawn even now are before me and speak of peace i never call to mind that abode of tranquillity without associating it with the poet's wish 'mine be a cot beside the hill a beehive's hum shall sooth my ear a willowy brook that turns a mill with many a fall shall linger near' to any one who fully understands and appreciates the peculiar beauties of england who knows how much elegance content and knowledge can be sheltered under such a roof these lines must ever i think as to me have a music of their own and unpretending as they are breathe the very soul of happiness in this imbowered cot near which a clear stream murmured which was clustered over by a thousand odoriferous parasites which stood in the seclusion of a beech wood there dwelt something more endearing even than all this and one glance at the only daughter of mrs rivers served to disclose that an angel dwelt in the paradise alithea rivers there is music and smiles and tears a whole life of happiness and moments of intensest transport in the sound her beauty was radiant her dark eastern eye shaded by the veined and darkly fringed lid beamed with a soft but penetrating fire her face of a perfect oval and lips which were wreathed into a thousand smiles or softly and silently parted seemed the home of every tender and poetic expression which one longed to hear them breathe forth her brow clear as day her swan throat and symmetrical and fairy like form disclosed a perfection of loveliness that the youngest and least susceptible must have felt even if they did not acknowledge she had two qualities which i have never seen equalled separately but which united in her formed a spell no one could resist the most acute sensitiveness to joy or grief in her own person and the most lively sympathy with these feelings in others i have seen her so enter heart and soul into the sentiments of one in whom she was interested that her whole being took the colour of their mood and her very features and complexion appeared to alter in unison with theirs her temper was never ruffled she could not be angry she grieved too deeply for those who did wrong but she could be glad and never have i seen joy the very sunshine of the soul so cloudlessly expressed as in her countenance she could subdue the stoutest heart by a look a word and were she ever wrong herself a sincere acknowledgment an ingenuous shame grief to have offended and eagerness to make reparation turned her very error into a virtue her spirits were high even to wildness but at their height tempered by such thought for others such inbred feminine softness that her most exuberant gayety resembled heart cheering music and made each bosom respond all everything loved her her mother idolized her each bird of the grove knew her and i felt sure that the very flowers she tended were conscious of and rejoiced in her presence since my birth or at least since i had lost my mother in early infancy my path had been cast upon thorns and brambles blows and stripes cold neglect reprehension and debasing slavery to such was i doomed i had longed for something to love and in the desire to possess something whose affections were my own i had secreted at school a little nest of field mice on which i tended but human being there was none who marked me except to revile and my proud heart rose in indignation against them mrs rivers had heard a sad story of my obduracy my indolence my violence she had expected to see a savage but my likeness to my mother won her heart at once and the affection i met transformed me at once into something worthy of her i had been told i was a reprobate till i half believed i felt that there was war between me and my tyrants and i was desirous to make them suffer even as they made me i read in books of the charities of life and the very words seemed only a portion of that vast system of imposture with which the strong oppressed the weak i did not believe in love or beauty or if ever my heart opened to it it was to view it in external nature and to wonder how all of perceptive and sentient in this wondrous fabric of the universe was instinct with injury and wrong mrs rivers was a woman of feeling and sense she drew me out she dived into the secrets of my heart for my mother's sake she loved me and she saw that to implant sentiments of affection was to redeem a character not ungenerous and far far from cold whose evil passions had been fostered as in a hotbed and whose better propensities were nipped in the bud she strove to awaken my susceptibility to kindness by lavishing a thousand marks of favour she called me her son her friend she taught me to look upon her regard as a possession of which nothing could deprive me and to consider herself and her daughter as near and dear ties that could not be rent away she imparted happiness she awoke gratitude and made me in my innermost heart swear to deserve her favour i now entered on a new state of being and one of which i had formed no previous idea i believed that the wish to please one who was dear to me would render every task easy that i did wrong merely from caprice and revenge and that if i chose i could with my finger stem and direct the tide of my passions i was astonished to find that i could not even bend my mind to attention and i was angry with myself when i felt my breast boiling with tumultuous rage when i promised myself to be meek enduring and gentle my endeavours to conquer these evil habits were indeed arduous i forced myself by fits and starts to study sedulously i yielded obedience to our school laws i taxed myself to bear with patience the injustice and impertinence of the ushers and the undisguised tyranny of the master but i could not for ever string myself to this pitch meanness and falsehood and injustice again and again awoke the tiger in me i am not going to narrate my boyhood's wrongs i was doomed sent to school with a bad character which at first i had taken pains to deserve and afterward doing right in my own way and still holding myself aloof from all scorning their praise and untouched by their censure i gained no approbation and was deemed a dangerous savage whose nails must be kept close pared and whose limbs were still to be fettered lest he should rend his keepers from such a scene i turned each sunday morning my willing steps to the cottage of mrs rivers there was something fascinating to me in the very peculiarities of her appearance ill health had brought premature age upon her person but her mind was as active and young her feelings as warm as ever she could only stand for a few minutes and could not unassisted walk across the room she took hardly any nourishment and looked as i have said more like a spirit than a woman thus deprived of every outward resource her mind acquired from habits of reflection and resignation aided by judicious reading a penetration and delicacy quite unequalled there was a philosophical truth in all her remarks adorned by a feminine tact and extreme warmth of heart that rendered her as admirable as she was endearing sometimes she suffered great pain but for the most part her malady which was connected with the spine had only the effect of extreme weakness and at the same time of rendering her sensations acute and delicate the odour of flowers the balmy air of morning the evening breeze almost intoxicated her with delight any dissonant sound appeared to shatter her peace was within and she coveted peace around and it was her dearest pleasure when we i and her lovely daughter were at her feet she playing with the sunny ringlets of alithea's hair and i listening with a thirst for knowledge and ardour to be taught while she with eloquence mild and cheering full of love and wisdom charmed our attentive ears and caused us to hang on all she said as on the oracles of a divinity at times we left her and alithea and i wandered through the woods and over the hills our talk was inexhaustible now canvassing some observation of her mother now pouring out our own youthful bright ideas and enjoying the breezes and the waterfalls and every sight of nature with a rapture unspeakable when we came to rugged uplands or some swollen brook i carried my young companion over in my arms i sheltered her with my body from the storms that sometimes overtook us i was her protector and her stay and the very office filled me with pride and joy when fatigued by our rambles we returned home bringing garlands of wild flowers for the invalid whose wisdom we revered whose maternal tenderness was our joy and yet whose weakness made her in some degree dependant on us and gave the form of a voluntary tribute to the attentions we delighted to pay her oh had i never returned to school this life had been a foretaste of heaven but there i returned and there again i found rebuke injustice my evil passions and the fiends who tormented me how my heart revolted from the contrast with what inconceivable struggles i tried to subdue my hatred to be as charitable and forgiving as mrs rivers implored me to be but my tormentors had the art of rousing the savage again and despite good resolves despite my very pride which urged me merely to despise i was again violent and rebellious again punished again vowing revenge and longing to obtain it i cannot imagine even the wild passions of my after life do not disclose more violent struggles than those i went through i returned from my friends my heart stored with affectionate sentiments and good intentions my brow was smooth my mind unruffled my whole soul set upon at once commanding myself and proving to my tyrants that they could not disturb the sort of heavenly calm with which i was penetrated on such a day and feeling thus i came back one evening from the cottage i was met by one of the ushers who in a furious voice demanded the key of my room threatening me with punishment if i ever dared lock it again this was a sore point my little family of mice had their warm nest in my room and i knew that they would be torn from me if the animal before me penetrated into my sanctuary before i could get in to hide them but the fellow had learned from the maids that i had some pets and was resolute to discover them i cannot dwell on the puerile yet hideous minuti of such a scene the loud voice the blow the key torn from me the roar of malice with which my pets were hailed the call for the cat my blood ran cold some slave among boys even there are slaves threw into the room the tiger animal the usher showed her prey but before she could spring i caught her up and whirled her out of the window the usher gave me a blow with a stick i was a well grown boy and a match for him unarmed he struck me on the head and then drew out a knife that he might himself commence the butcher's work on my favourites stunned by the blow but casting aside all the cherished calm i had hitherto maintained my blood boiling my whole frame convulsed with passion i sprung on him we both fell on the ground his knife was in hand open in our struggle i seized the weapon and the fellow got cut in the head of course i inflicted the wound but had neither before nor at that time the intention our struggle was furious we were both in a state of phrensy and an open knife at such a moment can hardly fail to do injury i saw the blood pouring from his temple and his efforts slacken i jumped up called furiously for help and when the servants and boys rushed into the room i made my escape i leaped from the window high as it was and alighted almost by a miracle unhurt on the turf below i made my way with all speed across the fields methought the guilt of murder was on my soul and yet i felt exultation that at last i a boy had brought upon the head of my foe some of the tortures he had so often inflicted upon me by this desperate act i believed that i had severed the cords that bound me to the vilest servitude i knew not but that houseless want would be my reward but i felt light as air and free as a bird instinctively my steps took the direction of my beloved cottage yet i dared not enter it a few hours ago i had left it in a pure and generous frame of mind i called to mind the conversation of the evening before the gentle eloquence of mrs rivers inculcating those lessons of mild forbearance and lofty self command which had filled me with generous resolve and how was i to return my hands died in blood i hid myself in the thicket near her house sometimes i stole near it then as i heard voices i retreated farther into the wild part of the wood night came on at last and that night i slept under a tree but at a short distance from the cottage the cool morning air woke me and i began seriously to consider my situation destitute of friends and money whither should i direct my steps i was resolved never to return to my school i was nearly sixteen i was tall and athletic in my frame though still a mere boy in my thoughts and pursuits still i told myself that such as i many a stripling was cast upon the world and that i ought to summon courage and to show my tyrants that i could exist independent of them my determination was to enlist as a soldier i believed that i should so distinguish myself by my valour as speedily to become a great man i saw myself singled out by the generals applauded honoured and rewarded i fancied my return and how proudly i should present myself before alithea having carved out my own fortune and become all that her sweet mother entreated me to be brave generous and true but could i put my scheme in execution without seeing my young companion again oh no my heart my whole soul led me to her side to demand her sympathy to ask her prayers to bid her never forget me at the same time that i dreaded seeing her mother for i feared her lessons of wisdom i felt sure i knew not why that she would wholly disapprove of my design i tore a leaf from my pocketbook and with the pencil implored alithea to meet me in the wood whence i resolved not to stir till i should see her but how was i to convey my paper without the knowledge of her mother or being seen by the servants i hovered about all day it was not till nightfall that i ventured near and knowing well the casement of her room i wrapped my letter round a stone and threw it in then i retreated speedily it was night again i had not eaten for twenty four hours i knew not when alithea could come to me but i resolved not to move from the spot i had designated till she came i hunted for a few berries and a turnip that had fallen from a cart was as the manna of the desert for a short half hour it stilled the gnawings of my appetite and then i lay down unable to sleep eying the stars through the leafy boughs above thinking alternately of a prisoner deserted by his jailer and starved to death while at each moment he fancied the far step approaching and the key turning in the lock and then again of feasts of a paradise of fruits of the simple cheerful repasts at the cottage which for many a long year i was destined never again to partake of it was midnight the air was still not a leaf moved sometimes i believed i dosed but i had a sense of being awake always present to my mind the hours seemed changed to eternity i began suddenly to think i was dying i thought i never should see the morrow's sun alithea would come but her friend would not answer to her call he would never speak to her more at this moment i heard a rustling was there some animal about it drew near it was steps a white figure appeared between the trunks of the trees again i thought it was a dream till the dearest of all voices spoke my name the loveliest and kindest face in the world bent over me my cold clammy hand was taken in hers so soft and warm i started up i threw my arms around her i pressed her to my bosom she had found my note on retiring for the night fearful of disobeying my injunctions of secrecy she had waited till all was at rest before she stole out to me and now with all the thoughtfulness that characterized her when another's wants and sufferings were in question she brought food with her and a large cloak to wrap my shivering limbs she sat beside me as i ate smiling through her tears no reproach fell from her lips it was only joy to see me and expressions of kind encouragement i dwell too much on these days my tale grows long and i must abridge the dear recollections of those moments of innocence and happiness alithea easily persuaded me to see her mother and mrs rivers received me as a mother would a son who has been in danger of death and is recovering i saw only smiles i heard only congratulations i wondered where the misery and despair which gathered so thickly around me had flown no vestige remained the sun shone unclouded on my soul i asked no questions i remained passive i felt that something was being done for me but i did not inquire what each day i spent several hours in study so to reward the kindness of my indulgent friend each day i listened to her gentle converse and wandered with alithea over hill and dale and poured into her ear my resolutions to become great and good surely in this world there are no aspirations so noble pure and godlike as those breathed by an enthusiastic boy who dreams of love and virtue and who is still guarded by childlike innocence mrs rivers meanwhile was in correspondence with my uncle and by a fortunate coincidence a cadetship long sought by him was presented at this moment and i was removed to the east indian military college before i went my maternal friend spoke with all the fervour of affection of my errors my duties the expectation she had that i should show myself worthy of the hopes she entertained of me i promised to her and to alithea i vowed to become all they wished my bosom swelled with generous ambition and ardent gratitude the drama of life methought was unrolling before me the scene on which i was to act appeared resplendent in fairy and gorgeous colours neither vanity nor pride swelled me up but a desire to prove myself worthy of those adored beings who were all the world to me who had saved me from myself to restore me to the pure and happy shelter of their hearts can it be wondered that from that day to the present hour they have seemed to me portions of heaven incarnate upon earth that i have prized the thought of them as a rich inheritance and how did i repay cold wan figure of the dead reproach me not thus with your closed eyes and the dank strings of your wet clinging hair give me space to breathe that i may record your vindication and my crime i was placed at the military college had i gone there at once it had been well but first i spent a month at my uncle's where i was treated like a reprobate and a criminal i tried to consider this but as a trial of my promises and good resolution to be gentle to turn one cheek when the other was smitten it is not for me to accuse others or defend myself but yet i think that i had imbibed so much of the celestial virtues of my instructress that had i been treated with any kindness my heart must have warmed towards my relatives as it was i left my uncle's having made a vow never to sleep beneath his roof again i reached the military college and here i might fairly begin a new career i exerted myself to study to obey to conciliate the applause that followed my endeavours gave me a little pleasure but when i wrote to alithea and her mother and felt no weight on my conscience no drawback to my hope that i was rendering myself worthy of them then indeed my felicity was without alloy and when my fiery temper kindled when injustice and meanness caused my blood to boil i thought of the mild appealing look of mrs rivers and the dearer smiles of her daughter and i suppressed every outward sign of anger and scorn for two whole years i did not see these dear dear friends while i lived upon the thought of them alas when have i ceased to do that i wrote constantly and received letters those dictated by mrs rivers traced by her sweet daughter's hand were full of all that generous benevolence and enlightened sensibility which rendered her the very being to instruct and rule me while the playful phrases of alithea her mention of the spots we had visited together and history of all the slight events of her innocent life breathed so truly of the abode of peace from which they emanated that they carried the charm of a soft repose even to my restless spirit a year passed and then tidings of misery came mrs rivers was dying alithea wrote in despair she was alone her father distant she implored my assistance my presence i did not hesitate her appeal came during the period that preceded an examination i believed that it would be useless to ask leave to absent myself and i resolved at once to go without permission i wrote a letter to the master mentioning that the sickness of a friend forced me to this step and then almost moneyless and on foot i set out to cross the country i do not record trivialties i will not mention the physical sufferings of that journey they were so much less than the agony of suspense i suffered the fear that i should not find my maternal friend alive life burnt low indeed when i at last stepped within the threshold of her sick chamber yet she smiled when she saw me and tried to hold out her hand one already clasped that of alithea for hours we thus watched her exchanging looks not speech alithea naturally impetuous and even vehement now controlled all sign of grief except the expression of wo that took all colour from her face and clouded her brow with anguish she knelt beside her mother her lips glued to her hand as if to the last to feel her pulse of life and assure herself that she still existed the room was darkened a broken ray tinged the head of the mourner while her mother lay in shadow a shadow that seemed to deepen as the hue of death crept over her face now and then she opened her eyes now and then murmured inarticulately and then she seemed to sleep we neither moved sometimes alithea raised her head and looked on her mother's countenance and then seeing the change already operated it drooped over the wan hand she held suddenly there was a slight sound a slight convulsion in the fingers i saw a shade darken over the face something seemed to pass over and then away and all was marble still and the lips wreathed into a smile became fixed and breathless alithea started up uttered a shriek and threw herself on her mother's body such name i give the blameless soul was gone for ever it was my task to console the miserable daughter and such was the angelic softness of alithea's disposition that when the first burst of grief was over she yielded to be consoled there was no hardness in her regrets she collected every relic surrounded herself with every object that might keep alive the memory of her parent she talked of her continually and together we spoke of her virtues her wisdom her ardent affection and felt a thrilling trembling pleasure in recalling every act and word that most displayed her excellence as we were thus employed i could contemplate and remark the change the interval of my absence had operated in the beautiful girl she had sprung into womanhood her figure was surrounded by a thousand graces a tender charm was diffused over each lineament and motion that intoxicated me with delight before i loved now i revered her her mother's angelic essence seemed united to hers forming two in one the sentiments these beings had divided were now concentrated in her and added to this a breathless adoration a heart's devotion which still even now dwells beside her grave and hallows every memory that remains the cold tomb held the gentle form of mrs rivers each day we visited it and each day we collected fresh memorials and exhausted ourselves in talk concerning the lost one immediately on my arrival i had written to my uncle and the cause of my rash act pleading my excuse it was visited less severely than i expected i was told that it was well that i displayed affection and gratitude towards a too indulgent friend though my depravity betrayed itself in the manner even in which i fulfilled a duty i was bid at once return to the college after a fortnight had passed i obeyed and now i lived on alithea's letters which breathed only her eloquent regrets already my own dream of life was formed to be for ever her protector her friend her servant her all that she could deign to make me to devote myself day after day year after year through all my life to her only while with her oppressed by grief as we both were i did not understand my own sensations and the burning of my heart which opened as a volcano when i heard her only speak my name or felt the touch of her soft hand but returned to college a veil fell from my eyes i knew that i loved her i hailed the discovery with transport i hugged to my bosom the idea that she was the first and last being to awaken the tumultuous sensations that took away my breath dimmed my eyes and dissolved me into tenderness soon after her mother's death she was placed as a parlour boarder at a school i saw her once there but i did not see her alone i could not speak i could only gaze on her unexampled loveliness nor strange to say did i wish to disclose the passion that agitated me she was so young so confiding so innocent i wished to be but as a brother to her for i had a sort of restless presentiment that distance and reserve would ensue on my disclosing my other feeling in fact i was a mere boy i knew myself to be a friendless one and i desired time and consideration and the fortunate moment to occur before i exchanged our present guileless but warm and tender attachment for the hopes and throes of a passion which demands a future and is therefore full of peril true when i left her i reproached myself for my cowardice but i would not write and deferred till i saw her all explanation of my feelings some months after the time arrived when i was to embark for india captain rivers had returned and inhabited the beloved cottage and alithea dwelt with him i went to see her previous to my departure my soul was in tumults i desired to take her with me but that was impossible and yet to leave her thus and go into a far and long exile away from her was too frightful i could not believe that i could exist without the near hope and expectation of seeing her without that constant mingling of hearts which made her life blood but as a portion of my own my resolution was easily made to claim her as mine my betrothed my future bride and i had a vague notion that if i were accepted captain rivers would form some plan to prevent my going to india or to bring me back speedily i arrived at the cottage and the first sight of her father was painful to me he was rough and uncouth and though proud of his daughter yet treated her with little of that deference to which she had a right even from him the more reason i thought to make her mine and that very evening i expressed my desire to captain rivers a horselaugh was the reply he treated me partly as a mad boy partly as an impertinent beggar my passions were roused my indignation burst all the fetters i sought to throw over it i answered haughtily insolently our words were loud and rude i laughed at his menaces and scoffed at his authority i retorted scorn with scorn till the fiery old sailor was provoked to knock me down in all this i thought not of him in the sacred character of alithea's father i knew but one parent for her she had as it were joined us by making us companions and friends both children of her heart she was gone and the rude tyrant who usurped her place excited only detestation and loathing from the insolence of his pretensions still when he struck me his age and his infirmities for he was lame prevented my returning the blow i rose and folding my arms and looking at him with a smile of ineffable contempt i said 'poor miserable man do you think to degrade me by a blow but for pity i could return it so that you would never lift up your head again from that floor i spare you farewell you have taught me one lesson i will die rather than leave alithea in the hands of a ruffian such as you' with these words i turned on my heel and walked out of the house i repaired to a neighbouring public house and wrote to alithea asking demanding an interview i claimed it in her mother's name her answer came it was wetted with her tears dear gentle being so alien was her nature from all strife that the very idea of contention shook her delicate frame and seemed almost to unhinge her reason she respected her father and she loved me with an affection nourished by long companionship and sacred associations she promised to meet me if i would abstain from again seeing her father in the same wood and at the same midnight hour as when before she came to bring assistance and consolation to the outcast boy three years before i saw her again and for the last time before i left england alithea had one fault if such name may be given to a delicacy of structure that rendered every clash of human passion terrifying in physical danger she could show herself a heroine but awaken her terror of moral evil and she was hurried away beyond all self command by spasms of fear thus as she came now clandestinely under the cover of night her father's denunciations still sounding in her ears the friend of her youth banished going away for ever and that departure disturbed by strife her reason almost forsook her she was bewildered clinging to me with tears yet fearful at every minute of discovery it was a parting of anguish she did not feel the passion that ruled my bosom hers was a gentler sisterly feeling yet not the less intwined with the principles of her being and necessary to her existence she lavished caresses and words of endearment on me she could not tear herself away yet she rejected firmly every idea of disobedience to her father and the burning expressions of my love found no echo in her bosom thus we parted and a few days afterward i was on the wide sea sailing for my distant bourn at first i had felt disappointed and angry but soon imagination shed radiance over what had seemed chilly and dim i felt her dear head repose on my heart i saw her bright eyes overbrimming with tears and heard her sweet voice repeat again and again her vow never to forget her brother her more than brother her only friend the only being left her to love no wonder that during the various changes of a long voyage during reveries indulged endlessly through calm nights and the mightier emotions awakened by storm and danger that the memory of this affection grew into a conviction that i was loved and a belief that she was mine for ever i am not writing my life and but for the wish to appear less criminal in my dear child's eyes i had not written a word of the foregone pages but leaped at once to the mere facts that justify poor alithea and tell the tragic story of her death years have passed and oblivion has swept away all memory of the events of which i speak who recollects the wise white lady of the secluded cot and her houri daughter this heart alone there they live enshrined my dreams call up their forms i visit them in my solitary reveries i try to forget the ensuing years and to become the heedless half savage boy who listened with wonder yet conviction to lessons of virtue and to call back the melting of the heart which the wise lady's words produced and the bounding wild joy i felt beside her child if there is a hell it need no other torment but memory to call back such scenes as these and bid me remember the destruction that ensued i remained ten years in india an officer in a regiment of the company's cavalry i saw a good deal of service went through much suffering and doing my duty on the field of battle or at the hour of attack i gained that approbation in the field which i lost when in quarters by a sort of systematized insubordination which was a part of my untameable nature in action even i went beyond my orders however that was forgiven but when in quarters i took part with the weak and showed contempt for the powerful i was looked upon as dangerous and the more so that the violence of my temper often made my manner in a high degree reprehensible i attached myself to several natives that was a misdemeanor i strove to inculcate european tastes and spirit enlightened views and liberal policy to one or two native princes whom from some ill luck the english governors wished to keep in ignorance and darkness i was for ever entangled in the intimacy and driven to try to serve the oppressed while the affection i excited was considered disaffection on my part to the rulers sometimes also i met with ingratitude and treachery my actions were misrepresented either by prejudice or malice and my situation of a subordinate officer without fortune gave to the influence i acquired through learning the language and respecting the habits and feelings of the natives an air of something so inexplicable as might in the dark ages have been attributed to witchcraft and in these enlightened times was considered a tendency to the most dangerous intrigues having saved an old rajah's life and having taken great pains to extricate him from a difficulty in which the europeans had purposely entangled him it became rumoured that i aspired to succeed to a native principality and i was peremptorily ordered off to another station my views were in diametrical opposition to the then indian government my conversation was heedless my youthful imagination exalted by native magnificence i own i often dreamed of the practicability of driving the merchant sovereigns from hindostan there was as is the essence of my character much boyish folly joined to dangerous passion all of which took the guise in my own heart of that high heroic adventure with which i longed to adorn my life a subaltern in the company's service i could never gain my alithea or do her the honour with which i longed to crown her the acquisition of power of influence of station would exalt me in her father's eyes so much of what was selfish mingled in my conduct but i was too young and impetuous to succeed those in power watched me narrowly the elevation of a day was always followed by a quick transfer to an unknown and distant province in all my wildest schemes the thought of alithea reigned paramount my only object was to prove myself worthy of her and my only dream for the future was to make her mine for ever a constancy of ten years strung perpetually up to the height of passion may appear improbable yet it was so it was my nature to hold an object with tenacious grasp to show a proud contempt of obstacles to resolve on ultimate triumph besides this the idea of alithea was so kneaded up and incorporate with my being that my living heart must have been searched and anatomized to its core before the portion belonging to her could have been divided from the rest i disdained the thought of every other woman it was my pride to look coldly on every charm and to shut my heart against all but alithea during the first years of my residence in india i often wrote to her and pouring out my soul on paper i conjured her to preserve herself for me i told her how each solitary jungle or mountain ravine spoke to me of a secluded home with her how every palace and gorgeous hall seemed yet a shrine too humble for her the very soul of passion breathed along the lines i traced they were such as an affianced lover would have written pure in their tenderness but heartfelt penetrating and eloquent they were my dearest comfort after long wearisome marches after the dangers of an assault or a skirmish after a day spent among the sick or dying in the midst of many disappointments and harassing cares during the storms of pride and the languor of despair it was my consolation to fly to her image and to recall the tender happiness of reunion to endeavour to convey to her how she was my hope and aim my fountain in the desert the shadowy tree to shelter me from the burning sun the soft breeze to refresh me the angelic visiter to the unfortunate martyr not one of these letters ever reached her her father destroyed them all on his head be the crime and the remorse of his daughter's death fool and coward would i shift to other shoulders the heavy weight no no crime and remorse still link me to her let them eat into my frame fiery torture they are better than forgetfulness i had two hopes in india one was to raise myself to such a station as would render me worthy of alithea in the eyes of captain rivers the other to return to england to find change there to find love in her heart and to move her to quit all for me by turns these two dreams reigned over me i indulged in them with complacency i returned to them with ardour i nourished them with perseverance i never saw a young indian mother with her infant but my soul dissolved in tender fancies of domestic union and bliss with alithea there was something in her soft dark eye and in the turn of her countenance purely eastern and many a lovely half veiled face i could have taken for hers many a slight symmetrical figure round elegant and delicate seemed her own as with elastic undulating motion they passed on their way to temple or feast i cultivated all these fancies they nourished my fidelity and made the thought of her the absolute law of my life ten years passed and then news came that altered my whole situation my uncle and his only son died the family estate devolved on me i was rich and free rich in my own eyes and in the eyes of all to whom competence is wealth i felt sure that with this inheritance captain rivers would not disdain me for his child i gave up my commission immediately and returned to england england and alithea how balmy how ineffably sweet was the idea of once more beholding the rural spot where she resided of treading the woodland paths with her of visiting her dear mother's grave of renewing our old associations and knitting our destinies inextricably in one it was a voyage of bliss i longed for its conclusion but feeling that a pathway was stretched across the ocean leading even into her very presence i blessed each wave or tract of azure sea we passed over the limitless atlantic was my road to her and became glorified as the vision of the hebrew shepherd boy and yet loved with the same homefelt sweetness as that with which i used to regard the lime tree walk that led to her garden gate i forgot the years that had elapsed since we met it was with difficulty that i forced my imagination to remember that i should not find her pale mother beside her to sanctify our union chapter xxviii on landing in england i at once set off to the far northern county where she resided i arrived at the well known village all looked the same i recognised the cottages and their flower gardens and even some of the elder inhabitants looking methought no older than when i left them my heart hailed my return home with rapture and i quickened my steps towards the cottage it was shut up and abandoned this was the first check my sanguine spirit had met hitherto i had not pronounced her name or asked a question i longed to return as from a walk and to find all things as i had left it living in a dream i had not considered the chances and the storms or even the mere changes of the seasons of life my pen lags in its task i dilate on things best hurried over yet they serve as a screen between me and fate a few inquiries revealed the truth captain rivers was dead his daughter married i had lived in a fool's paradise none of the obstacles existed that i expected to meet and conquer but in their stead a fourfold brazen door had risen locked barred and guarded and i could not even shake a hinge or put back a bolt i hurried from the fatal spot it became a hell to me and oh to think that i had lived in vain vainly dreamed of the angel of my idolatry vainly hoped and most vainly loved called her mine when another held her sold myself to perpetual slavery to her shadow while her living image enriched the shrine of another's home the tempest that shook my soul did not permit me to give form or indeed to dwell consecutively on such desolating thoughts as a man who arrives from a pleasant journey and turns the corner where he expects to view the dwelling in which repose his wife his children all dear to him and when he gains the desired spot beholds it smouldering in ashes and is told that all are consumed and that their bones lie beneath the ruins thus was i my imagination had created home and bride and fair being sprung from her side who called me father and one word defaced my whole future life and widowed me for ever now began that chain of incidents that led to a deed i had not thought of incidents or accidents acts done i know not why nothing in themselves but meeting and kindled by the fiery spirit that raged in my bosom they gave such direction to its ruinous powers as produced the tragedy for ever to be deplored bewildered and overwhelmed by the loss which to me had all the novelty and keenness of a disaster of yesterday though i found that many years had gone by since in reality it was completed i fled from the spot i had so fondly sought and hurried up to london on no fixed errand with no determined idea yet vaguely desiring to do something scarcely arrived i met a man whom i had known in india he asked me to dine with him and i complied because to refuse would have required explanation and the affirmative was more easily given i did not mean to keep my engagement yet when the hour came so intolerable had i become to myself so poignant and loathsome were my thoughts that i went so to lose for a few moments the present sense of ill it was a bachelor's dinner and there were in addition to myself three or four other guests among them a mr neville from the moment this man opened his lips to speak i took a violent dislike to him he was and always must have been the man whom among ten thousand i should have marked out to abhor he was cold proud and sarcastic withal a decayed dandy turned cynic who half despising himself tried wholly to disdain his fellow creatures a man whose bosom never glowed with a generous emotion and who took pride in the sagacity which enabled him to detect worms and corruption in the loveliness of virtue a poor mean spirited fellow despite his haughty outside and then when he spoke of women how base a thing he seemed his disbelief in their excellence his contemptuous pity his insulting love made my blood boil to me there was something sacred in a woman's very shadow was she evil i regarded her with the pious regret with which i might view a shrine desecrated by sacrilegious hands the odour of sanctity still floated around the rifled altar i never could regard them as mere fellow creatures they were beings of a better species sometimes gone astray in the world's wilderness but always elevated above the best among us for alithea's sake i respected every woman how much good i knew of them generous devoted delicate their very faults were but misdirected virtues and this animal dared revile beings of whose very nature he could form no conception a burden was lifted from my soul when he left us 'it is strange' said our host 'that neville should indulge in this kind of talk he is married to the most beautiful and the best woman in the world much younger than himself she yet performs her duties as a wife with steadiness and cheerfulness lovely beyond her sex she is without its weakness to please some jealous freak of his she has withdrawn herself from the world and buried herself alive at his seat in the north how she can endure an eternal tte tte with that empty conceited and arrogant husband of hers is beyond any guessing' i made some observation expressive of my abhorrence of mr neville's character and my friend continued 'disagreeable and shallow as he is one would have thought that the society of so superior so perfect a woman would reconcile him to her sex but i verily believe he is jealous of her surpassing excellence and that it is not so much a natural and i might almost call it generous fear of losing her affections as a dislike of seeing her admired and knowing that she is preferred to him especially now that he absolutely looks an old fellow poor alithea rivers hers is a hard fate' i had a glass of wine in my hand my convulsive grasp shivered the brittle thing but i gave no other outward sign before i was miserable i had lost all that made life dear but to know that she was lost to herself bound for life to a human brute curdled my heart's blood and spread an unnatural chilliness through my frame what a sacrifice was there a sacrifice of how much more than life of the heart's sweetest feelings when a spirit sent to gladden the world and cast one drop of celestial nectar into the bitterness of existence was made garbage for that detested animal from that moment from the moment i felt assured that i had seen alithea's husband something departed from the world such as i had once known it never to return again a sense of acquiescence in the decrees of providence of confidence in the benevolence and beauty of the universe of pride despite all my misfortunes in being man of pleasure in the loveliness of nature all departed i had lost her that was nothing it was my disaster but did not injure the order and grace of the creation she was i fondly trusted married to a better man than i but bound to that grovelling and loathsome type of the world's worst qualities the devil usurped at once the throne of god and life became a hell 'you are miserable alithea you must be miserable for you there is no sympathy no mingling of hearts no generous confidence in another's esteem and kindness no indulgence in golden imaginations of the beauty of life you are tied to a foul corrupting corpse you are cut off from the dear associations of the social hearth from the dignified sense of having exchanged virgin purity for a sweeter and more valuable possession in another's heart coldly and listlessly you look on the day which brings no hope to you if indeed you do not rave and blaspheme in your despair oh with me the brother of your soul your servant lover untiring friend how differently had your lot been cast i rushed from my friend's house i entered no roof that night my passions were awake my fierce volcanic passions had i encountered neville i had assuredly murdered him my soul was chaos yet a tempestuous ray gave a dark light amid the storm a glimmering yet permanent irradiation mantled over the ruins among which i stood i said to myself 'i am mad driven to desperation' but beneath this outward garb of my thought i knew and recognised an interior form i knew what i desired what i intended and what though i tried to cheat myself into the belief that i wavered i henceforth steadily pursued there is perhaps no more dangerous mood of mind than when we doggedly pursue means recklessly uncertain of their end thus was i led to the fatal hour a life of love and a sudden bereavement with such a thing the instrument of my ruin a contempt for the order of the universe a stern demoniacal braving of fate because i would rule and put that right which god had let go wrong oh let me not again blaspheme god made the stars and the green earth within whose bosom alithea lies she also is his and i will believe despite the hellish interference that tainted and deflowered her earthly life that now she is with the source of all good reaping the reward of her virtues the compensation for her suffering else why are we created to crawl forth to suffer and die i cannot believe it spirit of the blessed omnipotence did not form perfection to shatter and dissipate the elements like broken glass but i rave and wander alithea still lives and suffers at the time of which i write and i erecting myself into a providence resolved to put that right which was wrong and cure the world's misrule from that moment i never paused to look back i set my soul upon the cast and i am here and alithea her mysterious grave you shall now approach bent upon a dangerous purpose fate led before me an instrument without which i should have found it difficult to execute my plan i got a letter from a man in great distress asking for some small help he was on the point of quitting england for america and working his passage slight assistance would be of inestimable benefit in furthering his plans the petitioner followed his petition quickly and was ushered in before me i scrutinized his shrewd yet down looking countenance i scanned his supple yet uncertain carriage i felt that he was a coward yet knew he would tamper with roguery in all safety for a due reward i had known the fellow in india james osborne was his name he dabbled in various disreputable money transactions both with natives and englishmen and at last having excited the suspicion of government got thrown into prison he had then written to me who was considered a sort of refuge for the destitute and i went to see him there was no great harm in the man on the contrary he was soft hearted and humane the infection of dishonesty caught in bad company and fostered in poverty was his ruin and he joined to this a strong desire to be respectable if he could only contrive to subsist without double dealing i thought that by extricating him from his embarrassments and removing him from temptation i might save him from ignominy so i paid his passage to england where he told me that he had friends and resources but his old habits pursued him and even now though poverty was the alleged motive for his emigration i saw that there was secret fear of legal pursuit for dishonest practices he had been inveigled he said to lend his name to a transaction which turned out a knavish one with all this osborne was not a villain and scarcely a rogue there was truth in what he said he had always an aspiration for a better place in society but he saw no way of attaining it except by money and no way of gaining money except by cheating i listened to his story 'you are an incorrigible fellow' said i 'how can i give ear to your promises still i am willing to assist you i am myself going to america you shall accompany me' by degrees i afterward explained the service i needed yet i only half disclosed the truth osborne never knew the name or position of the lady who was to be my companion across the atlantic a man's notions of the conduct of others are always coloured by his own ruling passion osborne thought i was intent on carrying off an heiress with this ally i proceeded to cumberland my mind more intent on the result of my schemes than their intermediate detail i learned before i went that mr neville was still in town this was a golden opportunity and i hastened to use it i reached the spot that alithea inhabited i entered the outer gate of the demesne i rode up to the avenue that led to the house i was ushered into the room where i knew that i should find her i summoned every power to calm the throbbing of my heart i expected to find her changed but when i saw her i discovered no alteration it was strange that so much of girlish appearance should remain her figure was light and airy her rich clustering ringlets abundant as before her face it was alithea all herself that soft loving eye that clear brow those music breathing lips time had not harmed her it was herself she did not at once recognise me the beardless stripling was become a weather beaten thought worn man but when i told her who i was the name so long forgotten never heard since last she spoke it 'rupert' burst from her lips it united our severed lives and her look of rapture her accent all breathless with joy told me that her heart was still the same ardent affectionate and true we sat together hand linked in hand looking at each other with undisguised delight at first with satanic cunning i assumed the brother's part i questioned her concerning her fate her feelings and seeing that she was averse to confess the truth of her disappointed joyless married state i led her back to passed days i spoke of her dear mother i said that often had the image of that pale wise spirit checked guided and whispered sage lessons to me in my banishment i recalled a thousand scenes of our childhood when we wandered together hand in hand heart linked to heart confiding every pain avowing every wild or rebellious thought or discussing the mighty secrets of nature and of fate which to our young hearts were full of awe and mystery and yet of beauty and joy as i spoke i examined her more narrowly at first she had appeared to me the same now i marked a difference her mouth the home of smiles had ever its sweet benignant expression but her eyes there was a heaviness in the lids a liquid melancholy in their gaze which said that they were acquainted with tears her cheeks once round peachlike and downy were not fallen yet they had lost their rich fulness she was more beautiful there was more reflection more sentiment in her face but there was far far less happiness before smiles sprung up wherever she turned to gaze now an interest akin to pity and tears made the spectator's heart ache as he watched the turns of a countenance which was the faithful mirror of the truest heart that ever beat worse than this there ever and anon shot across her face a look that seemed like fear oh how unlike the trusting dreadless alithea my talk of other days at first soothed then excited and threw her off her guard by degrees i approached the object of all my talk and drew her to speak of her father and the motives that induced her marriage my knowledge and vivid recollections of all that belonged to her made her unawares speak as she had not done since we parted the undisguised truth and before she knew what she had said i had led her to confess that she had never loved her husband that she found no sympathy and little kindness in him that her life had been one of endurance of faults alien to her own temperament had i been more cautious i had allowed this to pass off at first and won her entire confidence before i laid bare my own thoughts for all she said had never before been breathed into any living ear but mine it was her principle to submit and to hide her sense of her husband's defective disposition and had i not with a serpent's subtlety glided on imperceptibly had i not brought forward her mother's name and the memory of childhood's cloudless years she had been mute with me but now i could contain myself no longer i told her that i had seen the miserable being to whom she was linked i uttered curses on the fate that had joined them together she laid her hand on my arm and looking in my face with confiding innocence 'hush rupert' she said 'you make me mean more than i would willingly have you think he is not unkind i have no right to complain it is not in every man that we can find a brother's or a friend's heart neville does not understand these things but he is my husband as such i honour him' i saw the internal feeling that led her to speak thus i saw the delicate forbearance that filled her noble mind she thought of her virgin faith plighted long years spent at his side her children her fidelity which if it had ceased to cling to him had never wandered even in thought to another duties exemplarily fulfilled earnest strivings to forget his worthlessness all this honour for her own pure nature she cheated herself into believing was honour paid to him i resolved to tear the veil which her gentleness and sense of right had drawn before the truth and i exclaimed impetuously 'wrong yourself not so much dear girl do not fancy that your high soul can really bow down to baseness you pay reverence to your own sense of duty but you hate you must hate that man' she started and her face and neck became died in blushes proceeding half from anger at being urged beyond her wish half from native modesty at hearing her husband thus spoken of as for myself i grew mad as i looked on her and felt the sweet transporting influences that gathered round here indeed was the creature whom i had loved through so many years who was mine in my dreams whose faith and true affection i fancied i held for ever and she was torn from me given away not to one who like me knew and felt her matchless excellence but to a base minded thing from whom she must shrink as from an animal of another species all that her soul contained of elevated thoughts and celestial aspirations all of generous high and heroic that warmed her heart what were they before a blind creeping worm who held a matchless jewel in his hand and deemed it dross he even could not understand or share the more sober affections mutual trust and mutual forbearance the utterance of love the caresses of tenderness what were these to a wretch who saw baseness and deceit in the most lofty and pure feelings of a woman's heart i expressed these thoughts or rather they burst from me she interrupted me 'i do not deny' she said 'for i know not how you have cheated me of my secret but that repinings have at times entered my mind and i have shed foolish tears to think that the dreams of my girlhood were as a bright morning quickly followed by a dim cloudy day but i have reproved myself for this discontent and you do very wrong to revive it the heart will rebel but religion and philosophy and the very tears i shed sooth its ruffled mood and make me remember that we do not live to be happy but to perform our duties to fulfil mine is the aim of my life teach me how to do that more completely more entirely to resign myself and you will be my benefactor it is true that my husband does not understand the childish overflowings of my heart which is too ready to seek its joys among the clouds he does not dwell with rapture on the thoughts and sentiments which give me so much life and happiness he is a stronger and sterner nature a slower one also i acknowledge one less ready to sympathize and feel but if i have in my intercourse with him regretted that lively cheering interchange of sentiment which i enjoyed with you you are now here to bestow it and my life hitherto defective your return may render complete' i laughed bitterly 'poor innocent bird' i cried 'think you at once to be free and in a cage at once to feel the fowler's grasp and fly away to heaven alithea you miserably deceive yourself hitherto you have but half guessed the secrets of a base grovelling spirit have you never seen your husband jealous' she shuddered and i saw a spasm of exquisite pain cloud her features as she averted her head from me and the look of trembling fear i had before remarked crept over her i was shocked to see so much of the slave had entered her soul i told her this i told her she was being degraded by the very duties which she was devoting herself body and soul to perform i told her that she must be free she looked wonderingly but i continued 'is not the very name of liberty dear and exhilarating does it not draw you irresistibly onward is not the very thought of casting your heavy chains from off you full of new and inexpressible joy poor prisoner do you not yearn to breathe without a fear would you not with transport escape from your jailer to a home of love and freedom' hitherto she had fancied that i but regretted her sorrows as she did and repined as she did over a fate whose real misery she alone could entirely feel she repented having spoken so openly yet she loved me for my unfeigned sympathy but now she saw that something more was meant she looked earnestly at me as if to read my heart she saw its wishes in my eyes and shrunk from them as from a snake as she exclaimed 'never dear rupert speak thus to me again or we must again part i have a son' the radiance of angelic love lighted up her face as she uttered these words and then my error and weakness being her strength she resumed the self possession she had lost during our previous conversation with bewitching grace she held out her hand to me and in a voice modulated by the soul of persuasion said 'let us be friends rupert such as we once were brother and sister i will not believe that you are returned only to pain and injure me i am happy in my children stay but a little and you will see how foolish i have been to complain at all you also will love my boy' would you not think that these words had sufficed to cure my madness and banish every guilty project had you seen her her inimitable grace of attitude the blushing tender expression of her face and her modest earnest manner a manner which spoke the maternal nature such as catholics imagine it without a tincture of the wife a girlish yet enthusiastic rapture at the very thought of her child you would have known that every scheme i meditated was riveted faster every desire to make her my own for ever more fixed and eager i went on to urge her till i saw every feature give token of distress and at last she suddenly left me as if unable any longer to bear my pertinacity she left me without a word but i saw her face bathed in tears i was indeed insane these tears which sprung from anguish of soul to think that her childhood's companion should thus show himself an injurer instead of a friend i interpreted into signs of relenting into a struggle with her heart chapter xxix i called again the following morning but she was denied to me twice this happened she feared me i believed and still more franticly i was driven to continue my persecutions i wrote to her she did not answer my letters i entered the grounds of her house clandestinely i lay in wait for her i resolved to see her again at length one afternoon i found her alone walking and musing in the more solitary part of the park i stood suddenly before her and her first emotion was pleasure so true was she to her affections so constant to her hope that at last i should be persuaded not to pain her by a renewal of my former conversation but i believed that i had a hold on her that i would not forego when she offered to renew our childhood's compact of friendship i asked her how that could be if she refused me her confidence i asked how she could promise me happiness whose every hope was blighted i told her that it was my firm conviction that her mother had intended us for one another that she had brought her up for me given her to me and that thus she was indeed mine her eyes flashed fire at this 'my mother' she said 'brought me up for a higher purpose than even conducing to your happiness she brought me up to fulfil my duties to be a mother in my turn i do not deny' she continued 'that i share in some sort my mother's fate and am more maternal than wife like and as i fondly wish to resemble her in all her virtues i will not repine at the circumstances that lead me rather to devote my existence to my children than to be that most blessed creature a happy wife i do not ask for that happiness i am contented with my lot my very girlish romantic repinings do not really make me unhappy' 'nor your fears nor his base jealousy his selfishness his narrow soul and brutish violence i know more than you think alithea i read your heart you must be miserable submissive yet tyrannized over wedded to your duty yet watched suspected accused there are traces of tears on your cheeks my poor girl your neck is bowed by the yoke your eyes have no longer the radiance of conscious rectitude and yet you are innocent' 'god knows i am' she replied as a shower of tears fell from her eyes but she was ashamed and brushed them away 'i am and will be rupert though you would mislead me where indeed can i find a consciousness of rectitude except in my heart my husband mistrusts me i acknowledge it by torture you force the truth he does not understand and you would pervert me in god and my own heart i put my trust and i will never do that which my conscience tells me is wrong and despite both i shall be happy a mother is in my eyes a more sacred name than wife my life is wrapped in my boy in him i find blameless joy though all the rest pierce my heart with poisoned arrows' 'you shall sweet alithea' i cried 'preserve him and every other blessing you were not born to inherit this maimed poverty stricken life the widowed mother of an orphan child such are you now i will be a father to him for your sake and many other joys will be yours and the fondest truest heart that ever warmed man's bosom shall be all your own alithea you must not offer yourself up a living sacrifice to that base idol but belong to one whose love and honour and eternal devotion merit you though he possess no other claim let me save you from him i ask no more' i felt a tear for many long years forgotten steal down my cheek my heart worshipped her excellence and pity and grief mingled with my deep regrets she saw how sincerely i was moved and tried to comfort me she wept also for despite her steadier thoughts she knew the cruelty of her destiny and i do believe her heart yearned to taste once more before she died the full joy of complete sympathy but if indeed her tears were partly shed for herself yet she never wavered she deplored my unhappiness but she reproved my perversion of principle she tried to awaken patience piety or philosophic fortitude any of the noble virtues that might enable me to combat the passion by which i was enslaved time was forgotten as we thus talked with the same openness of heart as in former days yet those hearts how saddened and wounded since then i would not let her go while the moon rose high shedding its silvery light over the forest trees and casting dark shadows on our path still we indulged in what she deemed our last conference as i must answer my crimes before god i swear i could discern no wavering thought no one idea that strayed to the forbidden ground towards which i strove to lead her she told me that she had intended not to see me again till her husband returned she said that she must implore me not again to seek her in this way or i should make her a prisoner in her house i listened i answered i knew not what i was more resolved than ever not to lose her despite all i still was mad enough to hope she left me at last hoping to have conquered yet resolved not to see me again she said till her husband returned this determination on her part was in absolute contradiction to what i resolved should be i had decreed to see her again nay more i would see her not within the precincts of her home where all spoke against me but where she should be free where seeing nothing to remind her of the heavy yoke to which she bent her neck i fondly dreamed i might induce her wholly to throw it aside if it so pleased her i would detain her but a few short hours and restore her to her home in all liberty but could i induce her to assert her freedom and follow me voluntarily then to think that possible the earth reeled under me and my passion gained strength from its very folly i prepared all things for my plan i went to liverpool and bought two fleet horses and a light foreign calche suited to my purpose returning northward towards dromore i sought a solitary spot for the scene of our last interview or of the first hour of my lasting bliss what more solitary than the wild and drear seashore of the south of cumberland landward it is screened by a sublime back ground of mountains but in itself presenting to the view a wide extent of uninhabited sands intersected by rivers which when the tide is up presents a dreary expanse of shallow water and at ebb are left except in the channels of the rivers a barren extent of mud and marsh the surrounding waste being variegated only by a line of sand hills thrown up to the height of thirty or forty feet shutting in the view from shore while seaward no boat appeared ever to spread its sail on that lonely sea on these sands near the mouth of one of the rivers there was a small hut deserted but not in ruins it was probably occasionally inhabited by guides who are used in this part of the country to show the track of the fords when the tide is full and any deviation from the right path is attended by peril the beds of the rivers being full of ruts and deep holes that hut i selected as the spot where all should be determined if she consented to accompany me we would proceed rapidly forward to liverpool and embark for america if she resolved to return this spot was but five miles from her home and i could easily lead her back without suspicion being excited i was anxious to put my scheme in execution as her husband was shortly expected it seemed a feasible one in my own heart i did not expect to induce her to forsake her home but i might and the very doubt maddened me and if i did not yet for a few hours to have her near me not in any spot that called her detested husband master but in the wide free scenes of nature the ocean parent of all liberty spread at our feet the way easy to escape no eye no ear to watch and spy out the uncontrolled and genuine emotions of her heart or no hand to check our progress if she consented to follow in this plan osborne whom i had left at the miserable town of ravenglass and who indeed had been the man to find and point out to me the solitary hut was necessary my explanation and directions to him were few and peremptory he was to appear with the calche he acting as postillion at a certain spot the moment he saw me arrive as soon as i had placed the lady who was to be my companion in the carriage he was to put spurs to his horses and not by any cry of hers nor command of mine nor interference of strangers to be induced to stop till he reached the hut there she should be free till then i would have her a prisoner even beyond my own control lest her entreaties should cheat me out of my resolves osborne looked frightened at some portion of these orders but i glossed over any inconsistency my bribe was high and he submitted at every step i took in this mad and guilty scheme i became more resolved to carry it on here is my crime here the tale of sin i have to relate the rest is disaster and endless remorse what moved me to this height of insanity what blinded me to the senseless as well as the unpardonable nature of my design i cannot tell except that for years i had lived in a dream and waking in the real world i refused to accommodate myself to its necessities but resolved to bend its laws to my desires i loved alithea i had loved her through years of absence she was the wife of my reveries my hopes my heart i could no more part with the thought of her as such than with a consciousness of my own identity to see her married and a mother might be supposed capable of dissipating these fancies far from it her presence her beauty the witchery of her eye her heart subduing voice her sensibility the perfection of her nature which her inimitable loveliness only half expressed but which reached my soul through a sort of inner sense that acknowledged it with worship all this added to my phrensy and steeped me to the very lips in intoxication what right had i to call this matchless creature mine none that i acknowledged but that he the man without a soul the incarnate belial should claim her was not to be endured mad as i was i aver and he who reads all hearts be now my testimony that it was more my wish to set her free from him than to bind her to myself that urged me on i had in the solitary shades of her park during the arguments and struggles of our last interview sworn that if she would suffer me to take her and her boy too if she chose away from him i would place her in some romantic spot build a home worthy of her surrounded with all the glory of nature and only see her as a servant and a slave i pledged my soul to this and i would have kept my oath those who have not loved may look on this as the very acme of my hallucination it might be i cannot tell but so it was all was ready and i wrote to her to meet me for the last time in this also i was in one sense sincere for i had determined if i should fail in my persuasions never to see her more she came but several hours later than i intended which to a certain degree deranged my plans the weather had a sultriness about it all day portending storm occasioning a state of atmosphere that operates to render the human frame uneasy and restless i paced the lane that bounded the demesnes of dromore for hours i threw myself on a grassy bank the rack in the upper sky sped along with fearful impetuosity it traversed the heavens from west to east driven by a furious wind which had not yet descended to us for below on earth no breath of air moved the herbage or could be perceived amid the topmost boughs of the trees everything in nature acted upon by these contrary influences had a strange and wild appearance the sun descended red towards the ocean before alithea opened the private gate of the grounds and stood in all her loveliness before me she brought her son with her at first this annoyed me but at a second thought it seemed to render my whole design more conclusive she had spoken of this child with such rapture that it would have been a barbarity beyond my acting to separate her from him by making him her companion she completed my purpose i would take them away together i met her i thought with self possession but she read the conflict of passion in my face and half fearful asked what disturbed me i attributed my agitation to our approaching parting and drawing her hand through my arm walked forward along the lane at the moment of executing my project its wickedness and cruelty became so apparent that a thousand times i was about to confess all solicit her forgiveness and leave her for ever but that hardness which in the ancient religions is deemed the immediate work of god crept over my heart turning its human misgiving to stony resolution i endeavoured to close every aperture of my soul against the relenting moods that assailed me yet they came with greater power each time and at length wholly mastering me i consented to be subdued i determined to relinquish my schemes to bid her an eternal adieu and moved by self pity at the desolate lot i was about to encounter i spoke of separation and absence and the death of hope with such heartfelt pathos as moved her to tears surely there is no greater enemy to virtue and good intentions than that want of self command the exterior of which though i had acquired no portion existed in the inner substance of my mind calm proud and stern as i seemed to others capable of governing the vehemence of my temper within i was the same slave of passion i had ever been i never could force myself to do the thing i hated i never could persuade myself to relinquish the thing i desired there is the secret of my crimes there the vice of my disposition which produced for her i loved a miserable death and for myself endless unutterable wo for a moment i had become virtuous and heroic we reached the end of the lane my emissary appeared with the carriage i had worked myself up by this time to determine to restore her to her home to part with her for ever she believed this the despair written on my brow my sombre mute yet heart broken mien my thoughts which had totally relinquished their favourite project and consented to be widowed of her for ever expressed in brief passionate sentences proved to her who had never suspected that i meant otherwise that i took my last look and spoke my last words we reached the end of the lane osborne drove up 'be not surprised' i said 'yes it is there alithea the carriage that is to convey me far far away gracious god do i live to see this hour' the carriage stopped we walked up to it a devil at that moment whispered in my ear a devil who feeds on human crimes and groans prompted my arm coward and dolt to use such words my own hellish mind was the sole instigator in a moment it was done i lifted her light figure into the carriage i jumped in after her i bade her boy follow it was too late one cry from him one long piercing shriek from her and we were gone with the swiftness of the winds we descended the eminence towards the shore and left child and all return far behind at that moment the storm burst over us but the thunder was unheard amid the rattling of the wheels even her cries were lost in the uproar but as the thickening clouds changed twilight into night the vivid lightning showed me alithea at my feet in convulsions of fear and anguish there was no help i raised her in my arms and she struggled in them without meaning without knowledge spasm succeeded to spasm i saw them by the flashes of the frequent lightning distort her features with agony but i could not even hear her groans the furious haste at which we went the thunder from above the plash of the rain suspended only by the howlings of the rising wind drowned every other sound i called to osborne to stop he gave no heed to my cries methought the horses had taken fright and held the bit in their teeth with such unimaginable speed we swept along the roar of ocean torn up by the wild west wind now mingled with the universal uproar hell had broken loose upon earth yet what was every other and more noisy tempest compared to that which shook my soul as i pressed alithea to my heart in agony vainly hoping to see the colour revisit her cheeks and her dear eyes open was she already a corpse i tried to feel her breath upon my cheek but the speed of our course and the uproar of the elements prevented my being able to ascertain whether she was alive or dead and thus i bore her thus i made her my bride thus i her worshipper emptied the vials of pain on her beloved head chapter xxx at last i became aware that the wheels of the carriage passed through water hope revived with the thought the hut where osborne was to stop was to the south of the river we were now crossing the tide was ebbing and despite the wind and storm we passed the ford in safety a moment more and the carriage stopped amid the sands i took the unfortunate lady in my arms and carried her into the hut then fetching the cushions of the carriage i bade osborne take the horses on to a covered shed about half a mile off which he had prepared for them and return immediately i re entered the hut still alithea lay motionless on the ground where i had placed her the lightning showed me her pale face and another flash permitted me to discover a portion of luggage brought here by osborne necessary if we fled among other things which soldier like i always carried with me i saw my canteen it contained the implements for striking a light and tapers by such means i could at last discover that my victim still lived and sometimes also she groaned and sighed heavily what had happened to her i could not tell nor by what means consciousness might be restored i chafed her head and hands in spirituous waters i made her swallow some in vain for a moment she somewhat revived but relapsed again and the icy cold of her hands and feet seemed to portend instant dissolution osborne returned as i had ordered he was totally unaware of the state to which my devilish machinations had brought my victim he found me hanging over her calling her by every endearing name chafing her hands in mine watching in torture for such signs of returning sense as would assure me that i was not about to see her expire before my eyes he was scared by what he saw but i silenced him and made him light a fire and heat sand which i placed at her feet and then by degrees with help of large doses of sal volatile and other drugs circulation was restored she opened her eyes and gazed wildly round and tears gushed from under the lids in large slow drops my soul blessed god every mad desire and guilty scheme had faded before the expectation of her death all i asked of heaven was her life and leave to restore her to her child and her home heaven granted as i thought my prayer the livid streaks which had settled round her mouth and eyes disappeared her features lost the rigidity of convulsions a slight colour tinged her cheeks her hands late chill and stiff now had warmth and voluntary motions of their own once or twice she looked round and tried to speak 'gerard' that word the name of her boy was murmured i caught the sound as i bent eagerly over her 'he is safe he is well' i whispered 'all is well be comforted alithea' the poor victim smiled yes her own sweet smile dawned upon her face 'she too is safe' i thought once again i felt my heart beat freely and at ease she continued however in a state of torpor there were two rooms in the hut i prepared a sort of couch for her in the inner one i placed her on it i covered her with her cloak by degrees the sort of insensibility in which she sunk changed to sleep we left her then and sat watching in the outer room i kept my eyes fixed on her and saw that each hour added to the tranquillity of her repose i could not hear her breathe for though the thunder and rain had ceased the wind howled and the near ocean roared its billows driven by the western gale encroached upon the sands almost to the threshold of the hut a revulsion had taken place within me i felt that there was something dearer to me than the fulfilment of my schemes which was her life she appeared almost miraculously restored and my softened heart thanked god and blessed her i believed i could be happy even in eternal absence now that the guilt of her death was taken from my soul well do i remember the kind of rapture that flowed in upon my heart as at dawn of day i crept noiselessly to her side and marked the regular heaving of her bosom and saw her eyelids heavy and dark with suffering it is true yet gently closed over the dear orbs which again and for many a long year would enjoy the light of day i felt a new man i felt happy in a few short hours i should receive her pardon convey her home declare my own guilt and while absolving her offer myself as the mark of whatever vengeance her husband might choose to take me oh what was i i had no being it was dissolved into a mere yearning for her life her contentment i was about to render myself up as a criminal to a man whose most generous act would be to meet me in the field but that was nothing i thought not of it either with gladness or regret she lives she shall be restored to all she loves she once again will be at peace these were my dreams as i hung over her and gradually the break of day became more decided by the increasing light i could perceive that i had not deceived myself she slept a healthy profound healing sleep i returned to the outer room osborne had wrapped himself in his great coat and lay stretched on the floor i roused him and told him to go for the horses and carriage immediately so that the first thing that might welcome alithea's awakening should be the offer of an immediate return home he gladly obeyed and left the hut but scarcely was he gone than a sort of consciousness came over me that i would not remain with her alone so i followed him at some little distance towards the shed where the carriage and horses were the wind had scattered every cloud and still howled through the clear gray morning sky the sea was in violent commotion and huge surges broke heavily and rapidly on the beach the tide was flowing fast and the bed of the river we had crossed so safely the night before was covered by the waves in a little time the ford would be impassable and this was another reason to hasten the arrival of the horses to the east each crag and precipice each vast mountain top showed in dark relief against the golden eastern sky seaward the horizon was misty from the gale and the ocean stretched out inimitably curlews and gulls screamed as they skimmed the crested waves and breaker after breaker dashed furiously at my feet it was a desolate but a magnificent spectacle and my throbbing heart was in unison with its vast grandeurs i blessed sea and wind and heaven and the dawn the guilt of my soul had passed from me and without the grievous penalty i had dreaded all again was well i walked swiftly on i reached the shed osborne was busy with the horses he had done what he could for them the night before and they seemed tolerably fresh i spoke cheerfully to the man as i helped to harness them osborne was still pale with fright but when i told him that i was going to carry the lady back to her friends and that there was nothing to fear he took heart i bade him come slowly along that the noise of the wheels might not waken her if she still slept and i walked beside my hand on the neck of one horse while he bestrode the other and we gazed around and pointed to each other signs of the recent tempest which had been so much more violent than i in my preoccupation had known and then as the idea of the ford being rendered impassable crossed me again i bid him get on at a quicker rate there was no fear of disturbing the sleeping lady for the wheels were noiseless on the heavy sands i have mentioned that huge sand hills were thrown up here and there on the beach two of the highest of these shut out all view of the hut and even of the river till we were close upon them as we passed these mounds my first glance was to see the state of the tide the bed of the river was entirely filled with dashing crested waves which poured in from the sea with inconceivable rapidity and obliterated every trace of the ford i looked anxiously round but it was plain we must wait for the ebbing tide or make a long detour to seek the upper part of the stream as i gazed something caught my eyes as peculiar the foam of the breaking waves was white and this object also was white yet was it real or but the mockery of a human form for a moment my heart ceased to beat and then with wings to my feet i ran to the hut i rushed into the inner room the couch was deserted the whole dwelling empty i hurried back to the river's brink and strained my eyeballs to catch a sight of the same fearful object it was there i could not mistake a wave lifted up and then again overwhelmed and swallowed it in its abyss the form no longer living the dead body of alithea i threw myself into the water i battled with the waves the tide bore me on again and again i was blinded and overwhelmed by the surges but still i held on and made my way into the middle of the roaring flood as i rose gasping from one large billow that had for more than a minute ingulfed me in its strangling depths i felt a substance strike against me instinctively i clutched at it and grasping her long streaming hair now with renewed strength and frantic energy i made for shore i was as a plaything to the foaming billows but by yielding to them by suffering myself to be carried up the tide to where the river grew shallower and the waves less powerful i was miserable enough at last to escape fool did i not know that she was dead why did i not clasping her in my arms resign my life to the waters no she had returned to me from the gates of death the night before and i madly deemed the miracle would be twice performed i reached the bank osborne trembling and ghastly helped me to lift her on shore we endeavoured by various means to recall the spark of life it was too late she had been long in the water and was quite dead how can i write these words how linger on these hideous details alas they are for ever before me no day no hour passes but the whole scene is acted over again with startling vividness and my soul shrinks and shudders from the present image of death even now that the dawn of greece is breaking among the hills that the balmy summer air fans my cheek that the distant mountain tops are gilded by the morning beams and the rich tranquil beauty of a southern clime is around yet even now the roar of that distant ocean is in my ear the desolate coast stretches out far away and alithea lies pale drenched and lifeless at my feet i saw it all and how often and for ever do i go over in my thoughts what had passed during the interval of my absence she had awoke refreshed she collected her scattered senses she remembered the hideous vision of her carrying off she knew not of my relenting she feared my violence she resolved to escape she was familiar with that shore its rivers and the laws which governed their tides were known to her she believed that she could pass the water in safety for often when the bed of the estuary was apparently full she knew that she had forded the stream on horseback and the waters scarce covered the animal's fetlock intent on escaping the man of violence of reaching her beloved home she had entered the stream without calculating the difference of a calm neap tide and the mass of irresistible waves borne up by the strong western wind they perhaps seemed less terrible than i to fly from me she encountered delivered herself up to them and there she lay destroyed dead lost for ever no more of this what then i did may i now conceive appear more shocking to my countrymen than all that went before but i knew little of english customs i had gone out an inexperienced stripling to india and my modes of action were formed there i now know that when one dies in england they keep the lifeless corpse weeping and watching beside it for many days and then with lingering ceremonies and the attendance of relations and friends lay it solemnly in the dismal tomb but i had seen whole armies mown down by the sword and disease i was accustomed to the soldier's hastily dug grave in a climate where corruption follows fast upon death to hide the dead with speed from every eye was the indian custom and then should i take the corpse of alithea wet with the ocean tide ghastly from the throes of recent death and bear her to her home and say here she is she enjoyed life and happiness yester evening i bore her away behold my work should i present myself to her husband answer his questions detail the various stages of my crime and tamely await his vengeance or his pardon never or should i destroy myself at her side and leave our bodies to tell a frightful tale of mystery and horror the miserable terrors of my associate would of itself have prevented this catastrophe i had to reassure and protect him my resolution was quickly made not to outlive my victim and making atonement by my death what other penalty could i be called upon to pay but my death should not be a tale to appal or amuse the vulgar or to swell with triumph the heart of alithea's tyrant husband secrecy and oblivion should cover all my plan was laid and i acted accordingly osborne entered into the design with alacrity he was moved by other feelings he was possessed by an agony of fear he did not doubt but that we should be accused of murdering the hapless lady and the image of the gallows flitted before his eyes understanding each other without many words osborne said that in the shed where we had placed the horses he had remarked a spade it was so early that no one was about to observe him and he went to fetch it he returned in about half an hour i sat keeping watch the while by the dead and feasted my eyes with the sight of my pale victim as she lay at my feet of what tough materials is man formed that my heart strings did not break and that i outlived that hour osborne returned and we went to work some ten yards above high water mark there was a single leafless moss grown skeleton tree with something like soil about its roots and sheltered from the spray and breeze by the vicinity of a sand hill close to it we dug a deep grave i placed the cushions in it on which her fair form all warm and soft had reposed during the preceding night then i composed her stark limbs banding the long wet tresses of her abundant hair across her eyes for ever closed crossing her hands upon her pure death cold bosom i touched her reverently i did not even profane her hand by a kiss i wrapped her in her cloak and laid her in the open grave i tore down some of the decaying boughs of the withered tree and arching them above her body threw my own cloak above so with vain care to protect her lifeless form from immediate contact with the soil then we filled up the grave and scattering dry sand above removed every sign of recent opening this was performed in silence or with whispered words the roaring waves were her knell the rising sun her funeral torch i was satisfied with the solemnity of the scene around and i was composed for i was resolved on death osborne trembled in every limb and his face rivalled in hue her wan bloodless countenance we carefully removed every article from the hut and put all in the same state as when we found it i did not indeed fear discovery who would imagine that my course would be to the desolate seabeach and if they did and found all i should be far i should be dead but osborne was eager to obliterate every mark of the hut having been visited when he was satisfied that he had accomplished this without looking behind i got into the carriage we drove with what speed we could to lancaster and thence to liverpool osborne was in a transport of fear till he got on board an american vessel fortunately the wind having veered towards the north there was one about to weigh anchor i placed a considerable sum of money in my accomplice's hands and recommended discretion he would have questioned me as to my own designs but he respected my stern silence and we parted never to meet again a small coasting vessel bound for plymouth was at that moment making her way out of harbour i hailed a man on board and threw myself on to the deck elizabeth can tell the rest she knows how i landed in a secluded village of cornwall with the intent there to make due sacrifice to the outraged manes of alithea still i grieve for the unaccomplished purpose still i repine that i did not there die she stopped my hand an angel in likeness of a human child arrested my arm and winning my wonder by her extraordinary loveliness and my interest by her orphan and desolate position i seemed called upon to live for her sake the struggle was violent for i longed to make atonement by my death and i longed to forget my crimes and their consequences in the oblivious grave at first i thought that the respite i granted myself would be short but it lasted for years and i dragged out a living death having survived love and hope remorse my follower ghastly images of crime and death my comrades i travelled from place to place pursued by alithea's upbraiding ghost and my own torturing thoughts by frequent change of place i sought to assuage my pangs i believe that i increased them they might perhaps have been mitigated by the monotony of a stationary life but a traveller's existence is all sensation and every emotion is rendered active and penetrating by the perpetual variation of the appearances of natural objects thought and feeling awaken with the sun and dewy eve and the radiant stars cause the eyes to turn towards the backward path while darkness felt palpably as one proceeds onward in an unknown land awakens the snakes of conscience the storm and expected wreck are images of retribution while yet the destruction i pined for receded from before my thirsting lips yet still i dragged on life most unworthily and unworthy till on a day i saw the son of my victim at baden i witnessed misery widely spread through my means and felt that her disimbodied spirit must curse me for the evil i had brought on her beloved child i remembered all she had fondly said of him and the cloudless beauty of his face his joyous laugh and free step when last i saw him at her side he was blighted and destroyed by me gloomy savage and wild eternal sorrow was written on his brow fear and hatred gleamed in his eyes such by my means had the son of alithea become such had his base minded father rendered him but mine the guilt mine be the punishment what a wretch was i to live in peace and security ministered to by an angel while this dearest part of herself was doomed to anguish and to the unmitigated influence of the demon for ever at his side through my accursed means from that hour i became thrice hateful to myself i had tried to live for my elizabeth but that idea passed away with every other solace in which hitherto i had iniquitously indulged i resolved to die but as a taint has been cast by the most villanous heart in the world upon her hallowed name my first task was to redeem that out of her unworthy husband's hands and yet i could not i would not while living disclose the truth and give a triumph to my enemy but soon oh very soon will the soil of greece drink up my life blood and while this writing proclaims her innocence i shall be sheltered by the grave from the taunts and revilings of men and you dear child of my affection who have been to me as a blessing immediate from heaven who have warmed my heart with your love and smoothed the fierceness of my temper by your unalterable sweetness who having blessed me with your virtues clinging to the ruin with a fidelity i believed impossible how shall i say farewell to you forgive your friend that he deserts you long ago he deserted himself and the better part of life it is but the shell of him that remains and that corroded by remorse and the desire to die you deserve better than to have your young days clouded by the shadow of my crime thrown over them forget me and be happy you must be so while i the sun is up the martial trumpet sounds it is a joy to think that i shall have a soldier's grave chapter xxxi such was the tale presented to the young enthusiastic innocent elizabeth unveiling the secret of the life of him whom she revered above all the world her soul was in her eyes as she read or rather devoured page after page till she arrived at the catastrophe when a burst of passionate tears relieved her swelling bosom and carried away upon their stream a thousand trembling unspeakable fears that had gathered in wild multitude around her heart he is innocent he my benefactor my father when he accused himself of murder spoke as i thought of a consequence not an act and if the chief principle of religion be true that repentance washes away sin he is pardoned and the crime forgotten noble generous heart what drops of anguish have you not shed in atonement what glorious obsequies you pay your victim for she also is acquitted gerard's mother is more than innocent she was true to him and to the purest sentiments of nature to the end nay more her life was sacrificed to them and elizabeth went over in her mind as falkner had often done the emotions that actuated her to attempt the dangerous passage across the ford she fancied her awakening on the fatal morning her wild look around no familiar object met her view nor did any friendly voice reassure her the strange scene and solitary hut were testimonies that she did not dream and that she had really been torn from home and all she loved by a violence she could not resist at first she must have listened tremblingly and fancied her lover enemy at hand but all is still she rises she ventures to examine the strange dwelling to which she has been carried no human being presents himself she quits the threshold of the hut a familiar scene is before her eyes the ocean and the dreary but well known shore the river which she has so often crossed and among the foldings of the not distant hills imbosomed in trees she sees dromore her tranquil home she knows that it is but a few miles distant and while she fancies her enemy near at hand yet the hope animates her that she may cross the stream unseen and escape elizabeth imaged all her hopes and fears she seemed to see the hapless lady place her uncertain feet her purpose being stanch and unfaltering within the shallow wave which she believed she could traverse in safety the roar of the advancing tide was in her ears the spray dashed round her and her footing grew uncertain as she sought to find her way across the rugged bed of the river but she thought only of her child from whom she had been torn and her fears of being through the deed of violence which had carried her off excluded from her home for ever to arrive at that home was all her desire as she advanced she still fixed her eyes on the clustering woods of dromore sleeping stilly in the gray quiet dawn and she risked her life unhesitatingly to gain the sacred shelter all depended on her reaching it quickly and alone and she was doomed never to see it more she advances resolutely but cautiously the waves rise higher she is in the midst of the stream her footing becomes more unsteady does she look back there is no return her heart proudly repels the very thought of desiring it she gathers her garments about her she looks right onward she steps more carefully the surges buffet her they rise higher and higher the spray is dashed over her head and blinds her sight a false step she falls the waters open to ingulf her she is borne away one thought of her gerard one prayer to heaven and the human eye can pursue the parting soul no farther she is lost to earth none upon it can any longer claim a portion in her but she is innocent the last word murmured in her last sleep the last word human ears heard her utter was her son's name to the last she was all mother her heart filled with that deep yearning which a young mother feels to be the very essence of her life for the presence of her child there is something so beautiful in a young mother's feelings usually a creature to be fostered and protected taught to look to another for aid and safety yet a woman is the undaunted guardian of her little child she will expose herself to a thousand dangers to shield his fragile being from harm if sickness or injury approach him her heart is transfixed by terror readily joyfully she would give her own blood to sustain him the world is a hideous desert when she is threatened to be deprived of him and when he is near and she takes him to the shelter of her bosom and wraps him in her soft warm embrace she cares for nothing beyond that circle and his smiles and infantine caresses are the life of her life such a mother was alithea and in gerard she possessed a son capable of calling forth in its intensity and of fully rewarding her maternal tenderness what wonder when she saw him cast pitilessly down on the road side alive or dead she knew not the wheel of the carriage that bore her away might have crushed and destroyed his tender limbs what wonder that she should be threatened by instant death through the excess of her agony what wonder that reviving from death her first and only thought was to escape to get back to him to clasp him to her heart never to be severed more how glad and yet how miserable gerard would be to read this tale his proudest and fondest assertions certified as true and yet to feel that he had lost her for ever whose excellence was proved to be thus paramount elizabeth's reflections now rested on him and now turned to falkner and now she opened the manuscript again and read anew and then again her heart made its commentary and she wept and rejoiced and longed to comfort her father and congratulate neville all in a breath she never thought of herself this was elizabeth's peculiarity she could be so engrossed by sympathy for others that she could forget herself wholly at length she remembered her father's directions that his manuscript should be given to neville when he called she had no thought of disobeying nor could she help being glad that gerard's filial affection should receive its reward even while she was pained to think that falkner should be changed at once into an enemy in her new friend's eyes still her generous nature led her instantly to ally herself to the weaker side neville was triumphant falkner humiliated and fallen and thus he drew her closer to him and riveted the chain of gratitude and fidelity by which she was bound she had shed many tears for alithea's untimely fate for the virtues and happiness hurried to a mysterious end buried in an untold grave but she had her reward long had she been there where there is no trouble no strife her pure soul received into the company of kindred angels her heroism would now be known her actions justified she would be raised above her sex in praise her memory crowned with unfading glory it was falkner who needed the exertion of present service to forgive and console he must be raised from his self abasement his despair must be cured he must feel that the hour of remorse was past that of repentance and forgiveness come he must be rewarded for all his goodness to her by being made to love life for her sake neville whose heart was free from every base alloy would enter into these feelings content to rescue the fame of his mother from the injury done it happy in being assured that his faithful filial love had not been mistaken in its reliance the first emotion of his generous soul would be to forgive yet elizabeth fancied that borne away by his ardour in his mother's cause he might altogether pass over and forget the extenuating circumstances that rendered falkner worthy of pardon and she thought it right to accompany the narrative with an explanatory letter thus she wrote my father has given me these papers for the purpose of transmitting them to you i need not tell you that i read them this day for the first time that till now i was in total ignorance of the facts they disclose it is most true that i a little child stopped his arm as he was about to destroy himself moved by pity for my orphan state he consented to live is this a crime yet i could not reconcile him to life and he went to greece seeking death he went there in the pride of life and health you saw him at marseilles you saw him to day the living effigy of remorse and wo it is hard at the moment you discover that he was the cause of your mother's death to ask your sympathy for his sufferings and high minded contrition i leave you to follow the dictates of your own heart with regard to him for myself attached to him as i am by every sentiment of affection and gratitude i am from this moment more than ever devoted to his service and eager to prove to him my fidelity these words come from myself my father knows not what i write he simply told me to inform you that he should remain here and if you desired aught of him he was ready at your call he thinks perhaps you may require further explanation further guidance to your mother's grave oh secret and obscure as it is is it not guarded by angels have you not been already led to it she left off abruptly she heard a ring at the outer gate the hour had come it must be neville she placed the papers in the writing case and directing and sealing the letter gave both to the servant to be delivered to him scarcely was this done when suddenly it flashed across her how the relative situations of neville and herself were changed that morning she had been his chosen friend into her ear he poured the history of his hopes and fears he claimed her sympathy and she felt that from her he derived a happiness never felt before now he must regard her as the daughter of his mother's destroyer and should she ever see him more instinctively she rushed to the highest room of the house to catch one other glimpse by the time she reached the window the act was fulfilled that changed both their lives the packet given dimly in the twilight she saw a horseman emerge from under the wall of the garden and slowly cross the heath slowly at first as if he did not comprehend what had happened or what he was doing there is something that excites unspeakable tenderness when the form of the loved one is seen even from far and elizabeth though unaware of the nature and depth of her sensations yet felt her heart soften and yearn towards her friend a blessing fell from her lips while the consciousness of all of doubtful and sad that he must at that moment experience at being sent from her door with a written communication only joined to the knowledge that each succeeding hour would add to the barriers that separated them so overcame her that when at last he put spurs to his horse and was borne out of sight into the thickening twilight she burst into a passion of tears and wept for some time not knowing what she did nor where she was but feeling that from that hour the colour of her existence was changed its golden hue departed and that patience and resignation must henceforth take place of gladness and hope she roused herself after a few minutes from this sort of trance and her thoughts reverted to falkner there are few crimes so enormous but that when we undertake to analyze their motives they do not find some excuse and pardon in the eyes of all except their perpetrators sympathy is more of a deceiver than conscience the stander by may dilate on the force of passion and the power of temptation but the guilty are not cheated by such subterfuges he knows that the still voice within was articulate to him he remembers that at the moment of action he felt his arm checked his ear warned he could have stopped and been innocent perhaps of all the scourges wielded by the dread eumenides there is none so torturing as the consciousness of the wilfulness of the act deplored it is a mysterious principle to be driven out by no reasonings no commonplace philosophy it had eaten into falkner's soul taken sleep from his eyes strength from his limbs every healthy and self complacent sentiment from his soul elizabeth however innocent and good as she was fancied a thousand excuses for an act whose frightful catastrophe was not foreseen falkner called himself a murderer but though the untimely death of the unfortunate alithea was brought about by his means so far from being guilty of the deed he would have given a thousand lives to save her since her death she well knew that sleep had not refreshed nor food nourished him he was blighted turned from all the uses and enjoyments of life he desired the repose of the grave he had sought death he had made himself akin to the grim destroyer that he had acted wrongly nay criminally elizabeth acknowledged but by how many throes of anguish by what repentance and sacrifice of all that life holds dear had he not expiated the past elizabeth longed to see him again to tell him how fondly she still loved him how he was exalted not debased in her eyes to comfort him with her sympathy cherish him with her love it was true that she did not quite approve of the present state of his mind there was too much of pride too much despair but when he found that instead of scorn his confession met with compassion and redoubled affection his heart would soften he would no longer desire to die so to escape from blame and retribution but be content to endure and teach himself that resignation which is the noblest and most unattainable temper of mind to which humanity may aspire chapter xxxii while these thoughts founded on a natural piety pure and gentle as herself occupied elizabeth falkner indulged in far other speculations he triumphed it is strange that although perpetually deceived and led astray by our imagination we always fancy that we can foresee and in some sort command the consequences of our actions falkner while he deplored his beloved victim with the most heartfelt grief yet at no time experienced a qualm of fear because he believed that he held the means of escape in his own hands and could always shelter himself from the obloquy that he now incurred in an unapproachable tomb through strange accidents that resource had failed him he was alive and his secret was in the hands of his enemies but as he confronted the injured son of a more injured mother another thought dearer to his lawless yet heroic imagination presented itself there was one reparation he could make and doubtless it would be demanded of him the law of honour would be resorted to to avenge the death of alithea he did not for a moment doubt but that neville would challenge him his care must be to fall by the young man's hand there was a sort of poetical justice in this idea a noble and fitting ending to his disastrous story that solaced his pride and filled him as it has been said with triumph having arrived at this conclusion he felt sure also that the consummation would follow immediately on neville's perusal of the narration put into his hands this very day might be his last and it was necessary to make every preliminary arrangement leaving elizabeth occupied with his fatal papers he drove to town to seek mr raby's solicitor to place in his hands the proofs of his adopted child's birth so to secure her future acknowledgment by her father's family she was not his child no drop of his blood flowed in her veins his name did not belong to her as miss raby neville would gladly seek her while as miss falkner an insuperable barrier existed between them and though he fell by gerard's hand yet he meant to leave a letter to convince her that this was but a sort of cunning suicide and that it need place no obstacle between two persons whom he believed were formed for each other what more delightful than that his own elizabeth should love the son of alithea if he survived indeed this mutual attachment would be beset by difficulties his death was like the levelling of a mountain all was plain easy happy when he no longer deformed the scene he had some difficulty in meeting with mr raby's man of business he found him however perfectly acquainted with all the circumstances and eager to examine the documents placed in his hands he had already written to treby and received confirmation of all falkner's statements this activity had been imparted by mrs raby then at tunbridge wells who was anxious to render justice to the orphan the moment she had been informed of her existence falkner heard with great satisfaction of the excellent qualities of this lady and the interest she showed in poor edwin raby's orphan child the day was consumed and part of the evening in these arrangements and a final interview with his own solicitor his will was already made he divided his property between elizabeth and his cousin the only surviving daughter of his uncle something of shame was in his heart when he returned and met again his adopted child a shame ennobled by the sense that he was soon to offer up his life as atonement while she who had long been reflecting on all that occurred yet felt it brought home more keenly when she again saw him and read in his countenance the tale of remorse and grief more legibly than in the written page passionately and gratefully attached her heart warmed towards him his very look of suffering was an urgent call upon her fidelity and though she felt all the change that his disclosures operated though she saw the flowery path she had been treading at once wasted and barren all sense of personal disappointment was merged in her desire to prove her affection at that moment silently but with heroic fervour she offered herself up at the shrine of his broken fortunes love friendship good name life itself if need were should be set at naught weighed in a balance against her duty to him they were but as a feather in the scale they sat together as of old their looks were affectionate their talk cheerful it seemed to embrace the future as well as the present and yet to exclude every painful reflection the heart of each bore its own secret without betrayal falkner expected in a few hours to be called upon to expiate with his life the evils he had caused while elizabeth's thoughts wandered to neville now he was reading the fatal narrative now agonized pity for his mother now abhorrence of falkner alternated in his heart her image was cast out or only called up to be associated with the hated name of the destroyer her sensibility was keenly excited how ardently had she prayed how fervently had she believed that he would succeed in establishing his mother's innocence in what high honour she had held his filial piety these things were still the same yet how changed were both towards each other it was impossible that they should ever meet again as formerly ever take counsel together that she should ever be made happy by the reflection that she was his friend and comforter falkner called her attention by a detail of his journey to belleforest and the probability that she would soon have a visit from her aunt here was a new revulsion elizabeth was forced to remember that her name was raby falkner described the majestic beauties of the ancestral seat of her family tried to impress her with the imposing grandeur of its antiquity to interest her in its religion and prejudices to gild the reality of pride and desertion with the false colours of principle and faith he spoke of mrs raby as he had heard her mentioned as a woman of warm feeling strong intellect and extreme generosity elizabeth listened but her eyes were fondly fixed on falkner's face and at last she exclaimed with spontaneous earnestness for all this i am your child and we shall never be divided it was now near midnight at each moment falkner expected a message from the son of his victim he engaged elizabeth to retire to her room that her suspicions might not be excited by the arrival of a visiter at that unaccustomed hour he was glad to see her wholly unsuspicious of what he deemed the inevitable consequence of his confession for though her thoughts evidently wandered and traces of regret clouded her brow it was regret not fear that inspired sadness she tried to cheer to comfort for the past and gain fortitude to meet the future but that future presented no more appalling image than the never seeing gerard neville more she went and he remained waiting and watching the livelong night but no one came the following day passed and the same mysterious silence was observed what could it mean it was impossible to accuse alithea's child of lukewarmness in her cause or want of courage a sort of dark mysterious fear crept over falkner's heart something would be done some vengeance taken in what frightful shape would the ghost of the past haunt him he seemed to scent horror and disgrace in the very winds yet he was spell bound he must await neville's call he must remain as he had promised to offer the atonement demanded he had felt glad and triumphant when he believed that reparation to be his life in the field but the delay was ominous he knew not why but at each ring at the gate each step along the passages of the house his heart grew chill his soul quailed he despised himself for cowardice yet it was not that but he knew that evil was at hand he pitied elizabeth and he shrunk from himself as one doomed to dishonour and unspeakable misery chapter xxxiii on arriving in london from hastings neville had repaired as usual to his father's house which as was to be supposed at that season of the year he found empty on the second day sir boyvill presented himself unexpectedly he looked cold and stern as ever the father and son met as they were wont the latter anticipating rebuke and angry unjust commands the other assuming the lofty tone of legitimate authority indignant at being disputed i hear from sophia said sir boyvill that you are on the point of sailing for america and this without deigning to acquaint me with your purpose is this fair common acquaintances act with more ceremony towards each other i feared your disapproval sir replied neville and thought it less faulty to act without than against a father's consent such is the vulgar notion but a very erroneous one it doubles the injury both to disobey me and to keep me in the dark with regard to my danger but if the danger be only imaginary observed his son sir boyvill replied i am not come to argue with you nor to dissuade nor to issue commands i come with the more humble intention of being instructed sophy though she evidently regrets your purposed journey yet avers that it is not so wild and aimless as your expeditions have hitherto been that the letters from lancaster did lead to some unlooked for disclosure you little know me if you are not aware that i have the question which you debate in so rash and boyish a manner as deeply and more sorely at heart than you let me then hear the tale you have heard surprised and even touched to find his father unbend so far as to listen to him neville related the american's story and the information that it seemed probable that osborne could afford sir boyvill listened attentively and then observed it will be matter of triumph to you gerard to learn that your strange perseverance has a little overcome me you are no longer a mere lad and though inexperienced and headstrong you have shown talents and decision and i am willing to believe though perhaps i am wrong that you are guided by conviction and not by a blind wish to disobey your conduct has been consistent throughout and so far is entitled to respect but you are as i have said and forgive a father for saying so inexperienced a mere child in the world's ways you go straightforward to your object reckless of the remark that you excite and the gall and wormwood that such remark imparts why will you not in some degree be swayed by me our views if you would deign to inquire into mine are not so dissimilar neville knew not what to answer for every reply and explanation were likely to offend hitherto continued sir boyvill in disgust at your wilfulness i have only issued disregarded commands but i am willing to treat my son as my friend if he will let me but it must be on one condition i exact one promise i am ready sir replied neville to enter into any engagement that does not defeat my purpose it is simply said sir boyvill that you shall do nothing without consulting me i on the other hand will promise not to interfere by issuing orders which you will not obey but if there is any sense in your pursuit my counsels may assist i ask no more than to offer advice and to have opportunity afforded me to express my opinion will you not allow that so much is due to me will you not engage to communicate your projects and to acquaint me unreservedly with every circumstance that falls to your knowledge this is the limit of my exactions most willingly i make this promise exclaimed neville it will indeed be my pride to have your participation in my sacred task how far i can afford that replied sir boyvill depends on the conduct you will pursue with regard to this osborne i consent at once that his story should be sifted nay that you should go to america for that purpose while you are ready to engage that you will not act on any information you may gather without my knowledge you may depend said gerard that i will keep to the letter of my promise and i pledge my honour gladly and unreservedly to tell you everything to learn your wishes and to endeavour throughout to act with your approbation this concession made on both sides the father and son conversed on more unreserved and kinder terms than they had ever before done they passed the evening together and though the arrogance the wounded pride the irritated feelings and unredeemed selfishness of sir boyvill betrayed themselves at every moment gerard saw with surprise the weakness masked by so imposing an exterior his angry commands and insulting blame had been used as batteries to defend the accessible part he still loved and regretted alithea he pined to be assured of her truth but he despised himself for these emotions calling them feebleness and credulity he felt assured that his worst suspicions would be proved true she might now be dead he thought it probable that ere this her faults and sorrows were hushed in the grave but had she remained voluntarily one half hour in the power of the man who had carried her from her home no subsequent repentance no remorse no suffering could exculpate her what he feared was the revival of a story so full of dishonour the dragging a mangled half formed tale again before the public which would jeer his credulity and make merry over the new gloss of a time worn subject when such a notion occupied his brain his heart swelled with uncontrollable emotions of pride and indignation neville cared little for the world he thought of his mother's wrongs and sufferings he conjured up the long years which might have been spent in wretchedness he longed whatever she had done to feel her maternal embrace to show his gratitude for her early care of him this was one view one class of emotions present to his mind when any occurrence tended to shake his belief in her unblemished honour and integrity which was the religion of his heart at the same time he as much as his father abhorred that the indifferent and light hearted the levelling and base should have any food administered to their loathsome appetite for slander so far as his father's views were limited to the guarding alithea's name from further discussion neville honoured them he showed sir boyvill that he was not so imprudent as he seemed and brought him at last to allow that some discovery might ensue from his voyage this open hearted and peaceful interchange of sentiment between them was very cheering to both and when gerard visited elizabeth the following day his spirit was lighter and happier than it had ever been and love was there to mingle its roseate visions with the sterner calls of duty he entered falkner's house with much of triumph and more of hope gladdening his heart he left it horror struck aghast and almost despairing he would not return to his father elizabeth's supposition that falkner spoke under a delusion produced by sudden insanity and his reluctance that while doubt hung over the event that her dear name should be needlessly mixed up with the tragedy of his mother's death restrained him he resolved at once to take no final step till the evening till he had again seen elizabeth and learned what foundation there was for the tremendous avowal that still rung in his ears the evening he had mentioned the evening but would it ever come till then he walked in a frightful dream he first went to the docks withdrew his luggage and yet left word that by possibility he might still join the vessel at sheerness he did this for he was glad to give himself something to do and yet soon after how gladly would he have exchanged those hours of suspense for the certainty that too quickly came like a sudden ray of light to show that he had long been walking at the edge of a giddy precipice he received the packet and letter from the servant dizzy and confounded he rode away by the light of the first lamp he read elizabeth's letter it disordered the current of his blood it confused and maddened the functions of reason putting spurs to his horse he galloped furiously on till he reached his father's house sir boyvill was seated solitarily in his drawing room sipping his coffee and indulging in various thought his wedded life with alithea her charms her admirable qualities and sweet endearing disposition occupied him as they had never done before since her flight for the first time the veil woven by anger and vanity fell from his eyes and he saw distinctly the rashness and injustice of his past actions he became convinced that deceit could never have had a part in her did not her child resemble her and was he not truth itself he had nourished an aversion to his son as her offspring now he looked on his virtues as an inheritance derived from his sweet mother and his heart instinctively unaccountably warmed towards both gerard opened the door of the room and looked in sir boyvill could hardly have recognised him his face whiter than marble his eyes wild and wandering his whole countenance convulsed his person shrunk up and writhing he threw the packet on the table crying out victory my father victory in a voice so shrill and dissonant so near a shriek as to inspire his auditor with fear rather than triumph read read he continued i have not yet i keep my word you shall know all even before me and yet i do know all i have seen my mother's destroyer she is dead sir boyvill now in some degree comprehended his son's agitation he saw that he was too much excited to act with any calmness he could not guess how he had discovered the villain on whom both would desire to heap endless unsatiable revenge but he did not wonder that if he had really encountered this man and learned his deeds that he should be transported into a sort of phrensy he took up the packet he cut the string that tied it he turned over the papers and his brow darkened here is a long narrative he said there is much of excuse and much of explanation here the story ought to be short that exculpates her i do not like these varnishings of the simple truth you will find none said neville at least i heard none his words were direct his avowal contained no subterfuge of whom do you speak asked sir boyvill read said neville and you will know more than i but half an hour ago those papers were put into my hands i have not read them i give them to you before i am aware of their contents that i might fully acquit myself of my promise they come from rupert falkner my mother's destroyer leave me then to my task said sir boyvill in an altered and subdued tone you speak of strange things facts to undo a frightful past and to generate a future dedicated to a new revenge leave me let me remain alone while i read while i ponder on what credit i may give what course i must pursue leave me gerard i have long injured you but at last you will be repaid come back in a few hours the moment i am master of the contents of the manuscript i will see you gerard left him he had scarcely been aware of what he was doing when he carried the packet unopened unexamined to his father he had feared that he might be tempted to what to conceal his mother's vindication never yet the responsibility sat heavy on him and driven by an irresistible impulse he had resolved to deprive himself of all power of acting basely by giving at once publicity to all that passed when he had done this he felt as if he had applied a match to some fatal rocket which would carry destruction to the very temple and shrine of his dearest hopes to elizabeth's happiness and life but the deed was done he could but shut his eyes and let the mortal ball proceed towards its destined prey gerard was young he aspired to happiness with all the ardour of youth while we are young we feel as if happiness were the birthright of humanity after a long and cruel apprenticeship we disengage ourselves from this illusion or from a yet more difficult sacrifice the realities that produce felicity for on earth there are such though they are too often linked with adjuncts that make the purchase of them cost in the end peace of mind and a pure conscience thus was it with gerard with elizabeth winning her love and making her his own he felt assured of a life of happiness but to sacrifice his mother's name the holy task to which he had dedicated himself from childhood for the sake of obtaining her it must not be with this thought came destruction to the fresh sprung hopes that adorned his existence gerard's poetic and tender nature led him to form sweet dreams of joys derived from a union which would be cemented by affection sympathy and enthusiastic admiration of the virtues of his companion in elizabeth he had beheld the imbodying of all his wishes in her eyes he had read their accomplishment her love for her father had first awakened his love her wise simple upright train of thinking the sensibility ennobled by self command yet ever ready to spring forth and comfort the unhappy her generosity her total abnegation of self her understanding so just and true yet tempered with feminine aptitude to adapt itself to the situation and sentiments of others all these qualities discovered one by one and made dear by the friendship she displayed towards him had opened the hitherto closed gates of the world's only paradise and now he found that as the poet says evil had entered even there and the trail of the serpent marked with slimy poison the fairest and purest of eden's flowers neville had looked forward to a life of blameless but ecstatic happiness as her friend her protector her husband youth without being presumptuous is often sanguine prodigal of self it expects as of right a full return ready to assist elizabeth in her task of watching over her father's health who in his eyes was wasting gradually away he felt that he should be near to soften her regrets and fill his place and sooth her sinking spirits when struck by a loss which to her would seem so dire and now falkner he believed him to be in a state of health that did not leave him many years to live he recollected him at marseilles stretched on his couch feeble as an infant the hues of death on his brow he thought of him as he had seen him that morning his figure bent by disease his face ashy pale and worn he was the man whom thirteen years before he remembered in upright proud and youthful strength wo and disease had brought on the ravages of age he was struck by premature decay a few years by the course of nature he would be laid in his grave but gerard could not leave him this respite he must at once meet him in such encounter as must end in the death of one of the combatants whichever that might be there was no hope for elizabeth in either case she lost her all in either case falkner would die and an insuperable barrier be raised between her and her only other friend neville's ardent and gentle spirit quivered with agony as he thought of these things oh ye destructive powers of nature he cried come all storm flood and fire mingled in one dire whirlwind or bring the deadlier tortures tyrants have inflicted and martyrs undergone and say can any agony equal that which convulses the human heart when writhing under contending passions torn by contrary purposes this very morning elizabeth was all the universe of hope and joy i would not for worlds have injured one hair of her dear head and now i meditate a deed that is to consign her to eternal grief athwart this tumult of thought came the recollection that he was still in ignorance of the truth he called to mind the narrative which his father was then reading would it reveal aught that must alter the line of conduct which he now considered inevitable a devouring curiosity was awakened leaving his father he had rushed into the open air in obedience to the instinct that always leads the unquiet mind to seek the solace of bodily activity he had hurried into hyde park which then in the dimness of night appeared a wide expanse a limitless waste he hurried to and fro on the turf he saw nothing he was aware of nothing except the internal war that shook him now as he felt the eager desire to get quit of doubt he fancied that several hours must have elapsed and that his father must be waiting for him the clocks of london struck he counted it was but eleven he had been there scarcely more than an hour footnote alas for man said the pitying spirit dearly you pay for your primal fall some flowers of eden you still inherit but the trail of the serpent is over them all paradise and the peri chapter xxxiv neville returned home he paused at the drawing room door a slight noise indicated that his father was within his hand was on the lock but he retreated he would not intrude uncalled for he wandered through the dark empty rooms till a bell rang sir boyvill inquired for him he hurried into his presence he devoured the expression of his countenance with his eyes trying to read the thought within sir boyvill's face was usually stamped with an unvarying expression of cold self possession mingled with sarcasm these feelings were now at their height his aged countenance withered and deep lined was admirably calculated to depict the concentrated disdain that sat upon his lips and elevated his brows he pointed to the papers before him and said in a composed yet hollow voice take these away read for it is necessary you should the amplified confession of the murderer gerard's blood ran cold yet why call it a confession continued sir boyvill his assumed contempt rising into angry scorn from the beginning to the end it is a lie he would varnish over his unparalleled guilt he would shelter himself from its punishment but in vain read gerard read and be satisfied i have wronged your mother she was innocent murdered be assured that her vindication shall be heard as loudly as her accusation and that her destroyer shall die to expiate her death be that my task said gerard trembling and pale from the conflict of passion i take the office of vengeance on myself i will meet mr falkner ha you think of a duel cried his father remember your promise young man i hold you strictly to it you do nothing without first communicating with me you must read these papers before you decide i have decided be not afraid i shall not forestall your purpose i will not challenge the murderer but in return for this pledge give me your word that you have no communication with the villain till you see me again i will not balk you of your revenge be sure of that but you must see me first i promise said gerard and one word more continued sir boyvill is there any possibility of this man's escape is he wrapped in the security which his lie affords or has he even now fled beyond our vengeance be his crimes what they may replied neville i believe him to entertain a delicate sense of worldly honour he has promised to remain in his home till he hears from me he doubtless expects to be challenged and i verily believe desires to die i feel convinced that the idea of flight has not crossed his mind enough good night we are now one gerard united by our love and honour for your wronged mother's memory and by our revenge dissimilar only in this that my desire to repair her injuries is more vehement even than yours sir boyvill pressed his son's hand and left him a few minutes afterward it would seem he quitted the house now to my task thought neville and o thou god who watchest over the innocent and yet gavest the innocent into the hands of the destroyer rule thou the throbbings of my heart that neither mad hate nor hunger for revenge take away my human nature and turn me into a fiend he took up the manuscript at first the words seemed written in fire but he grew calmer as he found how far back the narration went and curiosity succeeding to devouring impatience he became attentive he read and pitied all that awoke sir boyvill's ire falkner's presumption in daring to love and his long cherished constancy excited his compassion when he came to the account of the meeting of the forsaken lover and happy husband he found in the epithets so liberally bestowed in the contemptuous description of his father a cause for his augmented desire for vengeance when he read that his mother herself repined herself spoke disparagingly of her husband he wondered at the mildness of sir boyvill's expressions with regard to her and began to suspect that some strange and appalling design must be working in his head to produce this unnatural composure the rest was madness madness and misery thus to take a wife and mother from her home to gratify the insane desire to exert for one half hour a power he had lost for ever the vain hope of turning her from her duties which at least as far as her children were concerned were the dearest part of herself her terror her incapacity of mastering her alarm the night of insensibility which she passed in the hut with a start gerard felt sure that he had seen and marked that very spot all wrought him up to the height of breathless interest till when he read the sad end of all cold dew gathered on his brow the tears that filled his eyes changed to convulsive sobbings and despite his manhood he wept with the agony of a child he ended the tale and he thought yes there is but one termination to this tragedy i must avenge my sweet mother and by the death of falkner proclaim her innocence but wherefore it came across his mind had his father called him murderer in intention and very deed he was none why term the narrative a lie he followed it word by word and felt that truth was stamped in every line the house was still it was two in the morning had his father retired to rest he had been so absorbed by his occupation that he had heard no sound knew nothing that might have been passing around he remembered at last sir boyvill's good night and believing as all was hushed that all slept he retired to his own room he could not think of elizabeth or of the projected duel he could think only of the narrative he had read when in bed unable to sleep he rose lighted his candle and read much of it again he pondered over every word in the concluding pages it was all true he would have staked his existence on the accuracy of every word was it not stamped on falkner's brow as he had seen him but a few hours ago sad and worn with grief and suffering but without the stain of concealed guilt lofty in its very wo it was break of day just as gerard was thinking of rising to find and consult with his father that sleep crept unawares over him sleep will visit the young unbidden he had suffered so much fatigue of mind and body that nature sought relief sleep at first disturbed but soon profound and refreshing steeped his distracted thoughts in peace his wearied limbs in delightful repose the morning was far advanced when he awoke refreshed ready to meet the necessities of the hour grieved but composed sad but strengthened and resolved he inquired for his father and heard to his infinite astonishment that he had left town he had set out in his travelling carriage at four that morning a note from him was put into neville's hands it contained few words remember your engagement that you take no steps with regard to mr falkner till you have seen me i am setting out for dromore on my return which will be speedy i will communicate my wishes to which i do not doubt you will accede neville was startled he guessed at once sir boyvill's aim in the sudden journey but was he not a fit partner in such an act ought he not to share in the duty of rendering honour to his mother's grave he felt that he ought to be at his father's side and ordering his own chariot set out with the hope of overtaking him but sir boyvill travelled with equal speed and was many miles and many hours in advance gerard hoped to come up with him when he stopped at night but the old gentleman was so eager in his pursuit that he prosecuted his journey without rest gerard continued in the same way travelling alone he revolved again and again all that must be all that might have been whatever happened he was divided from elizabeth for ever did she love him he had scarcely questioned the return his affection would one day meet till now that he had lost her for ever and like a true lover earnestly desirous to preserve some property in her he loved he cherished the hope that she would share his deep regrets and so prove that in heart they were one how pleasant were the days they had passed at oakly all his sorrows there and his passionate desire to unveil the mystery of his mother's fate how had it given an interest to each hour and imparted an untold and most sweet grace to the loved elizabeth that she should sympathize with so much fervour and kindness how strange the chance that led the daughter of the destroyer to share the feelings of the unhappy victim's son yet stranger still that destroyer had a child rambling among many tangled thoughts gerard started when first this idea suggested itself where was falkner's boasted fidelity on which he laid claim to compassion and pardon where his assertion that all his soul was centred in alithea and this child an angel from her birth was even then born to him he opened the writing case which contained the papers and which he carried with him he referred to them for explanation yes elizabeth then lived and was not far from him her hand had staid his arm raised against his life it was not enough that the phrensy of passion urged him to tear alithea from her home and children but even the existence of his own daughter was no restraint he was willing to doom her from very childhood to a partnership in guilt and misery hitherto despite all and in despite of his resolve to meet him in mortal encounter neville had pitied falkner but now his heart grew hard against him he began to revolve thoughts similar to those expressed by sir boyvill and to call elizabeth's father an impostor his tale a lie he reread the manuscript with a new feeling of skepticism this time he was against the writer he detected exaggeration where before he had only found the energy of passion he saw an attempt to gloss over guilt where before he had read merely the struggles of conscience the innate innocence of profound feeling combating with the guilt which circumstances may impart to our loftiest emotions his very sufferings became but the just visitation of angry heaven he was a wretch whom to kill were mercy and elizabeth beautiful generous and pure was his child chapter xxxv that night was spent in travelling and without any sleep neville saw the day break in melancholy guise struggling with the clouds with which a southeast wind veiled the sky nature looked bleak and desolate even though she was still dressed in her summer garments it was only the latter end of august but so changeable is our climate that the bright festive days which he had lately enjoyed in sussex were already followed by chill and dreary precursors of the year's decline gerard reached dromore at about noon he learned that his father had arrived during the night he had slept a few hours but was already gone out it appeared that he had ridden over to a neighbour mr ashley for he had inquired if he were in the county and had with his groom both on horseback taken the road that led toward his house neville hastily took some refreshment while he ordered a horse to be saddled his heart led him to seek and view a spot which he had once before visited and which seemed accurately described in falkner's narrative he left behind him the woods of dromore and the foldings of the green hills in which it was situated he descended towards the barren dreary shore the roar of ocean soon met his ear and he reached the waste sands that border that melancholy coast he saw the line of sand hills which formed a sort of bulwark against the tide he reached at length a rapid yet shallow stream which was but about twenty yards wide flowing over a rough bottom of pebbles the eye easily reached its utmost depth it could not be more than two feet could that be the murderous furious estuary in which his mother had been borne away he looked across there stood the hut there the moss grown leafless oak and gathered round it was a crowd of men his father and two or three other gentlemen on horseback were stationed near while some labourers were throwing up the sand beneath the withered trunk when we have long thought of and grieved over an incident if any outward object bring the image of our thoughts bodily before us it is strange what an accession of emotion stirs the depths of the heart for many hours neville's mind had dwelt upon the scene in all its parts the wild waste sea dark and purple beneath the lowering clouds the dreary extent of beach the far stupendous mountains thrown up in sublime irregular grandeur with cloud capped peaks and vast gulfs between a sort of cyclopean screen to the noble landscape which they encompassed with their wide majestic extent his reflections had selected the smaller objects the river the hut the monumental tree and it seemed as if actual vision could not bring it home more truly but when he actually beheld these objects and the very motive of his coming was revealed as it were by the occupation of the men at work his young heart unhardened by many sufferings sickened the tears rushed into his eyes and the words oh my mother burst from his lips it was a spasm of uncontrollable pain an instant afterward he had mastered it and guiding his horse through the ford with tranquil mien though pale and sad he took his station abreast with his father sir boyvill turned as he rode up he manifested no surprise but he looked thankful and even triumphant gerard thought and the young man himself as he contemplated the glazed eyes and attenuated form of his parent which spoke of the weight of years despite his still upright carriage and the stern expression of his face felt that his right place was at his side to render the support of his youthful strength and active faculties the men went on with their work in silence nor did any speak the sand was thrown up in heaps the horses pawed the ground impatiently and the hollow murmurs of the neighbouring breakers filled every pause with sound but no voice spoke or if one of the labourers had a direction to give it was done in whispers at length some harder substance opposed their progress and they worked more cautiously mingled with sand they threw out pieces of dark substance like cloth or silk and at length got out of the wide long trench they had been opening with one consent though in silence every one gathered nearer and looked in they saw a human skeleton the action of the elements which the sands had not been able to impede had destroyed every vestige of a human frame except those discoloured bones and long tresses of dark hair which were wound around the scull a universal yet suppressed groan burst from all gerard felt inclined to leap into the grave but the thought of the many eyes all gazing acted as a check and a second instinctive feeling of pious reverence induced him to unfasten his large black horseman's cloak and to cast it over the opening sir boyvill then broke the silence you have done well my son let no man lift that covering or in any way disturb the remains beneath do you know my friends who lies there do you remember the night when mrs neville was carried off the country was raised but we sought for her in vain on that night she was murdered and was buried here a hollow murmur ran through the crowd already augmented by several stragglers who had heard that something strange was going on all pressed forward though but to see the cloak now become an object of curiosity and interest several remembered the lady whose mouldered remains were thus revealed in the pride of youth and beauty warm of heart kind beloved and this was all left of her these unseemly bones were all earth had to show of the ever sweet alithea mr ashley kindly assists me continued sir boyvill we are both magistrates the coroner is already sent for a jury will be summoned when that duty is performed the remains of my unfortunate much wronged wife will be fitly interred these ceremonies are necessary for the punishment of the murderer we know him he cannot escape and you every one of you will rejoice in that vengeance which will be mine at last execrations against the villain burst from every lip yet even then each eye turned from old sir boyvill whose vindictive nature had been showed before towards the hapless victim herself to the young man the son whose grief and pious zeal had been the theme of many a gossip's story and who now pale and mute as he was showed in his intent and wo struck gaze more true touch of natural sorrow than sir boyvill's wordy harangue could denote we must appoint constables to guard this place said sir boyvill mr ashley assented the proper arrangements were made the curious were to be kept off and two servants from dromore were added to the constables then the gentlemen rode off neville bewildered desirous to stay to look once again on what had been his mother yet averse to the vulgar gaze followed them at a slower pace till mr ashley taking leave of sir boyvill rode away and he perceived that his father was waiting for him and that he must join him thank you my son said sir boyvill for your zeal and timely arrival i expected it of you we are one now one to honour your mother one in our revenge you will not this time refuse your evidence do you then believe that mr falkner is actually a murderer cried neville let the laws of his country decide on that question replied sir boyvill with a sneering laugh i bring forward the facts only you do the same let the laws of his country and a jury of his equals acquit or condemn him your design then is to bring him to a trial asked gerard i should have thought that the publicity i design cried sir boyvill with uncontrolled passion to bring him to a fate more miserable than his victim's and i thank all seeing heaven which places such ample revenge in my hands he will die by the hands of the hangman and i shall be satisfied there was something horrible in the old man's look and voice he gloated on the foul disgrace about to be heaped on his enemy the chivalrous notions of gerard a duel between the destroyer and his victim's son was a paltry trifling vengeance compared with the ignominy he contemplated was not the accusation against your mother loud continued sir boyvill public universal did not the assembled parliament pronounce upon her guilt and decree her shame and shall her exculpation be hushed up and private i court publicity a less august tribunal but one whose decisions are no less widely circulated shall proclaim her innocence this idea alone would decide my course if i could so far unman my soul as to forget that vengeance is due let it decide yours if so much milk still mingle with your blood that it sicken at the thought of justice against a felon transported by rage sir boyvill sought for words bitter and venomous enough to convey his meaning and neville discerned at once how much he was incensed by the language used with regard to him in falkner's manuscript wounded vanity sought to ape injured feelings in such petty selfish passions gerard could take no share and he observed mr falkner is a gentleman i confess that his narration has won belief from me his crime dressed in his own words is frightful enough and heavily if it be left to me shall i visit it but the plan you adopt is too discordant with the habits of persons of our rank of life for me to view it without aversion there is another which i prefer adopting you mean replied sir boyvill that you would challenge him risk your life on the chance of taking his pardon me i can by no means acquiesce in the propriety of such an act i look on the wrongs he has done us as depriving him of the right to be treated with courtesy nor do i wish him to add the death of my only son to the list of the injuries i have sustained the old man paused his lip quivered his voice dropped neville fancied that tenderness of feeling caused these indications he was deceived his father continued i am endeavouring so far to command myself as to speak with moderation it is difficult to find words to express implacable hatred so let that go by and let us talk since you can and believe doubtless that i ought calmly and reasonably you would challenge this villain this gentleman as you name him you would put your life on a par with his he murdered your mother and to repay me you would die by the same hand if you speak the truth if he possess a spark of those feelings which as a soldier you have a right to believe may animate him do you think that he would return your fire he raves about remorse in that tissue of infamous falsehoods which you put into my hands if he be human he must have some touch of that and he could not if he would raise his weapon against the child of poor alithea he will therefore refuse to meet you or meeting you refuse to fire and either it will end in a farce for the amusement of the world or you will shoot a defenceless man i do not see the mercy of this proceeding of that sir said neville we must take our chance i will take no chance cried his father my unfortunate wife was borne off forcibly from her home you can bear witness to that two men carried her away and no tidings ever again reached us of her fate and now one of these men the arch criminal chooses to gloss over these circumstances events as pleases him tells his own story giving it such graces of style as may dupe the inexperienced and we are to rest satisfied and say it is so the absurdity of such conduct would mark us as madmen enough of this i have reasoned with you as if the decision lay with me when in fact i have no voice on the subject it is out of my hands i have made it over to the law and we can but stand by and view its course i believe and before heaven and your country you must assert the same that the remains we have uncovered are all that is left us of your lost mother the clandestine burial at once declares the guilt of murder such must be the opinion of impartial judges if i mistake not i can interfere no further the truth will be sifted by three juries this is no hole and corner vengeance let our enemy escape in god's name if they acquit him but if he be guilty then let him die as i believe he will a felon's death sir boyvill looked on his son with glassy eyes but a sneering lip that spoke of the cruel triumph he desired there is ravenglass he added there the coroner is summoned there the court meets we go to give our deposition we shall not lie nor pervert facts we tell who it was revealed to us your mother's unknown grave it rests with them to decide whether he who by his own avowal placed her therein has not the crime of murder on his soul chapter xxxvi sir boyvill quickened his pace neville followed he was still the same being who in his youth had been driven to the verge of insanity by the despotism of his father his free and feeling heart revolted from arbitrary commands and selfishness it was not only that his thoughts flew back wounded and sore to elizabeth and figured her agony but he detested the fierce and vulgar revenge of his father it is true that he had seen falkner and in the noble though tarnished grandeur of his countenance he had read the truth of the sad tale he related and he could not treat him with the contempt sir boyvill evinced to whom he was an image of the mind unseen unfelt and then falkner had loved his mother nay more she as a sister had loved him and faulty and cruel as had been his return for her kindness he through her was endued with sacredness in his eyes to oppose these softening feelings came a sort of rage that elizabeth was his child that through him a barrier was raised to separate him from the chosen friend of his heart the one sweet angel who had first whispered peace to his soul the struggle was violent he did not see how he could refuse his evidence at the inquest already summoned in every way his motives might be misunderstood and his mother's fame might suffer this idea became the victor he would do all that he was called upon to do to exculpate her the rest he must leave to the mysterious guidance of providence he arrived at the poverty stricken town of ravenglass the legal authorities were assembled and while preliminaries were being arranged he was addressed by sir boyvill's solicitor who asked him to relate what he knew that his legal knowledge might assist in framing his evidence briefly and conclusively neville recounted his story simply confining himself as much as possible to the bare outline of the facts the man of law was evidently struck by the new turn he gave to the tale for sir boyvill had unhesitatingly accused falkner of murder this falkner he said had concealed himself for the space of thirteen years till his accomplice osborne was discovered and till he heard of gerard's perseverance in sifting the truth then fearful the tale might be disclosed in america he came forward with his own narrative which glossed over the chief crime and yet by revealing the burial place of his victim at once demonstrated the truth of the present accusation it is impossible that the facts could have occurred as he represents them plausible as his account is could a woman as timid as alithea have rushed on certain death as he describes why should she have crossed the stream in its fury a bare half mile would have carried her to a cottage where she had been safe from falkner's pursuit what lady in a well known country where every face she met must prove a friend but would not have betaken herself to the nearest village instead of to an estuary renowned for danger the very wetting her feet in a brook had terrified her never could she have encountered the roar of waves sufficient to overwhelm and destroy her such were the observations of sir boyvill and though gerard by his simple assertion that he believed falkner's tale somewhat staggered the solicitor yet he could not banish his notion that a trial was the inevitable and best mode of bringing the truth to light the jury were now met and sir boyvill gave such a turn to his evidence as at once impressed them unfavourably towards the accused in melancholy procession they visited poor alithea's grave a crowd of country people were collected about it they did not dare touch the cloak but gazed on it with curiosity and grief many remembered mrs neville and their rude exclamations showed how deeply they felt her injuries when i was ill said an old woman she gave me medicine with her own hand when my son james was lost at sea said another she came to comfort me and brought young master gerard and cried bless her when she saw me take on rich and grand as she was she cried for poor james and that she should be there now my dear mistress cried another never did she speak a harsh word to me but for her i could not have married if she had lived i had never known sorrow execrations against the murderer followed these laments the arrival of the jury caused a universal murmur the crowd was driven back the cloak lifted from the grave the men looked in the scull bound by her long hair hair whose colour and luxuriance many remembered attracted peculiar observation the women as they saw it wept aloud fragments of her dress were examined which yet retained a sort of identity as silk or muslin though stained and colourless as farther proof among the bones were found a few ornaments among them on the skeleton hand was her wedding ring with two others both of which were sworn to by sir boyvill as belonging to his wife no doubt could exist concerning the identity of the remains it was sacrilege to gaze on them a moment longer than was necessary while each beholder as they contemplated so much beauty and excellence reduced to a small heap of bones abhorrent to the eye imbibed a heartfelt lesson on the nothingness of life stout hearted men wept and each bosom glowed with hatred against her destroyer after a few moments the cloak was again extended the crowd pressed nearer the jury retired and returned to ravenglass neville's evidence was only necessary to prove the name and residence of the assassin there was no hesitation about the verdict that of wilful murder against falkner was unhesitatingly pronounced a warrant issued for his apprehension and proper officers despatched to execute it the moment that the verdict was delivered sir boyvill and his son rode back to dromore mr ashley and the solicitor accompanied them and all the ordinary mechanism of life which intrudes so often for our good so to justle together discordant characters and wear off poignant impressions now forced neville who was desirous to give himself up to meditation to abide for several hours in the society of these gentlemen there was a dinner to be eaten mr ashley partook of it and gerard felt that his absence would be indecorous after dinner he was put to a trial more severe to a sensitive imaginative mind than any sharp strokes of commonplace adversity he was minutely questioned as to the extent of his acquaintance with falkner how he came to form it how often he had seen him and what had drawn confession from him they named the criminal these inquiries had been easily answered but that the name of elizabeth must be introduced and as he expected at the mention of a daughter a world of inquiry followed and coarse remarks fell from his father's lips which harrowed up his soul while he felt that he had no exculpation to offer nor any explanation that might take from her the name and association of the child of a murderer as soon as he could he burst away he rushed into the open air and hurried to the spot where he could best combat with and purify the rebellious emotions of his heart none but the men placed as watch were near his mother's grave seeing the young squire they retreated and he who had come on foot at such quick pace that he scarcely felt the ground he trod threw himself on the sands grateful to find himself alone with nature the moon was hurrying on among the clouds now bright in the clear ether now darkened by heavy masses and the mirroring ocean was sometimes alive with sparkling silver now veiled and dim so that you could hear but not see the breaking of the surge an eloquent author has said in contempt of such a being try to conceive a man without the ideas of god and eternity of the good the true the beautiful and the infinite neville was certainly not such there was poetry in his very essence and enthusiasm for the ideal of the excellent gave his character a peculiar charm to any one equally exalted and refined his mother's decaying form lay beneath the sands on which he was stretched death was there in its most hideous form beauty and even form had deserted that frame work which once was the dear being whose caresses so warm and fond it yet often thrilled him to remember he had demanded from heaven the revelation of his mother's fate here he found it here in the narrow grave lay the evidence of her virtues and her death did he thank heaven even while he did he felt with bitterness that the granting of his prayer was inextricably linked with the ruin of a being as good and fair as she whose honour he had so earnestly desired to vindicate he thought of all the sordid vulgar but heart thrilling misery which by his means was brought on elizabeth and he sought his heart for excuses for the success for which he had pined they came ready no desire of vulgar vengeance had been his his motives had been exalted his conduct straightforward the divine stamp on woman is her maternal character it was to prove that his idolized mother had not deserted the first and most sacred duty in the world that had urged him and he could not foresee that the innocent would suffer through his inquiries the crime must fall on its first promoter on falkner's head must be heaped the consequences of his act all else were guiltless these reflections however only served to cheat his wound of its pain for a time again other thoughts recurred the realities the squalid realities of the scene in which she miserable was about to take a part the thief takers and the gyves the prison and the public ignominious trial falkner was to be subjected to all these indignities and he well knew that his daughter would not leave his side and i her son the offspring of these sainted bones placed here by him how can i draw near his child god have mercy on her for man will have none still he could not be satisfied surely he thought something can be done and something i will do already men are gone who are to tear him from his home and to deliver him up to all those vile contrivances devised for the coercion of the lowest of mankind she will accompany him while i must remain here to morrow these remains will be conveyed to our house on the following day they are to be interred in the family vault and i must be present i am tied forced to inaction the privilege of free action taken from me hope was awakened however as he pursued these thoughts and recollected the generous kindly disposition of lady cecil and her attachment to her young friend he determined to write to her he felt assured that she would do all in her power to alleviate elizabeth's sufferings what she could do he did not well understand but it was a relief to him to take some step for the benefit of the devoted daughter bitterly as he thought of these things did he regret that he had ever seen elizabeth so complicated was the web of event that he knew not how to wish any event to have occurred differently except that he had not trusted to the hollow pretences of his father he saw at once how the generous and petty minded can never coalesce he ought to have acted for himself by himself and miserable as in any case the end must have been he felt that his own open honourable revenge would have been less cruel in its effects than the malicious pursuit of his vindictive father chapter xxxvii there is an impatient spirit in the young that will not suffer them to take into consideration the pauses that occur between events that which they do not see move they believe to be stationary falkner was surprised by the silence of several days on the part of neville but he did not the less expect and prepare for the time when he should be called upon to render an account for the wrong he had done elizabeth on the contrary deemed that the scene was closed the curtain fallen what more could arise neville had obtained assurance of the innocence and miserable end of his mother in some manner this would be declared to the world but the echo of such a voice would not penetrate the solitude in which she and her guardian were hereafter to live silence and exclusion were the signal and seal of discovered guilt other punishment she did not expect the name of falkner had become abhorrent to all who bore any relationship to the injured alithea she had bid an eternal adieu to the domestic circle at oakly to the kind and frank hearted lady cecil and with her to gerard his mind fraught with a thousand virtues his heart whose sensibility had awoke her tenderness were shut irrevocably against her did she love gerard this question never entered her own mind she felt but did not reason on her emotions elizabeth was formed to be alive to the better part of love her enthusiasm gave ideality her affectionate disposition warmth to all her feelings she loved falkner and that with so much truth and delicacy yet fervour of passion that scarcely could her virgin heart conceive a power more absolute a tie more endearing than the gratitude she had vowed to him yet she intimately felt the difference that existed between her deep rooted attachment for him she named and looked on as her father and the spring of playful happy absorbing emotions that animated her intercourse with neville to the one she dedicated her life and services she watched him as a mother may a child a smile or cheerful tone of voice was warmth and gladness to her anxious bosom and she wept over his misfortunes with the truest grief but there was more of the genuine attachment of mind for mind in her sentiment for neville falkner was gloomy and self absorbed elizabeth might grieve for but she found it impossible to comfort him with gerard it was far otherwise elizabeth had opened in his soul an unknown spring of sympathy to relieve the melancholy which had hitherto overwhelmed him with her he gave way freely to the impulses of a heart which longed to mingle its hitherto checked stream of feeling with other and sweeter waters in every way he excited her admiration as well as kindness the poetry of his nature suggested expressions and ideas at once varied and fascinating he led her to new and delightful studies by unfolding to her the pages of the poets of her native country with which she was little conversant except shakspeare and milton she knew nothing of english poetry the volumes of chaucer and spenser of ancient date of pope gray and burns and in addition the writings of a younger but divine race of poets were all opened to her by him in music also he became her teacher she was a fine musician of the german school he introduced her to the simpler graces of song and brought her the melodies of moore so married to immortal verse that they can only be thought of conjointly oh the happy days of oakly how had each succeeding hour been gilded by the pleasures of a nascent passion of the existence of which she had never before dreamed and these were fled for ever it was impossible to feel assured of so sad a truth and not to weep over the miserable blight elizabeth commanded herself to appear cheerful but sadness crept over her solitary hours she felt that the world had grown from being a copy of paradise into a land of labour and disappointment where self approbation was to be gained through self sacrifice and duty and happiness became separate instead of united objects at which to aim from such thoughts she took refuge in the society of falkner she loved him so truly that she forgot her personal regrets she forgot even neville when with him her affection for her benefactor was not a stagnant pool mantled over by memories existing in the depths of her soul but giving no outward sign it was a fresh spring of overflowing love it was redundant with all the better portion of our nature gratitude admiration and pity for ever fed it as from a perennial fountain it was on a day the fifth after the disclosure of falkner that she had been taking her accustomed ride and as she rode given herself up to those reveries now enthusiastic now drooping and mournful that sprung from her singular and painful position she returned home eager to forget in falkner's society many a rebel thought and to drive away the image of her younger friend by gazing on the wasted sinking form of her benefactor in whose singularly noble countenance she ever found new cause to devote her fortunes and her heart to say that he was not less than archangel ruined is not to express the peculiar interest of falkner's appearance thus had he seemed perhaps thirteen years before at treby but gentle and kindly sentiments the softening intercourse of elizabeth the improvement of his intellect and the command he had exercised over the demonstration of passion had moulded his face into an expression of benevolence and sweetness joined to melancholy thoughtfulness an abstracted but not sullen seriousness that rendered it interesting to every beholder since his confession to neville since the die was cast and he had delivered himself up to his fate to atone for his victim something more was added exalted resolution and serene lofty composure had replaced his usual sadness and the passions of his soul which had before deformed his handsome lineaments now animated them with a beauty of mind which struck elizabeth at once with tenderness and admiration now longing to behold to contemplate this dear face and to listen to a voice that always charmed her out of herself and made her forget her sorrows she was disappointed to find his usual sitting room empty it appeared even as if the furniture had been thrown into disorder there were marks of several dirty feet upon the carpet on the half written letter that lay on the desk the pen had hastily been thrown blotting it elizabeth wondered a little but the emotion was passing away when the head servant came into the room and informed her that his master had gone out and would not return that night not to night exclaimed elizabeth what has happened who have been here two men miss men gentlemen no miss not gentlemen and my father went away with them yes miss replied the man he did indeed he would not take the carriage he went in a hired post chaise he ordered me to tell you miss that he would write directly and let you know when you might expect him strange very strange is this thought elizabeth she did not know why she should be disturbed but disquiet invaded her mind she felt abandoned and forlorn and as the shades of evening gathered round even desolate she walked from room to room she looked from the window the air was chill and from the east yet she repaired to the garden she felt restless and miserable what could the event be that took falkner away she pondered vainly the most probable conjecture was that he obeyed some summons from her own relations at length one idea rushed into her mind and she returned to the house and rang for the servant falkner's wandering life had prevented his having any servant of long tried fidelity about him but this man was good hearted and respectable he felt for his young mistress and consulted with her maid as to the course they should take under the present painful circumstances and had concluded that they should preserve silence as to what had occurred leaving her to learn it from their master's expected letter yet the secret was in some danger when fixing her eyes on him elizabeth said tell me truly have you no guess what this business is that has taken your master away the man looked confused but like many persons not practised in the art of cross questioning elizabeth balked herself by adding another inquiry before the first was answered saying with a faltering voice are you sure thompson that it was not a challenge a duel the domestic's face cleared up quite certain miss it was no duel it could not be the men were not gentlemen then thought elizabeth as she dismissed the man i will no longer torment myself it is evidently some affair of mere business that has called him away i shall learn all to morrow yet the morrow and the next day came and falkner neither wrote nor returned like all persons who determine to conjecture no more elizabeth's whole time was spent in endeavouring to divine the cause of his prolonged absence and strange silence had any communication from neville occasioned his departure was he sent for to point out his victim's grave that idea carried some probability with it and elizabeth's thoughts flew fast to picture the solitary shore and the sad receptacle of beauty and love would falkner and neville meet at such an hour without a clew to guide her she wandered for ever in a maze of thought and each hour added to her disquietude she had not gone beyond the garden for several days she was fearful of being absent when anything might arise but nothing occurred and the mystery became more tantalizing and profound on the third day she could endure the suspense no longer she ordered horses to be put to the carriage and told the servant of her intention to drive into town and to call on falkner's solicitor to learn if he had any tidings that he was ill she felt assured where and how away from her perhaps deserted by all the world the idea of his sick bed became intolerably painful she blamed herself for her inaction she resolved not to rest till she saw her father again thompson knew not what to say he hesitated begged her not to go the truth hovered on his lips yet he feared to give it utterance elizabeth saw his confusion it gave birth to a thousand fears and she exclaimed what frightful event are you concealing tell me at once great god why this silence is my father dead no indeed miss said the man but my master is not in london he is a long way off i heard he was taken to carlisle taken to carlisle why taken what do you mean there was a charge against him miss thompson continued hesitating at every word the men who came they apprehended him for murder murder echoed his auditress then they fought gerard is killed the agony of her look made thompson more explicit it was no duel he said it was done many years ago it was a lady who was murdered a mrs or lady neville elizabeth smiled a painful yet a genuine smile so glad was she to have her worst fears removed so futile did the accusation appear the smile passed away as she thought of the ignominy the disgraceful realities of such a process of falkner torn from his home imprisoned a mark for infamy weak minds are stunned by a blow like this while the stronger rise to the level of the exigency and grow calm from the very call made upon their courage elizabeth might weep to remember past or anticipated misfortunes but she was always calm when called upon to decide and act her form seemed to dilate her eyes flashed with a living fire her whole countenance beamed with lofty and proud confidence in herself why did you not tell me this before' she exclaimed what madness possessed you to keep me in ignorance how much time has been lost order the horses i must begone at once and join my father he is in jail miss said thompson i beg your pardon but you had better see some friend before you go i must decide upon that replied elizabeth let there be no delay on your part you have caused too much but the bell rings did i not hear wheels perhaps he is returned she rushed to the outer door she believed that it was her father returned the garden gate opened two ladies entered one was lady cecil in a moment elizabeth felt herself embraced by her warm hearted friend she burst into tears this is kind more than kind she exclaimed and you bring good news do you not my father is liberated and all is again well chapter xxxviii the family of raby must be considered collectively as each member united in one feeling and acted on one principle they were catholics and never forgot it they were not bent on proselytism on the contrary they rather shunned admitting strangers into their circle but they never ceased to remember that they belonged to the ancient faith of the land and looked upon their fidelity to the tenets of their ancestors as a privilege and a distinction far more honourable than a patent of nobility surrounded by protestants and consequently as they believed by enemies it was the aim of their existence to keep their honour unsullied and that each member of the family should act for the good and glory of the whole unmindful of private interests and individual affections the result of such a system may be divined the pleasures of mediocrity toiling merit the happy home the cheerful family union where smiles glitter brighter than gold all these were unknown or despised young hearts were pitilessly crushed young hopes blighted without remorse the daughters were doomed for the most part to the cloister the sons to foreign service this indeed was not to be attributed entirely to the family failing a few years ago english catholics were barred out from every road to emolument and distinction in their native country edwin raby had thus been sacrificed his enlightened mind disdained the trammels thrown over it but his apostacy doomed him to become an outcast he had previously been the favourite and hope of his parents from the moment that he renounced his religion he became the opprobrium his name was never mentioned and his death hailed as a piece of good fortune that freed his family from a living disgrace the only person among them who regretted him was the wife of his eldest brother she had appreciated his talents and virtues and had entertained a sincere friendship for him but even she renounced him her heart naturally warm and noble was narrowed by prejudice but while she acted in conformity with the family principle she suffered severely from the shock thus given to her better feelings when edwin died her eyes were a little opened she began to suspect that human life and human suffering deserved more regard than articles of belief the late remorse of love was awakened and she never wholly forgot the impression she had not been consulted concerning she knew nothing of his widow and orphan child young at that time the weight of authority pressed also on her and she had been bred to submission there was a latent energy however in her character that developed itself as she grew older her husband died and her consequence increased in old oswi raby's eyes by degrees her authority became paramount it was greatly regulated by the prejudices and systems cherished by the family as far as regarded the world in general but it was softened in her own circle by the influence of the affections her daughters were educated at home not one was destined for the cloister her only son was brought up at eton the privileges granted of late years to the catholics made her entertain the belief that it was no longer necessary to preserve the old defences and fortifications which intolerance had forced its victims to institute still pride pride of religion pride of family pride in an unblemished name were too deeply rooted too carefully nurtured not to form an integral part of her character when a letter from her father in law revealed to her the existence of elizabeth her heart warmed towards the orphan and deserted daughter of edwin she felt all the repentance which duties neglected bring on a well regulated mind her pride revolted at the idea that a daughter of the house of raby was dependant on the beneficence of a stranger she resolved that no time should be lost in claiming and receiving her even while she trembled to think of how brought up as an alien she might prove rather a burden than an acquisition she had written to make inquiries as to her niece's abode she heard that she was on a visit at lady cecil's at hastings mrs raby was at tunbridge she instantly ordered horses and proceeded to oakly on the morning of her visit lady cecil had received a letter from gerard it was incoherent and had been written by snatches in the carriage on his way to dromore its first words proclaimed his mother's innocence and the acknowledgment of her wrongs by sir boyvill himself as he went on his pen lingered he trembled to write the words our friend our elizabeth is the daughter of the destroyer it was unnatural it was impossible the very thought added acrimony to his detestation of falkner it prevented the compassion his generous nature would otherwise have afforded and yet roused every wish to spare him as much as he might be spared for his heroic daughter's sake he felt deceived trepanned doomed in after life we are willing to compromise with fate to take the good with the bad and are satisfied if we can at all lighten the burden of life in youth we aim at completeness and perfection ardent and single minded neville disdained prejudices and his impulse was to separate the idea of father and daughter and to cherish elizabeth as a being totally distinct from her parentage but she would not yield to this delusion she would cling to her father and if he died by his hand he would for ever become an object of detestation well has alfieri said there is no struggle so vehement as when an upright but passionate heart is divided between inclination and duty neville's soul was set upon honour and well doing never before had he found the execution of the dictates of his conscience so full of bitterness and impatience something of these feelings betrayed themselves in his letter we have lost elizabeth he wrote for ever lost her is there no help for this no help for her none she clings to the destroyer's side and shares his miserable fate lost to happiness to the innocence and sunshine of life she will live a victim and die a martyr to her duties and she is lost to us for ever lady cecil read again and again she wondered she grieved she uttered impatient reproaches against gerard for having sought the truth and yet her heart was with him and she rejoiced in the acknowledged innocence of alithea she thought of elizabeth with the deepest grief had they never met had she and gerard never seen each other neither had loved and half this wo had been spared how strange and devious are the ways of fate how difficult to resign one's self to its mysterious and destructive course naturally serene though vivacious kind hearted but not informed with trembling insensibility yet so struck was lady cecil by the prospects of misery for those she best loved that she wept bitterly and wrung her hands in impatient impotent despair at this moment mrs raby was announced mrs raby had something of the tragedy queen in her appearance she was tall and dignified in person her black full eyes were melancholy her brow shadowing them over had a world of thought and feeling in its sculpture like lines the lower part of her face harmonized though something of pride lurked about her beautiful mouth her voice was melodious but deep toned her manners had not the ease of the well bred lady cecil something of the outcast was imprinted upon them which imparted consciousness reserve and alternate timidity and haughtiness there was nothing embarrassed however in her mien and she asked at once for elizabeth with obvious impatience she heard that she was gone with regret the praises lady cecil almost involuntarily showered on her late guest at once dissipated this feeling and caused her with all the frankness natural to her to unfold at once the object of her visit the parentage of the orphan the discovery of her niece lady cecil clasped her hands in a transport which was not all joy there was so much of wonder almost of disbelief at the strange tale had a fairy's wand operated the change it had not been more magical in her eyes heaven's ways were vindicated all of evil vanished from the scene her friend snatched from ignominy and crime to be shrined for ever in their hearts and love she poured out these feelings impetuously mrs raby was well acquainted with alithea's story and was familiar with gerard neville's conduct all that she now heard was strange indeed she did not imbibe any of lady cecil's gladness but much of her eagerness it became of paramount importance in her mind to break at once the link between elizabeth and her guardian before the story gained publicity and the name of raby became mingled in a tale of horror and crime which to the peculiar tone of mrs raby's mind was singularly odious and disgraceful no time must be lost elizabeth must be claimed must at once leave the guilty and tainted one while yet her name received no infection or she would be disowned for ever by her father's family when lady cecil learned mrs raby's intention of proceeding to london to see her niece she resolved to go also to act as mediator and to soften the style of the demands made even while she persuaded elizabeth to submit to them she expressed her intention and the ladies agreed to travel together both were desirous of further communication lady cecil wished to interest mrs raby still more deeply in her matchless kinswoman's splendid qualities of heart and mind while mrs raby felt that her conduct must be founded on the character and worth of her niece even while she was more convinced at every minute that no half measures would be permitted by oswi raby and others of their family and connexion and that elizabeth's welfare depended on her breaking away entirely from her present position and throwing herself unreservedly upon the kindness and affection of her father's relations strange tidings awaited their arrival in london and added to the eagerness of both the proceedings of sir boyvill the accusation of falkner and his actual arrest with all its consequent disgrace made each fear that it was too late to interpose mrs raby showed most energy the circumstances were already in the newspapers but there was no mention of elizabeth falkner had been taken from his home but no daughter accompanied him no daughter appeared to have any part in the shocking scene had falkner had the generosity to save her from disgrace if so it became her duty to co operate in his measures where elizabeth had taken refuge was uncertain but on inquiry it seemed that she was still at wimbledon thither the ladies proceeded together anxiety possessed both to a painful degree there was a mysteriousness in the progress of events which they could not unveil all depended on a clear and a happy explanation the first words and first embrace of elizabeth reassured her friend all indeed would be well she restored to her place in society and punishment would fall on the guilty alone chapter xxxix the first words that elizabeth spoke as she embraced lady cecil you are come then all is well seemed to confirm her belief that the offered protection of mrs raby would sound to the poor orphan as a hospitable shore to the wrecked mariner she pressed her fondly to her heart repeating her own words all is well dear dear elizabeth you are restored to us after i believed you lost for ever what then has happened asked elizabeth and where is my dear father your father miss raby repeated a deep serious but melodious voice whom do you call your father elizabeth in her agitation had not caught her aunt's name and turned with surprise to the questioner whom lady cecil introduced as one who had known and loved her real father as her aunt come to offer a happy and honourable home and the affection of a relative to one so long lost so gladly found we have come to carry you off with us said lady cecil your position here is altogether disagreeable but everything is changed now and you will come with us but my father cried elizabeth for what other name can i give to my benefactor dear lady cecil where is he do you not then know asked lady cecil hesitatingly this very morning i heard something frightful heart breaking but since you are here it must be all a fiction or at least the dreadful mistake is put right tell me where is mr falkner i know less than you i believe replied her friend my information is only gathered from the hasty letters of my brother which explain nothing but mr neville has told you said elizabeth that my dear father is accused of murder accused by him who possesses the best proof of his innocence i had thought mr neville generous unsuspicious nor is it he interrupted lady cecil who brings this accusation i tell you i know little but sir boyvill is the origin of mr falkner's arrest the account he read seemed to him unsatisfactory and the remains of poor mrs neville indeed dear elizabeth you must not question me for i know nothing much less than you gerard puts much faith in the innocence of mr falkner bless him for that cried elizabeth tears gushing into her eyes oh yes i knew that he would be just and generous my poor poor father by what fatal mistake is your cause judged by one incapable of understanding or appreciating you yet said lady cecil he cannot be wholly innocent the flight the catastrophe the concealment of his victim's death is there not guilt in these events much much i will not excuse or extenuate if ever you read his narrative which at his desire i gave mr neville you will learn from that every exculpation he can allege it is not for me to speak nor to hear even of his past errors never was remorse more bitter contrition more sincere but for me he had not survived the unhappy lady a week but for me he had died in greece to expiate his fault will not this satisfy his angry accusers i must act from higher motives gratitude duty every human obligation bind me to him he took me a deserted orphan from a state of miserable dependance on a grudging vulgar woman he brought me up as his child he was more to me than father ever was he has nursed me as my own mother would in sickness in perilous voyages he has carried me in his arms and sheltered me from the storm while he exposed himself for my sake year after year while none else have cared for have thought of me i have been the object of his solicitude he has consented to endure life that i might not be left desolate when i knew not that one of my father's family would acknowledge me shall i desert him now never but you cannot help him said lady cecil he must be tried by the laws of his country i hope he has not in truth offended against them but you cannot serve him where is he dear lady cecil tell me where he is i fear there can be no doubt he is in prison at carlisle and do you think that i cannot serve him there in prison as a criminal miserable as his fate makes me miserable as i too well know that he is it is some compensation to my selfish heart to know that i can serve him that i can be all in all of happiness and comfort to him even now he pines for me he knows that i never leave his side when in sorrow he wonders i am not already there yes in prison in shame he will be happy when he sees me again i shall go to him and then too i shall have comfort she spoke with a generous animation while yet her eyes glistened and her voice trembled with emotion lady cecil was moved while she deplored she caressed her she praised while mrs raby said it is impossible not to honour your intentions which spring from so pure and noble a source i think indeed that you overrate your obligations to mr falkner had he restored you to us after your mother's death you would have found i trust a happy home with me he adopted you because it best pleased him so to do he disregarded the evil he brought upon us by so doing and only restored you to us when the consequence of his crimes prevented him from being any longer a protection pardon me said elizabeth if i interrupt you mr falkner is a suffering he believed himself to be a dying man he lived in anguish till he could declare his error to clear the name of his unhappy victim he wished first to secure my future lot before he dared fate for himself chance altered his designs such were his motives generous towards me as they ever were and you dear elizabeth said lady cecil must act in obedience to them and to his wishes he anticipated disgrace from his disclosures a disgrace which you must not share you speak like a romantic girl of serving him in prison you cannot guess what a modern jail is its vulgar and shocking inhabitants the hideous language and squalid sights are such that their very existence should be a secret to the innocent be assured that mr falkner if he be as i believe him a man of honour and delicacy will shudder at the very thought of your approaching such contamination he will be best pleased to know you safe and happy with your family what a picture do you draw cried elizabeth trying to suppress her tears my poor poor father whose life hangs by a thread how can he survive the accumulation of evil but he will forget all these horrors when i am with him i know thank god i do indeed know that i have power to cheer and support him even at the worst this is madness observed lady cecil in a tone of distress mrs raby interposed with her suggestions she spoke of her own desire the desire of all the family to welcome elizabeth she told her that with them belonging to them she had new duties her obedience was due to her relatives she must not act so as to injure them she alluded to their oppressed religion to the malicious joy their enemies would have in divulging such a tale as that would be if their niece's conduct made the whole course of events public and as well as she could she intimated that if she mixed up her name in a tale so full of horror and guilt her father's family could never after receive her elizabeth heard all this with considerable coldness it grieves me she said to repay intended kindness with something like repulse i have no wish to speak of the past nor to remind you that if i was not brought up in obedience to you all it was because my father was disowned my mother abandoned and i a little child an orphan was left to live and die in dependance i who then bore your name had become a subject of niggard and degrading charity then young as i was i felt gratitude obedience duty all due to the generous benefactor who raised me from this depth of want and made me the child of his heart it is a lesson i have been learning many years i cannot unlearn it now i am his bought by his kindness earned by his unceasing care for me i belong to him his child if you will his servant i do not quarrel with names a child's duty i pay him and will ever do not be angry with me dear aunt if i may give you that name dearest lady cecil do not look so imploringly on me i am very unhappy mr falkner a prisoner accused of the most hideous crime treated with ignominy he whose nerves are agonized by a touch whose frame is even now decaying through sickness and sorrow and i and every hope away i am very unhappy do not urge me to what is impossible and thrice thrice wicked i must go to him day and night i shall have no peace till i am at his side do not for my sake do not dispute this sacred duty it was not thus that the two ladies could be led to desist they soothed her but again returned to the charge lady cecil brought a thousand arguments of worldly wisdom of feminine delicacy mrs raby insinuated the duty owed to her family to shield it from the disgrace she was bringing on it they both insisted on the impossibility on the foolish romance of her notions had she been really his daughter her joining him in prison was impracticable out of all propriety but elizabeth had been brought up to regard feelings rather than conventional observances duties not proprieties all her life falkner had been her law rule every tie to her she knew and felt nothing beyond when she had followed him to greece when she had visited the morea to bear him dying away when at zante she had watched by his sick couch the world and all the rabys it contained were nothing to her and now when he was visited by a far heavier calamity when in solitude and misery he had besides her no one comfort under heaven was she to adopt a new system of conduct become a timid home bred young lady tied by the most frivolous rules impeded by fictitious notions of propriety and false delicacy whether they were right and she were wrong whether indeed such submission to society such useless degrading dereliction of nobler duties was adapted for feminine conduct and whether she despising such bonds sought a bold and dangerous freedom she could not tell she only knew and felt that for her educated as she had been beyond the narrow paling of boarding school ideas or the refinements of a lady's boudoir that where her benefactor was there she ought to be and that to prove her gratitude to preserve her faithful attachment to him amid dire adversity was her sacred duty a virtue before which every minor moral faded and disappeared the discussion was long and even when they found her proof against every attack they would not give up they entreated her to go home with them for that day a wild light beamed from her eyes i am going home she cried an hour hence and i shall be gone to where my true home is how strange it is that you should imagine that i could linger here be not afraid for me dear lady cecil she continued all will go well with me and you will after a little reflection acknowledge that i could not act other than i do and will you mrs raby forgive my seeming ingratitude i acknowledge the justice of your demands i thank you for your proposed kindness the name of raby shall receive no injury it shall never escape my lips my father will preserve the same silence be not angry with me but except that i remember my dear parents with affection i would say i take more joy and pride in being his daughter his friend at this need than in the distinction and prosperity your kindness offers i give up every claim on my family the name of raby shall not be tainted but elizabeth falkner with all her wilfulness and faults shall at least prove her gratitude to him who bestowed that appellation on her and thus they parted lady cecil veiling her distress in sullenness while mrs raby was struck and moved by her niece's generosity which was in accordance with her own noble mind but she felt that other judges would sit upon the cause and decide from other motives she parted from her as a pagan relative might from a young christian martyr admiring while she deplored her sacrifice and feeling herself wholly incapable of saving chapter xl elizabeth delayed not a moment proceeding on her journey an exalted enthusiasm made her heart beat high and almost joyously this buoyancy of spirit springing from a generous course of action is the compensation provided for our sacrifices of inclination and at least on first setting out blinds us to the sad results we may be preparing for ourselves elated by a sense of acting according to the dictates of her conscience despite the horror of the circumstances that closed in the prospect her spirits were light and her eyes glistened with a feeling at once triumphant and tender while reflecting on the comfort she was bringing to her unfortunate benefactor a spasm of horror seized her now and then as the recollection pressed that he was in prison accused as a murderer but her young heart refused to be cowed even by the ignominy and anguish of such a reflection a philosopher not long ago remarked when adverting to the principle of destruction latent in all works of art and the overthrow of the most durable edifices but when they are destroyed so as to produce only dust nature asserts an empire over them and the vegetative world rises in constant youth and in a period of annual successions by the labours of man providing food vitality and beauty adorn the wrecks of monuments which were once raised for purposes of glory thus when crime and wo attack and wreck an erring human being the affections and virtues of one faithfully attached decorate the ruin with alien beauty and make that pleasant to the eye and heart which otherwise we might turn from as a loathsome spectacle it was a cold september day when she began her journey and the solitary hours spent on the road exhausted her spirits in the evening she arrived at stony stratford and here at the invitation of her servant consented to spend the night the solitary inn room without a fire and her lonely supper chilled her so susceptible are we to the minor casualties of life even when we meet the greater with heroic resolution she longed to skip the present hour to be arrived she longed to see falkner and to hear his voice she felt forlorn and deserted at this moment the door was opened a gentleman was announced and gerard neville entered love and nature at this moment asserted their full sway her heart bounded in her bosom her cheek flushed her soul was deluged at once with a sense of living delight she had never thought to see him more she had tried to forget that she regretted this but he was there and she felt that such a pleasure were cheaply purchased by the sacrifice of her existence he also felt the influence of the spell he came agitated by many fears perplexed by the very motive that led him to her but she was there in all her charms the dear object of his nightly dreams and waking reveries hesitation and reserve vanished in her presence and they both felt the alliance of their hearts now that i am here and see you said neville it seems to me the most natural thing in the world that i should have followed you as i have done while away i had a thousand misgivings and wherefore did you not sympathize in my sufferings and desire to aid me in my endeavours and i feel convinced that fate while by the turn of events it appeared to disunite has in fact linked us closer than ever i am come with a message from sophia and to urge also on my own part a change in your resolves you must not pursue your present journey you have indeed been taking a lesson from lady cecil when you say this replied elizabeth she has taught you to be worldly for me a lesson you would not learn on your own account she did not seduce me in this way i gave you my support when you were going to america elizabeth began to speak almost sportively but the mention of america brought to her recollection the cause of his going and the circumstances that prevented him and the tears gushed from her eyes as she continued in a voice broken by emotion oh mr neville i smile while my heart is breaking my dear dear father what misery is this that you have brought on him and now while he treated you with unreserve have you falsely you must know accused him of crime and pursued your vengeance in a vindictive and ignominious manner it is not well done i pardon your injustice said neville though it is very great one of my reasons for coming was to explain the exact state of things though i believed that your knowledge of me would have caused you to reject the idea of my being a party to my father's feelings of revenge neville then related all that had passed the discovery of his mother's remains in the very spot falkner had indicated and sir boyvill's resolve to bring the whole train of events before the public perhaps he continued my father believes in the justice of his accusation he never saw mr falkner and cannot be impressed as i am by the tokens of a noble mind which despite his errors are indelibly imprinted on his brow at all events he is filled with a sense of his own injuries stung by the disdain heaped on him in that narration and angry that he had been led to wrong a wife the memory of whose virtues and beauty now revives bitterly to reproach him i cannot wonder at his conduct even while i deplore it i do deplore it on your account for mr falkner god knows i would have visited his crime in another mode yet all he suffers he has brought on himself he must feel it due and must bear it as best he may forgive me if i seem harsh i compassionate him through you i cannot for his own sake how falsely do you reason cried elizabeth and you also are swayed and perverted by passion he is innocent of the hideous crime laid to his charge you know and feel that he is innocent and were he guilty i have heard you lament that crime is so hardly visited by the laws of society i have heard you say that even where guilt is joined to the hardness of habitual vice that it ought to be treated with the indulgence of a correcting father not by the cruel vengeance of the law and now when one whose very substance and flesh are corroded by remorse one whose conscience acts as a perpetual scourge one who has expiated his fault by many years spent in acts of benevolence and heroism this man because his error has injured you you forgetting your own philosophy would make over to a fate which considering who and what he is is the most calamitous human imagination can conceive neville could not hear this appeal without the deepest pain let us forget he at last said these things for a few minutes they did not arise through me nor can i prevent them indeed they are now beyond all human control falkner could as easily restore my mother whose remains we found mouldering in the grave which he dug for them he could as easily bring her back to the life and happiness of which he deprived her as i my father or any one free him from the course of law to which he is made over we must all abide by the issue there is no remedy but you i would speak of you i cannot speak cannot think of myself replied elizabeth except in one way to think all delays tedious that keep me from my father's side and prevent me from sharing his wretchedness and yet you must not go to him said neville yours is the scheme of inexperience but it must not be how can you share mr falkner's sorrows you will scarcely be admitted to see him and how unfit for you is such a scene you cannot guess what these things are believe me they are most unfit for one of your sex and age i grieve to say in what execration the supposed murderer of my mother is held you would be subjected to insult you are alone and unprotected even your high spirit would be broken by the evils that will gather round you i think not replied elizabeth i cannot believe that my spirit can be broken by injustice or that it can quail while i perform a duty it would indeed spirit and heart would both break were my conscience burdened with the sin of deserting my father in prison amid the hootings of the mob if for such i am reserved i shall be safe and well guarded by the approbation of my own mind would that an angel from heaven would descend to guard you cried neville passionately but in this inexplicable world guilt and innocence are so mingled that the one reaps the blessings deserved by the other and the latter sinks beneath the punishment incurred by the former else why removed by birth space and time from all natural connexion with the cause of all this misery are you cast on this evil hour were you his daughter my heart would not rebel blood calls to blood and a child's duty is paramount but you are no child of his you spring from another race honour affection prosperity await you in your proper sphere what have you to do with that unhappy man yet another word he continued seeing elizabeth about to reply with eagerness and yet how vain are words to persuade could i but take you to a tower and show you spread below the course of events and the fatal results of your present resolves you would suffer me to lead you from the dangerous path you are treading if once you reach cumberland and appear publicly as falkner's daughter the name of raby is lost to you for ever and if the worst should come where will you turn for support where fly for refuge unable to convince i would substitute entreaty and implore you to spare yourself these evils you know not indeed you do not know what you are about to do thus impetuously urged elizabeth was for a few minutes half bewildered i am afraid she said i suppose indeed that i am something of a savage unable to bend to the laws of civilization i did not know this i thought i was much like other girls attached to their home and parents fulfilling their daily duties as the necessities of those parents demand i nursed my father when sick now that he is in worse adversity i still feel my proper place to be at his side as his comforter and companion glad if i can be of any solace to him he is my father my more than father my preserver in helpless childhood from the worst fate may i suffer every evil when i forget that even if a false belief of his guilt renders the world inimical to him it will not be so unjust to one as unoffending as i and if it is it cannot touch me methinks we speak two languages i speak of duties the most sacred to fail in which would entail self condemnation on me to the end of my days you speak of the conveniences the paint the outside of life which is as nothing in comparison i cannot yield i grieve to seem eccentric and headstrong it is my hard fate not my will so to appear do not give such a name replied neville deeply moved to an heroic generosity only too exalted for this bad world it is i that must yield and pray to god to shield and recompense you as you deserve he only can he and your own noble heart and will you pardon me miss raby do not give me that name interrupted elizabeth i act in contradiction to my relations' wishes i will not assume their name the other too must be painful to you call me elizabeth neville took her hand i am he said a selfish odious being you are full of self sacrifice of thought for others of every blessed virtue i think of myself and hate myself while i yield to the impulse dear dear elizabeth since thus i may call you are you not all i have ever imagined of excellent i love you beyond all thought or word and have for many many months since first i saw you at marseilles without reflection i knew and felt you to be the being my soul thirsted for i find you and you are lost love's own colour died deeply the cheeks of elizabeth she felt recompensed for every suffering in the simple knowledge of the sentiment she inspired a moment before clouds and storms had surrounded her horizon now the sun broke in upon it it was a transcendent though a transient gleam the thought of falkner again obscured the radiance which even in its momentary flash was as if an angel bearing with it the airs of paradise had revealed itself and then again become obscured neville was less composed he had never fully entered into his father's bitter thoughts against falkner and elizabeth's fidelity to the unhappy man made him half suspect the unexampled cruelty and injustice of the whole proceeding still compassion for the prisoner was a passive feeling while horror at the fate preparing for elizabeth stirred his sensitive nature to its depths and filled him with anguish he walked impatiently about the room and stopped before her fixing on her his soft lustrous eyes whose expression was so full of tenderness and passion elizabeth felt their influence but this was not the hour to yield to the delusions of love and she said now you will leave me mr neville i have far to travel to morrow good night have patience with me yet a moment longer said neville i cannot leave you thus without offering from my whole heart and conjuring you to accept my services parting thus it is very uncertain when we meet again and fearful sufferings are prepared for you i believe that you esteem that you have confidence in me you know that my disposition is constant and persevering you know that the aim of my early life being fulfilled and my mother's name freed from the unworthy aspersions cast upon it i at once transfer every thought every hope to your well being at a distance knowing the scene of misery in which you are placed i shall be agitated by perpetual fears and pass unnumbered hours of bitter disquietude will you promise me that despite all that divides us if you need any aid or service you will write to me commanding me in the full assurance that all you order shall be executed in its very spirit and letter i will indeed replied elizabeth for i know that whatever happens you will always be my friend your true your best your devoted friend cried neville it will always be my dearest ambition to prove all this i will not adopt the name of brother yet use me as a brother no brother ever cherished the honour safety and happiness of a sister as i do yours you knew said elizabeth that i shall not be alone that i go to one to whom i owe obedience and who can direct me if in his frightful situation he needs counsel and assistance it is not you alas that can render them still in the world of sorrow in which i shall soon be an inhabitant it will be a solace and support to think of your kindness and rely upon it as unreservedly as i do a world of sorrow indeed repeated neville a world of ignominy and wo such as ought never to have visited you even in a dream its duration will be prolonged also beyond all fortitude or patience of course mr falkner's legal advisers will insist on the necessity of osborne's testimony he must be sent for and brought over this demands time it will be spring before the trial takes place and all this time my father will be imprisoned as a felon in a jail cried elizabeth tears bitter tears springing into her eyes most horrible oh how necessary that i should be with him to lighten the weary unending hours i thought all would soon be over and his liberation at hand this delay of justice is indeed beyond my fears thank god that you are thus sanguine of the final result replied neville i will not say a word to shake your confidence and i fervently hope it is well placed and now indeed good night i will not detain you longer all good angels guard you you cannot guess how bitterly i feel the necessity that disjoins us in this hour of mutual suffering forgive me said elizabeth but my thoughts are with my father you have conjured up a whole train of fearful anticipations but i will quell them and be patient again for his and all our sakes they separated and at the moment of parting a gush of tenderness smoothed the harsher feelings inspired by their grief despite herself elizabeth felt comforted by her friend's faithful and earnest attachment and a few minutes passed in self communion restored her to those hopes for the best which are the natural growth of youth and inexperience neville left the inn immediately on quitting her and she unable to sleep occupied by various reveries passed a few uneasy and yet not wholly miserable hours a hallowed calm at last succeeded to her anxious fears springing from a reliance on heaven and the natural delight of being loved by one so dear it smoothed her wrinkled cares and blunted her poignant regrets at earliest dawn she sprung from her bed eager to pursue her journey nor did she again take rest till she arrived at carlisle chapter xli in the best room that could be allotted to him consistently with safe imprisonment and with such comforts around as money might obtain falkner passed the lingering days what so forlorn as the comforts of a prison the wigwam of the indian is more pleasing to the imagination that is in close contiguity with nature and partakes her charm no barrier exists between it and freedom and nature and freedom are the stanch friends of unsophisticated man but a jail's best room sickens the heart in its very show of accommodation the strongly barred windows looking out on the narrow court surrounded by high frowning walls the appalling sounds that reach the ear in such close neighbourhood to crime and wo the squalid appearance given to each inhabitant by the confined air the surly authoritative manners of the attendants not dependant on the prisoner but on the state the knowledge that all may come in while he cannot get out and the conviction that the very unshackled state of his limbs depends upon his tame submission and apparent apathy there is no one circumstance that does not wound the free spirit of man and make him envy the meanest animal that breathes the free air and is at liberty falkner by that strange law of our nature which makes us conceive the future without being aware of our foreknowledge had acquainted his imagination with these things and while writing his history amid the far stretched mountains of greece had shrunk and trembled before such an aspect of slavery and yet now that it had fallen on him he felt in the first instance more satisfied more truly free than for many a long day before there is no tyranny so hard as fear no prison so abhorrent as apprehension falkner was not a coward yet he feared he feared discovery he feared ignominy and had eagerly sought death to free him from the terror of such evils with which perhaps so strangely are we formed osborne had infected him it had come it was here it was his life his daily bread and he rose above the infliction calmly and almost proudly it is with pride that we say that we endure the worst there is a very freedom in the thought that the animosity of all mankind is roused against us and every engine set at work for our injury no more can be done the gulf is passed the claw of the wild beast is on our heart but the spirit soars more freely still to this was added the singular relief which confession brings to the human heart guilt hidden in the recesses of the conscience assumes gigantic and distorted dimensions when the secret is shared by another it falls back at once into its natural proportion much had this man of wo endured the feeling against him throughout the part of the country where he now was was vehement the discovery of poor alithea's remains the inquest and its verdict the unhappy lady's funeral had spread far and wide his accusation it had been found necessary to take him into carlisle by night and even then some few remained in waiting and roused their fellows and the hootings of execration were raised against him i end as i began thought falkner amid revilings and injustice i can surely suffer now that which was so often my lot in the first dawn of boyhood his examination before the magistrates was a more painful proceeding there was no glaring injustice no vindictive hatred here and yet he was accused of the foulest crime in nature and saw in many faces the belief that he was a murderer the murderer of alithea he could have laughed in scorn to think that such an idea had entered a man's mind she an angel whom he worshipped whom to save he would have met ten thousand deaths how mad a world how insane a system must it be where such a thought was not scouted as soon as conceived falkner had no vulgar mind in early youth he experienced those aspirations after excellence which betoken the finely moulded among our fellow creatures there was a type of virtue engraved in his heart after which he desired to model himself since the hour when the consequences of his guilt revealed its true form to him he had striven like an eagle in an iron bound cage to free himself from the trammels of conscience he felt within how much better he might be than anything he was but all this was unacknowledged and uncared for in the present scene it was not the heroism of his soul that was inquired into but the facts of his whereabouts not the sacred nature of his worship for alithea but whether he had had opportunity to perpetrate crime when we are conscious of innocence what so heart sickening as to combat circumstances that accuse us of guilt which we abhor his prison room was a welcome refuge after such an ordeal his spirit could not be cowed by misfortune and he felt unnaturally glad to be where he was he felt glad to be the victim of injustice the mark of unspeakable adversity but his body's strength failed to keep pace with the lofty disdain of his soul and elizabeth where was she he rejoiced that she was absent when torn from his home he had directed the servants to say nothing to miss falkner he would write and he had meant to fulfil this promise but each time he thought to do so he shrunk repugnant he would not for worlds call her to his side to share the horrors of his lot and feeling sure that she would be visited by some member of her father's family he thought it best to let things take their course unprotected and alone she would gladly accept refuge there where it was offered and the tie snapped between them happiness and love would alike smile on her he had it deeply at heart that she should not be mingled in the frightful details of his present situation and yet drearily he missed her for he loved her with a feeling which though not paternal was as warm as ever filled a father's breast his passions were ardent and all that could be spared from remorse were centred in his adopted child he had looked on her as the prophet might on the angel who ministered to his wants in the desert in the abandonment of all mankind in the desolation to which his crime had led him she had brought love and cheer she had been his sweet household companion his familiar friend his patient nurse his soul had grown to her image and when the place was vacant that she had filled he was excited by eager longings for her presence that even made his man's heart soft as a woman's with very desire by degrees as he thought of her and the past the heroism of his soul was undermined and weakened to every eye he continued composed and even cheerful as before none could read in his impassive countenance the misery that dwelt within he spent his time in reading and writing and in necessary communications with the lawyers who were to conduct his defence and all this was done with a calm eye and unmoved voice no token of complaint or impatience ever escaped he seemed equal to the fortune that attacked him he grew indeed paler and thinner till his handsome features stood out in their own expressive beauty he might have served for a model of prometheus the vulture at his heart producing pangs and spasms of physical suffering but his will unconquered his mind refusing to acknowledge the bondage to which his body was the prey it was an unnatural combat for the tenderness which was blended with his fiercer passions and made the charm of his character sided with his enemies and made him less able to bear than one more roughly and hardly framed he loved nature he had spent his life among her scenes nothing of her visited him now save a star or two that rose above the prison wall into the slip of sky his window commanded they were the faintest stars in heaven and often were shrouded by clouds and mist thus doubly imprisoned his body barred by physical impediments his soul shut up in itself he became in the energetic language of genius the cannibal of his own heart without a vent for any thoughts revolved in his brain with the velocity and action of a thousand mill wheels and would not be stopped now a spasm of painful emotion covered his brow with a cold dew now self contempt made every portion of himself detestable in his own eyes now he felt the curse of god upon him weighing him down with heavy relentless burden and then again he was assailed by images of freedom and keen longings for the free air if even like mazeppa i might seek the wilds and career along though death was the bourn in view i were happy these wild thoughts crossed him exaggerated into gasping desire to achieve such a fate when the sights and sounds of a prison gathered thick around and made the very thought of his fellow creatures one of disgust and abhorrence thus sunk in gloom far deeper internally than in outward show warring with remorse and the sense of unmerited injury vanquished by fate yet refusing to yield nature had reached the acme of suffering he grew to be careless of the result of his trial and to neglect the means of safety he pondered on self destruction though that were giving the victory to his enemies he looked round him his cell appeared a tomb he felt as if he had passed out of life into death strange thoughts and images flitted through his mind and the mortal struggle drew to a close when on a day his prison door opened and elizabeth stepped within the threshold to see the beloved being we long for inexpressibly and believe to be so far to hear the dear voice whose sweet accent we imagined to be mute to us for ever to feel the creature's very soul in real communion with us and the person we dote on visible to our eyes such are moments of bliss which the very imperfections of our finite nature render immeasurably dear falkner saw his child and felt no longer imprisoned she was freedom and security looking on her sweet face he could not believe in the existence of evil wrongs and wo and a torturing conscience melted and fled away before her while fresh springing happiness filled every portion of his being chapter xlii elizabeth arrived at the moment of the first painful crisis of falkner's fate the assizes came on busy faces crowded into his cell and various consultations took place as to the method of his defence and here began a series of cares mortifications and worse anxieties which brought home to the hearts of the sufferers the horrors of their position the details of crime and its punishment are so alien to the individuals placed in the upper classes of society that they read them as tales of another and a distant land and it is like being cast away on a strange and barbarous country to find such become a part of our own lives the list of criminals the quality of their offences the position falkner held among them were all discussed by the men of law and falkner listened impassive in seeming apathy his eagle eye bent on vacancy his noble brow showing no trace of the rush of agonizing thought that flowed through his brain it was not till he saw his child's earnest searching eyes bent on him that he smiled so to soften the keenness of her lively sympathy she listened too her cheek alternately flushed and pale and her eyes brimming over with tears as she drew nearer to her unfortunate friend's side as if her innocence and love might stand between him and the worst the decision of the grand jury was the first point to be considered there existed no doubt but that would go against the accused the lawyers averred this but still elizabeth hoped men could not be so blind or some unforeseen enlightenment might dawn on their understandings the witnesses against him were sir boyvill and his son the latter she well knew abhorred the course pursued and if some touch could reach sir boyvill's heart and show him the unworthiness and falsehood of his proceedings through the mode in which their evidence might be given all would alter the scales would drop from men's eyes the fetters from falkner's limbs and this strange and horrible entanglement be dissipated like morning mist she brooded for ever on these thoughts sometimes she pondered on writing to neville sometimes on seeing his father but his assertion was recollected that nothing now could alter the course of events and that drove her back upon despair for ever thinking on these things and hearing them discussed it was yet a severe blow to both when in the technical language of the craft it was announced that a true bill was found against rupert falkner such is the nature of the mind that hitherto falkner had never looked on the coming time in its true proportions or colours the decision of the preliminary jury which might be in his favour had stood as a screen between him and the future knowing himself to be innocent abhorring the very image of the crime of which he was accused how could twelve impartial educated men agree that any construction put upon his actions should cast the accusation on him the lawyers had told him that so it would be he had read the fearful expectation in elizabeth's eyes but it could not justice was not a mere word innocence bore a stamp not to be mistaken the vulgar and senseless malice of sir boyvill would be scouted and reprobated such was his intimate conviction though he had never expressed it but this was all changed now the tale of horror was admitted registered as a probability and had become a rule for future acts the ignominy of a public trial would assuredly be his and going as is usual from one extreme to the other the belief entered his soul that he should be found guilty and die the death a dark veil fell over life and nature ofttimes he felt glad even to escape thus from a hideous system of wrong and suffering but the innate pride of the heart rebelled and his soul struggled as in the toils elizabeth heard the decision with even more dismay her head swam and she grew sick at heart would his trial come on in a few days would all soon so soon be decided was the very moment near at hand to make or mar existence and turn this earth from a scene of hope into a very hell of torture and despair for such to her it must be if the worst befell falkner the worst oh what a worst how hideous squalid unredeemed there was madness in the thought and she hurried to his cell to see him and hear him speak so to dissipate the horror of her thoughts her presence of mind her equanimity all deserted her she looked bewildered her heart beat as if it would burst her bosom her face grew ashy pale her limbs unstrung of every strength and her efforts to conceal her weakness from falkner's eyes but served the more to confuse she found him seated near his window looking on so much of the autumnal sky as could be perceived through the bars of the high narrow opening the clouds traversed the slender portion of heaven thus visible they fled fast to other lands and the spirit of liberty rode upon their outstretched wings away they flew far from him and he had no power to reach their bourn nor to leave the dingy walls that held him in oh nature while we possess thee thy changes ever lovely thy vernal airs or majestic storms thy vast creation spread at our feet above around us how can we call ourselves unhappy there is brotherhood in the growing opening flowers love in the soft winds repose in the verdant expanse and a quick spirit of happy life throughout with which our souls hold glad communion but the poor prisoner was barred out from these how cumbrous the body felt how alien to the inner spirit of man the fleshy bars that allowed it to become the slave of his fellows the stunning effects of the first blow had passed away and there was in falkner's face that lofty expression that resembled coldness though it was the triumph over sensibility something of disdain curled his lip and his whole air denoted the acquisition of a power superior to fate trembling elizabeth entered never before had she lost self command even now she paused at the threshold to resume it but in vain she saw him she flew to his arms she dissolved in tears and became all woman in her tender fears he was touched he would have soothed her a choking sensation arose in his throat i never felt a prisoner till now he cried can you still cling to one struck with infamy dearer more beloved than ever she murmured surely there is no tie so close and strong as misery dear generous girl said falkner how i hate myself for making such large demand on your sympathy let me suffer alone this is not the place for you elizabeth your free step should be on the mountain's side these silken tresses the playthings of the unconfined winds while i thought that i should speedily be liberated i was willing to enjoy the comfort of your society but now i the murderer am not a fit mate for you i am accursed and pull disaster down on all near me i was born to destroy the young and beautiful with such talk they tried to baffle this fierce visitation of adversity falkner told her that on that day it would be decided whether the trial should take place at once or time be given to send for osborne from america the turn neville had given to his evidence had been so favourable to the accused as to shake the prejudice against him and it was believed that the judges would at once admit the necessity of waiting for so material a witness and yet their first and dearest hope had been destroyed so they feared to give way to a new one as they conversed the solicitor entered with good tidings the trial was put off till the ensuing assizes in march to give time for the arrival of osborne the hard dealing of destiny and man relented a little and despair receded from their hearts leaving space to breathe to pray to hope no time was to be lost in sending for osborne would he come it could not be doubted a free pardon was to be extended to him and he would save a fellow creature and his former benefactor without any risk of injury to himself the day closed therefore more cheeringly than it had begun falkner conquered himself even to a show of cheerfulness and recalled the colour to his tremulous companion's cheeks and half a smile to her lips by his encouragement he turned her thoughts from the immediate subject narrating the events of his first acquaintance with osborne and describing the man a poltron but kindly hearted fearful of his own skin to a contemptible extent but looking up with awe to his superiors and easily led by one richer and of higher station to any line of conduct an inborn slave but with many of a slave's good qualities falkner did not doubt that he would put himself eagerly forward on the present occasion and whatever his evidence were good for it would readily be produced there was no reason then for despair while the shock they had undergone took the sting from the present fearing an immediate and horrible catastrophe the wretchedness of their actual state was forgotten it acquired comfort and security by the contrast each tried to cheer the other and they separated for the night with apparent composure yet that night elizabeth's pillow despite her earnest endeavours to place reliance on providence was watered by the bitterest tears that ever such young eyes shed and falkner told each hour of the livelong night as his memory retraced past scenes and his spirit writhed and bled to feel that in the wantonness and rebellion of youth he had been the author of so wide spreading so dark a web of misery from this time their days were spent in that sort of monotony which has a peculiar charm to the children of adversity the recurrence of one day after the other none being marked by disaster or indeed any event imparted a satisfaction gloomy indeed and sad but grateful to the heart wearied by many blows and by the excitement of mortal hopes and fears the mind adapted itself to the new state of things and enjoyments sprung up in the very home of desolation circumstances that in happier days were but the regular routine of life grew into blessings from heaven and the thought come what will this hour is safe made precious the mere passage of time months were placed between them and the dreaded crisis and so are we made that when once this is an established acknowledged fact we can play on the eve of danger almost like the unconscious animal destined to bleed their time was regularly divided and occupations succeeded one to another elizabeth rented apartments not far from the prison she gave the early morning hours to exercise and the rest of the day was spent in falkner's prison he read to her as she worked at the tapestry frame or she took the book while he drew or sketched nor was music wanting such as suited the subdued tone of their minds and elevated it to reverence and resignation and sweet still hours were spent near their fire for their hearth gleamed cheerfully despite surrounding horrors gayety was absent but neither was the voice of discontent heard all repinings were hidden in the recesses of their hearts their talk was calm abstracted from matters of daily life but gifted with the interest that talent can bestow on all it touches falkner exerted himself chiefly to vary their topics and to enliven them by the keenness of his observations the beauty of his descriptions and the vividness of his narrations he spoke of india they read various travels and compared the manners of different countries they forgot the bars that checkered the sunlight on the floor of the cell they forgot the cheerless gloom of each surrounding object did they also forget the bars and bolts between them and freedom the thoughtful tenderness which had become the habitual expression of elizabeth's face the subdued manner and calm tones of falkner were a demonstration that they did not something they were conscious of at each minute that checked the free pulsations of their hearts a word in a book brought by some association home to her feelings would cause elizabeth's eyes to fill with unbidden tears and proud scorn would now and then dilate the breast of falkner as he read some story of oppression and felt i also am persecuted and must endure in this position they each grew unutterably dear to the other every moment every thought was full to both of the image of either there is something inexpressibly winning in beauty and grace it is a sweet blessing when our household companion charms our senses by the loveliness of her person and makes the eye gladly turn to her to be gratified by such a form and look as we would travel miles to see depicted on canvass it soothed many a spasm of pain and turned many an hour of suffering into placid content when falkner watched the movements of his youthful friend you might look in her face for days and still read something new something sublime in the holy calm of her brow in her serious yet intelligent eyes while all a woman's softness dwelt in the moulding of her cheeks and her dimpled mouth each word she said and all she did so became her that it appeared the thing best to be said and done and was accompanied by a fascination both for eye and heart which emanated from her purity and truth falkner grew to worship the very thought of her she had not the wild spirits and trembling sensibility of her he had destroyed but in her kind she was no way inferior yet though each as it were enjoyed the respite given by fortune to their worst fears yet this very sense of transitory security was in its essence morbid and unnatural a fever preyed nightly on falkner and there were ghastly streaks upon his brow that bespoke internal suffering and decay elizabeth grew paler and thinner her step lost its elasticity her voice became low toned her eyes were acquainted with frequent tears and the lids grew heavy and dark both lived for ever in the presence of misery they feared to move or speak lest they should awaken the monster then for a space torpid but they spent their days under its shadow the air they drew was chilled by its icy influence no wholesome light hearted mood of mind was ever theirs they might pray and resign themselves they might congratulate themselves on the safety of the passing moment but each sand that flowed from the hourglass was weighed each thought that passed through the brain was examined every word uttered was pondered over they were exhausted by the very vividness of their unsleeping endeavours to blunt their sensations the hours were very sad that they spent apart the door closed on elizabeth and love and hope and all the pride of life vanished with her falkner was again a prisoner an accused felon a man over whom impended the most hideous fate whom the dogs of law barked round and looked on as their prey his high heart often quailed he laid his head on his pillow desiring never again to raise it despair kept his lids open the livelong nights while naught but palpable darkness brooded over his eyeballs he rose languid dispirited revolving thoughts of death till at last she came who by degrees dispelled the gloom and shed over his benighted soul the rays of her pure spirit she also was miserable in solitude the silent evening hours spent apart from him were melancholy and drear nothing interrupted their stillness she felt deserted by every human being and was indeed reduced to the extremity of loneliness in the town and neighbourhood many pitied many admired her and some offered their services but none visited or tried to cheer the solitary hours of the devoted daughter as the child of a man accused of murder there was a barrier between her and the world the english are generous to their friends but they are never kind to strangers the tie of brotherhood which christ taught as uniting all mankind is unacknowledged by them they so fear that their sullen fireside should be unduly invaded and so expect to be ill treated that each man makes a martello tower of his home and keeps watch against the gentler charities of life as from an invading enemy hour after hour therefore elizabeth spent thought her only companion from falkner and his miserable fortunes sometimes her reflections strayed to gerard neville the generous friend on whom she wholly relied yet who could in no way aid or comfort her they were divided he thought of her she knew his constant and ardent disposition would cause her to be for ever the cherished object of his reveries and now and then as she took her morning ride or looked from her casement at night upon the high stars and pale still moon nature spoke to her audibly of him and her soul overflowed with tenderness still he was far no word from him reached her no token of living remembrance lady cecil also she neither wrote nor sent the sense of abandonment is hard to bear and many bitter tears did the young sufferer shed and many a yearning had she to enter with her ill starred father the silent abode of the tomb scarcely more still or dark than the portion of life which was allotted to them even while existence was warm in their hearts and the natural impulse of their souls was to seek sympathy and receive consolation chapter xliii the varied train of hopes and fears which belonged to the situation of the prisoner and his faithful young companion stood for some time suspended in some sort they might be said neither to hope nor fear for reasoning calmly they neither expected that the worst would befall and the actual and impending evil was certain like shipwrecked sailors who have betaken themselves to a boat and are tossed upon a tempestuous sea they saw a ship nearing they believed that their signal was seen and that it was bearing down towards them what if with sudden tack the disdainful vessel should turn its prow aside and leave them to the mercy of the waves they did not anticipate such a completion to their disasters yet as time passed new anxieties occurred falkner's solicitor mr colville had despatched an agent to america to bring osborne over the pardon promised ensured his coming and yet it was impossible not to feel inquietude with regard to his arrival falkner experienced least of this he felt sure of osborne his creature the being whose life he had heretofore saved whose fortunes he had created he knew his weakness and how easily he was dealt with the mere people of business were not so secure osborne enjoyed a comfortable existence far from danger why should he come over to place himself in a disgraceful situation to be branded as a pardoned felon in a thousand ways he might evade the summons perhaps there was nothing to prove that the osborne whom hoskins named was the osborne who had been employed by falkner and was deemed an accessory in mrs neville's death hillary who had been sent to washington in september had written immediately on his arrival his passage had been tedious as autumnal voyages to america usually are he did not arrive till the last day of october he announced that osborne was in the town and that on the morrow he should see him this letter had arrived towards the end of november and there was no reason wherefore hillary and osborne should not quickly follow it but november passed away and december had begun and still the voyagers did not arrive the southwest wind continued to reign with slight variation except that as winter advanced it became more violent packets perpetually arrived in liverpool from america after passages of seventeen and twenty days but hillary did not return nor did he write the woods were despoiled of their leaves but still the air was warm and pleasant and it cheered elizabeth as favourable to her hopes the sun shown at intervals and the misty mornings were replaced by cheerful days elizabeth rode out each morning and this one day the sixteenth of december she found a new pleasure in her solitary exercise the weather was calm and cheerful a brisk canter gave speed to the current of her blood and her thoughts though busy had a charm in them that she was half angry with herself for feeling but which glowed all warm and bright despite every effort on the preceding evening she had observed on her return home at nine o'clock from the prison the figure of a man which passed her hastily and then stood aloof as if guarding and watching her at a distance once as he stood under an archway a flickering lamp threw his shadow across her path it was a bright moonlight night and as he stood in the midst of an open space near which her house was situated she recognised muffled as he was the form of gerard neville no wonder then that her heart was lightened of its burden he had not forgotten her he could no longer command himself to absence if he might not converse with her at least he might look upon her as she passed on the same morning she entered her father's prison room she found two visiters already there colville and his agent hillary the faces of both were long and serious elizabeth turned anxiously to falkner who looked stern and disdainful he smiled when he saw her and said you must not be shocked my love at the news which these gentlemen bring i cannot tell how far it influences my fate but it is impossible to believe that it is irrevocably sealed by it but who can express the scorn that a man must feel to know that so abject a poltron wears the human form osborne refuses to come such an announcement naturally filled her with dismay at the request of falkner hillary began again to relate the circumstances of his visit to america he recounted that finding that osborne was in washington he lost no time in securing an interview he delivered his letters to him and said that he came from mr falkner on an affair of life and death at the name osborne turned pale he seemed afraid of opening the letters and muttered something about there being a mistake at length he broke the seals fear in its most abject guise blanched his cheek as he read and his hand trembled so that he could scarcely hold the paper hillary perceiving at last that he had finished reading and was hesitating what to say began himself to enter on the subject when faltering and stammering osborne threw the letter down saying i said there was a mistake i know nothing all this affair is new to me i never had concern with mr falkner i do not know who mr falkner is but for the pale quivering lips of the man and his tremulous voice hillary might have thought that he spoke truth but he saw that cowardice was the occasion of the lie he told and he endeavoured to set before him the perfect safety with which he might comply with the request he conveyed but the more he said osborne gathering assurance the more obstinately denied all knowledge of the transactions in question or their principal actor he changed warmed by his own words from timid to impudent in his denials till hillary's conviction began to be shaken a little and at the same time he grew angry and cross questioned him with a lawyer's art about his arrival in america questions which osborne answered with evident trepidation at last he asked him if he remembered such and such a house and such a journey and the name of his companion on the occasion and if he recollected a person of the name of hoskins osborne started at the word as if he had been shot pale he was before but now his cheeks grew of a chalky white his limbs refused to support him and his voice died away till rousing himself he pretended to fly into a violent passion at the insolence of the intrusion and impertinence of the questions as he spoke he unwarily betrayed that he knew more of the transaction than he would willingly have allowed at last after running on angrily and incoherently for some time he suddenly broke away and they were at a tavern left the room and also the house hillary hoped that on deliberation he would come to his senses he sent the letters after him to his house and called the next day but he was gone he had left washington the evening before by the steamer to charlestown hillary knew not what to do he applied to the government authorities they could afford him no help he also repaired to charlestown some time he spent in searching for osborne vainly it appeared plain that he travelled under another name at length by chance he found a person who knew him personally who said that he had departed a week before for new orleans it seemed useless to make this further journey yet hillary made it and with like ill success whether osborne was concealed in that town whether he had gone to mexico or lurked in the neighbouring country could not be discovered time wore away in fruitless researches and it became necessary to come to a decision hopeless of success hillary thought it best to return to england with the account of his failure so that no time might be lost in providing a remedy if any could be found to so fatal an injury to their cause while this tale was being told falkner had leisure to recover from that boiling of the blood which the first apprehension of unworthy conduct in one of our fellow creatures is apt to excite and now spoke with his usual composure i cannot believe he said that this man's evidence is of the import which is supposed no one in fact believes that i am a murderer every one knows that i am innocent all that we have to do is to prove this in a sort of technical and legal manner and yet hardly that for we are not to address the deaf ear of law but the common sense of twelve men who will not be slow i feel assured in recognising the truth all that can be done to make my story plain and to prove it by circumstances of course must be done and i do not fear but that when it is ingenuously and simply told it will suffice for my acquittal it is right to hope for the best said mr colville but osborne's refusal to come is in itself a bad fact the prosecutor will insist much upon it i would give a hundred pounds to have him here i would not give a hundred pence said falkner dryly the other stared the observation had an evil effect on his mind he fancied that his client was even glad that a witness so material refused to appear and this to him had the aspect of guilt he continued i am so far of a different opinion that i should advise sending a second time had you a friend sufficiently zealous to undertake a voyage across the atlantic for the purpose of persuading osborne i would not ask him to cross a ditch for the purpose interrupted falkner with some asperity let such men as would believe a dastard like osborne in preference to a gentleman and a soldier take my life if they will it is not worth this pains in my own eyes and thirsted for by my fellow men it is a burden i would willingly lay down the soft touch of elizabeth's hand placed on his recalled him he looked on her tearful eyes and became aware of his fault he smiled to comfort her i ought to apologize to these gentlemen for my hastiness he said and to you my dear girl for my apparent trifling but there is a degradation in these details that might chafe a more placid temper i cannot i will not descend to beg my life i am innocent this all men must know or at least will know when their passions are no longer in excitement against me i can say no more i cannot win an angel from heaven to avouch my guiltlessness of her blood i cannot draw this miserable fellow from his cherished refuge all must fall on my own shoulders i must support the burden of my fate i shall appear before my judges if they seeing me and hearing me speak yet pronounce me guilty let them look to it i shall be satisfied to die so to quit at once a blind bloodthirsty world the dignity of falkner as he spoke these words the high disdainful yet magnanimous expression of his features the clear though impassioned tone of his voice thrilled the hearts of all thank god i do love this man even as he deserves to be loved was the tender sentiment that lighted up elizabeth's eyes while his male auditors could not help both by countenance and voice giving token that they were deeply moved on taking their leave soon after mr colville grasped falkner's hand cordially and bade him rest assured that his zeal his utmost endeavours should not be wanting to serve him and he added in obedience rather to his newly awakened interest than his judgment i cannot doubt but that our endeavours will be crowned with complete success a man of real courage always finds new strength unfold within him to meet a larger demand made upon it falkner was now perhaps for the first time thoroughly roused to meet the evils of his lot he threw off every natural every morbid sensibility and strung himself at once to a higher and firmer tone of mind he renounced the brittle hopes before held out to him of this or that circumstance being in his favour he intrusted unreservedly his whole cause to the mighty irresistible power who rules human affairs and felt calm and free if by disgrace and death he were to atone for the destruction of his victim so let it be the hour of suffering would come and it would pass away and leaving him a corpse the vengeance of his fellow creatures would end there he felt that the decree for life or death having received already the irrefragable fiat he was prepared for both and he resolved from that hour to drive all weak emotions all struggle all hope or fear from his soul let god's will be done something of christian resignation something derived from his eastern life of belief in fatality and something of philosophic fortitude composed the feeling that engraved this sentiment in his heart in ineffaceable characters he now spoke of osborne to elizabeth without acrimony my indignation against that man was all thrown away he said we do not rebuke the elements when they destroy us and why should we spend our anger against men a word from osborne they say would save me the falling of the wind or the allaying of the waves would have saved alithea both are beyond our control i imagined in those days that i could guide events till suddenly the reins were torn from my hands a few months ago i exulted in expectation that the penalty demanded for my crime would be the falling by the hands of her son and here i am an imprisoned felon and now we fancy that this thing or that might preserve me while in truth all is decreed all registered and we must patiently await the appointed time come what may i am prepared from this hour i have taught my spirit to bend and to be content to die when all is over men will do me justice and that poor fellow will bitterly lament his cowardice it will be agony to him to remember that one word would have preserved my life then when no power on earth can recall me to existence he is not a bad man and could he now have represented to him his after remorse he would cease to exhibit such lamentable cowardice a cowardice after all that has its origin in the remnants of good feeling the fear of shame horror at having participated in so fearful a tragedy and a desire to throw off the consequences of his actions which is the perpetual and stinging accompaniment of guilt form his motives but could he be told how immeasurably his sense of guilt will be increased if his silence occasions my death all these would become minor considerations and vanish on the instant and would it be impossible said elizabeth to awaken this feeling in him by no means replied falkner though it is out of our power we sent a mercenary not indeed altogether lukewarm but still not penetrated by that ardour nor capable of that eloquence which is necessary to move a weak man like the one he had to deal with osborne is in some sort a villain but he is too feeble minded to follow out his vocation he always desired to be honest now he has the reputation of being such from being one of those miserable creatures the refuse of civilization preying upon the vices while they are the outcasts of society he has become respectable and trustworthy in the eyes of others he very naturally clings to advantages dearly earned lately gained he fancies to preserve them by deserting me could the veil be lifted could the conviction be imparted of the wretch he will become in his own eyes and of the universal execration that will be heaped on him after my death his mind would entirely change and he would be as eager i had almost said to come forward as now he is set upon concealment and silence chapter xliv elizabeth listened in silence all that had passed made a deep impression from the moment that the solicitor had expressed a wish that falkner had a zealous friend to cross the atlantic till now that he himself dilated on the good that would result from representations being clearly and fervently made to osborne she was revolving an idea that absorbed her whole faculties this idea was no other than going to america herself she had no doubt that seeing osborne she could persuade him and the difficulties of the journey appeared slight to her who had travelled so much she asked falkner many questions and his answers confirmed her more and more in her plan no objection presented itself to her mind already she felt sure of success there was scarcely time it was true for the voyage but she hoped that the trial might be again deferred if reasonable hopes were held out of osborne's ultimate arrival it was painful to leave falkner without a friend but the object of her journey was paramount even to this consideration but it must it should be undertaken still she said nothing of her scheme and falkner could not guess at what was passing in her mind wrapped in the revery suggested by such a plan she returned home in the evening without thinking of the apparition of neville which had so filled her mind in the morning it was not till at her own door that the thought glanced through her mind and she remembered that she had seen nothing of him she looked across the open space where he had stood the evening before it was entirely vacant she felt disappointed and saddened and she began to reflect on her total friendlessness no one to aid her in preparations for her voyage none to advise her sole resource was in hirelings but her independent firm spirit quickly threw off this weakness and she began a note to mr colville asking him to call on her as she wished to arrange everything definitively before she spoke to falkner as she wrote she heard a rapid decided step in her quiet street followed by a hurried yet gentle knock at her door she started up it is he the words were on her lips when gerard entered she held out her hand gladness thrilling through her whole frame her heart throbbing wildly her eyes lighted up with joy this is indeed kind she cried oh mr neville how happy your visit makes me he did not look happy he had grown paler and thinner and the melancholy which had sat on his countenance before banished for a time by her had returned with the addition of a look of wildness that reminded her of the youth of baden elizabeth was shocked to remark these traces of suffering and her next impulse was to ask what has happened i fear some new misfortune has occurred it is the property of misfortune to be ever new he replied to be always producing fresh and more miserable results i have no right to press my feelings on you your burden is sufficient but i could not refrain any longer from seeing in what way adversity had exerted its pernicious influence over you his manner was gloomy and agitated she resigned devoted to her duties commanding herself day by day to fulfil her task of patience and of acquiring cheerfulness for falkner's sake she imagined that some fresh disaster must be the occasion of these marks of emotion she did not know that fruitless struggles to alleviate the evils of her situation vain broodings over its horrors and bitter regret at losing her had robbed him of sleep of appetite of all repose i despise myself for my weakness he said when i see your fortitude you are more than woman more than human being ever was and you must feel the utmost contempt for one whom fortune bends and breaks as it does me you are well however and half my dreams of misery have been false and vain god guards and preserves you i ought to have placed more faith in him but tell me dear mr neville tell me what has happened nothing he replied and does not that imply the worst i cannot make up my mind to endure the visitation of ill fallen upon us it drives me from place to place like an unlaid ghost i am very selfish to speak in this manner yet it is your sufferings that fill my mind to bursting were all the evil poured on my own head while you were spared welcome most welcome would be the bitterest infliction but you elizabeth you are my cruel father's victim and the future will be more hideous than the hideous present elizabeth was shocked and surprised what could he mean the future she replied will bring my dear father's liberation how then can that be so bad he looked earnestly and inquiringly on her yes she continued my sorrows heavy as they are have not that additional pang i have no doubt of the ultimate justice that will be rendered my father we have much to endure in the interim much that undermines the fortitude and visits the heart with sickening throes there is no help but patience let us have patience and this adversity will pass away the prison and the trial will be over and freedom and security again be ours i see how it is replied neville we each live in a world of our own and it is wicked in me to give you a glimpse of the scene as it is presented to me yet speak explain said elizabeth you have frightened me so much that any explanation must be better than the thoughts which your words your manner suggest nay said neville do not let my follies infect you your views your hopes are doubtless founded on reason it is if you will forgive the allusion that may seem too light for so sad a subject but the old story of the silver and brazen shield i see the dark the fearful side of things i live among your enemies that is the enemies of mr falkner i hear of nothing but his guilt and the expiation prepared for it i am maddened by all i hear i have implored my father not to pursue his vengeance convinced as i am of the truth of mr falkner's narration the idea that one so gifted should be made over to the fate that awaits him is abhorrent and when i think that you are involved in such a scene of wrong and horror my blood freezes in my veins i have implored my father i have quarrelled with him i have made sophia advocate the cause of justice against malice all in vain could you see the old man my father i mean pardon my irreverence how he revels in the demoniacal hope of revenge and with what hideous delight he gloats upon the detail of ignominy to be inflicted on one so much his superior in every noble quality you would feel the loathing i do he heaps sarcasm and contempt on my feeble spirit as he names my pardon of my mother's destroyer my esteem for him and my sympathy for you but that does not touch me it is the knowledge that he will succeed and you be lost and miserable for ever that drives me to desperation i fancied that these thoughts must pursue you even more painfully than they do me i saw you writhing beneath the tortures of despair wasting away under the influence of intense misery you haunted my dreams accompanied by every image of horror sometimes you were bleeding ghastly dying sometimes you took my poor mother's form as falkner describes it snatched cold and pale from the waves other visions flitted by still more frightful despairing of moving my father abhorring the society of every human being i have been living for the last month at dromore a few days ago my father arrived there i wondered till i heard the cause the time for expecting osborne had arrived as vultures have instinct for carrion so he swooped down at the far off scent of evil fortune he had an emissary at liverpool on the watch to hear of this man's arrival disgusted at this foul appetite for evil i left him i came here only to see you to gaze on you afar was to purify the world of the 'blasts from hell' which the bad passions i have so long contemplated spread round me my father learned whither i had gone i had a letter from him this morning you may guess at its contents he triumphs in osborne's refusal to appear said elizabeth who was much moved by the picture of hatred and malice neville had presented to her and trembled from head to foot as she listened from the violent emotions his account excited and the vehemence of his manner as he spoke he does indeed triumph replied neville and you you and mr falkner do you not despair if you could see my dear father said elizabeth her courage returning at the thought you would see how innocence and a noble mind can sustain at the worst he does not despair he bears the present with fortitude he looks to the future with resignation his soul is firm his spirit inflexible and you share these feelings partly i do and partly i have other thoughts to support me osborne's cowardice is a grievous blow but it must be remedied the man we sent to bring him was too easily discouraged other means must be tried i shall go to america i shall see osborne and you cannot doubt of my success you cried neville you to go to america you to follow the traces of a man who hides himself impossible this is worse madness than all does falkner consent to so senseless an expedition you use strong expressions interrupted elizabeth i do he replied and i have a right to do so i beg your pardon but my meaning is justifiable you must not undertake this voyage it is as useless as improper suppose yourself arrived on the shores of wide america you seek a man who conceals himself you know not where can you perambulate large cities cross wide extents of country go from town to town in search of him it is by personal exertion alone that he can be found and your age and sex wholly prevent that yet i shall go said elizabeth thoughtfully so much is left undone because we fancy it impossible to do which upon endeavour is found plain and easy if insurmountable obstacles oppose themselves i must submit but i see none yet i have not the common fears of a person whose life has been spent in one spot i have been a traveller and know that but for the fatigue it is as easy to go a thousand miles as a hundred if there are dangers and difficulties they will appear light to me encountered for my dear father's sake she looked beautiful as an angel as she spoke her independent spirit had nothing rough in its texture it did not arise from a love of opposition but from a belief that in fulfilling a duty she could not be opposed or injured her fearlessness was that of a generous heart that could not believe in evil intentions she explained more fully to her friend the reasons that induced her determination she repeated falkner's account of osborne's character the injury that it was believed would arise from his refusal to appear and the probable facility of persuading him were he addressed by one zealous in the cause neville listened attentively she paused he was lost in thought and made no reply she continued to speak but he continued mute till at last she said you are conquered i know you yield and agree that my journey is a duty a necessity we are both apt it would seem he replied to see our duties in a strong light and to make sudden or they may be called rash resolutions perhaps we both go too far and are in consequence reprehended by those about us in each other then let us find approval you must not go to america for your going would be useless with all your zeal you could not succeed but i will go of course this act will be treated as madness or worse by sir boyvill and the rest but my own mind assures me that i do right for many years i devoted myself to discovering my mother's fate i have discovered it falkner's narrative tells all but clear and satisfactory as that is to me others choose to cast frightful doubts over its truth and conjure up images the most revolting have they any foundation i do not believe it but many do and all assert that the approaching trial alone can establish the truth this trial is but a mockery unless it is fair and complete it cannot be that without osborne surely then it neither misbecomes me as her son nor as the son of sir boyvill to undertake any action that will tend to clear up the mystery i am resolved i shall go be assured that i shall not return without osborne you will allow me to take your place to act for you you do not distrust my zeal elizabeth had regarded her own resolves as the simple dictates of reason and duty but her heart was deeply touched by neville's offer tears rushed into her eyes as she replied in a voice faltering with emotion i fear this cannot be it will meet with too much opposition but never never can i repay your generosity in but imagining so great a service it is a service to both he said and as to the opposition i shall meet that is my affair you know that nothing will stop me when once resolved and i am resolved the inner voice that cannot be mistaken assures me that i do right i ask no other approval a sense of justice perhaps of compassion for the original author of all our wretchedness ought probably to move me but i will not pretend to be better than i am were falkner alone concerned i fear i should be lukewarm but not one cloud nor the shadow of a cloud shall rest on my mother's fate all shall be clear all universally acknowledged nor shall your life be blotted and your heart broken by the wretched fate of him to whom you cling with matchless fidelity he is innocent i know but if the world thinks and acts by him as a murderer how could you look up again through you i succeeded in my task to you i owe unspeakable gratitude which it is my duty to repay yet away with such expressions you know that my desire to serve you is boundless that i love you beyond expression that every injury you receive is trebled upon me that vain were every effort of self command i must do that thing that would benefit you though the whole world rose to forbid you are of more worth in your innocence and nobleness than a nation of men such as my father do you think i can hesitate in my determinations thus founded thus impelled more vehement more impassioned than elizabeth neville bore down her objections while he awakened all her tenderness and gratitude now i prove myself your friend he said proudly now heaven affords me opportunity to serve you and i thank it he looked so happy so wildly delighted while a more still but not less earnest sense of joy filled her heart they were young and they loved this of itself was bliss but the cruel circumstances around them added to their happiness by drawing them closer together and giving fervour and confidence to their attachment and now that he saw a mode of serving her and she felt entire reliance on his efforts the last veil and barrier fell from between them and their hearts became united by that perfect love which can result alone from entire confidence and acknowledged unshackled sympathy always actuated by generous impulses but often rash in his determinations and impetuous in their fulfilment full of the warmest sensibility hating that the meanest thing that breathed should endure pain and feeling the most poignant sympathy for all suffering neville had been maddened by his own thoughts while he brooded over the position in which elizabeth was placed not one of those various circumstances that alleviate disaster to those who endure it presented themselves to his imagination he saw adversity in its most hideous form without relief or disguise names and images appending to falkner's frightful lot which he and elizabeth carefully banished from their thoughts haunted him the fate of the basest felon hung over the prisoner neville believed that it must inevitably fall on him he often wondered that he did not contrive to escape that elizabeth devoted and heroic did not contrive some means of throwing open his dungeon's doors he had endeavoured to open his father's eyes to soften his heart in vain he had exerted himself to discover whether any trace of long past circumstances existed that might tend to acquit falkner he had gone to treby visited the graves of the hapless parents of elizabeth seen mrs baker and gathered there the account of his landing but nothing helped to elucidate the mystery of his mother's death falkner's own account was the only trace left behind that bore the stamp of truth in every line and appeared to him so honourable a tribute to poor alithea's memory that he looked with disgust on his father's endeavours to cast upon it suspicions and interpretations the most hideous and appalling in the first instance he had been bewildered by sir boyvill's sophistry and half conquered by his plausible arguments but a short time and the very circumstance of elizabeth's fidelity to his cause sufficed to show him the baseness of his motives and the real injury he did his mother's fame resolved to clear the minds of other men from the prejudice against the prisoner thus spread abroad and at least to secure a fair trial neville made no secret of his belief that falkner was innocent he represented him everywhere as a gentleman a man of humanity and honour whose crime ought to receive its punishment from his own conscience and at the hand of the husband or son of the victim in the field and whom to pursue as his father did was at once futile and disgraceful sir boyvill irritated by falkner's narrative his vanity wounded to the quick by the avowed indifference of his wife was enraged beyond all bounds by the opposition of his son unable to understand his generous nature and relying on his previous zeal for his mother's cause he had not doubted but that his revenge would find a' ready ally in him his present arguments his esteem for their enemy his desire that he should be treated with a forbearance which between gentlemen was but an adherence to the code of honour appeared to sir boyvill insanity and worse a weakness the most despicable a want of resentment the most low minded but he cared not the game was in his hands revelling in the idea of his enemy's ignominious sufferings he more than half persuaded himself that his accusation was true and that the punishment of a convicted felon would at last satisfy his thirst for revenge a feeble old man tottering on the verge of the grave he gloried to think that his grasp was still deadly his power acknowledged in throes of agony by him by whom he had been injured returning to dromore from carlisle gerard sought his father osborne's refusal to appear crowned sir boyvill's utmost hopes and his sarcastic congratulations when he saw his son expressed all the malice of his heart gerard replied with composure that he did indeed fear that this circumstance would prove fatal to the course of justice but that it must not tamely be submitted to and that he himself was going to america to induce osborne to come that nothing might be wanting to elucidate the mystery of his mother's fate and to render the coming trial full fair and satisfactory such an announcement rendered for a moment sir boyvill speechless with rage a violent scene ensued gerard resolved and satisfied of the propriety of his resolution was calm and firm sir boyvill habituated to the use of vituperative expressions boiled over with angry denunciations and epithets of abuse he called his son the disgrace of his family the opprobrium of mankind the detractor of his mother's fame gerard smiled yet at heart he deeply felt the misery of thus for ever finding an opponent in his father and it required all the enthusiasm and passion of his nature to banish the humiliating and saddening influence of sir boyvill's indignation they parted worse friends than ever sir boyvill set out for town gerard repaired to liverpool the wind was contrary there was little hope of change he thought that it would conduce to his success in america if he spent the necessary interval in seeing hoskins again and also in consulting with his friend the american minister so in all haste having first secured his passage on board a vessel that was to sail in four or five days he also set out for london chapter xlv the philosophy of falkner was not proof against the intelligence that gerard neville was about to undertake the voyage to america for the sake of inducing osborne to come over elizabeth acquainted him with her design and her friend's determination to replace her with sparkling eyes and cheeks flushed by the agitation of pleasure the pure pleasure of having such proof of the worth of him she loved falkner was even more deeply touched even though he felt humiliated by the very generosity that filled him with admiration his blood was stirred and his feelings tortured him by a sense of his own demerits and the excellence of one he had injured better die without a word than purchase my life thus were the words hovering on his lips yet it was no base cost that he paid and he could only rejoice at the virtues of the son of her whom he had so passionately loved there are moments when the past is remembered with intolerable agony and when to alter events which occurred at the distance of many years becomes a passion and a thirst his regret at alithea's marriage seemed all renewed his agony that thence forth she was not to be the half of his existence as he had hoped that her child was not his child that her daily life her present pleasures and future hopes were divorced from his all these feelings were revived together with a burning jealousy as if instead of being a buried corpse she had still adorned her home with her loveliness and virtues such thoughts lost their poignancy by degrees and he could charm elizabeth by dwelling on gerard's praises and he remarked with pleasure that she resumed her vivacity and recovered the colour and elasticity of motion which she had lost she did not feel less for falkner but her contemplations had lost their sombre hue they were full of neville his voyage his exertions his success his return and the spirit of love that animated each of these acts were gone over and over again in her waking dreams unbidden smiles gleamed in her countenance her ideas were gayly coloured and her conversation gained a variety and cheerfulness that lightened the burden of their prison hours meanwhile neville arrived in london he visited the american minister and learned from him that osborne had given up the place he held and had left washington no one knew whither he was gone these events being still too recent to leave any trace behind it was evident that to seek and find him would be a work of trouble and time and neville felt that not a moment must be lost december was drawing to a close the voyages to and from america might if not favourable consume the whole interval that still remained before the spring assizes hoskins he learned was gone to liverpool he visited lady cecil before he left town though somewhat tainted by worldliness yet this very feeling made her highly disapprove sir boyvill's conduct a plausible and she believed true account was given of mrs neville's death exonerating her redounding indeed to her honour it was injurious to all to cast doubts upon this tale it was vulgar and base to pursue revenge with such malicious and cruel pertinacity falkner was a gentleman and deserved to be treated as such and now he and elizabeth were mixed up in loathsome scenes and details that made lady cecil shudder even to think of that gerard should go to america as the advocate as it were of falkner startled her but he represented his voyage in a simpler light as not being undertaken for his benefit but for the sake of justice and truth sir boyvill came in upon them while they were discussing this measure he was absolutely phrensied by his son's conduct and views his exasperation but tended to disgust and did not operate to shake their opinions neville hastened back to liverpool a southwest wind reigned whose violence prevented any vessel from sailing for america it was evident that the passage would be long and perhaps hazardous neville thought only of the delay but this made him anxious a portion of his time was spent in seeking for hoskins but he was not to be found at last it was notified to him that the wind had a little changed and that the packet was about to sail he hurried on board soon they were tossing on a tempestuous sea they lost sight of land sky and ocean each dusky and the one rising at each moment into more tumultuous commotion surrounded them neville supporting himself by a rope looked out over the horizon a few months before he had anticipated the same voyage over a summer sea now he went under far other auspices the veil was raised the mystery explained but the wintry storms that had gathered round him were but types of the tempestuous passions which the discoveries he had made raised in the hearts of all for three days and nights the vessel beat about in the irish channel unable to make any way three days were thus lost to their voyage and when were they to arrive impatient almost terrified by the delay which attended his endeavours neville began to despair of success on the fourth night the gale rose to a hurricane there was no choice but to run before it by noon the following day the captain thought himself very lucky to make the harbour of liverpool and though the gale had much abated and the wind had veered into a more favourable quarter it was necessary to run in to refit with bitter feelings of disappointment neville disembarked several days must elapse before the packet would be able to put to sea so he abandoned the idea of going by her and finding a new york merchantman preparing to sail at an early hour the following morning he resolved to take his passage on board he hastened to the american coffee house to see the captain and make the necessary arrangements for his voyage the captain had just left the tavern but a waiter came up to neville and told him that the mr hoskins concerning whom he had before inquired was in the house in a private room show me to him said neville and followed the man as he went to announce him hoskins was not alone he had a friend with him and they were seated over their wine on each side of the fire neville could not help being struck with the confusion evinced by both as he entered the person with hoskins was a fair light haired rather good looking man though past the prime of life he had at once an expression of good nature and cunning in his face and added to this a timid baffled look which grew into something very like dismay when the waiter announced mr neville good morning sir said hoskins i hear that you have been inquiring for me i thought all our business was settled on your side probably replied neville on mine i have reasons for wishing to see you i have been seeking you in vain in london and here yes i know said the other i went round by ravenglass to take leave of the old woman before i crossed and here i am my passage taken with not an hour to lose i sail by the owyhee captain bateman then we shall have time enough for all my inquiries observed neville i came here for the very purpose of arranging my passage with captain bateman you sir are you going to america i thought that was all at an end' it is more necessary than ever i must see osborne i must bring him over his testimony is necessary to clear up the mystery that hangs over my mother's fate you are nearer hanging mr falkner without him than with him said hoskins i would bring him over for the very purpose of saving a man whom i believe to be innocent of the crime he is charged with for that purpose i go to america i wish the truth to be established i have no desire for revenge and do you really go to america for that purpose repeated hoskins certainly i consider it my duty replied neville nay it may be said that i went for this design for i sailed by the john adams which has been driven back by contrary winds i disembarked only half an hour ago that beats all cried hoskins why do you know i have more than half a mind to tell you you had really sailed for america for the purpose of bringing osborne over and you now intend taking a passage on board the owyhee certainly why not what is there so strange in all this i sought you for the sake of making inquiries that might guide me in my search for osborne who wishes to conceal himself you could not have addressed a better man by the lord he's a craven and deserves no better so i'll just let out mr neville that osborne sneaked out of this room at the instant he saw you come into it neville had seen hoskins's companion disappear he thought it but an act of civility the strangeness of this coincidence the course of events at once so contrary and so propitious staggered him for a moment they tell of the rattlesnake said hoskins that fixing its eye on its prey a bird becomes fascinated and wheels round nearer and nearer till he falls into the jaws of the enemy poor osborne he wishes himself on the shores of the pacific to be far enough off and here he is and turn and twist as he will it will end by the law grasping him by the shoulder and dragging him to the very noose he so fears to slip into not that he helped to murder the lady you do not believe that mr neville you do not think that the lady was murdered i would stake my existence that she was not said neville were it otherwise i should have no desire to see osborne or to interfere strange most strange it is that he should be here and he is come you think with no design of offering his testimony to clear mr falkner he is come under a feigned name replied hoskins under pretence that he was sent by osborne he has brought a quantity of attested declarations and hopes to serve mr falkner without endangering his own neck it was even so osborne was a weak man good hearted as it is called but a craven no sooner did he hear that hillary had sailed for europe and that he might consider himself safe than he grew uneasy on another score he had still possession even while he had denied all knowledge of the writer of falkner's letter representing to him the necessity of coming over it was simply but forcibly written every word went to the heart of osborne now that he believed that his conduct would make over his generous benefactor to an ignominious end this idea haunted him like an unlaid ghost yet if they hanged falkner what should prevent them from hanging him too suspicion must fall equally on both when hillary had urged the case many other objections had presented themselves to osborne's mind he thought of the new honest course he had pursued so long the honourable station he had gained the independence and respectability of his present life and he shrunk from giving up these advantages and becoming again in all men's eyes the osborne whose rascality he had left behind in england it seemed hard that he should feel the weight of the chain that bound his former existence to his present one when he fondly hoped that time had broken it but these minor considerations vanished as soon as the idea of falkner's danger fastened itself on his mind it is always easy to fall back upon a state of being which once was ours the uncertain disreputable life osborne had once led he had gladly bidden adieu to but the traces were still there and he could fall into the way of it without any great shock besides this he knew that hillary had made his coming and the cause of it known to the legal authorities in washington and though he might persist in his denials still he felt that he should be universally disbelieved a dislike at being questioned and looked askance upon by his american friends made him already turn his eyes westward a longing to see the old country arose unbidden in his heart above all he could neither rest nor sleep nor eat nor perform any of the offices of life for the haunting image of his benefactor left by him to die a felon's death not that he felt tempted to alter his determination and to come forward to save him on the contrary his blood grew chill and his flesh shrunk at the thought but still he might conceal himself in england no one would suspect him of being there he would be on the spot to watch the course of events and if it was supposed that he could render any assistance without compromising himself he should at least be able to judge fairly how far he might concede his vacillating mind could go no further in its conclusions hoskins had rightly compared him to the bird and the rattlesnake he was fascinated he could not avoid drawing nearer and nearer to the danger which he believed to be yawning to swallow him ten days after hillary left america he was crossing the atlantic hoskins was the first person he saw on landing the second was neville his heart grew cold he felt himself in the toils how bitterly he repented his voyage coward as he was he died a thousand deaths from fear of that one which in fact there was no danger of his incurring that osborne should of his own accord have come to england appeared to smooth everything neville did not doubt that he should be able to persuade him to come forward at the right time he instructed hoskins to reassure him and to induce him to see him and if he objected to contrive that they should meet he promised to take no measures for securing his person but to leave him in all liberty to act as he chose he depended that the same uneasy conscience that brought him from america to liverpool would induce him at last after various throes and struggles to act as it was supposed he would have done at the beginning but day after day passed and osborne was not to be found hoskins had never seen him again and it was impossible to say whither he was gone or where he was hid the owyhee whose voyage had again been delayed by contrary winds now sailed hoskins went with her it was possible that osborne might be on board returning to the land of refuge neville saw the captain and he denied having such a passenger but he might be bound to secrecy or osborne might have disguised himself neville went on board he carefully examined each person he questioned both crew and passengers he even bribed the sailors to inform him if any one were secreted the owyhee was not however the only vessel sailing nearly thirty packets and merchantmen who had been detained by foul winds were but waiting for a tide to carry them out neville deliberated whether he should not apply to a magistrate for a search warrant he was averse to this nay repugnant it was of the first importance to the utility of osborne as a witness that he should surrender himself voluntarily the seizing him by force as an accomplice in the murder would only place him beside falkner in the dock and render his evidence of no avail and his neville's causing his arrest could only be regarded as a piece of rancorous hostility against the accused yet to suffer him to depart from the english shores was madness and worse still to be left in doubt of whether he had gone or remained if the first were ascertained neville could take his passage also and there might still be time to bring him back when we act for another we are far more liable to hesitation than when our deeds regard ourselves only we dread to appear lukewarm we dread to mar all by officiousness ill success always appears a fault and yet we dare not make a bold venture such as we should not hesitate upon were it our own cause neville felt certain that falkner would not himself deliberate but risk all to possess himself of the person of osborne still he dared not take so perilous perhaps so fatal a step the tide rose and the various docks filled one by one the american bound vessels dropped out and put to sea it was a moment of agony to neville to see their sails unfurl swell to the wind and make a speedy and distant offing he now began to accuse himself bitterly of neglect he believed that there was but one mode of redeeming his fault to hurry on board one of the packets and to arrive in america as soon as osborne whom he felt convinced was already on his way thither swift in his convictions rash in execution uncertainty was peculiarly hostile to his nature and these moments of vacillation and doubt and then of self reproach at having lost all in consequence were the most painful of his life to determine to do something was some consolation and now he resolved on his voyage he hurried back to his hotel for a few necessaries and money on his entrance a letter was put into his hands the contents changed the whole current of his ideas his countenance cleared up the tumult of his thoughts subsided into a happy calm changing all his plans instead of undertaking a voyage to america he the same evening set out for london chapter xlvi the prisoner and his faithful companion knew nothing of these momentous changes day by day elizabeth withdrew from the fire to the only window in her father's room moving her embroidery table close to it her eyes turned however to the sky instead of to the flowers she was working and leaning her cheek upon her hand she perpetually watched the clouds gerard was already she fancied on the waste of waters yet the clouds did not change their direction they all sped one way and that contrary to his destination thus she passed her mornings and when she returned to her own abode where her heart could more entirely spend its thoughts on her lover and his voyage her lonely room was no longer lonely nor the gloomy season any longer gloomy more than happy a breathless rapture quickened the beatings of her heart as she told over again and again neville's virtues and dearer than all his claims on her gratitude falkner saw with pleasure the natural effects of love and hope add to the cheerfulness of his beloved child diffuse a soft charm over her person her motions and her voice and impart a playful tenderness to her before rather serious manners youth love and happiness are so very beautiful in their conjunction god grant he thought i do not mar this fair creature's life may she be happier than alithea if man can be worthy of her gerard neville surely is as he turned his eyes silently from the book that apparently occupied him and contemplated her pensive countenance whose expression showed that she was wrapped in yet enjoying her thoughts retrospect made him sad he went over his own life its clouded morning the glad beams that broke out to dissipate those clouds and the final setting amid tempests and wreck was all life like this must all be disappointed hope baffled desires lofty imaginations engendering fatal acts and bringing the proud thus low would she at his age view life as he did a weary wilderness a tangled endless labyrinth leading by one rough path or another to a bitter end he hoped not her innocence must receive other reward from heaven it was on a day as they were thus occupied falkner refrained from interrupting elizabeth's revery which he felt was sweeter to her than any converse and appeared absorbed in reading suddenly she exclaimed the wind has changed dear father indeed it has changed it is favourable now do you not feel how much colder it is the wind has got to the north there is a little east in it his voyage will not be a long one if this change only lasts falkner answered her by a smile but it was humiliating to think of the object of that voyage and her cheerful voice announcing that it was to be prosperous struck he knew not why a saddening chord at this moment he heard the bolts of the chamber door pushed back and the key turn in the lock the turnkey entered followed by another man who hesitated as he came forward and then as he glanced at the inhabitants of the room drew back saying there is some mistake mr falkner is not here but for his habitual self command falkner had started up and made an exclamation so surprised was he to behold the person who entered for he recognised his visitant on the instant he himself was far more changed by the course of years time sickness and remorse had used other than praxitilean art and had defaced the lines of grace and power which had marked him many years ago before his hands had dug alithea's grave he was indeed surprised to see who entered but he showed no sign of wonder only saying with a calm smile no there is no mistake i am the man you seek the other now apparently recognised him and advanced timidly and in confusion the turnkey left them and falkner then said osborne you deserve my thanks for this but i did believe that it would come to this no said osborne i do not deserve thanks i and he looked confused and glanced towards elizabeth falkner followed his eye and understanding his look said you do not fear being betrayed by a lady osborne you are safe here as in america i see how it is you are here under a false name no one is aware that you are the man who a few weeks ago refused to appear to save a fellow creature from death i see no way to do that now replied osborne hesitatingly i do not come for that i come i could not stay away i thought something might be done elizabeth my love said falkner you at least will thank mr osborne for his spontaneous services you are watching the clouds which were to bear along the vessel towards him and beyond our hopes he is already here elizabeth listened breathlessly she feared to utter a word lest it should prove a dream now gathering falkner's meaning she came forward and with all a woman's grace addressed the trembling man who already looked at the door as if he longed to be on the other side fearful that he was caught in his own toils for as hoskins said the fascinated prey had wheeled yet nearer to his fate involuntarily he had been unable to resist his desire to see falkner and learn how it was with him but he still resolved not to risk anything he had represented himself to the magistrates as coming from osborne showing false papers and a declaration drawn up by him at washington and attested before official men there setting forth falkner's innocence he had brought this over to see if it would serve his benefactor and had thus got access to him such was his reliance on the honour of his patron that he had not hesitated in placing himself in his power well aware that he should not be detained by him against his will for still his heart quailed and his soul shrunk from rendering him the service that would save his life his manner revealed his thoughts to the observant falkner but elizabeth less well read in men's hearts younger and more sanguine saw in his arrival the completion of her hopes and she thanked him with so much warmth and with such heartfelt praises of his kindness and generosity that osborne began to think that his greatest difficulty would be in resisting her fascination and disappointing her wishes he stammered out at last some lame excuses all he could do consistently with safety they might command he had shown this by coming over more could not be asked could not be expected he himself god knew was innocent so was mr falkner of the crime he was charged with but he had no hand whatever in the transaction he was not in his confidence he had not known even who the lady was his testimony after all must be worth nothing for he had nothing to tell and for this he was to expose himself to disgrace and death acquiring courage at the sound of his own voice osborne grew fluent elizabeth drew back she looked anxiously at falkner and saw a cloud of displeasure and scorn gather over his countenance she put her hand on his as if to check the outbreak of his indignation yet she herself as osborne went on turned her eyes flashing with disdain upon him the miserable fellow cowed before the glances of both he shifted from one foot to the other he dared not look up but he knew that their eyes were on him and he felt the beams transfix him and wither up his soul there are weak men who yield to persuasion there are weaker who are vanquished by reproaches and contempt of such was osborne his fluency faded into broken accents his voice died away as a last effort he moved towards the door enough sir said falkner in a calm contemptuous voice and now begone hasten away do not stop till you have gained the shore the ship the waves of the atlantic be assured i shall not send for you a second time i have no desire to owe my life to you if i could save your life mr falkner he began but we will not argue that point interrupted falkner it is enough that it is generally asserted that your testimony is necessary for my preservation were my crime as great as it is said to be it would find its punishment in that humiliation go sir you are safe i would not advise you to loiter here return to america walls have ears in abodes like these you may be forced to save a fellow creature against your will hasten then away go eat drink and be merry whatever betides me not even my ghost shall haunt you meanwhile i would beg you no longer to insult me by your presence begone at once you are angry sir said osborne timidly i hope not replied falkner who had indeed felt his indignation rise and checked himself i should be very sorry to feel anger against a coward i pity you you will repent this when too late oh do not say so cried elizabeth do not say he will repent when too late but now in time i am sure that he repents do you not mr osborne you are told that your fears are vain you know mr falkner is far too noble to draw you into danger to save himself you know even that he does not fear death but ignominy eternal horrible disgrace and the end the frightful end prepared even he must recoil from that and you no you cannot in cold blood and with calm forethought make him over to it you cannot i see that you cannot forbear elizabeth interrupted falkner in a tone of displeasure i will not have my life nor even my honour begged by you let the worst come the condemnation the hangman i can bear all except the degradation of supplicating such a man as that i see how it is said osborne yes you do with me as you will i feared this and yet i thought myself firm do with me as you will call the jailer i will surrender myself he turned pale as death and tottered to a chair falkner turned his back on him go sir he repeated i reject your sacrifice no father no cried elizabeth eagerly say not so you accept it and i also with thanks and gratitude yet it is no sacrifice mr osborne i assure you that is not at least the sacrifice you fear all is far easier than you think there is no prison for you your arrival need not yet be known your consent being obtained a pardon will be at once granted you are to appear as a witness not as a her voice faltered she turned to falkner her eyes brimming over with tears osborne caught the infection he was touched he was cheered also by elizabeth's assurances which he hoped that he might believe hitherto he had been too frightened and bewildered to hear accurately even what he had been told he fancied that he must be tried the pardon might or might not come afterward the youth earnestness and winning beauty of elizabeth moved him and now that his fears were a little allayed he could see more clearly he was even more touched by the appearance of his former benefactor dignity and yet endurance suffering as well as fortitude marked his traits there was something so innately noble and yet so broken by fortune expressed in his commanding yet attenuated features and person he was a wreck that spoke so plainly of the glorious being he had once been there was so much majesty in his decay such real innocence sat on his high and open brow streaked though it was with disease such lofty composure in his countenance pale from confinement and suffering that osborne felt a mixture of respect and pity that soon rose above every other feeling reassured with regard to himself and looking on his patron with eyes that caught the infection of elizabeth's tears he came forward i beg your pardon mr falkner he said for my doubts for my cowardice if you please so to name it i request you to forget it and to permit me to come forward in your behalf i trust you will not disdain my offer though late it comes i assure you from my heart there was no mock dignity about falkner a sunny smile broke over his features as he held out his hand to osborne and from my heart i thank you he replied and deeply regret that you are to suffer any pain through me mine was the crime you the instrument it is hard very hard that you should be brought to this through your complaisance to me real danger for you there is none or i would die this worst death rather than expose you to it elizabeth now in all gladness wrote a hasty note desiring mr colville to come to them that all might at once be arranged and gerard dear father she said we must write to mr neville to recall him from his far and fruitless journey mr neville is in liverpool said osborne i saw him the very day before i came away he doubtless was on the look out for me and i dare swear hoskins betrayed me we must be on our guard fear nothing from mr neville replied elizabeth he is too good and generous not to advocate justice and truth he is convinced of my father's innocence they were interrupted the solicitor entered osborne's appearance was beyond his hopes he could not believe in so much good fortune he had begun to doubt suspect and fear he speedily carried off his godsend as he named him to talk over and bring into form his evidence and all that appertained to his surrender thus leaving falkner with his adopted child such a moment repaid for much for elizabeth's hopes were high and she knelt before falkner embracing his knees thanking heaven in a rapture of gratitude he also was thankful yet mortification and wounded pride struggled in his heart with a sense of gratitude for unhoped for preservation his haughty spirit rebelled against the obligation he owed to so mean a man as osborne it required hours of meditation of reawakened remorse for alithea's fate of renewed wishes that she should be vindicated before all the world of remembered love for the devoted girl at his feet to bring him back from the tumult of contending passions to the fortitude and humility which he at every moment strove to cultivate elizabeth's sweet voice dispelled such storms and rewarded him for the serenity he at last regained it was impossible not to feel sympathy in her happiness and joy in possessing the affection of so gentle yet so courageous and faithful a heart elizabeth's happiness was even more complete when she left him and sat in her solitary room there where gerard had so lately visited her and his image and her gratitude towards him mingled more with her thoughts her last act that night was to write to him to tell him what had happened it was her note that he received at liverpool on the eve of his second departure and which had changed his purpose he had immediately set out for london to communicate the good tidings to lady cecil chapter xlvii these had been hours of sunshine for the prisoner and his child such as seldom visit the precincts of a jail and soon too soon they changed and the usual gloom returned to the abode of suffering in misfortune various moods assail us at first we are struck stunned and overwhelmed then the elastic spirit rises it tries to shape misery in its own way it adapts itself to it it finds unknown consolations arise out of circumstances which in moments of prosperity were unregarded but this temper of mind is not formed for endurance as a sick person finds comfort in a new posture at first but after a time the posture becomes restrained and wearisome thus after mustering fortitude patience the calm spirit of philosophy and the tender one of piety and finding relief suddenly the heart rebels its old desires and old habits recur and we are the more dissatisfied from being disappointed in those modes of support in which we trusted there was a perpetual struggle in falkner's heart hatred of life pride a yearning for liberty and a sore quick spirit of impatience for all the bars and forms that stood between him and it swelled like a tide in his soul he hated himself for having brought himself thus low he was angry that he had exposed elizabeth to such a scene he reviled his enemies in his heart he accused destiny then again if he but shut his eyes the stormy river the desolate sands and the one fair being dead at his feet presented themselves and remorse like a wind drove back the flood he felt that he had deserved it all that he had himself woven the chain of circumstances which he called his fate while his innocence of the crime brought against him imparted a lofty spirit of fortitude and even of repose elizabeth with an angel's love watched the changes of his temper her sensibility was often wounded by his sufferings but her benign disposition was so fertile of compassion and forbearance that her own mood was never irritated by finding her attempts to console fruitless she listened meekly when his overladen heart spent itself in invectives against the whole system of life or catching a favourable moment she strove to raise his mind to nobler and purer thoughts unobtrusive but never weary eagerly gathering all good tidings banishing the ill her smiles her tears her cheerfulness or calm sadness by turns relieved and comforted him winter came upon them it was wild and drear their abode far in the north of the island was cold beyond their experience the dark prison walls were whitened by snow the bars of their windows were laden falkner looked out the snow drifted against his face one peep at the dusky sky was all that was allowed him he thought of the wide steppes of russia the swift sledges and how he longed for freedom elizabeth as she walked home through the frost and sleet gave a sigh for the soft seasons of greece and felt that a double winter gathered round her steps day by day time passed on each evening returning to her solitary fireside she thought another is gone the time draws near she shuddered despite her conviction that the trial would be the signal for the liberation of falkner she saw the barriers time had placed between him and fate fall off one by one with terror january and february passed march had come the first of march the very month when all was to be decided arrived poor tempest tossed voyagers would the wished for port be gained should they ever exchange the uncertain element of danger for the firm land of security it was on the first of march that returning home in the evening she found a letter on her table from neville poor elizabeth she loved with tenderness and passion and yet how few of the fairy thoughts and visions of love had been hers love with her was mingled with so dire a tragedy such real oppressive griefs that its charms seemed crimes against her benefactor yet now as she looked on the letter and thought from him the rapture of love stole over her her eyes were dimmed by the agitation of delight and the knowledge that she was loved suspended every pain filling her with soft triumph and thrilling though vague expectation she broke the seal there was an inner envelope directed to miss raby and she smiled at the mere thought of the pleasure gerard must have felt in tracing that name the seal as he regarded it of their future union but when she unfolded the sheet and glanced down the page her attention was riveted by other emotions thus neville wrote my own sweet elizabeth i write in haste but doubt is so painful and tidings fly so quickly that i hope you will hear first by means of these lines the new blow fate has prepared for us my father lies dangerously ill this i fear will again delay the trial occasion prolonged imprisonment and keep you still a martyr to those duties you so courageously fulfil we must have patience we are impotent to turn aside irrevocable decrees yet when we think how much hangs on the present moment of time the heart my weak heart at least is wrung by anguish i cannot tell whether sir boyvill is aware of his situation he is too much oppressed by illness for conversation the sole desire he testifies is to have me near him once or twice he has pressed my hand and looked on me with affection i never remember to have received before such testimonials of paternal love such is the force of the natural tie between us that i am deeply moved and would not leave him for the whole world my poor father he has no friend no relative but me and now after so much haughtiness and disdain he in his need is like a little child reduced to feel his only support in natural affections his unwonted gentleness subdues my soul oh who would rule by power when so much more absolute a tyranny is established through love sophia is very kind but she is not his child the hour approaches when we should be at carlisle what will be the result of our absence what the event of this illness i am perplexed and agitated beyond measure in a day or two all will be decided if sir boyvill becomes convalescent still it may be long before he can undertake so distant a journey do not fear that for a moment i shall neglect your interests they are my own for months i have lived only on the expectation of the hour when you should be liberated from the horrors of your present position and the anticipation of another delay is torture even your courage must sink your patience have an end yet a little longer my elizabeth support yourself let not your noble heart fail at this last hour this last attack of adversity be all that you have ever been firm resigned and generous in your excellence i place all my trust i will write again very speedily and if you can imagine any service that i can do you command me to the utmost i write by my father's bedside he does not sleep but he is still farewell i love you in those words is summed a life of weal or wo for me and for you also my elizabeth do not call me selfish for feeling thus even here yes yes thought elizabeth busy fingers are weaving the web of destiny is unrolling fast we may not think nor hope nor scarcely breathe we must await the hour death is doing his work what victim will he select the intelligence in this letter communicated on the morrow to all concerned in the coming trial filled each with anxiety in a very few days the assizes would commence falkner's name stood first on the list delay was bitter yet he must prepare for delay and arm himself anew with resolution several anxious days passed elizabeth received no other letter she felt that sir boyvill's danger was protracted that gerard was still in uncertainty the post hour now became a moment of hope and dread it was a sort of harassing inquietude hard to endure at length a few lines from lady cecil arrived they brought no comfort all remained in the same state the assizes began on the morrow the judges were expected in carlisle and already all that bustle commenced that bore the semblance of gayety in the rest of the town but which was so mournful and fearful in the jail there were several capital cases as elizabeth heard them discussed her blood ran cold she hated life and all its adjuncts to know of misery she could not alleviate was always saddening but to feel the squalid mortal misery of such a place and hour brought home to her own heart was a wretchedness beyond all expression poignant and hideous the day that the judges arrived elizabeth presented herself in falkner's cell a letter in her hand her first words announced good tidings yet she was agitated tearful something strange and awful had surely betided it was a letter from neville that she held and gave to falkner to read i shall soon be in carlisle my dearest friend but this letter will outspeed me and bring you the first intelligence of my poor father's death thank god i did my duty by him to the last thank god he died in peace in peace with me and the whole world the uneasiness of pain yielded at first to torpor and thus we feared he would die but before his death he recovered himself an hour or two and though languid and feeble his mind was clear how little dear elizabeth do we know of our fellow creatures each shrouded in the cloak of manner that cloak of various dies displays little of the naked man within we thought my father vain selfish and cruel he was all this but he was something else that we knew not of he was generous humane humble these qualities he hid as if they had been vices he struggled with them pride prevented him from recognising them as the redeeming points of a faulty nature he despised himself for feeling them until he was on his deathbed then in broken accents he asked me his only son to pardon his mistakes and cruelties he asked me to forgive him in my dear mother's name he acknowledged his injustices towards her 'would that i might live' he said 'for my awakened conscience urges me to repair a portion of the evils i have caused but it is too late strange that i should never have given ear to the whisperings of justice though they were often audible till now when there is no help yet is it so cannot some reparation be made there is one' and as he spoke he half raised himself and some of the wonted fire flashed from his glazed eye but he sunk back again saying in a low but distinct voice 'falkner rupert falkner he is innocent i know and feel his innocence yet i have striven to bring him to the death let me record my belief that his tale is true and that alithea died the victim of her own heroism not by his hand gerard remember report these words save him his sufferings have been great promise me that i may feel that god and alithea will forgive me as i forgive him i act now as your mother would have had me act i act to please her' i speak it without shame my eyes ran over with tears and this softening of a proud heart before the remembered excellence of one so long dead so long thought of with harshness and resentment was the very triumph of the good spirit of the world yet tears were all the thanks i could give for several minutes he saw that i was moved but his strength was fast leaving him and pressing my hand and murmuring 'my last duty is now performed i will sleep' he turned away his head he never spoke more except to articulate my name and once or twice as his lips moved and i bent down to listen i heard the name of my mother breathed at the latest hour i cannot write more the trial will take place i am told immediately before the funeral i shall be in carlisle all will go well dear elizabeth and when we meet again happier feelings will be ours god bless you now and always as you deserve chapter xlviii all things now assumed an anxious aspect all was hurrying to a conclusion to morrow the trial was to come on security is not a word for mortal man to use more especially when the issue of an event depends on the opinions and actions of his fellow creatures falkner's acquittal was probable but not certain even if the impression went in general in his favour a single juryman might hold out and perverseness added to obstinacy would turn the scale against him sickening fears crept over elizabeth's heart she endeavoured to conceal them she endeavoured to smile and repeat this is our last day of bondage falkner cast no thought upon the worst innocence shut out fear he could not look forward to the ignominy of such a trial without acute suffering yet there was an austere composure in his countenance that spoke of fortitude and reliance on a power beyond the limit of human influence his turn had come to encourage elizabeth there was a nobleness and simplicity of character common to both that made them very intelligible to each other falkner however had long been nourishing secret thoughts and plans of which he had made no mention till now the crisis impending he thought it best to lift a portion of the veil that covered the future yes he said in reply to elizabeth to morrow will be the last day of slavery i regain my human privileges after to morrow and i shall not be slow to avail myself of them my first act will be to quit this country i have never trod its soil but to find misery after to morrow i leave it for ever elizabeth started and looked inquiringly were her wishes her destiny to have no influence over his plans he knew of the hope the affection that rendered england dear to her falkner took her hand you will join me hereafter dearest but you will in the first instance yield to my request and consent to a separation for a time never said elizabeth you cannot deceive me you act thus for my purposes and not your own and you misconceive everything we will never part daughters when they marry observed falkner leave father mother all and follow the fortunes of their husbands you must submit to the common law of human society do not ask me to reason with you and refute your arguments replied elizabeth our position is different from that of any other parent and child i will not say i owe you more than daughter ever owed father perhaps the sacred tie of blood may stand in place of the obligations you have heaped on me but i will not reason i cannot leave you right or wrong in the eyes of others my own heart would perpetually reproach me i should image your solitary wanderings your lonely hours of sickness and suffering and my peace of mind would be destroyed it is true said falkner that i am more friendless than most men yet i am not so weak and womanish that i need perpetual support your society is dear to me dearer god who reads my heart knows than liberty or life i shall return to that society and again enjoy it but for a time do not fear but that i can form such transitory ties as will prevent solitary suffering men and women abound who will feel benevolently towards the lonely stranger money purchases respect blameless manners win kindness i shall find friends in my need if i desire it and i shall return at last to you my dearest father said elizabeth you cannot deceive me i penetrate your motives but you wholly mistake you would force me also to mistake your character but i know you too well you never form transitory friendships you take no pleasure in the ordinary run of human intercourse you inquire you seek for instruction you endeavour to confer benefits but you have no happiness except such as you derive from your heart and that is not easily impressed did you not for many long years continue faithful to one idea adhere to one image devote yourself to one one only despite all that separated you did not the impediment you found to the fulfilment of your visions blight your whole life and bring you here pardon me if i allude to these things i cannot be to you what she was but you can no more banish me from your heart and imagination than you could her i know that you cannot we are not parent and child she continued playfully but we have a strong resemblance on one point fidelity is our characteristic we will not speak of this to others they might think that we boasted i am not quite sure that it is not a defect at least in some cases as with you it proved a misfortune to me it can never be such it repays itself i cannot leave you whatever befalls if gerard neville is hereafter lost to me i cannot help it it would kill me to fall off from you i must follow the natural the irresistible bent of my character to morrow the day after to morrow we will speak more of this what is necessary for your happiness be assured i will fulfil without repining but now dearest father let us not speak of the future now my heart is too full of the present the future appears to me a dream never to be arrived at oh how more than blessed i shall be when the future the long future shall grow into interest and importance they were interrupted one person came in and then another and the appalling details of the morrow effectually banished all thoughts of plans the necessity of which falkner wished to impress on his young companion he also was obliged to give himself up to present cares he received all he talked to all with a serious but unembarrassed air while elizabeth sat shuddering by wiping away her tears unseen and turning her dimmed eyes from one to the other pale and miserable we have fortitude and resignation for ourselves but when those beloved are in peril we can only weep and pray sheltered in a dusky corner a little retreated behind falkner she watched she listened to all and her heart almost broke leave him after this leave him she thought a prey to such memories oh may all good angels desert me when i become so vile a wretch the hour came when they must part she was not to see him on the morrow until the trial was over for her presence during the preliminary scenes was neither fitting nor practicable already great indulgences had been granted to the prisoner arising from his peculiar position the great length of time since the supposed crime had been committed and the impression now become general that he was innocent but this had limits the morrow was to decide all and send him forth free and guiltless or doom him to all the horrors of condemnation and final suffering their parting was solemn neither indulged in grief falkner felt composed elizabeth endeavoured to assume tranquillity but her lips quivered and she could not speak it was like separating not to meet for years a few short hours and she would look again upon his face but how much would happen in the interval how mighty a change have occurred what agony would both have gone through the one picturing the other enduring the scene of the morrow the gaze of thousands the accusation the evidence the defence the verdict each of these bearing with it to the well born and refined a barbed dart pregnant with thrilling poison ignominy added to danger how elizabeth longed to express to the assembled world the honour in which she held him whom all looked on as overwhelmed with disgrace how she yearned to declare the glory she took in the ties that bound them and the affection that she bore she must be mute but she felt all this to bursting and her last words best of men excellent upright noble generous god will preserve you and restore you to me expressed in some degree the swelling emotions of her soul they parted night and silence gathered round falkner's pillow with stoical firmness he banished retrospect he banished care he laid his hopes and fears at the feet of that almighty power who holds earth and all it contains in the hollow of his hand and he would trouble himself no more concerning the inevitable though unknown decree his thoughts were at first solemn and calm and then as the human mind can never even in torture fix itself unalterably on one point milder and more pleasing reveries presented themselves he thought of himself as a wild yet not worthless schoolboy he remembered the cottage porch clustered over with odoriferous parasites under whose shadow sat the sick pale lady with her starry eyes and wise lessons and her radiant daughter whose soft hand he held as they both nestled close at her feet he recalled his wanderings with that daughter over hill and dale when their steps were light and their hearts unburdened with a care soared to that heaven which her blessed spirit had already reached oh what is life that these dreams of youth and innocence should have conducted her to an untimely grave him to a felon's cell the thought came with a sharp pang again he banished it and the land of greece his perils and his wanderings with elizabeth on the shores of zante now replaced his other memories he then bore a burden on his heart which veiled with dark crape the glories of a sunny climate the heart cheering tenderness of his adopted child this was less bitter this meeting of fate this atonement sleep crept over him at last and such is the force of innocence that though a cloud of agony hung over his awakening yet he slept peacefully on the eve of his trial towards morning his sleep became less tranquil he moved he groaned then opening his eyes he started up struggling to attain full consciousness of where he was and wherefore he had been dreaming and he asked himself what had been the subject of his dreams was it greece or the dreary waste shores of cumberland and why did that fair lingering shape beckon him was it alithea or elizabeth before these confused doubts could be solved he recognised the walls of the cell and saw the shadow of the bars of his windows on the curtain spread before it it was morning the morning where would another sun find him he rose and drew aside the curtain and there were the dark high walls weather stained and huge clear but sunless daylight was spread over each object it penetrated every nook and yet was devoid of cheer there is indeed something inexpressibly desolate in the sight of the early gray chill dawn dissipating the shadows of night when the day which it harbingers is to bring misery night is a cloak a shelter a defence all men sleep at night the law sleeps and its dread ministrants are harmless in their beds hushed like cradled children even now they sleep thought falkner pillowed and curtained in luxury but day is come and they will soon resume their offices and drag me before them and wherefore because it is day because it is wednesday because names have been given to portions of time which otherwise might be passed over and forgotten to the surgeon's eye a human body sometimes presents itself merely as a mass of bones muscles and arteries though that human body may contain a soul to emulate shakspeare and thus there are moments when the wretched dissect the forms of life and contemplating only the outward semblance of events wonder how so much power of misery or the reverse resides in what is after all but sleeping or waking walking here or walking there seeing one fellow creature instead of another such were the morbid sensations that absorbed falkner as day grew clearer and clearer the narrow court more gloomy as compared with the sky and the objects in his cell assumed their natural colour and appearances all asleep he again thought except i the sufferer and does my own elizabeth sleep heaven grant it and guard her slumbers may those dear eyes long remain closed in peace upon this miserable day he dressed himself long before any one in the prison and jailers are early risers was awake at last there were steps in the passage bolts were drawn and voices heard these familiar sounds recalled him to actual life and approaching inevitable events his haughty soul awoke again a dogged pride steeled his heart he remembered the accusation the execration in which he believed him self to be held and his innocence retribution or atonement i am ready to pay it as it is demanded of me for alithea's sake but the injustice of man is not lessened on this account henceforth i am to be stamped with ignominy and yet in what am i worse than my fellows at least they shall not see that my spirit bends before them he assumed cheerfulness and bore all the preliminaries of preparation with apparent carelessness sometimes his eagle eye flashed fire sometimes fixed on vacancy a whole life of memories passed across his mental vision but there was no haste no trepidation no faltering he never thought of danger or of death innocence sustained him the ignominy of the present was all that he felt that he had to endure and master that and the desolation beyond when branded through life as he believed he should be even by acquittal he was henceforth to be looked on as an outcast at length he was led forth to trial pride in his heart resolution in his eye he passed out of the gloomy portal of the prison and entered the sunlit street houses were around but through an opening he caught a glimpse of the country uplands and lawny fields and tree crested hills the work of god himself sunshine rested on the scene one used to liberty had regarded with contempt the restricted view presented by the opening but to the prisoner who for months had only seen his prison walls it seemed as if the creation lay unrolled in its majesty before him what was man in comparison with the power that upheld the earth and bade the sun to shine and man was to judge him what mockery man and all his works were but a plaything in the hands of omnipotence and to that falkner submitted his destiny he rose above the degrading circumstances around him he looked down upon his fate a real a lofty calm at last possessed his soul he felt that naught said or done that day by his fellow creatures could move him his reliance was elsewhere it rested on his own innocence and his intimate sense that he was in no more danger now than if sheltered in the farthest darkest retreat unknown to man he walked as if surrounded by an atmosphere which no storms from without could penetrate he entered the court with a serene brow and so much dignity added to a look that expressed such entire peace of conscience that every one who beheld him became prepossessed in his favour his distinct calm voice declaring himself not guilty the confidence untinged by vaunting with which he uttered the customary appeal to god and his country excited admiration at first and then when a second sentiment could be felt the most heart moving pity such a man so unstained by vice so raised above crime had never stood there before accustomed to the sight of vulgar rogues or hardened ruffians wonder was mingled with a certain self examination which made each man feel that if justice were done he probably deserved more to be in that dock than the prisoner and then they remembered that he stood there to be consigned to life or death as the jury should decide a breathless interest was awakened not only in the spectators but even in those hardened by habit to scenes like this every customary act of the court was accompanied by a solemnity unfelt before the feeling indeed that reigned was something more than solemn thirsting curiosity and eager wonder gave way before thrilling awe to think that man might be condemned to an ignominious end when once the trial had begun and his preliminary part had been played falkner sat down he became to all appearance abstracted he was indeed thinking of things more painful than even the present scene the screams and struggles of the agonized alithea her last sad sleep in the hut upon the shore the strangling turbid waves her wet lifeless form her low unnamed grave dug by him had these been atoned for by long years of remorse and misery or was the present ignominy and worse that might ensue fitting punishment be it as it might he was equal to the severest blows and ready to lay down a life in compensation for that of which he most unintentionally and yet most cruelly had deprived her his thoughts were not recalled to the present scene till a voice struck his ear so like hers did the dead speak knit up as he was to the endurance of all he trembled from head to foot he had been so far away from that place till the echo as it were of alithea's voice recalled him in a moment he recovered himself and found that it was her child gerard neville who was giving his evidence he heard the son of his victim speak of him as innocent and a thrill of thankfulness entered his soul he smiled and hope and sympathy with his fellow creatures and natural softening feelings replaced the gloomy bitterness and harshness of his past reflections he felt that he should be acquitted and that it became him to impress all present favourably it became him to conduct himself so as to show his confidence in the justice of those on whom his fate depended and at once to assert the dignity of innocence from that time he gave himself entirely up to the details of the trial he became attentive and not the less calm and resolute because he believed that his own exertions would crown the hour with success the spectators saw the change in him and were roused to double interest the court clock meanwhile kept measure of the time that passed the hands travelled silently on another turn and all would be over and what would then be chapter xlix elizabeth meanwhile might envy the resolution that bore him through these appalling scenes on the night after leaving him she had not even attempted to rest wrapped in a shawl she threw herself on a sofa and told each hour during the livelong night her reveries were wild vague and exquisitely painful in the morning she tried to recall her faculties she remembered her conviction that on that day falkner would be liberated and she dressed herself with care that she might welcome him with the appearances of rejoicing she expected with unconquerable trepidation the hour when the court would meet before that hour there was a knock at her door and a visiter was announced it was mrs raby it was indeed a solace to see a friendly face of her own sex she had been so long deprived of this natural support lady cecil had now and then written to her her letters were always affectionate but she seemed stunned by the magnitude of the blow that had fallen on her friend and unable to proffer consolation with kindness of heart sweetness of temper and much good sense still lady cecil was commonplace and worldly mrs raby was of a higher order of being she saw things too exclusively through one medium and thus the scope of her exertions was narrowed but that medium was a pure and elevated one in visiting elizabeth on this occasion she soared beyond it long and heavily had her desertion of the generous girl weighed on her conscience she could sympathize in her heroism and warmly approve it was in her nature to praise and to reward merit and she had withheld all tribute from her abandoned niece the interests of her religion blended with those of family actuated her and while resisting a natural impulse of generosity she fancied that she was doing right she had spoken concerning her with no one but lady cecil and she while she praised her young friend forgot to speak of falkner and there lay the stumbling block to every motion in her favour when elizabeth repaired to carlisle mrs raby returned to belleforest she scarcely knew how to introduce the subject to her father in law and when she did he verging into dotage only said act as you please my dear i rely on you act for the honour and welfare of yourself and your children the old man day by day lost his powers of memory and reason by the time of the trial he had become a mere cipher every responsibility fell on mrs raby and she eager to do right and fearful to do wrong struggled with her better nature wavered repented and yet remained inactive neville strongly reprobated the conduct of every one towards elizabeth he had never seen mrs raby but she in particular he regarded with the strongest disapprobation it so happened that the very day after his father's death he was at lady cecil's when mrs raby called and by an exception in the general orders made for elizabeth's sake she was let come up gerard was alone in the drawing room when she was announced he rose hastily meaning to withdraw when the lady's appearance changed his entire mind we ridicule the minuti of the science of physiognomy but who is not open to first impressions neville was prepossessed favourably by mrs raby's countenance her open thoughtful brow her large dark melancholy eyes her dignity of manner joined to evident marks of strong feeling at once showed him that he saw a woman capable of generous sentiments and heroic sacrifice he felt that there must have been some grievous error in sophia's proceedings not to have awakened more active interest in her mind while he was forming these conclusions mrs raby was struck by him in an equally favourable manner no one could see gerard neville without feeling that something angelic something nobly disinterested unearthly in its purity yet beyond the usual nature of man sympathetic animated a countenance that was all sensibility genius and love in a minute they were intimate friends lady cecil hearing that they were together would not interrupt them and their conversation was long neville related his first acquaintance with elizabeth raby he sketched the history of falkner he described him and the scene when he denounced himself as the destroyer of alithea he declared his conviction of his innocence he narrated sir boyvill's dying words then they both dwelt on his long imprisonment elizabeth's faithful affection and all that they must have undergone enough to move the stoniest heart tears rushed into gerard's eyes while he spoke while he described her innocence her integrity her total forgetfulness of self and i have deserted her exclaimed mrs raby we have all deserted her this must not continue you go to carlisle to morrow for the trial the moment it is over and mr falkner acquitted when they have left that town where all is so full of their name and story i will see her and try to make up for my past neglect it will be too late said gerard you may then please yourself by admiring one so superior to every human being but you will not benefit her falkner acquitted she will have risen above all need of your support now is the hour to be of use the very hour of the trial when this unfortunate heroic girl is thrown entirely on herself wounded by her absolute friendlessness yet disdaining to complain i could almost wish that sophia would disregard appearances and hasten to her side although her connexion with our family would render that too strange but you mrs raby what should stop you she is your niece how vain to attempt to conceal this from the world it must be known through me i fondly trust it will be known who shall claim her as miss raby when as elizabeth falkner i could never see her more and when it is known will not your desertion be censured be wise be generous win that noblest and gentlest heart by your kindness now and the very act will be your reward hasten to carlisle be with her in the saddest hour that ever one so young and innocent passed through mrs raby was moved she was persuaded she felt a veil fall from before her eyes she saw her duty and she keenly felt the littleness of her past desertion she did not hesitate and now that she perceived how gladly her niece welcomed her in this hour of affliction and how gratefully she appreciated her kindness she found in the approval of her own heart the sweetest recompense for her disinterestedness elizabeth's swollen eyes and timid hurried manner betrayed how she had passed the night and how she was possessed by the most agitating fears still she spoke of the acquittal of her father as she took pride in calling him at this crisis as certain and mrs raby taking advantage of this endeavoured to draw her mind from the torture of representing to herself the progress of the scene then acting at so short a distance from them by speaking of the future elizabeth mentioned falkner's determination to quit england and her own to accompany him the hinted dissuasion of mrs raby she disregarded he has been a father to me i am his child what would you say to a daughter who deserted her father in adversity and sickness and dear mrs raby you must remember that my father is in spite of all his courage struck by disease accustomed to my attentions he would die if left to hirelings deserted by me he would sink into apathy or despair mrs raby listened she admired the enthusiasm and yet the softness the sensibility and firmness of her young kinswoman but she was pained many ideas assailed her but she would not entertain them they were too wild and dangerous and yet her heart formed for generosity was tempted to trample upon the suggestions of prudence and the qualms of bigotry to give diversion to her thoughts she mentioned gerard neville a blush of pleasure a smile shown more in the eyes than on the lips mantled over her niece's countenance she spoke of him as of a being scarcely earthly in his excellence his devotion to his mother first and lately his generosity towards her his resolution to go to america to seek osborne for her sake and the sake of justice were themes for eloquence she spoke with warmth and truth yet if you follow mr falkner's fortunes said mrs raby you will see him no more i cannot believe that replied elizabeth yet if it must be so i am resigned he will never forget me and i shall feel that i am worthy of him though separated better that than to remain at the sacrifice of all i hold honourable and good he would despise me and that were worse absence an absence of the heart ten thousand times more galling than mere distance of place one would be eternal and irremediable the other easily obviated when our duties should no longer clash i go with my father because he is suffering neville may join us because he is innocent he will not i feel and know either forget me or stay away for ever chapter l while they were conversing quick footsteps were heard in the street below mrs raby had succeeded in making the time pass more lightly than could be hoped it was three o'clock there was a knock at the door of the house elizabeth breaking off abruptly turned ashy pale and clasped her hands in the agony of expectation osborne rushed into the room it is all over he exclaimed all is well tears streamed from his eyes as he spoke and ran up to shake hands with elizabeth and congratulate her with an ardour and joy that contrasted strangely with the frightened looking being he had always before shown himself mr falkner is acquitted he is free he will soon be here no one could doubt his innocence that saw him no one did doubt it the jury did not even retire thus osborne ran on relating the events of the trial falkner's mere appearance had prepossessed every one the frankness of his open brow his dignified unembarrassed manner his voice whose clear tones were the very echo of truth vouched for him the barrister who conducted the prosecution narrated the facts rather as a mystery to be inquired into than as a crime to be detected gerard neville's testimony was entirely favourable to the prisoner he showed how falkner wholly unsuspected safe from the shadow of accusation had spontaneously related the unhappy part he took in his unfortunate mother's death for the sake of restoring her reputation and relieving the minds of her relatives the narrative written in greece and left as explanation in case of his death was further proof of the truth of his account gerard declared himself satisfied of his innocence and when he stated his father's dying words his desire at the last hour on the bed of death to record his belief in falkner's being guiltless of the charge brought against him words spoken as it were yesterday for he who uttered them still lay unburied the surprise seemed to be that he should have suffered a long imprisonment and the degradation of a trial osborne's own evidence was clear and satisfactory at last falkner himself was asked what defence he had to make as he rose every eye turned on him every voice and breath were hushed a solemn silence reigned his words were few spoken calmly and impressively he rested his innocence on the very evidence brought against him he had been the cause of the lady's death and asked for no mercy but for her sake and the sake of that heroic feeling that led her to encounter death amid the waves he asked for justice and he did not for a moment doubt that it would be rendered him nor could you doubt it as you heard him continued osborne never were truth and innocence written so clearly on human countenance as on his as he looked upon the jury with his eagle eyes addressing them without pride but with infinite majesty as if he could rule their souls through the power of a clear conscience and a just cause they did not hesitate the jury did not hesitate a moment i rushed here the moment i heard the words and now he is come many steps were again heard in the street below and one which elizabeth could not mistake upon the stairs falkner entered she flew to his arms and he pressed her to his bosom wrapping her in a fond long embrace while neither uttered a word a few moments of trembling almost to agony a few agitated tears and the natural gladness of the hour assumed its genuine aspect falkner commanding himself could shake hands with osborne and thank him and elizabeth presented him to mrs raby he at once comprehended the kindness of her visit and acknowledged it with a heartfelt thankfulness that showed how much he had suffered while picturing elizabeth's abandonment soon various other persons poured into the room and it was necessary to pass through many congratulations and to thank and what was really painful to listen to the outpouring talk of those persons who had been present at the trial yet at such a moment the heart warmed and open acknowledges few distinctions among those whose evident joy in the result filled elizabeth with gratitude she and falkner felt touched by none so much as the visit of a turnkey who was ashamed to show himself yet who hearing they were immediately to quit carlisle begged permission to see them once again the poor fellow who looked on elizabeth as an angel and falkner as a demigod for not forgetting others in their adversity they had discovered and assisted his necessities the poor fellow seemed out of his mind with joy ecstasy was painted on his face there was no mistaking the clear language of a full and grateful heart at length the hurry and tumult subsided all departed falkner and his beloved companion were left alone and for a few short hours enjoyed a satisfaction so perfect that angels might have envied them falkner was humbled it is true and looked to the past with the same remorse but in vain did he think that his pride ought to feel deeply wounded by the scene of that day in vain did he tell himself that after such a trial the purity of his honour was tarnished his heart told another tale its emphatic emotions banished every conventional or sophisticated regret he was honestly though calmly glad and acknowledged the homely feeling with the sincerity of a man who had never been nourished in false refinements or factitious woes in the evening when it was dusk said falkner let us love take a walk the words made elizabeth both laugh and cry for joy he put on his hat and with her on his arm they got quickly out of the town and strolled down a neighbouring lane the wind that waved the heads of the still leafless trees the aspect of the starry sky the wide spread fields were felt as blessings from heaven by the liberated prisoner they all seem he said created purely for my enjoyment how sweet is nature how divine a thing is liberty oh my god i dare not be so happy as i would there is one thought to chill the genial glow but for the image of lost dead alithea i should enjoy a felicity too pure for frail humanity as they returned into the town a carriage with four posters passed them elizabeth recognised at once gerard neville within a pang shot through her heart to remember that they did not share their feelings but were separated perhaps for ever at this very hour on her return worn out with fatigue and oppressed with this reflection she bade good night to falkner and he happy in the idea that the same roof would cover them kissed and embraced her on entering her room she found a letter on her toilet and smiles again dimpled her face it was a letter from neville it contained a few words a very few of congratulation reminding her that he must hurry back to town for the melancholy task of his father's funeral and imploring that neither she nor falkner would determine on any immediate step i cannot penetrate the cloud in which we are enveloped he said but i know that i ought not that i cannot lose you a little time a little reflection may show us how to accord our various duties with the great necessity of our not being separated be not rash therefore my own elizabeth nor let your friend be rash surely the worst is over and we may be permitted at last to hate no more and to be happy elizabeth kissed the letter and placed it beneath her pillow that night she slept sweetly and well early in the morning mrs raby called on them the same prepossession which gerard had felt in her favour as soon as he saw her had taken place in her on seeing falkner there is a sort of magnetism that draws like to like and causes minds of fine and lofty tone to recognise each other when brought in contact mrs raby saw and acknowledged at once falkner's superiority whatever his faults had been they were winnowed away by adversity and he was become at once the noblest and gentlest of human beings mrs raby had that touch of generosity in her own character that never permitted her to see merit without openly acknowledging and endeavouring to reward it the first thought of the plan she now entertained she had cast away as impracticable but it returned the desire to give and to benefit a natural growth in her heart made her look on it with complacency by degrees she dismissed the objections that presented themselves and resolved to act upon it we complain she thought of the barrenness of life and the tediousness and faults of our fellow creatures and when providence brings before us two selected from the world as endowed with every admirable quality we allow a thousand unworthy considerations which assume the voice of prudence to exile us from them where can i find a man like falkner full of honour sensibility and talent where a girl like elizabeth who has proved herself to be the very type of virtuous fidelity such companions will teach my children better than volumes of moral treatises the existence and loveliness of human goodness mrs raby passed a sleepless night revolving these thoughts in the morning she called on her new friends and then with all the grace that was her peculiar charm she invited them to accompany her to belleforest and to take up their residence there for the next few months elizabeth's eyes sparkled with delight falkner at once accepted the invitation for her and declined it for himself you hear him my dear aunt cried elizabeth but you will not accept his refusal you will not permit this perversity you forget many things when you speak thus said falkner but mrs raby remembers them all i thank her for her kindness but i am sure she will admit of the propriety of my declining her invitation you imagine then replied mrs raby that i made it for form's sake intending it should be refused you mistake i know what you mean and all you would covertly suggest let us cast aside the ceremonies of mere acquaintanceship let us be friends and speak with the openness natural to us do you consent to this you are good very good said falkner except this dear girl who will deign to be my friend if i thought replied mrs raby that your heart was so narrowed by the disasters and injustice you have suffered that you must hereafter shut yourself up with the remembrance of them i should feel inclined to retract my offer for friendship is a mutual feeling and he who feels only for himself can be no one's friend but this is not the case with you you have a heart true to every touch of sympathy as elizabeth can testify since you determined to live for her sake when driven to die by the agony of your sufferings let us then at once dismiss notions which i must consider as unworthy of us when we turn to the page of history and read of men visited by adversity what do we say to those of their fellow creatures who fall off from them on account of their misfortunes do we not call them little minded and visit them with our contempt do not class me with such i might pass you carelessly by if you had always been prosperous it is your misfortunes that inspire me with friendship that render me eager to cultivate an intimacy with one who has risen above the most frightful calamity that could befall a man and shown himself at once repentant and courageous you will understand what i mean without long explanation we shall have time for that hereafter i honour you what my heart feels my voice and actions will ever be ready to proclaim for elizabeth's sake you must not permit the world to think that he who adopted and brought her up is unworthy of regard and esteem come with us to belleforest you must not refuse i long to introduce my girls to their matchless cousin i long to win her heart by my affection and kindness and if you will permit me the enviable task how proud and glad i shall be to repay a portion of what we owe you on her account by endeavouring to compensate by a few months of tranquillity and friendship for the misery you have undergone mrs raby spoke with sincerity and earnestness and elizabeth's eyes pleaded her cause yet more eloquently where you go she said to falkner there also i shall be i shall not repine however you decide but we shall be very happy at belleforest it was real modesty and no false pride that actuated falkner he felt happy yet when he looked outward he fancied that hereafter he must be shut out from society a branded man he intimately felt the injustice of this he accepted it as a punishment for the past but he did not the less proudly rise above it it was a real pleasure to find one entertaining the generous sentiments which mrs raby expressed and capable of acting on them he felt worthy of her regard and acknowledged that none but conventional reasons placed any barrier to his accepting her kind offers why then should he reject them he did not frankly and with sincere thanks he suffered himself to be overruled and on the following day they were on their road to belleforest chapter li it was one of those days which do sometimes occur in march warm and balmy and enlivening as spring always is the birds were busy among the leafless boughs and if the carriage stopped for a moment the gushing song of the skylark attracted the eye to his blue ethereal bower a joyous welcome was breathed by nature to every heart and none answered it so fervently as falkner sentiments of pleasure possessed all three travellers mrs raby experienced that exultation natural to all human beings when performing a generous action elizabeth felt that in going to belleforest she drew nearer neville for there was no reason why he should not enter her grandfather's doors but falkner was happier than either it was not the vulgar joy of having escaped danger partly it was gladness to see elizabeth restored to her family where only as things were she could find happiness and yet not divided from him partly it arose from the relief he felt as the burden of heavy long endured care was lifted from his soul but there was something more which was incomprehensible even to himself his bosom's lord sat lightly on its throne he no longer turned a saddened reproachful eye on nature nor any more banished soft emotions nourishing remorse as a duty he was reconciled to himself and the world the very circumstances of his prison and his trial being over took with them the more galling portion of his retrospections health again filled his veins at the moment when he had first accused himself neville saw in him a man about to die it was evident now that the seeds of disease were destroyed his person grew erect his eye clear and animated elizabeth had never since they left greece seen him so free from suffering during all her intercourse with him she never remembered him so bland and cheerful in his mood it was the reward of much suffering the gift of heaven to one who had endured patiently opening his heart to the affections instead of cherishing pride and despair it was the natural result of a noble disposition which could raise itself above even its own errors throwing off former evil as alien to its nature embracing good as its indefeasible right they entered the majestic avenues and imbowered glades of belleforest where cedar larch and pine diversified the bare woods with a show of foliage the turf was covered with early flowers the buds were green and bursting on the boughs falkner remembered his visit the preceding summer how little had he then foreseen impending events and how far from his heart had then been the peace that at present so unaccountably possessed it then the wide demesne and stately mansion had appeared the abode of gloom and bigotry now it was changed to a happy valley where love and cheerfulness reigned mrs raby was welcomed by her children two elegant girls of fifteen and sixteen and a spirited boy of twelve they adored their mother and saw in their new cousin an occasion for rejoicing their sparkling looks and gay voices dispelled the last remnant of melancholy from the venerable mansion old oswi raby himself too much sunk in dotage to understand what was going on yet smiled and looked glad on the merry faces about him he could not exactly make out who elizabeth was he was sure that it was a relation and he treated her with an obsequious respect which considering his former impertinent tone was exceedingly amusing what was wanting to complete the universal happiness elizabeth's spirits rose to unwonted gayety in the society of her young relations and her cousin edwin in particular found her the most delightful companion in the world for she was as fearless on horseback as himself and was unwearied in amusing him by accounts of the foreign countries she had seen and adventures ridiculous or fearful that she had encountered in mrs raby she found a beloved friend for serious hours and falkner's recovered health and spirits were a source of exhaustless congratulation yet where was gerard neville where the looks of love and rapturous sense of sympathy before which all the other joys of life fade into dimness love causes us to get more rid of our haunting identity and to give ourselves more entirely away than any other emotion it is the most complete the most without veil or shadow to mar its beauty every other human passion occupies but a distinct portion of our being this assimilates with all and turns the whole into bliss or misery elizabeth did not fear that gerard would forget her he had remembered through the dark hours gone by and now his shadow walked with her beneath the avenues of belleforest and the recollection of his love impregnated the balmy airs of spring with a sweetness unfelt before elizabeth had now leisure to love and many an hour she spent in solitary yet blissful dreams almost wondering that such happiness was to be found on earth what a change what a contrast between the deathgirt prison of carlisle and the love adorned glades of her ancestral park not long ago the sky appeared to bend over one universe of tears and wo and now in the midst a piece of heaven had dropped down upon earth and she had entered the enchanted ground yet as weeks sped on some thoughts troubled her repose gerard neither came nor wrote at length she got a letter from lady cecil congratulating her on falkner's acquittal and the kindness of her aunt her letter was amiable yet it was constrained and elizabeth reading it again and again and pondering on every expression became aware that her friends felt less satisfaction than she did in the turn of fortune that placed her and falkner together under her paternal roof she had believed that as elizabeth raby neville would at once claim her but she was forced to recollect that falkner was still at her side and what intercourse could there be between him and his mother's destroyer thus anxiety and sadness penetrated poor elizabeth's new found paradise she strove to appear the same but she stole away when she could to meditate alone on her strange lot it doubled her regret to think that neville also was unhappy she figured the struggles he underwent she almost thought that if he were happy she could bear all she remembered him as she last saw him agitated and wretched she alone she felt sure could calm she alone minister happiness and were they never more to meet falkner who watched elizabeth with all the jealousy of excessive affection soon perceived the change at first her gayety had been spontaneous her step free her voice and laugh the very echo of joy now the forced smile the frequent abstraction the eagerness with which she watched for opportunities to steal into solitude while her attentions to him became even more sedulous and tender as if she wished to prove how ready she was to make every sacrifice for his sake all these appearances he saw and his heart ached to think how the effects of his errors still spread poison over his own life and that of one so dear he felt sure that mrs raby shared his uneasiness she and her niece were much less together than before elizabeth could not speak of the thoughts that occupied her and she could not feign with her dear wise friend whose eyes read her soul and whose counsels or consolations she alike feared falkner saw mrs raby's regards fix anxiously on her young relative he penetrated her thoughts and again he was forced to abhor himself as the destroyer of the happiness of all who came within his sphere it was evident that some communication must take place between some one of the individuals thus misplaced and wretched elizabeth alone was resigned and therefore silent falkner longed to act rather than to speak to depart to disappear for ever he also therefore brooded mutely over the state of things mrs raby seeing the wretchedness that was creeping over the hearts of those whose happiness she most desired was the first to enter on the subject one day being alone with falkner she began the more i see and admire my dearest niece she said the greater i feel our obligation to be to you mr falkner for having made her what she is her natural disposition is full of excellence but it is the care and the education you bestowed which give her character so high a tone had she come to us in her childhood it is more than probable she would have been placed in a convent and what nature however perfect but would be injured by the system that reigns in those places to you we owe our fairest flower and if gratitude could repay you you would be repaid by mine to prove it and to serve you must always be the most pleasing duty of my life i should be much happier said falkner if i could regard my interference as you do i fear i have injured irreparably my beloved girl and that through me she is suffering pangs which she is too good to acknowledge but which in the end may destroy her had i restored her to you had she been brought up here she and gerard neville would not now be separated but they might never have met replied mrs raby it is indeed vain thus to regard the past not only is it unalterable but each link of the chain producing the one that followed seems in our instance to have been formed and riveted by a superior power for peculiar purposes the whole order of events is inscrutable one little change and none of us would be as we are now except as a lesson or a warning we ought not to contemplate the past but the future certainly demands our attention it is impossible to see gerard neville and not to feel an intense interest in him he is worthy of our elizabeth and he is ardently attached to her and has besides made a deep impression on her young heart which i would not have erased or lessened for i am sure that her happiness as far as mortals can be happy will be ensured by their marriage i stand in the way of this union of that i am well aware said falkner but be assured i will not continue to be an obstacle to the welfare of my angel girl it is for this that i would consult you how are contradictions to be reconciled or rather how can we contrive my absence so as to remove every impediment and yet not to awaken elizabeth's suspicions i dislike contrivances replied mrs raby and i hate all mystery suffer me therefore to speak frankly to you i have often conversed with elizabeth she is firm not to marry so as to be wholly divided from you she reasons calmly but she never wavers she will not she says commence new duties by in the first place betraying her old ones she should be for ever miserable if she did and therefore those who love her must not ask it sir gerard entertains similar sentiments with regard to himself though less resolute and i believe less just than hers i received a letter from him this morning i was pondering whether to show it to you or to my niece it seems to me best that you should read it if it will not annoy you give it me said falkner and permit me also to answer it it is not in my nature to dally with evils i shall meet those that now present themselves and bring the best remedy i can at whatever cost neville's letter was that of a man whose wishes were at war with his principles and yet who was not convinced of the justice of the application of those principles it began by deeply regretting the estrangement of elizabeth from his family by asking mrs raby if she thought that she could not be induced to pay another visit to lady cecil he said that lady was eager to see her and only delayed asking her till she ascertained whether her friendship which was warm and lively as ever would prove as acceptable as formerly i will at once be frank with you the letter continued for your excellent understanding may direct us and will suggest excuses for our doubts you may easily divine the cause of our perplexities though you can scarcely comprehend the extremely painful nature of mine permit me to treat you as a friend be the judge of my cause i have faith in the purity and uprightness of a woman's heart when she is endowed with gifts such as you possess i had once thought to refer myself to miss raby herself but i dread the generous devotedness of her disposition will you who love her take therefore the task of decision on yourself neville went on to express in few but forcible words his attachment to elizabeth his conviction that it could never change and his persuasion that she returned it it is not therefore my cause merely that i plead he said but hers also do not call me presumptuous for thus expressing myself a mutual attachment alone can justify extraordinary conduct but where it is mutual every minor consideration ought to give way before it the happiness of both our lives depends upon our not trifling with feelings which i am sure can never change they may be the source of perpetual felicity if not they will they must be pregnant with misery to the end of our lives but why this sort of explanation when the meaning that i desire to convey is that if that as may i not say we love each other no earthly power shall deprive me of her sooner or later she must she shall be mine and meanwhile this continued separation is painful beyond my fortitude to bear can i take my mother's destroyer by the hand and live with him on terms of intimacy and friendship such is the price i must pay for elizabeth can i may i so far forget the world's censure and i may say the instigations of nature as unreservedly to forgive i will confess to you dear mrs raby that when i saw falkner in the most degrading situation in which a man can be placed manacled and as a felon his dignity of mien his majestic superiority to all the race of common mortals around the grandeur of his calm yet piercing eye and the sensibility of his voice won my admiration with such is peopled that heaven where the noble penitent is more welcome than the dull follower of a narrow code of morals who never erred because he never felt i pardon him then from my heart in my mother's name these sentiments the entire forgiveness of the injury done me and the sense of his merits still continue but may i act on them would not you despise me if i did say but that you would and my sentence is pronounced i lose elizabeth i quit england for ever it matters little where i go yet before you decide consider that this man possesses virtues of the highest order he honoured as much as he loved my mother and if his act was criminal dearly has he paid the result i persuade myself that there is more real sympathy between me and my mother's childhood's friend who loved her so long and truly whose very crime was a mad excess of love than one who knew nothing of her to whom her name conjures up no memories no regret i feel that i could lament with falkner the miserable catastrophe and yet not curse him for bringing it about nay as with such a man there can be no half sentiments i feel that if we are thrown together his noble qualities will win ardent sentiments of friendship were not his victim my mother there does not exist a man whose good opinion i should so eagerly seek and highly prize as that of rupert falkner it is that fatal name which forms the barrier between me and charity shutting me out at the same time from hope and love thus incoherently i put down my thoughts as they rise a tangled maze which i ask you to unravel i will endeavour to abide by your decision whatever it may be yet i again ask you to pause is elizabeth's happiness as deeply implicated as mine if it be can i abide by any sentence that shall condemn her to a wretchedness similar to that which has so long been an inmate of my struggling heart no sooner than inflict one pang on her i will fly from the world we three will seek some far obscure retreat and be happy despite the world's censure and even your condemnation falkner's heart swelled within him as he read he could not but admire neville's candour and he was touched by the feelings he expressed towards himself but pride was stronger than regret and prompted an instant and decisive reply he rebelled against the idea that gerard and elizabeth should suffer through him and thus he wrote you have appealed to mrs raby will you suffer me to answer that appeal and to decide i have a better right for kind as she is i have elizabeth's welfare yet more warmly at heart the affection that she feels for you will endure to the end of her life for her faithful heart is incapable of change on you therefore depends her happiness and you are called upon to make some sacrifice to ensure it come here take her at my hand it is all i ask from that hour you shall never see me more the injured and the injurer will separate my fortunes are of my own earning and i can bear them you must compensate to my dear child for my loss you must be father as well as husband and speak kindly of me to her or her heart will break we must be secret in our proceedings mystery and deception are contrary to my nature but i willingly adopt them for her sake mrs raby must not be trusted but you and i love elizabeth sufficiently even to sacrifice a portion of our integrity to secure her happiness for her own sake we must blindfold her she need never learn that we deceived her she will naturally be separated from me for a short time the period will be indefinitely prolonged till new duties arise wholly to wean her from me and i shall be forgotten come then at once endure the sight of the guilty falkner for a few short days till you thus earn his dearest treasure and do not fear that i shall intrude one moment longer than is absolutely necessary for our success be assured that when once elizabeth is irrevocably yours wide seas shall roll between us nor will your condescension to my wish bring any stigma on yourself or your bride for miss raby does not bear my tainted name all i ask is that you will not delay it is difficult for me to cloak my feelings to one so dear let my task of deception be abridged as much as possible i shall give my elizabeth to you with confidence and pleasure you deserve her your generous disposition will enable you to endure her affection for me and even her grief at my departure never speak unkindly of me to her when you see me no more you will find less difficulty in forgetting the injury i have done you you must endeavour to remember only the benefit you receive in gaining elizabeth chapter lii the beautiful month of may had arrived with her light budding foliage which seems to hang over the hoar branches of the trees like a green aerial mist the nightingales sung through the moonlight night and every other feathered chorister took up the note at early dawn the sweetest flowers in the year embroidered the fields and the verdant corn fields were spread like a lake now glittering in the sun now covered over by the shadows of the clouds it appeared impossible not to hope not to enjoy yet a seriousness had again gathered over falkner's countenance that denoted the return of care he avoided the society even of elizabeth his rides were solitary his evenings passed in the seclusion of his own room elizabeth for the first time in her life grew a little discontented i sacrificed all to him she thought yet i cannot make him happy love alone possesses the sceptre and arbitrary power to rule every other affection admits a parliament of thoughts and debate and divisions ensue which may make us wiser but which sadly derogates from the throned state of what we fancy a master sentiment i cannot make falkner happy yet neville is miserable through my endeavours and to such struggle there is no end my promised faith is inviolable nor do i even wish to break it one balmy lovely day elizabeth rode out with her cousins mrs raby was driving her father in law through the grounds in the pony phaeton falkner had been out and was returned several days had passed and no answer arrived from neville he was uneasy and sad and yet rejoiced at the respite afforded to the final parting with his child suddenly from the glass doors of the saloon he perceived a gentleman riding up the avenue he recognised him and exclaimed all is over at that moment he felt himself transported to a distant land surrounded by strangers cut off from all he held dear such must be the consequence of the arrival of gerard neville and it was he who dismounting in a few minutes after entered the room he came up to falkner and held out his hand saying we must be friends mr falkner from this moment i trust that we are friends we join together for the happiness of the dearest and most perfect being in the world falkner could not take his hand his manner grew cold but he readily replied i hope we do and we must concert together to ensure our success yet there is one other continued neville whom we must take into our consultations mrs raby no elizabeth herself she alone can decide for us all and teach us the right path to take do not mistake me i know the road she will point out and am ready to follow it do you think i could deceive her could i ask her to give me her dear self and thus generously raise me to the very height of human happiness with deception on my lips i were indeed unworthy of her if i were capable of such an act yet but for the sake of honest truth i would not even consult her my own mind is made up if you consent i am come to you mr falkner as a suppliant to ask you to give me your adopted child but not to separate you from her i should detest myself if i were the cause of so much sorrow to either if my conduct need explanation in the world you are my excuse i need go no further we must both join in rendering miss raby happy and both i trust remain friends to the end of our lives you are generous replied falkner perhaps you are just i am not unworthy of the friendship you offer were you any other than you are it is because i am such as i am that i venture to make advances which would be impertinent from any other at this moment a light step was heard on the lawn without and elizabeth stood before them she paused in utter wonder on seeing falkner and neville together soon surprise was replaced by undisguised delight her expressive countenance became radiant with happiness falkner addressed her i present a friend to you dear elizabeth i leave you with him he will best explain his purposes and wishes meanwhile i must remark that i consider him bound by nothing that has been said you must take counsel together you must act for your mutual happiness that is all the condition i make i yield to no other be happy and if it be necessary forget me as i am very willing to forget myself falkner left them and they instinctively so to prevent interruption took their way into a woody glade of the park and as they walked beneath the shadows of some beautiful lime trees on the crisp green turf disclosed to each other every inner thought and feeling neville declared his resolve not to separate her from her benefactor if the world censure me he said i am content i am accustomed to its judgments and never found them sway or annoy me i do right for my own heart it is a godlike task to reward the penitent in religion and morality i know that i am justified whether i am in the code of worldly honour i leave others to decide and yet i believe that i am i had once thought to have met falkner in a duel but my father's vengeance prevented that he is now acquitted before all the world of being more than the accidental cause of my dear mother's death knights of old after they fought in right good earnest became friends each finding in the bravery of the other a cause for esteem such is the situation of rupert falkner and myself and we will both join dear elizabeth in making him forget the past and rendering his future years calm and happy elizabeth could only look her gratitude she felt as was most true that this was not a cause for words or reason falkner in himself offered or did not offer full excuse for the generosity of neville no one could see him and not allow that the affectionate duteous son in no way derogated from his reverence for his mother's memory by entirely forgiving him who honoured her as an earthly angel and had deplored through years of unutterable anguish the mortal injury done her satisfied in his own mind that he acted rightly neville did not seek for any other approval and yet he gladly accepted it from elizabeth whose heart touched to its very core by his nobleness felt an almost painful weight of gratitude and love she tried to express it fortunately between lovers mere language is not necessary ineffectually to utter that which transcends all expression neville felt himself most sweetly thanked a more happy pair never trod this lovely earth than the two that closely linked hand in hand and with hearts open and true as the sunlight about them enjoyed the sweetest hour of love the first of acknowledged perpetual union beneath the majestic deep shadowing thickets of belleforest all that had seemed so difficult now took its course easily they did not any of them seek to account for or to justify the course they took they each knew that they could not do other than they did elizabeth could not break faith with falkner neville could not renounce her it might be strange but it must be so they three must remain together through life despite all of tragic and miserable that seemed to separate them even lady cecil admitted that there was no choice elizabeth must be won she was too dear a treasure to be voluntarily renounced in a few weeks the wedding day of sir gerard neville and miss raby being fixed she joined them at belleforest and saw with genuine pleasure the happiness of the two persons whom she esteemed and loved most in the world secured mrs raby's warm heart reaped its own reward in witnessing this felicitous conclusion of her interference whether the reader of this eventful tale will coincide with every other person fully in the confidence of all in the opinion that such was the necessary termination of a position full of difficulty is hard to say but so it was and it is most certain that no woman who ever saw rupert falkner but thought neville just and judicious and if any man disputed this point when he saw elizabeth he was an immediate convert as much happiness as any one can enjoy whose inner mind bears the unhealing wound of a culpable act fell to the portion of falkner he had repented and was forgiven we may believe in heaven as well as on earth he could not forgive himself and this one shadow remained upon his lot it could not be got rid of yet perhaps in the gratitude he felt to those about him in the softened tenderness inspired by the sense that he was dealt with more leniently than he believed that he deserved he found full compensation for the memories that made him feel himself a perpetual mourner beside alithea's grave neville and elizabeth had no drawback to their felicity they cared not for the world and when they did enter it the merits of both commanded respect and liking they were happy in each other happy in a growing family happy in falkner whom as neville had said it was impossible to regard with lukewarm sentiments and they derived a large store of happiness from his enlightened mind from the elevated tone of moral feeling which was the result of his sufferings and from the deep affection with which he regarded them both they were happy also in the wealth which gave scope to the benevolence of their dispositions and in the talents that guided them rightly through the devious maze of life they often visited dromore but their chief time was spent at their seat in bucks near which falkner had purchased a villa he lived in retirement he grew a sage amid his books and his own reflections but his heart was true to itself to the end and his pleasures were derived from the society of his beloved elizabeth of neville who was scarcely less dear and their beautiful children surrounded by these he felt no want of the nearest ties they were to him as his own time passed lightly on bringing no apparent change thus they still live and neville has never for a moment repented the irresistible impulse that led him to become the friend of him whose act had rendered his childhood miserable but who completed the happiness of his maturer years the end
