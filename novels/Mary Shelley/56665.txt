the treasure house of tales by great authors mary wollstonecraft shelley of this volume fifty five copies have been printed on dutch handmade paper of which this is no illustration mary wollstonecraft shelley tales and stories by mary wollstonecraft shelley now first collected with an introduction by richard garnett lld keeper of the printed books british museum london william paterson co introduction it is customary to regard mary shelleys claims to literary distinction as so entirely rooted and grounded in her husbands as to constitute a merely parasitic growth upon his fame it may be unreservedly admitted that her association with shelley and her care of his writings and memory after his death are the strongest of her titles to remembrance it is further undeniable that the most original of her works is also that which betrays the strongest traces of his influence frankenstein was written when her brain magnetized by his companionship was capable of an effort never to be repeated but if the frame of mind which engendered and sustained the work was created by shelley the conception was not his and the diction is dissimilar to his both derive from godwin but neither is godwins the same observation except for an occasional phrase caught from shelley applies to all her subsequent work the frequent exaltation of spirit the ideality and romance may well have been shelleysthe general style of execution neither repeats nor resembles him mary shelleys voice then is not to die away as a mere echo of her illustrious husbands she has the prima facie claim to a hearing due to every writer who can assert the possession of a distinctive individuality and if originality be once conceded to frankenstein as in all equity it must none will dispute the validity of a title to fame grounded on such a work it has solved the question itselfit is famous it is full of faults venial in an author of nineteen but apart from the wild grandeur of the conception it has that which even the maturity of mere talent never attainsthe insight of genius which looks below the appearances of things and perhaps even reverses its own first conception by the discovery of some underlying truth mary shelleys original intention was probably that which would alone have occurred to most writers in her place she meant to paint frankensteins monstrous creation as an object of unmitigated horror the perception that he was an object of intense compassion as well imparted a moral value to what otherwise would have remained a daring flight of imagination it has done more it has helped to create if it did not itself beget a type of personage unknown to ancient fiction the conception of a character at once justly execrable and truly pitiable is altogether modern richard the third and caliban make some approach towards it but the former is too self sufficing in his valour and his villainy to be deeply pitied and the latter too senseless and brutal victor hugo has made himself the laureate of pathetic deformity but much of his work is a conscious or unconscious variation on the original theme of frankenstein none of mary shelleys subsequent romances approached frankenstein in power and popularity the reason may be summed up in a wordlanguor after the death of her infant son in she could never again command the energy which had carried her so vigorously through frankenstein except in one instance her work did not really interest her her heart is not in it valperga contains many passages of exquisite beauty but it was as the authoress herself says a child of mighty slow growth laboriously dug shelley adds out of a hundred old chronicles and wants the fire of imagination which alone could have interpenetrated the mass and fused its diverse ingredients into a satisfying whole of the later novels the last man excepted it is needless to speak save for the autobiographic interest with which professor dowdens fortunate discovery has informed the hitherto slighted pages of lodore but the last man demands great attention for it is not only a work of far higher merit than commonly admitted but of all her works the most characteristic of the authoress the most representative of mary shelley in the character of pining widowhood which it was her destiny to support for the remainder of her life it is an idealized version of her sorrows and sufferings made to contribute a note to the strain which celebrates the final dissolution of the world the languor which mars her other writings is a beauty here harmonizing with the general tone of sublime melancholy most pictures of the end of the world painted or penned have an apocalyptic character mens imaginations are powerfully impressed by great convulsions of nature fire tempest and earthquake are summoned to effect the dissolution of the expiring earth in the last man pestilence is the sole agent and the tragedy is purely human the tale consequently lacks the magnificence which the subject might have seemed to invite but on the other hand gains in pathosa pathos greatly increased when the authoresss identity is recollected and it is observed how vividly actual experience traverses her web of fiction none can have been affected by mary shelleys work so deeply as mary shelley herself for the scenery is that of her familiar haunts the personages are her intimates under thin disguises the universal catastrophe is but the magnified image of the overthrow of her own fortunes and there are pages on pages where every word must have come to her fraught with some unutterably sweet or bitter association yet though her romance could never be to the public what it was to the author it is surprising that criticism should have hitherto done so little justice either to its pervading nobility of thought or to the eloquence and beauty of very many inspired passages when the last man is reprinted it will come before the world as a new work the same is the case with the short tales in this collection the very existence of which is probably unknown to those most deeply interested in mary shelley the entire class of literature to which they belong has long ago gone into times wallet as alms for oblivion they are exclusively contributions to a form of publication utterly superseded in this hasty agethe annual whose very name seemed to prophesy that it would not be perennial for the creations of the intellect however there is a way back from avernus every new generation convicts the last of undue precipitation in discarding the work of its own immediate predecessor the special literary form may be incapable of revival but the substance of that which has pleased or profited its age be it crashaws verse or ethereges comedies or hoadlys pamphlets or what it may always repays a fresh examination and is always found to contribute some element useful or acceptable to the literature of a later day the day of the splendid annual was certainly not a vigorous or healthy one in the history of english belles lettres it came in at the ebb of the great tide of poetry which followed on the french revolution and before the insetting of the great tide of victorian prose a pretentious feebleness characterizes the majority of its productions half of which are hardly above the level of the album yet it had its good points worthy to be taken into account the necessary brevity of contributions to an annual operated as a powerful check on the loquacity so unfortunately encouraged by the three volume novel there was no room for tiresome descriptions of minuti or interminable talk about uninteresting people being moreover largely intended for the perusal of high born maidens in palace towers the annuals frequently affected an exalted order of sentiment which if intolerable in insincere or merely mechanical hands encouraged the emotion of a really passionate writer as much as the present taste for minute delineation represses it this perfectly suited mary shelley no writer felt less call to reproduce the society around her it did not interest her in the smallest degree the bent of her soul was entirely towards the ideal this ideal was by no means buried in the grave of shelley she aspired passionately towards an imaginary perfection all her life and solaced disappointment with what in actual existence too often proved the parent of fresh disillusion in fiction it was otherwise the fashionable style of publication with all its faults encouraged the enthusiasm rapturous or melancholy with which she adored the present or lamented the lost she could fully indulge her taste for exalted sentiment in the annual and the necessary limitations of space afforded less scope for that creeping languor which relaxed the nerve of her more ambitious productions in these little tales she is her perfect self and the reader will find not only the entertainment of interesting fiction but a fair picture of the mind repressed in its energies by circumstances but naturally enthusiastic and aspiring of a lonely thwarted misunderstood woman who could seldom do herself justice and whose precise place in the contemporary constellation of genius remains to be determined the merit of a collection of stories casually written at different periods and under different influences must necessarily be various as a rule it may be said that mary shelley is best when most ideal and excels in proportion to the exaltation of the sentiment embodied in her tale virtue patriotism disinterested affection are very real things to her and her heroes and heroines if generally above the ordinary plane of humanity never transgress the limits of humanity itself her fault is the other way and arises from a positive incapacity for painting the ugly and the commonplace she does her best but her villains do not impress us minute delineation of character is never attempted it lay entirely out of her sphere her tales are consequently executed in the free broad style of the eighteenth century towards which a reaction is now fortunately observable as stories they are very good the theme is always interesting and the sequence of events natural no person and no incident perhaps takes a very strong hold upon the imagination but the general impression is one of a sphere of exalted feeling into which it is good to enter and which ennobles as much as the photography of ugliness degrades the diction as usual in the imaginative literature of the period is frequently too ornate and could spare a good many adjectives but its native strength is revealed in passages of impassioned feeling and remarkable command over the resources of the language is displayed in descriptions of scenes of natural beauty the microscopic touch of a browning or a meredith bringing the scene vividly before the minds eye is indeed absolutely wanting but the landscape is suffused with the poetical atmosphere of a claude or a danby the description at the beginning of the sisters of albano is a characteristic and beautiful instance the biographical element is deeply interwoven with these as with all mary shelleys writings it is of especial interest to search out the traces of her own history and the sources from which her descriptions and ideas may have been derived the mourner has evident vestiges of her residence near windsor when alastor was written and probably reflects the general impression derived from shelleys recollections of eton the visit to pstum in the pole recalls one of the most beautiful of shelleys letters which mary however probably never saw claire clairmonts fortunes seem glanced at in one or two places and the story of the pole may be partly founded on some experience of hers in russia trelawny probably suggested the subjects of the two greek tales the evil eye and euphrasia the mortal immortal is a variation on the theme of st leon and transformation on that of frankenstein these are the only tales in the collection which betray the influence of godwin and neither is so fully worked out as it might have been mary shelley was evidently more at home with a human than with a superhuman ideal her enthusiasm soars high but does not transcend the possibilities of human nature the artistic merit of her tales will be diversely estimated but no reader will refuse the authoress facility of invention

the man whose re ascending star rose oer an empire but beneath thy right tully reposed from rome and where yon bar of girdling mountains intercepts the sight the sabine farm was tilld the weary bards delight it was to see this beautiful lake that i made my last excursion before quitting rome the spring had nearly grown into summer the trees were all in full but fresh green foliage the vine dresser was singing perched among them training his vines the cicada had not yet begun her song the heats therefore had not commenced but at evening the fire flies gleamed among the hills and the cooing aziola assured us of what in that country needs no assurancefine weather for the morrow we set out early in the morning to avoid the heats breakfasted at albano and till ten oclock passed our time in visiting the mosaic the villa of cicero and other curiosities of the place we reposed during the middle of the day in a tent elevated for us at the hill top whence we looked on the hill embosomed lake and the distant eminence crowned by a town with its church other villages and cottages were scattered among the foldings of mountains and beyond we saw the deep blue sea of the southern poets which received the swift and immortal tiber rocking it to repose among its devouring waves the coliseum falls and the pantheon decaysthe very hills of rome are perishingbut the tiber lives for ever flows for ever and for ever feeds the land encircled mediterranean with fresh waters our summer and pleasure seeking party consisted of many to me the most interesting person was the countess atanasia d who was as beautiful as an imagination of raphael and good as the ideal of a poet two of her children accompanied her with animated looks and gentle manners quiet yet enjoying i sat near her watching the changing shadows of the landscape before us as the sun descended it poured a tide of light into the valley of the lake deluging the deep bank formed by the mountain with liquid gold the domes and turrets of the far town flashed and gleamed the trees were dyed in splendour two or three slight clouds which had drunk the radiance till it became their essence floated golden islets in the lustrous empyrean the waters reflecting the brilliancy of the sky and the fire tinted banks beamed a second heaven a second irradiated earth at our feet the mediterranean gazing on the sunas the eyes of a mortal bride fail and are dimmed when reflecting her lovers glancewas lost mixed in his light till it had become one with himlong our souls like the sea the hills and lake drinking in the supreme loveliness we gazed till the too full cup overflowed and we turned away with a sigh at our feet there was a knoll of ground that formed the foreground of our picture two trees lay basking against the sky glittering with the golden light which like dew seemed to hang amid their branches a rock closed the prospect on the other side twined round by creepers and redolent with blooming myrtle a brook crossed by huge stones gushed through the turf and on the fragments of rock that lay about sat two or three persons peasants who attracted our attention one was a hunter as his gun lying on a bank not far off demonstrated yet he was a tiller of the soil his rough straw hat and his picturesque but coarse dress belonged to that class the other was some contadina in the costume of her country returning her basket on her arm from the village to her cottage home they were regarding the stores of a pedlar who with doffed hat stood near some of these consisted of pictures and printsviews of the country and portraits of the madonna our peasants regarded these with pleased attention one might easily make out a story for that pair i said his gun is a help to the imagination and we may fancy him a bandit with his contadina love the terror of all the neighbourhood except of her the most defenceless being in it you speak lightly of such a combination said the lovely countess at my side as if it must not in its nature be the cause of dreadful tragedies the mingling of love with crime is a dread conjunction and lawless pursuits are never followed without bringing on the criminal and all allied to him ineffable misery i speak with emotion for your observation reminds me of an unfortunate girl now one of the sisters of charity in the convent of santa chiara at rome whose unhappy passion for a man such as you mention spread destruction and sorrow widely around her i entreated my lovely friend to relate the history of the nun for a long time she resisted my entreaties as not willing to depress the spirit of a party of pleasure by a tale of sorrow but i urged her and she yielded her sweet italian phraseology now rings in my ears and her beautiful countenance is before me as she spoke the sun set and the moon bent her silver horn in the ebbing tide of glory he had left the lake changed from purple to silver and the trees before so splendid now in dark masses just reflected from their tops the mild moonlight the fire flies flashed among the rocks the bats circled round us meanwhile thus commenced the countess atanasia the nun of whom i speak had a sister older than herself i can remember them when as children they brought eggs and fruit to my fathers villa maria and anina were constantly together with their large straw hats to shield them from the scorching sun they were at work in their fathers podere all day and in the evening when maria who was the elder by four years went to the fountain for water anina ran at her side their cotthe folding of the hill conceals itis at the lake side opposite and about a quarter of a mile up the hill is the rustic fountain of which i speak maria was serious gentle and considerate anina was a laughing merry little creature with the face of a cherub when maria was fifteen their mother fell ill and was nursed at the convent of santa chiara at rome maria attended her never leaving her bedside day or night the nuns thought her an angel she deemed them saints her mother died and they persuaded her to make one of them her father could not but acquiesce in her holy intention and she became one of the sisters of charity the nun nurses of santa chiara once or twice a year she visited her home gave sage and kind advice to anina and sometimes wept to part from her but her piety and her active employments for the sick reconciled her to her fate anina was more sorry to lose her sisters society the other girls of the village did not please her she was a good child and worked hard for her father and her sweetest recompense was the report he made of her to maria and the fond praises and caresses the latter bestowed on her when they met it was not until she was fifteen that anina showed any diminution of affection for her sister yet i cannot call it diminution for she loved her perhaps more than ever though her holy calling and sage lectures prevented her from reposing confidence and made her tremble lest the nun devoted to heaven and good works should read in her eyes and disapprove of the earthly passion that occupied her perhaps a part of her reluctance arose from the reports that were current against her lovers character and certainly from the disapprobation and even hatred of him that her father frequently expressed ill fated anina i know not if in the north your peasants love as ours but the passion of anina was entwined with the roots of her being it was herself she could die but not cease to love the dislike of her father for domenico made their intercourse clandestine he was always at the fountain to fill her pitcher and lift it on her head he attended the same mass and when her father went to albano velletri or rome he seemed to learn by instinct the exact moment of his departure and joined her in the podere labouring with her and for her till the old man was seen descending the mountain path on his return he said he worked for a contadino near nemi anina sometimes wondered that he could spare so much time for her but his excuses were plausible and the result too delightful not to blind the innocent girl to its obvious cause poor domenico the reports spread against him were too well founded his sole excuse was that his father had been a robber before him and he had spent his early years among these lawless men he had better things in his nature and yearned for the peace of the guiltless yet he could hardly be called guilty for no dread crime stained him nevertheless he was an outlaw and a bandit and now that he loved anina these names were the stings of an adder to pierce his soul he would have fled from his comrades to a far country but anina dwelt amid their very haunts at this period also the police established by the french government which then possessed rome made these bands more alive to the conduct of their members and rumours of active measures to be taken against those who occupied the hills near albano nemi and velletri caused them to draw together in tighter bonds domenico would not if he could desert his friends in the hour of danger on a festa at this timeit was towards the end of octoberanina strolled with her father among the villagers who all over italy make holiday by congregating and walking in one place their talk was entirely of the ladri and the french and many terrible stories were related of the extirpation of banditti in the kingdom of naples and the mode by which the french succeeded in their undertaking was minutely described the troops scoured the country visiting one haunt of the robbers after the other and dislodging them tracked them as in those countries they hunt the wild beasts of the forest till drawing the circle narrower they enclosed them in one spot they then drew a cordon round the place which they guarded with the utmost vigilance forbidding any to enter it with provisions on pain of instant death and as this menace was rigorously executed in a short time the besieged bandits were starved into a surrender the french troops were now daily expected for they had been seen at velletri and nemi at the same time it was affirmed that several outlaws had taken up their abode at rocca giovane a deserted village on the summit of one of these hills and it was supposed that they would make that place the scene of their final retreat the next day as anina worked in the podere a party of french horse passed by along the road that separated her garden from the lake curiosity made her look at them and her beauty was too great not to attract their observations and address soon drove her away for a woman in love consecrates herself to her lover and deems the admiration of others to be profanation she spoke to her father of the impertinence of these men and he answered by rejoicing at their arrival and the destruction of the lawless bands that would ensue when in the evening anina went to the fountain she looked timidly around and hoped that domenico would be at his accustomed post for the arrival of the french destroyed her feeling of security she went rather later than usual and a cloudy evening made it seem already dark the wind roared among the trees bending hither and thither even the stately cypresses the waters of the lake were agitated into high waves and dark masses of thundercloud lowered over the hill tops giving a lurid tinge to the landscape anina passed quickly up the mountain path when she came in sight of the fountain which was rudely hewn in the living rock she saw domenico leaning against a projection of the hill his hat drawn over his eyes his tabaro fallen from his shoulders his arms folded in an attitude of dejection he started when he saw her his voice and phrases were broken and unconnected yet he never gazed on her with such ardent love nor solicited her to delay her departure with such impassioned tenderness how glad i am to find you here she said i was fearful of meeting one of the french soldiers i dread them even more than the banditti domenico cast a look of eager inquiry on her and then turned away saying sorry am i that i shall not be here to protect you i am obliged to go to rome for a week or two you will be faithful anina mia you will love me though i never see you more the interview under these circumstances was longer than usual he led her down the path till they nearly came in sight of her cottage still they lingered a low whistle was heard among the myrtle underwood at the lake side he started it was repeated and he answered it by a similar note anina terrified was about to ask what this meant when for the first time he pressed her to his heart kissed her roseate lips and with a muttered carissima addio left her springing down the bank and as she gazed in wonder she thought she saw a boat cross a line of light made by the opening of a cloud she stood long absorbed in reverie wondering and remembering with thrilling pleasure the quick embrace and impassioned farewell of her lover she delayed so long that her father came to seek her each evening after this anina visited the fountain at the ave maria he was not there each day seemed an age and incomprehensible fears occupied her heart about a fortnight after letters arrived from maria they came to say that she had been ill of the malaria fever that she was now convalescent but that change of air was necessary for her recovery and that she had obtained leave to spend a month at home at albano she asked her father to come the next day to fetch her these were pleasant tidings for anina she resolved to disclose everything to her sister and during her long visit she doubted not but that she would contrive her happiness old andrea departed the following morning and the whole day was spent by the sweet girl in dreams of future bliss in the evening maria arrived weak and wan with all the marks of that dread illness about her yet as she assured her sister feeling quite well as they sat at their frugal supper several villagers came in to inquire for maria but all their talk was of the french soldiers and the robbers of whom a band of at least twenty was collected in rocca giovane strictly watched by the military we may be grateful to the french said andrea for this good deed the country will be rid of these ruffians true friend said another but it is horrible to think what these men suffer they have it appears exhausted all the food they brought with them to the village and are literally starving they have not an ounce of maccaroni among them and a poor fellow who was taken and executed yesterday was a mere anatomy you could tell every bone in his skin there was a sad story the other day said another of an old man from nemi whose son they say is among them at rocca giovane he was found within the lines with some baccall under his pastrano and shot on the spot there is not a more desperate gang observed the first speaker in the states and the regno put together they have sworn never to yield but upon good terms to secure these their plan is to waylay passengers and make prisoners whom they keep as hostages for mild treatment from the government but the french are merciless they are better pleased that the bandits wreak their vengeance on these poor creatures than spare one of their lives they have captured two persons already said another and there is old betta tossi half frantic for she is sure her son is taken he has not been at home these ten days i should rather guess said an old man that he went there with good will the young scapegrace kept company with domenico baldi of nemi no worse company could he have kept in the whole country said andrea domenico is the bad son of a bad race is he in the village with the rest my own eyes assured me of that replied the other when i was up the hill with eggs and fowls to the piquette there i saw the branches of an ilex move the poor fellow was weak perhaps and could not keep his hold presently he dropped to the ground every musket was levelled at him but he started up and was away like a hare among the rocks once he turned and then i saw domenico as plainly though thinner poor lad by much than he wasas plainly as i now seesanta virgine what is the matter with nina she had fainted the company broke up and she was left to her sisters care when the poor child came to herself she was fully aware of her situation and said nothing except expressing a wish to retire to rest maria was in high spirits at the prospect of her long holiday at home but the illness of her sister made her refrain from talking that night and blessing her as she said good night she soon slept domenico starvingdomenico trying to escape and dying through hunger was the vision of horror that wholly possessed poor anina at another time the discovery that her lover was a robber might have inflicted pangs as keen as those which she now felt but this at present made a faint impression obscured by worse wretchedness maria was in a deep and tranquil sleep anina rose dressed herself silently and crept downstairs she stored her market basket with what food there was in the house and unlatching the cottage door issued forth resolved to reach rocca giovane and to administer to her lovers dreadful wants the night was dark but this was favourable for she knew every path and turn of the hills every bush and knoll of ground between her home and the deserted village which occupies the summit of that hill you may see the dark outline of some of its houses about two hours walk from her cottage the night was dark but still the libeccio brought the clouds below the mountain tops and veiled the horizon in mist not a leaf stirred her footsteps sounded loud in her ears but resolution overcame fear she had entered yon ilex grove her spirits rose with her success when suddenly she was challenged by a sentinel no time for escape fear chilled her blood her basket dropped from her arm its contents rolled out on the ground the soldier fired his gun and brought several others round him she was made prisoner in the morning when maria awoke she missed her sister from her side i have overslept myself she thought and nina would not disturb me but when she came downstairs and met her father and anina did not appear they began to wonder she was not in the podere two hours passed and then andrea went to seek her entering the near village he saw the contadini crowding together and a stifled exclamation of ecco il padre told him that some evil had betided his first impression was that his daughter was drowned but the truth that she had been taken by the french carrying provisions within the forbidden line was still more terrible he returned in frantic desperation to his cottage first to acquaint maria with what had happened and then to ascend the hill to save his child from her impending fate maria heard his tale with horror but an hospital is a school in which to learn self possession and presence of mind do you remain my father she said i will go my holy character will awe these men my tears move them trust me i swear that i will save my sister andrea yielded to her superior courage and energy the nuns of santa chiara when out of their convent do not usually wear their monastic habit but dress simply in a black gown maria however had brought her nuns habiliments with her and thinking thus to impress the soldiers with respect she now put them on she received her fathers benediction and asking that of the virgin and the saints she departed on her expedition ascending the hill she was soon stopped by the sentinels she asked to see their commanding officer and being conducted to him she announced herself as the sister of the unfortunate girl who had been captured the night before the officer who had received her with carelessness now changed countenance his serious look frightened maria who clasped her hands exclaiming you have not injured the child she is safe she is safenow he replied with hesitation but there is no hope of pardon holy virgin have mercy on her what will be done to her i have received strict orders in two hours she dies no no exclaimed maria impetuously that cannot be you cannot be so wicked as to murder a child like her she is old enough madame said the officer to know that she ought not to disobey orders mine are so strict that were she but nine years old she dies these terrible words stung maria to fresh resolution she entreated for mercy she knelt she vowed that she would not depart without her sister she appealed to heaven and the saints the officer though cold hearted was good natured and courteous and he assured her with the utmost gentleness that her supplications were of no avail that were the criminal his own daughter he must enforce his orders as a sole concession he permitted her to see her sister despair inspired the nun with energy she almost ran up the hill out speeding her guide they crossed a folding of the hills to a little sheep cot where sentinels paraded before the door there was no glass to the windows so the shutters were shut and when maria first went in from the bright daylight she hardly saw the slight figure of her sister leaning against the wall her dark hair fallen below her waist her head sunk on her bosom over which her arms were folded she started wildly as the door opened saw her sister and sprang with a piercing shriek into her arms they were left alone together anina uttered a thousand frantic exclamations beseeching her sister to save her and shuddering at the near approach of her fate maria had felt herself since their mothers death the natural protectress and support of her sister and she never deemed herself so called on to fulfil this character as now that the trembling girl clasped her neckher tears falling on her cheeks and her choked voice entreating her to save her the thoughto could i suffer instead of you was in her heart and she was about to express it when it suggested another idea on which she was resolved to act first she soothed anina by her promises then glanced round the cot they were quite alone she went to the window and through a crevice saw the soldiers conversing at some distance yes dearest sister she cried i willi can save youquickwe must change dressesthere is no time to be lost iyou must escape in my habit and you remain to die they dare not murder the innocent a nun fear not for mei am safe anina easily yielded to her sister but her fingers trembled every string she touched she entangled maria was perfectly self possessed pale but calm she tied up her sisters long hair and adjusted her veil over it so as to conceal it she unlaced her bodice and arranged the folds of her own habit on her with the greatest carethen more hastily she assumed the dress of her sister putting on after a lapse of many years her native contadina costume anina stood by weeping and helpless hardly hearing her sisters injunctions to return speedily to their father and under his guidance to seek sanctuary the guard now opened the door anina clung to her sister in terror while she in soothing tones entreated her to calm herself the soldier said they must delay no longer for the priest had arrived to confess the prisoner to anina the idea of confession associated with death was terrible to maria it brought hope she whispered in a smothered voice the priest will protect mefear nothasten to our father anina almost mechanically obeyed weeping with her handkerchief placed unaffectedly before her face she passed the soldiers they closed the door on the prisoner who hastened to the window and saw her sister descend the hill with tottering steps till she was lost behind some rising ground the nun fell on her kneescold dew bathed her brow instinctively she feared the french had shown small respect for the monastic character they destroyed the convents and desecrated the churches would they be merciful to her and spare the innocent alas was not anina innocent also her sole crime had been disobeying an arbitrary command and she had done the same courage cried maria perhaps i am fitter to die than my sister is gesu pardon me my sins but i do not believe that i shall out live this day in the meantime anina descended the hill slowly and trembling she feared discoveryshe feared for her sisterand above all at the present moment she feared the reproaches and anger of her father by dwelling on this last idea it became exaggerated into excessive terror and she determined instead of returning to her home to make a circuit among the hills to find her way by herself to albano where she trusted to find protection from her pastor and confessor she avoided the open paths and following rather the direction she wished to pursue than any beaten road she passed along nearer to rocca giovane than she anticipated she looked up at its ruined houses and bell less steeple straining her eyes to catch a glimpse of him the author of all her ills a low but distinct whistle reached her ear not far off she startedshe remembered that on the night when she last saw domenico a note like that had called him from her side the sound was echoed and re echoed from other quarters she stood aghast her bosom heaving her hands clasped first she saw a dark and ragged head of hair shadowing two fiercely gleaming eyes rise from beneath a bush she screamed but before she could repeat her scream three men leapt from behind a rock secured her arms threw a cloth over her face and hurried her up the acclivity their talk as she went along informed her of the horror and danger of her situation pity they said that the holy father and some of his red stockings did not command the troops with a nun in their hands they might obtain any terms coarse jests passed as they dragged their victim towards their ruined village the paving of the street told her when they arrived at rocca giovane and the change of atmosphere that they entered a house they unbandaged her eyes the scene was squalid and miserable the walls ragged and black with smoke the floor strewn with offals and dirt a rude table and broken bench was all the furniture and the leaves of indian corn heaped high in one corner served it seemed for a bed for a man lay on it his head buried in his folded arms anina looked round on her savage hosts their countenances expressed every variety of brutal ferocity now rendered more dreadful from gaunt famine and suffering oh there is none who will save me she cried the voice startled the man who was lying on the floor he lept upit was domenico domenico so changed with sunk cheeks and eyes matted hair and looks whose wildness and desperation differed little from the dark countenances around him could this be her lover his recognition and surprise at her dress led to an explanation when the robbers first heard that their prey was no prize they were mortified and angry but when she related the danger she had incurred by endeavouring to bring them food they swore with horrid oaths that no harm should befall her but that if she liked she might make one of them in all honour and equality the innocent girl shuddered let me go she cried let me only escape and hide myself in a convent for ever domenico looked at her in agony yes poor child he said go save yourself god grant no evil befall you the ruin is too wide already then turning eagerly to his comrades he continued you hear her story she was to have been shot for bringing food to us her sister has substituted herself in her place we know the french one victim is to them as good as another maria dies in their hands let us save her our time is up we must fall like men or starve like dogs we have still ammunition still some strength left to arms let us rush on the poltroons free their prisoner and escape or die there needed but an impulse like this to urge the outlaws to desperate resolves they prepared their arms with looks of ferocious determination domenico meanwhile led anina out of the house to the verge of the hill inquiring whether she intended to go on her saying to albano he observed that were hardly safe be guided by me i entreat you take these piastres hire the first conveyance you find hasten to rome to the convent of santa chiara for pitys sake do not linger in this neighbourhood i will obey your injunctions domenico she replied but i cannot take your money it has cost you too dear fear not i shall arrive safely at rome without that ill fated silver domenicos comrades now called loudly to him he had no time to urge his request he threw the despised dollars at her feet nina adieu for ever he said may you love again more happily never she replied god has saved me in this dress it were sacrilege to change it i shall never quit santa chiara domenico had led her a part of the way down the rock his comrades appeared at the top calling to him gesu save you cried he reach the conventmaria shall join you there before night farewell he hastily kissed her hand and sprang up the acclivity to rejoin his impatient friends the unfortunate andrea had waited long for the return of his children the leafless trees and bright clear atmosphere permitted every object to be visible but he saw no trace of them on the hill side the shadows of the dial showed noon to be passed when with uncontrollable impatience he began to climb the hill towards the spot where anina had been taken the path he pursued was in part the same that this unhappy girl had taken on her way to rome the father and daughter met the old man saw the nuns dress and saw her unaccompanied she covered her face with her hands in a transport of fear and shame but when mistaking her for maria he asked in a tone of anguish for his youngest darling her arms fellshe dared not raise her eyes which streamed with tears unhappy girl exclaimed andrea where is your sister she pointed to the cottage prison now discernible near the summit of a steep acclivity she is safe she replied she saved me but they dare not murder her heaven bless her for this good deed exclaimed the old man fervently but you hasten on your way and i will go in search of her each proceeded on an opposite path the old man wound up the hill now in view and now losing sight of the hut where his child was captive he was aged and the way was steep once when the closing of the hill hid the point towards which he for ever strained his eyes a single shot was fired in that direction his staff fell from his hands his knees trembled and failed him several minutes of dead silence elapsed before he recovered himself sufficiently to proceed full of fears he went on and at the next turn saw the cot again a party of soldiers were on the open space before it drawn up in a line as if expecting an attack in a few moments from above them shots were fired which they returned and the whole was enveloped and veiled in smoke still andrea climbed the hill eager to discover what had become of his child the firing continued quick and hot now and then in the pauses of musketry and the answering echoes of the mountains he heard a funeral chant presently before he was aware at a turning of the hill he met a company of priests and contadini carrying a large cross and a bier the miserable father rushed forward with frantic impatience the awe struck peasants set down their loadthe face was uncovered and the wretched man fell helpless on the corpse of his murdered child the countess atanasia paused overcome by the emotions inspired by the history she related a long pause ensued at length one of the party observed maria then was the sacrifice to her goodness the french said the countess did not venerate her holy vocation one peasant girl to them was the same as another the immolation of any victim suited their purpose of awe striking the peasantry scarcely however had the shot entered her heart and her blameless spirit been received by the saints in paradise when domenico and his followers rushed down the hill to avenge her and themselves the contest was furious and bloody twenty french soldiers fell and not one of the banditti escapeddomenico the foremost of the assailants being the first to fall i asked and where are now anina and her father you may see them if you will said the countess on your return to rome she is a nun of santa chiara constant acts of benevolence and piety have inspired her with calm and resignation her prayers are daily put up for domenicos soul and she hopes through the intercession of the virgin to rejoin him in the other world andrea is very old he has outlived the memory of his sufferings but he derives comfort from the filial attentions of his surviving daughter but when i look at his cottage on this lake and remember the happy laughing face of anina among the vines i shudder at the recollection of the passion that has made her cheeks pale her thoughts for ever conversant with death her only wish to find repose in the grave ii ferdinando eboli during this quiet time of peace we are fast forgetting the exciting and astonishing events of the napoleonic wars and the very names of europes conquerors are becoming antiquated to the ears of our children those were more romantic days than these for the revulsions occasioned by revolution or invasion were full of romance and travellers in those countries in which these scenes had place hear strange and wonderful stories whose truth so much resembles fiction that while interested in the narration we never give implicit credence to the narrator of this kind is a tale i heard at naples the fortunes of war perhaps did not influence its actors yet it appears improbable that any circumstances so out of the usual routine could have had place under the garish daylight that peace sheds upon the world when murat then called gioacchino king of naples raised his italian regiments several young nobles who had before been scarcely more than vine dressers on the soil were inspired with a love of arms and presented themselves as candidates for military honours among these was the young count eboli the father of this youthful noble had followed ferdinand to sicily but his estates lay principally near salerno and he was naturally desirous of preserving them while the hopes that the french government held out of glory and prosperity to his country made him often regret that he had followed his legitimate but imbecile king to exile when he died therefore he recommended his son to return to naples to present himself to his old and tried friend the marchese spina who held a high office in murats government and through his means to reconcile himself to the new king all this was easily achieved the young and gallant count was permitted to possess his patrimony and as a further pledge of good fortune he was betrothed to the only child of the marchese spina the nuptials were deferred till the end of the ensuing campaign meanwhile the army was put in motion and count eboli only obtained such short leave of absence as permitted him to visit for a few hours the villa of his future father in law there to take leave of him and his affianced bride the villa was situated on one of the apennines to the north of salerno and looked down over the plain of calabria in which pstum is situated on to the blue mediterranean a precipice on one side a brawling mountain torrent and a thick grove of ilex added beauty to the sublimity of its site count eboli ascended the mountain path in all the joy of youth and hope his stay was brief an exhortation and a blessing from the marchese a tender farewell graced by gentle tears from the fair adalinda were the recollections he was to bear with him to inspire him with courage and hope in danger and absence the sun had just sunk behind the distant isle of istria when kissing his ladys hand he said a last addio and with slower steps and more melancholy mien rode down the mountain on his road to naples that same night adalinda retired early to her apartment dismissing her attendants and then restless from mingled fear and hope she threw open the glass door that led to a balcony looking over the edge of the hill upon the torrent whose loud rushing often lulled her to sleep but whose waters were concealed from sight by the ilex trees which lifted their topmost branches above the guarding parapet of the balcony leaning her cheek upon her hand she thought of the dangers her lover would encounter of her loneliness the while of his letters and of his return a rustling sound now caught her ear was it the breeze among the ilex trees her own veil was unwaved by every wind her tresses even heavy in their own rich beauty only were not lifted from her cheek again those sounds her blood retreated to her heart and her limbs trembled what could it mean suddenly the upper branches of the nearest tree were disturbed they opened and the faint starlight showed a mans figure among them he prepared to spring from his hold on to the wall it was a feat of peril first the soft voice of her lover bade her fear not and on the next instant he was at her side calming her terrors and recalling her spirits that almost left her gentle frame from mingled surprise dread and joy he encircled her waist with his arm and pouring forth a thousand passionate expressions of love she leant on his shoulder and wept from agitation while he covered her hands with kisses and gazed on her with ardent adoration then in calmer mood they sat together triumph and joy lighted up his eyes and a modest blush glowed on her cheek for never before had she sat alone with him nor heard unrestrained his impassioned assurances of affection it was indeed loves own hour the stars trembled on the roof of his eternal temple the dashing of the torrent the mild summer atmosphere and the mysterious aspect of the darkened scenery were all in unison to inspire security and voluptuous hope they talked of how their hearts through the medium of divine nature might hold commune during absence of the joys of reunion and of their prospect of perfect happiness the moment at last arrived when he must depart one tress of this silken hair said he raising one of the many curls that clustered on her neck i will place it on my heart a shield to protect me against the swords and balls of the enemy he drew his keen edged dagger from its sheath ill weapon for so gentle a deed he said severing the lock and at the same moment many drops of blood fell fast on the fair arm of the lady he answered her fearful inquiries by showing a gash he had awkwardly inflicted on his left hand first he insisted on securing his prize and then he permitted her to bind his wound which she did half laughing half in sorrow winding round his hand a riband loosened from her own arm now farewell he cried i must ride twenty miles ere dawn and the descending bear shows that midnight is past his descent was difficult but he achieved it happily and the stave of a songwhose soft sounds rose like the smoke of incense from an altarfrom the dell below to her impatient ear assured her of his safety as is always the case when an account is gathered from eye witnesses i never could ascertain the exact date of these events they occurred however while murat was king of naples and when he raised his italian regiments count eboli as aforesaid became a junior officer in them and served with much distinction though i cannot name either the country or the battle in which he acted so conspicuous a part that he was on the spot promoted to a troop not long after this event and while he was stationed in the north of italy gioacchino sending for him to headquarters late one evening entrusted him with a confidential mission across a country occupied by the enemys troops to a town possessed by the french it was necessary to undertake the expedition during the night and he was expected to return on that succeeding the following day the king himself gave him his despatches and the word and the noble youth with modest firmness protested that he would succeed or die in the fulfilment of his trust it was already night and the crescent moon was low in the west when count ferdinando eboli mounting his favourite horse at a quick gallop cleared the streets of the town and then following the directions given him crossed the country among the fields planted with vines carefully avoiding the main road it was a beauteous and still night calm and sleep occupied the earth war the blood hound slumbered the spirit of love alone had life at that silent hour exulting in the hope of glory our young hero commenced his journey and visions of aggrandizement and love formed his reveries a distant sound roused him he checked his horse and listened voices approached when recognising the speech of a german he turned from the path he was following to a still straighter way but again the tone of an enemy was heard and the trampling of horses eboli did not hesitate he dismounted tied his steed to a tree and skirting along the enclosure of the field trusted to escape thus unobserved he succeeded after an hours painful progress and arrived on the borders of a stream which as the boundary between two states was the mark of his having finally escaped danger descending the steep bank of the river which with his horse he might perhaps have forded he now prepared to swim he held his despatch in one hand threw away his cloak and was about to plunge into the water when from under the dark shade of the argine which had concealed them he was suddenly arrested by unseen hands cast on the ground bound gagged and blinded and then placed into a little boat which was sculled with infinite rapidity down the stream there seemed so much of premeditation in the act that it baffled conjecture yet he must believe himself a prisoner to the austrian while however he still vainly reflected the boat was moored he was lifted out and the change of atmosphere made him aware that they entered some house with extreme care and celerity yet in the utmost silence he was stripped of his clothes and two rings he wore drawn from his fingers other habiliments were thrown over him and then no departing footstep was audible but soon he heard the splash of a single oar and he felt himself alone he lay perfectly unable to move the only relief his captor or captors had afforded him being the exchange of the gag for a tightly bound handkerchief for hours he thus remained with a tortured mind bursting with rage impatience and disappointment now writhing as well as he could in his endeavours to free himself now still in despair his despatches were taken away and the period was swiftly passing when he could by his presence have remedied in some degree this evil the morning dawned and though the full glare of the sun could not visit his eyes he felt it play upon his limbs as the day advanced hunger preyed on him and though amidst the visitation of mightier he at first disdained this minor evil towards evening it became in spite of himself the predominant sensation night approached and the fear that he should remain and even starve in this unvisited solitude had more than once thrilled through his frame when feminine voices and a childs gay laugh met his ear he heard persons enter the apartment and he was asked in his native language while the ligature was taken from his mouth the cause of his present situation he attributed it to banditti his bonds were quickly cut and his banded eyes restored to sight it was long before he recovered himself water brought from the stream however was some refreshment and by degrees he resumed the use of his senses and saw that he was in a dilapidated shepherds cot with no one near him save the peasant girl and a child who had liberated him they rubbed his ankles and wrists and the little fellow offered him some bread and eggs after which refreshment and an hours repose ferdinando felt himself sufficiently restored to revolve his adventure in his mind and to determine on the conduct he was to pursue he looked at the dress which had been given him in exchange for that which he had worn it was of the plainest and meanest description still no time was to be lost and he felt assured that the only step he could take was to return with all speed to the headquarters of the neapolitan army and inform the king of his disasters and his loss it were long to follow his backward steps and to tell all of indignation and disappointment that swelled his heart he walked painfully but resolutely all night and by three in the morning entered the town where gioacchino then was he was challenged by the sentinels he gave the word confided to him by murat and was instantly made prisoner by the soldiers he declared to them his name and rank and the necessity he was under of immediately seeing the king he was taken to the guard house and the officer on duty there listened with contempt to his representations telling him that count ferdinando eboli had returned three hours before ordering him to be confined for further examination as a spy eboli loudly insisted that some impostor had taken his name and while he related the story of his capture another officer came in who recognised his person other individuals acquainted with him joined the party and as the impostor had been seen by none but the officer of the night his tale gained ground a young frenchman of superior rank who had orders to attend the king early in the morning carried a report of what was going forward to murat himself the tale was so strange that the king sent for the young count and then in spite of having seen and believed in his counterfeit a few hours before and having received from him an account of his mission which had been faithfully executed the appearance of the youth staggered him and he commanded the presence of him who as count eboli had appeared before him a few hours previously as ferdinand stood beside the king his eye glanced at a large and splendid mirror his matted hair his bloodshot eyes his haggard looks and torn and mean dress derogated from the nobility of his appearance and still less did he appear like the magnificent count eboli when to his utter confusion and astonishment his counterfeit stood beside him he was perfect in all the outward signs that denoted high birth and so like him whom he represented that it would have been impossible to discern one from the other apart the same chestnut hair clustered on his brow the sweet and animated hazel eyes were the same the one voice was the echo of the other the composure and dignity of the pretender gained the suffrages of those around when he was told of the strange appearance of another count eboli he laughed in a frank good humoured manner and turning to ferdinand said you honour me much in selecting me for your personation but there are two or three things i like about myself so well that you must excuse my unwillingness to exchange myself for you ferdinand would have answered but the false count with greater haughtiness turning to the king said will your majesty decide between us i cannot bandy words with a fellow of this sort irritated by scorn ferdinand demanded leave to challenge the pretender who said that if the king and his brother officers did not think that he should degrade himself and disgrace the army by going out with a common vagabond he was willing to chastise him even at the peril of his own life but the king after a few more questions feeling assured that the unhappy noble was an impostor in severe and menacing terms reprehended him for his insolence telling him that he owed it to his mercy alone that he was not executed as a spy ordering him instantly to be conducted without the walls of the town with threats of weighty punishment if he ever dared to subject his impostures to further trial it requires a strong imagination and the experience of much misery fully to enter into ferdinands feelings from high rank glory hope and love he was hurled to utter beggary and disgrace the insulting words of his triumphant rival and the degrading menaces of his so lately gracious sovereign rang in his ears every nerve in his frame writhed with agony but fortunately for the endurance of human life the worst misery in early youth is often but a painful dream which we cast off when slumber quits our eyes after a struggle with intolerable anguish hope and courage revived in his heart his resolution was quickly made he would return to naples relate his story to the marchese spina and through his influence obtain at least an impartial hearing from the king it was not however in his peculiar situation an easy task to put his determination into effect he was penniless his dress bespoke poverty he had neither friend nor kinsman near but such as would behold in him the most impudent of swindlers still his courage did not fail him the kind italian soil in the autumnal season now advanced furnished him with chestnuts arbutus berries and grapes he took the most direct road over the hills avoiding towns and indeed every habitation travelling principally in the night when except in cities the officers of government had retired from their stations how he succeeded in getting from one end of italy to the other it is difficult to say but certain it is that after the interval of a few weeks he presented himself at the villa spina with considerable difficulty he obtained admission to the presence of the marchese who received him standing with an inquiring look not at all recognising the noble youth ferdinand requested a private interview for there were several visitors present his voice startled the marchese who complied taking him into another apartment here ferdinand disclosed himself and with rapid and agitated utterance was relating the history of his misfortunes when the tramp of horses was heard the great bell rang and a domestic announced count ferdinando eboli it is himself cried the youth turning pale the words were strange and they appeared still more so when the person announced entered the perfect semblance of the young noble whose name he assumed as he had appeared when last at his departure he trod the pavement of the hall he inclined his head gracefully to the baron turning with a glance of some surprise but more disdain towards ferdinand exclaiming thou here ferdinand drew himself up to his full height in spite of fatigue ill fare and coarse garments his manner was full of dignity the marchese looked at him fixedly and started as he marked his proud mien and saw in his expressive features the very face of eboli but again he was perplexed when he turned and discerned as in a mirror the same countenance reflected by the new comer who underwent this scrutiny somewhat impatiently in brief and scornful words he told the marchese that this was a second attempt in the intruder to impose himself as count eboli that the trick had failed before and would again adding laughing that it was hard to be brought to prove himself to be himself against the assertion of a briccone whose likeness to him and matchless impudence were his whole stock in trade why my good fellow continued he sneeringly you put me out of conceit with myself to think that one apparently so like me should get on no better in the world the blood mounted into ferdinands cheeks on his enemys bitter taunts with difficulty he restrained himself from closing with his foe while the words traitorous impostor burst from his lips the baron commanded the fierce youth to be silent and moved by a look that he remembered to be ferdinands he said gently by your respect for me i adjure you to be patient fear not but that i will deal impartially then turning to the pretended eboli he added that he could not doubt but that he was the true count and asked excuse for his previous indecision at first the latter appeared angry but at length he burst into a laugh and then apologising for his ill breeding continued laughing heartily at the perplexity of the marchese it is certain his gaiety gained more credit with his auditor than the indignant glances of poor ferdinand the false count then said that after the kings menaces he had entertained no expectation that the farce was to be played over again he had obtained leave of absence of which he profited to visit his future father in law after having spent a few days in his own palazzo at naples until now ferdinand had listened silently with a feeling of curiosity anxious to learn all he could of the actions and motives of his rival but at these last words he could no longer contain himself what cried he hast thou usurped my place in my own fathers house and dared assume my power in my ancestral halls a gush of tears overpowered the youth he hid his face in his hands fierceness and pride lit up the countenance of the pretender by the eternal god and the sacred cross i swear he exclaimed that palace is my fathers palace those halls the halls of my ancestors ferdinand looked up with surprise and the earth opens not he said to swallow the perjured man he then at the call of the marchese related his adventures while scorn mantled on the features of his rival the marchese looking at both could not free himself from doubt he turned from one to the other in spite of the wild and disordered appearance of poor ferdinand there was something in him that forbade his friend to condemn him as the impostor but then it was utterly impossible to pronounce such the gallant and noble looking youth who could only be acknowledged as the real count by the disbelief of the others tale the marchese calling an attendant sent for his fair daughter this decision said he shall be made over to the subtle judgment of a woman and the keen penetration of one who loves both the youths now smiledthe same smile the same expressionthat of anticipated triumph the baron was more perplexed than ever adalinda had heard of the arrival of count eboli and entered resplendent in youth and happiness she turned quickly towards him who resembled most the person she expected to see when a well known voice pronounced her name and she gazed aghast on the double appearance of the lover her father taking her hand briefly explained the mystery and bade her assure herself which was her affianced husband signorina said ferdinand disdain me not because i appear before you thus in disgrace and misery your love your goodness will restore me to prosperity and happiness i know not by what means said the wondering girl but surely you are count eboli adalinda said the rival youth waste not your words on a villain lovely and deceived one i trust trembling i say it that i can with one word assure you that i am eboli adalinda said ferdinand i placed the nuptial ring on your finger before god your vows were given to me the false count approached the lady and bending one knee took from his heart a locket enclosing hair tied with a green riband which she recognised to have worn and pointed to a slight scar on his left hand adalinda blushed deeply and turning to her father said motioning towards the kneeling youth he is ferdinand all protestations now from the unhappy eboli were vain the marchese would have cast him into a dungeon but at the earnest request of his rival he was not detained but thrust ignominiously from the villa the rage of a wild beast newly chained was less than the tempest of indignation that now filled the heart of ferdinand physical suffering from the fatigue and fasting was added to his internal anguish for some hours madness if that were madness which never forgets its ill possessed him in a tumult of feelings there was one predominant idea it was to take possession of his fathers house and to try by ameliorating the fortuitous circumstances of his lot to gain the upper hand of his adversary he expended his remaining strength in reaching naples entered his family palace and was received and acknowledged by his astonished domestics one of his first acts was to take from a cabinet a miniature of his father encircled with jewels and to invoke the aid of the paternal spirit refreshment and a bath restored him to some of his usual strength and he looked forward with almost childish delight to one night to be spent in peace under the roof of his fathers house this was not permitted ere midnight the great bell sounded his rival entered as master with the marchese spina the result may be divined the marchese appeared more indignant than the false eboli he insisted that the unfortunate youth should be imprisoned the portrait whose setting was costly found on him proved him guilty of robbery he was given into the hands of the police and thrown into a dungeon i will not dwell on the subsequent scenes he was tried by the tribunal condemned as guilty and sentenced to the galleys for life on the eve of the day when he was to be removed from the neapolitan prison to work on the roads in calabria his rival visited him in his dungeon for some moments both looked at the other in silence the impostor gazed on the prisoner with mingled pride and compassion there was evidently a struggle in his heart the answering glance of ferdinand was calm free and dignified he was not resigned to his hard fate but he disdained to make any exhibition of despair to his cruel and successful foe a spasm of pain seemed to wrench the bosom of the false one and he turned aside striving to recover the hardness of heart which had hitherto supported him in the prosecution of his guilty enterprise ferdinand spoke first what would the triumphant criminal with his innocent victim his visitant replied haughtily do not address such epithets to me or i leave you to your fate i am that which i say i am to me this boast cried ferdinand scornfully but perhaps these walls have ears heaven at least is not deaf said the deceiver favouring heaven which knows and admits my claim but a truce to this idle discussion compassiona distaste to see one so very like myself in such ill conditiona foolish whim perhaps on which you may congratulate yourselfhas led me hither the bolts of your dungeon are drawn here is a purse of gold fulfil one easy condition and you are free and that condition sign this paper he gave to ferdinand a writing containing a confession of his imputed crimes the hand of the guilty youth trembled as he gave it there was confusion in his mien and a restless uneasy rolling of his eye ferdinand wished in one mighty word potent as lightning loud as thunder to convey his burning disdain of this proposal but expression is weak and calm is more full of power than storm without a word he tore the paper in two pieces and threw them at the feet of his enemy with a sudden change of manner his visitant conjured him in voluble and impetuous terms to comply ferdinand answered only by requesting to be left alone now and then a half word broke uncontrollably from his lips but he curbed himself yet he could not hide his agitation when as an argument to make him yield the false count assured him that he was already married to adalinda bitter agony thrilled poor ferdinands frame but he preserved a calm mien and an unaltered resolution having exhausted every menace and every persuasion his rival left him the purpose for which he came unaccomplished on the morrow with many others the refuse of mankind count ferdinando eboli was led in chains to the unwholesome plains of calabria to work there at the roads i must hurry over some of the subsequent events for a detailed account of them would fill volumes the assertion of the usurper of ferdinands right that he was already married to adalinda was like all else he said false the day was however fixed for their union when the illness and the subsequent death of the marchese spina delayed its celebration adalinda retired during the first months of mourning to a castle belonging to her father not far from arpino a town of the kingdom of naples in the midst of the apennines about miles from the capital before she went the deceiver tried to persuade her to consent to a private marriage he was probably afraid that in the long interval that was about to ensue before he could secure her she would discover his imposture besides a rumour had gone abroad that one of the fellow prisoners of ferdinand a noted bandit had escaped and that the young count was his companion in flight adalinda however refused to comply with her lovers entreaties and retired to her seclusion with an old aunt who was blind and deaf but an excellent duenna the false eboli seldom visited his mistress but he was a master in his art and subsequent events showed that he must have spent all his time disguised in the vicinity of the castle he contrived by various means unsuspected at the moment to have all adalindas servants changed for creatures of his own so that without her being aware of the restraint she was in fact a prisoner in her own house it is impossible to say what first awakened her suspicions concerning the deception put upon her she was an italian with all the habitual quiescence and lassitude of her countrywomen in the ordinary routine of life and with all their energy and passion when roused the moment the doubt darted into her mind she resolved to be assured a few questions relative to scenes that had passed between poor ferdinand and herself sufficed for this they were asked so suddenly and pointedly that the pretender was thrown off his guard he looked confused and stammered in his replies their eyes met he felt that he was detected and she saw that he perceived her now confirmed suspicions a look such as is peculiar to an impostora glance that deformed his beauty and filled his usually noble countenance with the hideous lines of cunning and cruel triumphcompleted her faith in her own discernment how she thought could i have mistaken this man for my own gentle eboli again their eyes met the peculiar expression of his terrified her and she hastily quitted the apartment her resolution was quickly formed it was of no use to attempt to explain her situation to her old aunt she determined to depart immediately for naples throw herself at the feet of gioacchino and to relate and obtain credit for her strange history but the time was already lost when she could have executed this design the contrivances of the deceiver were completeshe found herself a prisoner excess of fear gave her boldness if not courage she sought her jailor a few minutes before she had been a young and thoughtless girl docile as a child and as unsuspecting now she felt as if she had suddenly grown old in wisdom and that the experience of years had been gained in that of a few seconds during their interview she was wary and firm while the instinctive power of innocence over guilt gave majesty to her demeanour the contriver of her ills for a moment cowered beneath her eye at first he would by no means allow that he was not the person he pretended to be but the energy and eloquence of truth bore down his artifice so that at length driven into a corner he turneda stag at bay then it was her turn to quail for the superior energy of a man gave him the mastery he declared the truth he was the elder brother of ferdinand a natural son of the old count eboli his mother who had been wronged never forgave her injurer and bred her son in deadly hate for his parent and a belief that the advantages enjoyed by his more fortunate brother were rightfully his own his education was rude but he had an italians subtle talents swiftness of perception and guileful arts it would blanch your cheek he said to his trembling auditress could i describe all that i have suffered to achieve my purpose i would trust to nonei executed all myself it was a glorious triumph but due to my perseverance and my fortitude when i and my usurping brother stoodi the noble he the degraded outcastbefore our sovereign having rapidly detailed his history he now sought to win the favourable ear of adalinda who stood with averted and angry looks he tried by the varied shows of passion and tenderness to move her heart was he not in truth the object of her love was it not he who scaled her balcony at villa spina he recalled scenes of mutual overflow of feeling to her mind thus urging arguments the most potent with a delicate woman pure blushes tinged her cheek but horror of the deceiver predominated over every other sentiment he swore that as soon as they should be united he would free ferdinand and bestow competency nay if so she willed it half his possessions on him she coldly replied that she would rather share the chains of the innocent and misery than link herself with imposture and crime she demanded her liberty but the untamed and even ferocious nature that had borne the deceiver through his career of crime now broke forth and he invoked fearful imprecations on his head if she ever quitted the castle except as his wife his look of conscious power and unbridled wickedness terrified her her flashing eyes spoke abhorrence it would have been far easier for her to have died than have yielded the smallest point to a man who had made her feel for one moment his irresistible power arising from her being an unprotected woman wholly in his hands she left him feeling as if she had just escaped from the impending sword of an assassin one hours deliberation suggested to her a method of escape from her terrible situation in a wardrobe at the castle lay in their pristine gloss the habiliments of a page of her mother who had died suddenly leaving these unworn relics of his station dressing herself in these she tied up her dark shining hair and even with a somewhat bitter feeling girded on the slight sword that appertained to the costume then through a private passage leading from her own apartment to the chapel of the castle she glided with noiseless steps long after the ave maria sounded at four oclock had on a november night given token that half an hour had passed since the setting of the sun she possessed the key of the chapel doorit opened at her touch she closed it behind her and she was free the pathless hills were around her the starry heavens above and a cold wintry breeze murmured around the castle walls but fear of her enemy conquered every other fear and she tripped lightly on in a kind of ecstasy for many a long hour over the stony mountain pathshe who had never before walked more than a mile or two from home at any time in her lifetill her feet were blistered her slight shoes cut through her way utterly lost at mornings dawn she found herself in the midst of the wild ilex covered apennines and neither habitation nor human being apparent she was hungry and weary she had brought gold and jewels with her but here were no means of exchanging these for food she remembered stories of banditti but none could be so ruffian like and cruel as him from whom she fled this thought a little rest and a draught of water from a pure mountain spring restored her to some portion of courage and she continued her journey noonday approached and in the south of italy the noonday sun when unclouded even in november is oppressively warm especially to an italian woman who never exposes herself to its beams faintness came over her there appeared recesses in the mountain sides along which she was travelling grown over with bay and arbutus she entered one of these there to repose it was deep and led to another that opened into a spacious cavern lighted from above there were cates grapes and a flagon of wine on a rough hewn table she looked fearfully around but no inhabitant appeared she placed herself at the table and half in dread ate of the food presented to her and then sat her elbow on the table her head resting on her little snow white hand her dark hair shading her brow and clustering round her throat an appearance of languor and fatigue was diffused through her attitude while her soft black eyes filled at intervals with large tears as pitying herself she recurred to the cruel circumstances of her lot her fanciful but elegant dress her feminine form her beauty and her grace as she sat pensive and alone in the rough unhewn cavern formed a picture a poet would describe with delight an artist love to paint she seemed a being of another world a seraph all light and beauty a ganymede escaped from his thrall above to his natal ida it was long before i recognised looking down on her from the opening hill my lost adalinda thus spoke the young count eboli when he related this story for its end was as romantic as its commencement when ferdinando had arrived a galley slave in calabria he found himself coupled with a bandit a brave fellow who abhorred his chains from love of freedom as much as his fellow prisoner did from all the combination of disgrace and misery they brought upon him together they devised a plan of escape and succeeded in effecting it on their road ferdinand related his story to the outlaw who encouraged him to hope for a favourable turn of fate and meanwhile invited and persuaded the desperate man to share his fortunes as a robber among the wild hills of calabria the cavern where adalinda had taken refuge was one of their fastnesses whither they betook themselves at periods of imminent danger for safety only as no booty could be collected in that unpeopled solitude and there one afternoon returning from the chase they found the wandering fearful solitary fugitive girl and never was lighthouse more welcome to tempest tossed sailor than was her own ferdinand to his lady love fortune now tired of persecuting the young noble favoured him still further the story of the lovers interested the bandit chief and promise of reward secured him ferdinand persuaded adalinda to remain one night in the cave and on the following morning they prepared to proceed to naples but at the moment of their departure they were surprised by an unexpected visitant the robbers brought in a prisonerit was the impostor missing on the morrow her who was the pledge of his safety and success but assured that she could not have wandered far he despatched emissaries in all directions to seek her and himself joining in the pursuit followed the road she had taken and was captured by these lawless men who expected rich ransom from one whose appearance denoted rank and wealth when they discovered who their prisoner was they generously delivered him up into his brothers hands ferdinand and adalinda proceeded to naples on their arrival she presented herself to queen caroline and through her murat heard with astonishment the device that had been practised on him the young count was restored to his honours and possessions and within a few months afterwards was united to his betrothed bride the compassionate nature of the count and countess led them to interest themselves warmly in the fate of ludovico whose subsequent career was more honourable but less fortunate at the intercession of his relative gioacchino permitted him to enter the army where he distinguished himself and obtained promotion the brothers were at moscow together and mutually assisted each other during the horrors of the retreat at one time overcome by drowsiness the mortal symptom resulting from excessive cold ferdinand lingered behind his comrades but ludovico refusing to leave him dragged him on in spite of himself till entering a village food and fire restored him and his life was saved on another evening when wind and sleet added to the horror of their situation ludovico after many ineffective struggles slid from his horse lifeless ferdinand was at his side and dismounting endeavoured by every means in his power to bring back pulsation to his stagnant blood his comrades went forward and the young count was left alone with his dying brother in the white boundless waste once ludovico opened his eyes and recognised him he pressed his hand and his lips moved to utter a blessing as he died at that moment the welcome sounds of the enemys approach roused ferdinand from the despair into which his dreadful situation plunged him he was taken prisoner and his life was thus saved when napoleon went to elba he with many others of his countrymen was liberated and returned to naples iii the evil eye the wild albanian kirtled to his knee with shawl girt head and ornamented gun and gold embroiderd garments fair to see the crimson scarfed man of macedon lord byron the moreot katusthius ziani travelled wearily and in fear of its robber inhabitants through the pashalik of yannina yet he had no cause for dread did he arrive tired and hungry in a solitary villagedid he find himself in the uninhabited wilds suddenly surrounded by a band of klephtsor in the larger towns did he shrink at finding himself sole of his race among the savage mountaineers and despotic turkas soon as he announced himself the pobratimo of dmitri of the evil eye every hand was held out every voice spoke welcome footnote in greece especially in illyria and epirus it is no uncommon thing for persons of the same sex to swear friendship the church contains a ritual to consecrate this vow two men thus united are called pobratimi the women posestrime the albanian dmitri was a native of the village of korvo among the savage mountains of the district between yannina and terpellen the deep broad stream of argyro castro flows bastioned to the west by abrupt wood covered precipices shadowed to the east by elevated mountains the highest among these is mount trebucci and in a romantic folding of that hill distinct with minarets crowned by a dome rising from out a group of pyramidal cypresses is the picturesque village of korvo sheep and goats form the apparent treasure of its inhabitants their guns and yataghans their warlike habits and with them the noble profession of robbery are sources of still greater wealth among a race renowned for dauntless courage and sanguinary enterprise dmitri was distinguished it was said that in his youth this klepht was remarkable for a gentler disposition and more refined taste than is usual with his countrymen he had been a wanderer and had learned european arts of which he was not a little proud he could read and write greek and a book was often stowed beside his pistols in his girdle he had spent several years in scio the most civilised of the greek islands and had married a sciote girl the albanians are characterized as despisers of women but dmitri in becoming the husband of helena enlisted under a more chivalrous rule and became the proselyte of a better creed often he returned to his native hills and fought under the banner of the renowned ali and then came back to his island home the love of the tamed barbarian was concentrated burning and something beyond this it was a portion of his living beating heartthe nobler part of himselfthe diviner mould in which his rugged nature had been recast on his return from one of his albanian expeditions he found his home ravaged by the mainotes helenathey pointed to her tomb nor dared tell him how she died his only child his lovely infant daughter was stolen his treasure house of love and happiness was rifled its gold excelling wealth changed to blank desolation dmitri spent three years in endeavours to recover his lost offspring he was exposed to a thousand dangers underwent incredible hardships he dared the wild beast in his lair the mainote in his port of refuge he attacked and was attacked by them he wore the badge of his daring in a deep gash across his eyebrow and cheek on this occasion he had died but that katusthius seeing a scuffle on shore and a man left for dead disembarked from a moreot sacovela carried him away tended and cured him they exchanged vows of friendship and for some time the albanian shared his brothers toils but they were too pacific to suit his taste and he returned to korvo who in the mutilated savage could recognise the handsomest amongst the arnaoots his habits kept pace with his change of physiognomy he grew ferocious and hardhearted he only smiled when engaged in dangerous enterprise he had arrived at that worst state of ruffian feeling the taking delight in blood he grew old in these occupations his mind became reckless his countenance more dark men trembled before his glance women and children exclaimed in terror the evil eye the opinion became prevalent he shared it himself he gloried in the dread privilege and when his victim shivered and withered beneath the mortal influence the fiendish laugh with which he hailed this demonstration of his power struck with worse dismay the failing heart of the fascinated person but dmitri could command the arrows of his sight and his comrades respected him the more for his supernatural attribute since they did not fear the exercise of it on themselves dmitri had just returned from an expedition beyond prevesa he and his comrades were laden with spoil they killed and roasted a goat whole for their repast they drank dry several wine skins then round the fire in the court they abandoned themselves to the delights of the kerchief dance roaring out the chorus as they dropped upon and then rebounded from their knees and whirled round and round with an activity all their own the heart of dmitri was heavy he refused to dance and sat apart at first joining in the song with his voice and lute till the air changed to one that reminded him of better days his voice died away his instrument dropped from his hands and his head sank upon his breast at the sound of stranger footsteps he started up in the form before him he surely recognised a friendhe was not mistaken with a joyful exclamation he welcomed katusthius ziani clasping his hand and kissing him on the cheek the traveller was weary so they retired to dmitris own homea neatly plastered white washed cottage whose earthen floor was perfectly dry and clean and the walls hung with armssome richly ornamentedand other trophies of his klephtic triumphs a fire was kindled by his aged female attendant the friends reposed on mats of white rushes while she prepared the pilaf and seethed flesh of kid she placed a bright tin tray on a block of wood before them and heaped upon it cakes of indian corn goats milk cheese eggs and olives a jar of water from their purest spring and skin of wine served to refresh and cheer the thirsty traveller after supper the guest spoke of the object of his visit i come to my pobratimo he said to claim the performance of his vow when i rescued you from the savage kakovougnis of boularias you pledged to me your gratitude and faith do you disclaim the debt dmitris brow darkened my brother he cried need not remind me of what i owe command my life in what can the mountain klepht aid the son of the wealthy ziani the son of ziani is a beggar rejoined katusthius and must perish if his brother deny his assistance the moreot then told his tale he had been brought up as the only son of a rich merchant of corinth he had often sailed as caravokeiri of his fathers vessels to stamboul and even to calabria some years before he had been boarded and taken by a barbary corsair his life since then had been adventurous he said in truth it had been a guilty onehe had become a renegadeand won regard from his new allies not by his superior courage for he was cowardly but by the frauds that make men wealthy in the midst of this career some superstition had influenced him and he had returned to his ancient religion he escaped from africa wandered through syria crossed to europe found occupation in constantinople and thus years passed at last as he was on the point of marriage with a fanariote beauty he fell again into poverty and he returned to corinth to see if his fathers fortunes had prospered during his long wanderings he found that while these had improved to a wonder they were lost to him for ever his father during his protracted absence acknowledged another son as his and dying a year before had left all to him katusthius found this unknown kinsman with his wife and child in possession of his expected inheritance cyril divided with him it is true their parents property but katusthius grasped at all and resolved to obtain it he brooded over a thousand schemes of murder and revenge yet the blood of a brother was sacred to him and cyril beloved and respected at corinth could only be attacked with considerable risk then his child was a fresh obstacle as the best plan that presented itself he hastily embarked for butrinto and came to claim the advice and assistance of the arnaoot whose life he had saved whose pobratimo he was not thus barely did he tell his tale but glossed it over so that had dmitri needed the incitement of justice which was not at all a desideratum with him he would have been satisfied that cyril was a base interloper and that the whole transaction was one of imposture and villainy footnote master of a merchant ship all night these men discussed a variety of projects whose aim was that the deceased zianis wealth should pass undivided into his elder sons hands at mornings dawn katusthius departed and two days afterwards dmitri quitted his mountain home his first care had been to purchase a horse long coveted by him on account of its beauty and fleetness he provided cartridges and replenished his powder horn his accoutrements were rich his dress gay his arms glittered in the sun his long hair fell straight from under the shawl twisted round his cap even to his waist a shaggy white capote hung from his shoulder his face wrinkled and puckered by exposure to the seasons his brow furrowed with care his mustachios long and jet black his scarred face his wild savage eyeshis whole appearance not deficient in barbaric grace but stamped chiefly with ferocity and bandit pride inspired and we need not wonder the superstitious greek with a belief that a supernatural spirit of evil dwelt in his aspect blasting and destroying now prepared for his journey he departed from korvo crossing the woods of acarnania on his way to morea wherefore does zella tremble and press her boy to her bosom as if fearful of evil thus asked cyril ziani returning from the city of corinth to his own rural abode it was a home of beauty the abruptly broken hills covered with olives or brighter plantations of orange trees overlooked the blue waves of the gulf of egina a myrtle underwood spread sweet scent around and dipped its dark shining leaves into the sea itself the low roofed house was shaded by two enormous fig trees while vineyards and corn land stretched along the gentle upland to the north when zella saw her husband she smiled though her cheek was still pale and her lips quivering now you are near to guard us she said i dismiss fear but danger threatens our constans and i shudder to remember that an evil eye has been upon him cyril caught up his child by my head he cried thou speakest of an ill thing the franks call this superstition but let us beware his cheek is still rosy his tresses flowing gold speak constans hail thy father my brave fellow it was but a short lived fear no ill ensued and they soon forgot an incident which had causelessly made their hearts to quail a week afterwards cyril returned as he was wont from shipping a cargo of currants to his retreat on the coast it was a beautiful summer evening the creaking water wheel which produced the irrigation of the land chimed in with the last song of the noisy cicala the rippling waves spent themselves almost silently among the shingles this was his home but where its lovely flower zella did not come forth to welcome him a domestic pointed to a chapel on a neighbouring acclivity and there he found her his child nearly three years of age was in his nurses arms his wife was praying fervently while the tears streamed down her cheeks cyril demanded anxiously the meaning of this scene but the nurse sobbed zella continued to pray and weep and the boy from sympathy began to cry this was too much for man to endure cyril left the chapel he leant against a walnut tree his first exclamation was a customary greek one welcome this misfortune so that it come single but what was the ill that had occurred unapparent was it yet but the spirit of evil is most fatal when unseen he was happya lovely wife a blooming child a peaceful home competence and the prospect of wealth these blessings were his yet how often does fortune use such as her decoys he was a slave in an enslaved land a mortal subject to the high destinies and ten thousand were the envenomed darts which might be hurled at his devoted head now timid and trembling zella came from the chapel her explanation did not calm his fears again the evil eye had been on his child and deep malignity lurked surely under this second visitation the same man an arnaoot with glittering arms gay attire mounted on a black steed came from the neighbouring ilex grove and riding furiously up to the door suddenly checked and reined in his horse at the very threshold the child ran towards him the arnaoot bent his sinister eyes upon himlovely art thou bright infant he cried thy blue eyes are beaming thy golden tresses fair to see but thou art a vision fleeting as beautifullook at me the innocent looked up uttered a shriek and fell gasping on the ground the women rushed forward to seize him the albanian put spurs to his horse and galloping swiftly across the little plain up the wooded hill side he was soon lost to sight zella and the nurse bore the child to the chapel they sprinkled him with holy water and as he revived besought the panagia with earnest prayers to save him from the menaced ill several months elapsed little constans grew in intelligence and beauty no blight had visited the flower of love and its parents dismissed fear sometimes cyril indulged in a joke at the expense of the evil eye but zella thought it unlucky to laugh and crossed herself whenever the event was alluded to at this time katusthius visited their abodehe was on his way he said to stamboul and he came to know whether he could serve his brother in any of his transactions in the capital cyril and zella received him with cordial affection they rejoiced to perceive that fraternal love was beginning to warm his heart he seemed full of ambition and hope the brothers discussed his prospects the politics of europe and the intrigues of the fanar the petty affairs of corinth even were made subjects of discourse and the probability that in a short time young as he was cyril would be named codja bashee of the province on the morrow katusthius prepared to depart one favour does the voluntary exile askwill my brother and sister accompany me some hours on my way to napoli whence i embark zella was unwilling to quit her home even for a short interval but she suffered herself to be persuaded and they proceeded altogether for several miles towards the capital of the morea at noontide they made a repast under the shadow of a grove of oaks and then separated returning homeward the wedded pair congratulated themselves on their tranquil life and peaceful happiness contrasted with the wanderers lonely and homeless pleasures these feelings increased in intensity as they drew nearer their dwelling and anticipated the lisped welcome of their idolized child from an eminence they looked upon the fertile vale which was their home it was situated on the southern side of the isthmus and looked upon the gulf of eginaall was verdant tranquil and beautiful they descended into the plain there a singular appearance attracted their attention a plough with its yoke of oxen had been deserted midway in the furrow the animals had dragged it to the side of the field and endeavoured to repose as well as their conjunction permitted the sun already touched its western bourne and the summits of the trees were gilded by its parting beams all was silent even the eternal water wheel was still no menials appeared at their usual rustic labours from the house the voice of wailing was too plainly heardmy child zella exclaimed cyril began to reassure her but another lament arose and he hurried on she dismounted and would have followed him but sank on the road side her husband returned courage my beloved he cried i will not repose night nor day until constans is restored to ustrust to mefarewell with these words he rode swiftly on her worst fears were thus confirmed her maternal heart lately so joyous became the abode of despair while the nurses narration of the sad occurrence tended but to add worse fear to fear thus it was the same stranger of the evil eye had appeared not as before bearing down on them with eagle speed but as if from a long journey his horse lame and with drooping head the arnaoot himself covered with dust apparently scarcely able to keep his seat by the life of your child he said give a cup of water to one who faints with thirst the nurse with constans in her arms got a bowl of the desired liquid and presented it ere the parched lips of the stranger touched the wave the vessel fell from his hands the woman started back while he at the same moment darting forward tore with strong arm the child from her embrace already both were gonewith arrowy speed they traversed the plain while her shrieks and cries for assistance called together all the domestics they followed on the track of the ravisher and none had yet returned now as night closed in one by one they came back they had nothing to relate they had scoured the woods crossed the hillsthey could not even discover the route which the albanian had taken on the following day cyril returned jaded haggard miserable he had obtained no tidings of his son on the morrow he again departed on his quest nor came back for several days zella passed her time wearilynow sitting in hopeless despondency now climbing the near hill to see whether she could perceive the approach of her husband she was not allowed to remain long thus tranquil the trembling domestics left in guard warned her that the savage forms of several arnaoots had been seen prowling about she herself saw a tall figure clad in a shaggy white capote steal round the promontory and on seeing her shrink back once at night the snorting and trampling of a horse roused her not from slumber but from her sense of security wretched as the bereft mother was she felt personally almost reckless of danger but she was not her own she belonged to one beyond expression dear and duty as well as affection for him enjoined self preservation cyril again returned he was gloomier sadder than before but there was more resolution on his brow more energy in his motions he had obtained a clue yet it might only lead him to the depths of despair he discovered that katusthius had not embarked at napoli he had joined a band of arnaoots lurking about vasilico and had proceeded to patras with the protoklepht thence they put off together in a monoxylon for the northern shores of the gulf of lepanto nor were they alone they bore a child with them wrapt in a heavy torpid sleep poor cyrils blood ran cold when he thought of the spells and witchcraft which had probably been put in practice on his boy he would have followed close upon the robbers but for the report that reached him that the remainder of the albanians had proceeded southward towards corinth he could not enter upon a long wandering search among the pathless wilds of epirus leaving zella exposed to the attacks of these bandits he returned to consult with her to devise some plan of action which would at once ensure her safety and promise success to his endeavours after some hesitation and discussion it was decided that he should first conduct her to her native home consult with her father as to his present enterprise and be guided by his warlike experience before he rushed into the very focus of danger the seizure of his child might only be a lure and it were not well for him sole protector of that child and its mother to rush unadvisedly into the toils zella strange to say for her blue eyes and brilliant complexion belied her birth was the daughter of a mainote yet dreaded and abhorred by the rest of the world as are the inhabitants of cape tnarus they are celebrated for their domestic virtues and the strength of their private attachments zella loved her father and the memory of her rugged rocky home from which she had been torn in an adverse hour near neighbours of the mainotes dwelling in the ruder and wildest portion of maina are the kakovougnis a dark suspicious race of squat and stunted form strongly contrasted with the tranquil cast of countenance characteristic of the mainote the two tribes are embroiled in perpetual quarrels the narrow sea girt abode which they share affords at once a secure place of refuge from the foreign enemy and all the facilities of internal mountain warfare cyril had once during a coasting voyage been driven by stress of weather into the little bay on whose shores is placed the small town of kardamyla the crew at first dreaded to be captured by the pirates but they were reassured on finding them fully occupied by their domestic dissensions a band of kakovougnis were besieging the castellated rock overlooking kardamyla blockading the fortress in which the mainote capitano and his family had taken refuge two days passed thus while furious contrary winds detained cyril in the bay on the third evening the western gale subsided and a land breeze promised to emancipate them from their perilous condition when in the night as they were about to put off in a boat from shore they were hailed by a party of mainotes and one an old man of commanding figure demanded a parley he was the capitano of kardamyla the chief of the fortress now attacked by his implacable enemies he saw no escapehe must falland his chief desire was to save his treasure and his family from the hands of his enemies cyril consented to receive them on board the latter consisted of an old mother a paramana and a young and beautiful girl his daughter cyril conducted them in safety to napoli soon after the capitanos mother and paramana returned to their native town while with her fathers consent fair zella became the wife of her preserver the fortunes of the mainote had prospered since then and he stood first in rank the chief of a large tribe the capitano of kardamyla thither then the hapless parents repaired they embarked on board a small sacovela which dropt down the gulf of egina weathered the islands of skyllo and cerigo and the extreme point of tnarus favoured by prosperous gales they made the desired port and arrived at the hospitable mansion of old camaraz he heard their tale with indignation swore by his beard to dip his poniard in the best blood of katusthius and insisted upon accompanying his son in law on his expedition to albania no time was lostthe grey headed mariner still full of energy hastened every preparation cyril and zella parted a thousand fears a thousand hours of misery rose between the pair late sharers in perfect happiness the boisterous sea and distant lands were the smallest of the obstacles that divided them they would not fear the worst yet hope a sickly plant faded in their hearts as they tore themselves asunder after a last embrace zella returned from the fertile district of corinth to her barren native rocks she felt all joy expire as she viewed from the rugged shore the lessening sails of the sacovela days and weeks passed and still she remained in solitary and sad expectation she never joined in the dance nor made one in the assemblies of her countrywomen who met together at evening tide to sing tell stories and wile away the time in dance and gaiety she secluded herself in the most lonely part of her fathers house and gazed unceasingly from the lattice upon the sea beneath or wandered on the rocky beach and when tempest darkened the sky and each precipitous promontory grew purple under the shadows of the wide winged clouds when the roar of the surges was on the shore and the white crests of the waves seen afar upon the ocean plain showed like flocks of new shorn sheep scattered along wide extended downs she felt neither gale nor inclement cold nor returned home till recalled by her attendants in obedience to them she sought the shelter of her abode not to remain long for the wild winds spoke to her and the stormy ocean reproached her tranquillity unable to control the impulse she would rush from her habitation on the cliff nor remember till she reached the shore that her papooshes were left midway on the mountain path and that her forgotten veil and disordered dress were unmeet for such a scene often the unnumbered hours sped on while this orphaned child of happiness leant on a cold dark rock the low browed crags beetled over her the surges broke at her feet her fair limbs were stained by spray her tresses dishevelled by the gale hopelessly she wept until a sail appeared on the horizon and then she dried her fast flowing tears fixing her large eyes upon the nearing hull or fading topsail meanwhile the storm tossed the clouds into a thousand gigantic shapes and the tumultuous sea grew blacker and more wild her natural gloom was heightened by superstitious horror the morai the old fates of her native grecian soil howled in the breezes apparitions which told of her child pining under the influence of the evil eye and of her husband the prey of some thracian witchcraft such as still is practised in the dread neighbourhood of larissa haunted her broken slumbers and stalked like dire shadows across her waking thoughts her bloom was gone her eyes lost their lustre her limbs their round full beauty her strength failed her as she tottered to the accustomed spot to watchvainly yet for ever to watch what is there so fearful as the expectation of evil tidings delayed sometimes in the midst of tears or worse amidst the convulsive gaspings of despair we reproach ourselves for influencing the eternal fates by our gloomy anticipations then if a smile wreathe the mourners quivering lip it is arrested by a throb of agony alas are not the dark tresses of the young painted grey the full cheek of beauty delved with sad lines by the spirits of such hours misery is a more welcome visitant when she comes in her darkest guise and wraps us in perpetual black for then the heart no longer sickens with disappointed hope cyril and old camaraz had found great difficulty in doubling the many capes of the morea as they made a coasting expedition from kardamyla to the gulf of arta north of cefalonia and st mauro during their voyage they had time to arrange their plans as a number of moreots travelling together might attract too much attention they resolved to land their comrades at different points and travel separately into the interior of albania yannina was their first place of rendezvous cyril and his father in law disembarked in one of the most secluded of the many creeks which diversify the winding and precipitous shores of the gulf six others chosen from the crew would by other routes join them at the capital they did not fear for themselves alone but well armed and secure in the courage of despair they penetrated the fastnesses of epirus no success cheered them they arrived at yannina without having made the slightest discovery they were joined by their comrades whom they directed to remain three days in the town and then separately to proceed to terpellen whither they immediately directed their steps at the first village on their way thither at monastic zitza they obtained some information not to direct but to encourage their endeavours they sought refreshment and hospitality in the monastery which is situated on a green eminence crowned by a grove of oak trees immediately behind the village perhaps there is not in the world a more beautiful or more romantic spot sheltered itself by clustering trees looking out on one widespread landscape of hill and dale enriched by vineyards dotted with frequent flocks while the calamas in the depth of the vale gives life to the scene and the far blue mountains of zoumerkas sagori sulli and acroceraunia to the east west north and south close in the various prospects cyril half envied the caloyers their inert tranquillity they received the travellers gladly and were cordial though simple in their manners when questioned concerning the object of their journey they warmly sympathized with the fathers anxiety and eagerly told all they knew two weeks before an arnaoot well known to them as dmitri of the evil eye a famous klepht of korvo and a moreot arrived bringing with them a childa bold spirited beautiful boy who with firmness beyond his years claimed the protection of the caloyers and accused his companions of having carried him off by force from his parents by my head cried the albanian a brave palikar he keeps his word brother he swore by the panagia in spite of our threats of throwing him down a precipice food for the vulture to accuse us to the first good men he saw he neither pines under the evil eye nor quails beneath our menaces katusthius frowned at these praises and it became evident during their stay at the monastery that the albanian and the moreot quarrelled as to the disposal of the child the rugged mountaineer threw off all his sternness as he gazed upon the boy when little constans slept he hung over him fanning away with womans care the flies and gnats when he spoke he answered with expressions of fondness winning him with gifts teaching him all child as he was a mimicry of warlike exercises when the boy knelt and besought the panagia to restore him to his parents his voice quivering and tears running down his cheeks the eyes of dmitri overflowed he cast his cloak over his face his heart whispered to him thus perhaps my child prayed heaven was deaf alas where is she now encouraged by such signs of compassion which children are quick to perceive constans twined his arms round his neck telling him that he loved him and that he would fight for him when a man if he would take him back to corinth at such words dmitri would rush forth seek katusthius remonstrate with him till the unrelenting man checked him by reminding him of his vow still he swore that no hair of the childs head should be injured while the uncle unvisited by compunction meditated his destruction the quarrels which thence arose were frequent and violent till katusthius weary of opposition had recourse to craft to obtain his purpose one night he secretly left the monastery bearing the child with him when dmitri heard of his evasion it was a fearful thing to the good caloyers only to look upon him they instinctively clutched hold of every bit of iron on which they could lay their hands so to avert the evil eye which glared with native and untamed fierceness in their panic a whole score of them had rushed to the iron plated door which led out of their abode with the strength of a lion dmitri tore them away threw back the portal and with the swiftness of a torrent fed by the thawing of the snows in spring he dashed down the steep hillthe flight of an eagle not more rapid the course of a wild beast not more resolved such was the clue afforded to cyril it were too long to follow him in his subsequent search he with old camaraz wandered through the vale of argyro castro and climbed mount trebucci to korvo dmitri had returned he had gathered together a score of faithful comrades and sallied forth again various were the reports of his destination and the enterprise which he meditated one of these led our adventurers to terpellen and hence back towards yannina and now chance again favoured them they rested one night in the habitation of a priest at the little village of mosme about three leagues to the north of zitza and here they found an arnaoot who had been disabled by a fall from his horse this man was to have made one of dmitris band they learned from him that the arnaoot had tracked katusthius following him close and forcing him to take refuge in the monastery of the prophet elias which stands on an elevated peak of the mountains of sagori eight leagues from yannina dmitri had followed him and demanded the child the caloyers refused to give it up and the klepht roused to mad indignation was now besieging and battering the monastery to obtain by force this object of his newly awakened affections at yannina camaraz and cyril collected their comrades and departed to join their unconscious ally he more impetuous than a mountain stream or oceans fiercest waves struck terror into the hearts of the recluses by his ceaseless and dauntless attacks to encourage them to further resistance katusthius leaving the child behind in the monastery departed for the nearest town of sagori to entreat its belouk bashee to come to their aid the sagorians are a mild amiable social people they are gay frank clever their bravery is universally acknowledged even by the more uncivilised mountaineers of zoumerkas yet robbery murder and other acts of violence are unknown among them these good people were not a little indignant when they heard that a band of arnaoots was besieging and battering the sacred retreat of their favourite caloyers they assembled in a gallant troop and taking katusthius with them hastened to drive the insolent klephts back to their ruder fastnesses they came too late at midnight while the monks prayed fervently to be delivered from their enemies dmitri and his followers tore down their iron plated door and entered the holy precincts the protoklepht strode up to the gates of the sanctuary and placing his hands upon it swore that he came to save not to destroy constans saw him with a cry of delight he disengaged himself from the caloyer who held him and rushed into his arms this was sufficient triumph with assurance of sincere regret for having disturbed them the klepht quitted the chapel with his followers taking his prize with him katusthius returned some hours after and so well did the traitor plead his cause with the kind sagorians bewailing the fate of his little nephew among those evil men that they offered to follow and superior as their numbers were to rescue the boy from their destructive hands katusthius delighted with the proposition urged their immediate departure at dawn they began to climb the mountain summits already trodden by the zoumerkians delighted with repossessing his little favourite dmitri placed him before him on his horse and followed by his comrades made his way over the mountains clothed with old dodonas oaks or in higher summits by dark gigantic pines they proceeded for some hours and at length dismounted to repose the spot they chose was the depth of a dark ravine whose gloom was increased by the broad shadows of dark ilexes an entangled underwood and a sprinkling of craggy isolated rocks made it difficult for the horses to keep their footing they dismounted and sat by the little stream their simple fare was spread and dmitri enticed the boy to eat by a thousand caresses suddenly one of his men set as a guard brought intelligence that a troop of sagorians with katusthius as their guide was advancing from the monastery of st elias while another man gave the alarm of the approach of six or eight well armed moreots who were advancing on the road from yannina in a moment every sign of encampment had disappeared the arnaoots began to climb the hills getting under cover of the rocks and behind the large trunks of the forest trees keeping concealed till their invaders should be in the very midst of them soon the moreots appeared turning round the defile in a path that only allowed them to proceed two by two they were unaware of danger and walked carelessly until a shot that whizzed over the head of one striking the bough of a tree recalled them from their security the greeks accustomed to the same mode of warfare betook themselves also to the safeguards of the rocks firing from behind them striving with their adversaries which should get to the most elevated station jumping from crag to crag and dropping down and firing as quickly as they could load one old man alone remained on the pathway the mariner camaraz had often encountered the enemy on the deck of his caick and would still have rushed foremost at a boarding but this warfare required too much activity cyril called on him to shelter himself beneath a low broad stone the mainote waved his hand fear not for me he cried i know how to die the brave love the brave dmitri saw the old man stand unflinching a mark for all the balls and he started from behind his rocky screen calling on his men to cease then addressing his enemy he cried who art thou wherefore art thou here if ye come in peace proceed on your way answer and fear not the old man drew himself up saying i am a mainote and cannot fear all hellas trembles before the pirates of cape matapan and i am one of these i do not come in peace behold you have in your arms the cause of our dissension i am the grandsire of that childgive him to me dmitri had he held a snake which he felt awakening in his bosom could not so suddenly have changed his cheerthe offspring of a mainotehe relaxed his graspconstans would have fallen had he not clung to his neck meanwhile each party had descended from their rocky station and were grouped together in the pathway below dmitri tore the child from his neckhe felt as if he could with savage delight dash him down the precipice when as he paused and trembled from excess of passion katusthius and the foremost sagorians came down upon them stand cried the infuriated arnaoot behold katusthius behold friend whom i driven by the resistless fates madly and wickedly forswore i now perform thy wishthe mainote child dies the son of the accursed race shall be the victim of my just revenge cyril in a transport of fear rushed up the rock he levelled his musket but he feared to sacrifice his child the old mainote less timid and more desperate took a steady aim dmitri saw the act and hurled the dagger already raised against the child at himit entered his sidewhile constans feeling his late protectors grasp relax sprang from it into his fathers arms camaraz had fallen yet his wound was slight he saw the arnaoots and sagorians close round him he saw his own followers made prisoners dmitri and katusthius had both thrown themselves upon cyril struggling to repossess themselves of the screaming boy the mainote raised himselfhe was feeble of limb but his heart was strong he threw himself before the father and child he caught the upraised arm of dmitri on me he cried fall all thy vengeance i of the evil race for the child he is innocent of such parentage maina cannot boast him for a son man of lies commenced the infuriated arnaoot this falsehood shall not stead thee nay by the souls of those you have loved listen continued camaraz and if i make not good my words may i and my children die the boys father is a corinthian his mother a sciote girl scio the very word made the blood recede to dmitris heart villain he cried dashing aside katusthius arm which was raised against poor constans i guard this childdare not to injure him speak old man and fear not so that thou speakest the truth fifteen years ago said camaraz i hovered with my caick in search of prey on the coast of scio a cottage stood on the borders of a chestnut wood it was the habitation of the widow of a wealthy islandershe dwelt in it with her only daughter married to an albanian then absentthe good woman was reported to have a concealed treasure in her housethe girl herself would be rich spoilit was an adventure worth the risk we ran our vessel up a shady creek and on the going down of the moon landed stealing under the covert of night towards the lonely abode of these women dmitri grasped at his daggers hiltit was no longer there he half drew a pistol from his girdlelittle constans again confiding in his former friend stretched out his hands and clung to his arm the klepht looked on him half yielded to his desire to embrace him half feared to be deceived so he turned away throwing his capote over his face veiling his anguish controlling his emotions till all should be told camaraz continued it became a worse tragedy than i had contemplated the girl had a childshe feared for its life and struggled with the men like a tigress defending her young i was in another room seeking for the hidden store when a piercing shriek rent the airi never knew what compassion was beforethis cry went to my heart but it was too late the poor girl had sunk to the ground the life tide oozing from her bosom i know not why but i turned woman in my regret for the slain beauty i meant to have carried her and her child on board to see if aught could be done to save her but she died ere we left the shore i thought she would like her island grave best and truly feared that she might turn vampire to haunt me did i carry her away so we left her corpse for the priests to bury and carried off the child then about two years old she could say few words except her own namethat was zella and she is the mother of this boy a succession of arrivals in the bay of kardamyla had kept poor zella watching for many nights her attendant had in despair of ever seeing her sleep again drugged with opium the few cakes she persuaded her to eat but the poor woman did not calculate on the power of mind over body of love over every enemy physical or moral arrayed against it zella lay on her couch her spirit somewhat subdued but her heart alive her eyes unclosed in the night led by some unexplained impulse she crawled to her lattice and saw a little sacovela enter the bay it ran in swiftly under favour of the wind and was lost to her sight under a jutting crag lightly she trod the marble floor of her chamber she drew a large shawl close round her she descended the rocky pathway and reached with swift steps the beachstill the vessel was invisible and she was half inclined to think that it was the offspring of her excited imaginationyet she lingered she felt a sickness at her very heart whenever she attempted to move and her eyelids weighed down in spite of herself the desire of sleep at last became irresistible she lay down on the shingles reposed her head on the cold hard pillow folded her shawl still closer and gave herself up to forgetfulness so profoundly did she slumber under the influence of the opiate that for many hours she was insensible of any change in her situation by degrees only she awoke by degrees only became aware of the objects around her the breeze felt fresh and freeso was it ever on the wave beaten coast the waters rippled near their dash had been in her ears as she yielded to repose but this was not her stony couch that canopy not the dark overhanging cliff suddenly she lifted up her headshe was on the deck of a small vessel which was skimming swiftly over the ocean wavesa cloak of sables pillowed her head the shores of cape matapan were to her left and they steered right towards the noonday sun wonder rather than fear possessed her with a quick hand she drew aside the sail that veiled her from the crewthe dreaded albanian was sitting close at her side her constans cradled in his arms she uttered a crycyril turned at the sound and in a moment she was folded in his embrace iv the dream chi dice mal damore dice una falsit italian song the time of the occurrence of the little legend about to be narrated was that of the commencement of the reign of henry iv of france whose accession and conversion while they brought peace to the kingdom whose throne he ascended were inadequate to heal the deep wounds mutually inflicted by the inimical parties private feuds and the memory of mortal injuries existed between those now apparently united and often did the hands that had clasped each other in seeming friendly greeting involuntarily as the grasp was released clasp the daggers hilt as fitter spokesman to their passions than the words of courtesy that had just fallen from their lips many of the fiercer catholics retreated to their distant provinces and while they concealed in solitude their rankling discontent not less keenly did they long for the day when they might show it openly in a large and fortified chateau built on a rugged steep overlooking the loire not far from the town of nantes dwelt the last of her race and the heiress of their fortunes the young and beautiful countess de villeneuve she had spent the preceding year in complete solitude in her secluded abode and the mourning she wore for a father and two brothers the victims of the civil wars was a graceful and good reason why she did not appear at court and mingle with its festivities but the orphan countess inherited a high name and broad lands and it was soon signified to her that the king her guardian desired that she should bestow them together with her hand upon some noble whose birth and accomplishments should entitle him to the gift constance in reply expressed her intention of taking vows and retiring to a convent the king earnestly and resolutely forbade this act believing such an idea to be the result of sensibility overwrought by sorrow and relying on the hope that after a time the genial spirit of youth would break through this cloud a year passed and still the countess persisted and at last henry unwilling to exercise compulsiondesirous too of judging for himself of the motives that led one so beautiful young and gifted with fortunes favours to desire to bury herself in a cloisterannounced his intention now that the period of her mourning was expired of visiting her chateau and if he brought not with him the monarch said inducement sufficient to change her design he would yield his consent to its fulfilment many a sad hour had constance passedmany a day of tears and many a night of restless misery she had closed her gates against every visitant and like the lady olivia in twelfth night vowed herself to loneliness and weeping mistress of herself she easily silenced the entreaties and remonstrances of underlings and nursed her grief as it had been the thing she loved yet it was too keen too bitter too burning to be a favoured guest in fact constance young ardent and vivacious battled with it struggled and longed to cast it off but all that was joyful in itself or fair in outward show only served to renew it and she could best support the burden of her sorrow with patience when yielding to it it oppressed but did not torture her constance had left the castle to wander in the neighbouring grounds lofty and extensive as were the apartments of her abode she felt pent up within their walls beneath their fretted roofs the spreading uplands and the antique wood associated to her with every dear recollection of her past life enticed her to spend hours and days beneath their leafy coverts the motion and change eternally working as the wind stirred among the boughs or the journeying sun rained its beams through them soothed and called her out of that dull sorrow which clutched her heart with so unrelenting a pang beneath her castle roof there was one spot on the verge of the well wooded park one nook of ground whence she could discern the country extended beyond yet which was in itself thick set with tall umbrageous treesa spot which she had forsworn yet whither unconsciously her steps for ever tended and where now again for the twentieth time that day she had unaware found herself she sat upon a grassy mound and looked wistfully on the flowers she had herself planted to adorn the verdurous recessto her the temple of memory and love she held the letter from the king which was the parent to her of so much despair dejection sat upon her features and her gentle heart asked fate why so young unprotected and forsaken she should have to struggle with this new form of wretchedness i but ask she thought to live in my fathers hallsin the spot familiar to my infancyto water with my frequent tears the graves of those i loved and here in these woods where such a mad dream of happiness was mine to celebrate for ever the obsequies of hope a rustling among the boughs now met her earher heart beat quickall again was still foolish girl she half muttered dupe of thine own passionate fancy because here we met because seated here i have expected and sounds like these have announced his dear approach so now every coney as it stirs and every bird as it awakens silence speaks of him o gasparmine oncenever again will this beloved spot be made glad by theenever more again the bushes were stirred and footsteps were heard in the brake she rose her heart beat high it must be that silly manon with her impertinent entreaties for her to return but the steps were firmer and slower than would be those of her waiting woman and now emerging from the shade she too plainly discerned the intruder her first impulse was to flybut once again to see himto hear his voiceonce again before she placed eternal vows between them to stand together and find the wide chasm filled which absence had made could not injure the dead and would soften the fatal sorrow that made her cheek so pale and now he was before her the same beloved one with whom she had exchanged vows of constancy he like her seemed sad nor could she resist the imploring glance that entreated her for one moment to remain i come lady said the young knight without a hope to bend your inflexible will i come but once again to see you and to bid you farewell before i depart for the holy land i come to beseech you not to immure yourself in the dark cloister to avoid one as hateful as myselfone you will never see more whether i die or live france and i are parted for ever that were fearful were it true said constance but king henry will never so lose his favourite cavalier the throne you helped to build you still will guard nay as i ever had power over thought of thine go not to palestine one word of yours could detain meone smileconstanceand the youthful lover knelt before her but her harsher purpose was recalled by the image once so dear and familiar now so strange and so forbidden linger no longer here she cried no smile no word of mine will ever again be yours why are you herehere where the spirits of the dead wander and claiming these shades as their own curse the false girl who permits their murderer to disturb their sacred repose when love was young and you were kind replied the knight you taught me to thread the intricacies of these woodsyou welcomed me to this dear spot where once you vowed to be my owneven beneath these ancient trees a wicked sin it was said constance to unbar my fathers doors to the son of his enemy and dearly is it punished the young knight gained courage as she spoke yet he dared not move lest she who every instant appeared ready to take flight should be startled from her momentary tranquillity but he slowly repliedthose were happy days constance full of terror and deep joy when evening brought me to your feet and while hate and vengeance were as its atmosphere to yonder frowning castle this leafy starlit bower was the shrine of love happymiserable days echoed constance when i imagined good could arise from failing in my duty and that disobedience would be rewarded of god speak not of love gaspara sea of blood divides us for ever approach me not the dead and the beloved stand even now between us their pale shadows warn me of my fault and menace me for listening to their murderer that am not i exclaimed the youth behold constance we are each the last of our race death has dealt cruelly with us and we are alone it was not so when first we lovedwhen parent kinsman brother nay my own mother breathed curses on the house of villeneuve and in spite of all i blessed it i saw thee my lovely one and blessed it the god of peace planted love in our hearts and with mystery and secrecy we met during many a summer night in the moonlit dells and when daylight was abroad in this sweet recess we fled to avoid its scrutiny and here even here where now i kneel in supplication we both knelt and made our vows shall they be broken constance wept as her lover recalled the images of happy hours never she exclaimed o never thou knowest or wilt soon know gaspar the faith and resolves of one who dare not be yours was it for us to talk of love and happiness when war and hate and blood were raging around the fleeting flowers our young hands strewed were trampled by the deadly encounter of mortal foes by your fathers hand mine died and little boots it to know whether as my brother swore and you deny your hand did or did not deal the blow that destroyed him you fought among those by whom he died say no moreno other word it is impiety towards the unreposing dead to hear you go gaspar forget me under the chivalrous and gallant henry your career may be glorious and some fair girl will listen as once i did to your vows and be made happy by them farewell may the virgin bless you in my cell and cloister home i will not forget the best christian lessonto pray for our enemies gaspar farewell she glided hastily from the bower with swift steps she threaded the glade and sought the castle once within the seclusion of her own apartment she gave way to the burst of grief that tore her gentle bosom like a tempest for hers was that worst sorrow which taints past joys making remorse wait upon the memory of bliss and linking love and fancied guilt in such fearful society as that of the tyrant when he bound a living body to a corpse suddenly a thought darted into her mind at first she rejected it as puerile and superstitious but it would not be driven away she called hastily for her attendant manon she said didst thou ever sleep on st catherines couch manon crossed herself heaven forefend none ever did since i was born but two one fell into the loire and was drowned the other only looked upon the narrow bed and returned to her own home without a word it is an awful place and if the votary have not led a pious and good life woe betide the hour when she rests her head on the holy stone constance crossed herself also as for our lives it is only through our lord and the blessed saints that we can any of us hope for righteousness i will sleep on that couch to morrow night dear my lady and the king arrives to morrow the more need that i resolve it cannot be that misery so intense should dwell in any heart and no cure be found i had hoped to be the bringer of peace to our houses and is the good work to be for me a crown of thorns heaven shall direct me i will rest to morrow night on st catherines bed and if as i have heard the saint deigns to direct her votaries in dreams i will be guided by her and believing that i act according to the dictates of heaven i shall feel resigned even to the worst the king was on his way to nantes from paris and he slept on this night at a castle but a few miles distant before dawn a young cavalier was introduced into his chamber the knight had a serious nay a sad aspect and all beautiful as he was in feature and limb looked wayworn and haggard he stood silent in henrys presence who alert and gay turned his lively blue eyes upon his guest saying gently so thou foundest her obdurate gaspar i found her resolved on our mutual misery alas my liege it is not credit me the least of my grief that constance sacrifices her own happiness when she destroys mine and thou believest that she will say nay to the gaillard chevalier whom we ourselves present to her oh my liege think not that thought it cannot be my heart deeply most deeply thanks you for your generous condescension but she whom her lovers voice in solitudewhose entreaties when memory and seclusion aided the spellcould not persuade will resist even your majestys commands she is bent upon entering a cloister and i so please you will now take my leavei am henceforth a soldier of the cross gaspar said the monarch i know woman better than thou it is not by submission nor tearful plaints she is to be won the death of her relatives naturally sits heavy at the young countesss heart and nourishing in solitude her regret and her repentance she fancies that heaven itself forbids your union let the voice of the world reach herthe voice of earthly power and earthly kindnessthe one commanding the other pleading and both finding response in her own heartand by my fay and the holy cross she will be yours let our plan still hold and now to horse the morning wears and the sun is risen the king arrived at the bishops palace and proceeded forthwith to mass in the cathedral a sumptuous dinner succeeded and it was afternoon before the monarch proceeded through the town beside the loire to where a little above nantes the chateau villeneuve was situated the young countess received him at the gate henry looked in vain for the cheek blanched by misery the aspect of downcast despair which he had been taught to expect her cheek was flushed her manner animated her voice scarce tremulous she loves him not thought henry or already her heart has consented a collation was prepared for the monarch and after some little hesitation arising even from the cheerfulness of her mien he mentioned the name of gaspar constance blushed instead of turning pale and replied very quickly to morrow good my liege i ask for a respite but until to morrowall will then be decidedto morrow i am vowed to godor she looked confused and the king at once surprised and pleased said then you hate not young de vaudemontyou forgive him for the inimical blood that warms his veins we are taught that we should forgive that we should love our enemies the countess replied with some trepidation now by saint denis that is a right welcome answer for the novice said the king laughing what ho my faithful serving man dan apollo in disguise come forward and thank your lady for her love in such disguise as had concealed him from all the cavalier had hung behind and viewed with infinite surprise the demeanour and calm countenance of the lady he could not hear her words but was this even she whom he had seen trembling and weeping the evening beforethis she whose very heart was torn by conflicting passionwho saw the pale ghosts of parent and kinsman stand between her and the lover whom more than her life she adored it was a riddle hard to solve the kings call was in unison with his impatience and he sprang forward he was at her feet while she still passion driven overwrought by the very calmness she had assumed uttered one cry as she recognised him and sank senseless on the floor all this was very unintelligible even when her attendants had brought her to life another fit succeeded and then passionate floods of tears while the monarch waiting in the hall eyeing the half eaten collation and humming some romance in commemoration of womans waywardness knew not how to reply to vaudemonts look of bitter disappointment and anxiety at length the countess chief attendant came with an apology her lady was ill very ill the next day she would throw herself at the kings feet at once to solicit his excuse and to disclose her purpose to morrowagain to morrowdoes to morrow bear some charm maiden said the king can you read us the riddle pretty one what strange tale belongs to to morrow that all rests on its advent manon coloured looked down and hesitated but henry was no tyro in the art of enticing ladies attendants to disclose their ladies counsel manon was besides frightened by the countess scheme on which she was still obstinately bent so she was the more readily induced to betray it to sleep in st catherines bed to rest on a narrow ledge overhanging the deep rapid loire and if as was most probable the luckless dreamer escaped from falling into it to take the disturbed visions that such uneasy slumber might produce for the dictate of heaven was a madness of which even henry himself could scarcely deem any woman capable but could constance her whose beauty was so highly intellectual and whom he had heard perpetually praised for her strength of mind and talents could she be so strangely infatuated and can passion play such freaks with uslike death levelling even the aristocracy of the soul and bringing noble and peasant the wise and foolish under one thraldom it was strangeyet she must have her way that she hesitated in her decision was much and it was to be hoped that st catherine would play no ill natured part should it be otherwise a purpose to be swayed by a dream might be influenced by other waking thoughts to the more material kind of danger some safeguard should be brought there is no feeling more awful than that which invades a weak human heart bent upon gratifying its ungovernable impulses in contradiction to the dictates of conscience forbidden pleasures are said to be the most agreeableit may be so to rude natures to those who love to struggle combat and contend who find happiness in a fray and joy in the conflict of passion but softer and sweeter was the gentle spirit of constance and love and duty contending crushed and tortured her poor heart to commit her conduct to the inspirations of religion or if it was so to be named of superstition was a blessed relief the very perils that threatened her undertaking gave a zest to itto dare for his sake was happinessthe very difficulty of the way that led to the completion of her wishes at once gratified her love and distracted her thoughts from her despair or if it was decreed that she must sacrifice all the risk of danger and of death were of trifling import in comparison with the anguish which would then be her portion for ever the night threatened to be stormy the raging wind shook the casements and the trees waved their huge shadowy arms as giants might in fantastic dance and mortal broil constance and manon unattended quitted the chateau by a postern and began to descend the hill side the moon had not yet risen and though the way was familiar to both manon tottered and trembled while the countess drawing her silken cloak round her walked with a firm step down the steep they came to the rivers side where a small boat was moored and one man was in waiting constance stepped lightly in and then aided her fearful companion in a few moments they were in the middle of the stream the warm tempestuous animating equinoctial wind swept over them for the first time since her mourning a thrill of pleasure swelled the bosom of constance she hailed the emotion with double joy it cannot be she thought that heaven will forbid me to love one so brave so generous and so good as the noble gaspar another i can never love i shall die if divided from him and this heart these limbs so alive with glowing sensation are they already predestined to an early grave oh no life speaks aloud within them i shall live to love do not all things lovethe winds as they whisper to the rushing waters the waters as they kiss the flowery banks and speed to mingle with the sea heaven and earth are sustained by and live through love and shall constance alone whose heart has ever been a deep gushing overflowing well of true affection be compelled to set a stone upon the fount to lock it up for ever these thoughts bade fair for pleasant dreams and perhaps the countess an adept in the blind gods lore therefore indulged them the more readily but as thus she was engrossed by soft emotions manon caught her armlady look she cried it comesyet the oars have no sound now the virgin shield us would we were at home a dark boat glided by them four rowers habited in black cloaks pulled at oars which as manon said gave no sound another sat at the helm like the rest his person was veiled in a dark mantle but he wore no cap and though his face was turned from them constance recognised her lover gaspar she cried aloud dost thou livebut the figure in the boat neither turned its head nor replied and quickly it was lost in the shadowy waters how changed now was the fair countess reverie already heaven had begun its spell and unearthly forms were around as she strained her eyes through the gloom now she saw and now she lost view of the bark that occasioned her terror and now it seemed that another was there which held the spirits of the dead and her father waved to her from shore and her brothers frowned on her meanwhile they neared the landing her bark was moored in a little cove and constance stood upon the bank now she trembled and half yielded to manons entreaty to return till the unwise suivante mentioned the kings and de vaudemonts name and spoke of the answer to be given to morrow what answer if she turned back from her intent she now hurried forward up the broken ground of the bank and then along its edge till they came to a hill which abruptly hung over the tide a small chapel stood near with trembling fingers the countess drew forth the key and unlocked its door they entered it was darksave that a little lamp flickering in the wind showed an uncertain light from before the figure of saint catherine the two women knelt they prayed and then rising with a cheerful accent the countess bade her attendant good night she unlocked a little low iron door it opened on a narrow cavern the roar of waters was heard beyond thou mayest not follow my poor manon said constancenor dost thou much desirethis adventure is for me alone it was hardly fair to leave the trembling servant in the chapel alone who had neither hope nor fear nor love nor grief to beguile her but in those days esquires and waiting women often played the part of subalterns in the army gaining knocks and no fame besides manon was safe in holy ground the countess meanwhile pursued her way groping in the dark through the narrow tortuous passage at length what seemed light to her long darkened sense gleamed on her she reached an open cavern in the overhanging hills side looking over the rushing tide beneath she looked out upon the night the waters of the loire were speeding as since that day have they ever spedchangeful yet the same the heavens were thickly veiled with clouds and the wind in the trees was as mournful and ill omened as if it rushed round a murderers tomb constance shuddered a little and looked upon her beda narrow ledge of earth and a moss grown stone bordering on the very verge of the precipice she doffed her mantlesuch was one of the conditions of the spellshe bowed her head and loosened the tresses of her dark hair she bared her feet and thus fully prepared for suffering to the utmost the chill influence of the cold night she stretched herself on the narrow couch that scarce afforded room for her repose and whence if she moved in sleep she must be precipitated into the cold waters below at first it seemed to her as if she never should sleep again no great wonder that exposure to the blast and her perilous position should forbid her eyelids to close at length she fell into a reverie so soft and soothing that she wished even to watch and then by degrees her senses became confused and now she was on st catherines bedthe loire rushing beneath and the wild wind sweeping byand nowoh whitherand what dreams did the saint send to drive her to despair or to bid her be blest for ever beneath the rugged hill upon the dark tide another watched who feared a thousand things and scarce dared hope he had meant to precede the lady on her way but when he found that he had outstayed his time with muffled oars and breathless haste he had shot by the bark that contained his constance nor even turned at her voice fearful to incur her blame and her commands to return he had seen her emerge from the passage and shuddered as she leant over the cliff he saw her step forth clad as she was in white and could mark her as she lay on the ledge beetling above what a vigil did the lovers keepshe given up to visionary thoughts he knowingand the consciousness thrilled his bosom with strange emotionthat love and love for him had led her to that perilous couch and that while dangers surrounded her in every shape she was alive only to the small still voice that whispered to her heart the dream which was to decide their destinies she slept perhapsbut he waked and watched and night wore away as now praying now entranced by alternating hope and fear he sat in his boat his eyes fixed on the white garb of the slumberer above morningwas it morning that struggled in the clouds would morning ever come to waken her and had she slept and what dreams of weal or woe had peopled her sleep gaspar grew impatient he commanded his boatmen still to wait and he sprang forward intent on clambering the precipice in vain they urged the danger nay the impossibility of the attempt he clung to the rugged face of the hill and found footing where it would seem no footing was the acclivity indeed was not high the dangers of st catherines bed arising from the likelihood that any one who slept on so narrow a couch would be precipitated into the waters beneath up the steep ascent gaspar continued to toil and at last reached the roots of a tree that grew near the summit aided by its branches he made good his stand at the very extremity of the ledge near the pillow on which lay the uncovered head of his beloved her hands were folded on her bosom her dark hair fell round her throat and pillowed her cheek her face was serene sleep was there in all its innocence and in all its helplessness every wilder emotion was hushed and her bosom heaved in regular breathing he could see her heart beat as it lifted her fair hands crossed above no statue hewn of marble in monumental effigy was ever half so fair and within that surpassing form dwelt a soul true tender self devoted and affectionate as ever warmed a human breast with what deep passion did gaspar gaze gathering hope from the placidity of her angel countenance a smile wreathed her lips and he too involuntarily smiled as he hailed the happy omen when suddenly her cheek was flushed her bosom heaved a tear stole from her dark lashes and then a whole shower fell as starting up she cried nohe shall not diei will unloose his chainsi will save him gaspars hand was there he caught her light form ready to fall from the perilous couch she opened her eyes and beheld her lover who had watched over her dream of fate and who had saved her manon also had slept well dreaming or not and was startled in the morning to find that she waked surrounded by a crowd the little desolate chapel was hung with tapestrythe altar adorned with golden chalicesthe priest was chanting mass to a goodly array of kneeling knights manon saw that king henry was there and she looked for another whom she found not when the iron door of the cavern passage opened and gaspar de vaudemont entered from it leading the fair form of constance who in her white robes and dark dishevelled hair with a face in which smiles and blushes contended with deeper emotion approached the altar and kneeling with her lover pronounced the vows that united them for ever it was long before the happy gaspar could win from his lady the secret of her dream in spite of the happiness she now enjoyed she had suffered too much not to look back even with terror to those days when she thought love a crime and every event connected with them wore an awful aspect many a vision she said she had that fearful night she had seen the spirits of her father and brothers in paradise she had beheld gaspar victoriously combating among the infidels she had beheld him in king henrys court favoured and beloved and she herselfnow pining in a cloister now a bride now grateful to heaven for the full measure of bliss presented to her now weeping away her sad daystill suddenly she thought herself in paynim land and the saint herself st catherine guiding her unseen through the city of the infidels she entered a palace and beheld the miscreants rejoicing in victory and then descending to the dungeons beneath they groped their way through damp vaults and low mildewed passages to one cell darker and more frightful than the rest on the floor lay one with soiled and tattered garments with unkempt locks and wild matted beard his cheek was worn and thin his eyes had lost their fire his form was a mere skeleton the chains hung loosely on the fleshless bones and was it my appearance in that attractive state and winning costume that softened the hard heart of constance asked gaspar smiling at this painting of what would never be even so replied constance for my heart whispered me that this was my doing and who could recall the life that waned in your pulseswho restore save the destroyer my heart never warmed to my living happy knight as then it did to his wasted image as it lay in the visions of night at my feet a veil fell from my eyes a darkness was dispelled from before me methought i then knew for the first time what life and what death was i was bid believe that to make the living happy was not to injure the dead and i felt how wicked and how vain was that false philosophy which placed virtue and good in hatred and unkindness you should not die i would loosen your chains and save you and bid you live for love i sprung forward and the death i deprecated for you would in my presumption have been minethen when first i felt the real value of lifebut that your arm was there to save me your dear voice to bid me be blest for evermore v the mourner one fatal remembrance one sorrow that throws its bleak shade alike oer our joys and our woes to which life nothing darker or brighter can bring for which joy has no balm and affliction no sting moore a gorgeous scene of kingly pride is the prospect now before usthe offspring of art the nursling of naturewhere can the eye rest on a landscape more deliciously lovely than the fair expanse of virginia water now an open mirror to the sky now shaded by umbrageous banks which

overflowing the radiance that streams from yonder well of light the foliage of the trees seems dripping with the golden flood while the lake filled with no earthly dew appears but an imbasining of the sun tinctured atmosphere and trees and gay pavilion float in its depth more dear more distinct than their twins in the upper air nor is the scene silent strains more sweet than those that lull venus to her balmy rest more inspiring than the song of tiresias which awoke alexander to the deed of ruin more solemn than the chantings of st cecilia float along the waves and mingle with the lagging breeze which ruffles not the lake strange that a few dark scores should be the key to this fountain of sound the unconscious link between unregarded noise and harmonies which unclose paradise to our entranced senses the sun touches the extreme boundary and a softer milder light mingles a roseate tinge with the fiery glow our boat has floated long on the broad expanse now let it approach the umbrageous bank the green tresses of the graceful willow dip into the waters which are checked by them into a ripple the startled teal dart from their recess skimming the waves with splashing wing the stately swans float onward while innumerable waterfowl cluster together out of the way of the oars the twilight is blotted by no dark shades it is one subdued equal receding of the great tide of day we may disembark and wander yet amid the glades long before the thickening shadows speak of night the plantations are formed of every english tree with an old oak or two standing out in the walks there the glancing foliage obscures heaven as the silken texture of a veil a womans lovely features beneath such fretwork we may indulge in light hearted thoughts or if sadder meditations lead us to seek darker shades we may pass the cascade towards the large groves of pine with their vast undergrowth of laurel reaching up to the belvidere or on the opposite side of the water sit under the shadow of the silver stemmed birch or beneath the leafy pavilions of those fine old beeches whose high fantastic roots seem formed in natures sport and the near jungle of sweet smelling myrica leaves no sense unvisited by pleasant ministration now this splendid scene is reserved for the royal possessor but in past years while the lodge was called the regents cottage or before when the under ranger inhabited it the mazy paths of chapel wood were open and the iron gates enclosing the plantations and virginia water were guarded by no cerebus untamable by sops it was here on a summers evening that horace neville and his two fair cousins floated idly on the placid lake in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts bring sad thoughts to the mind neville had been eloquent in praise of english scenery in distant climes he said we may find landscapes grand in barbaric wildness or rich in the luxuriant vegetation of the south or sublime in alpine magnificence we may lament though it is ungrateful to say so on such a night as this the want of a more genial sky but where find scenery to be compared to the verdant well wooded well watered groves of our native land the clustering cottages shadowed by fine old elms each garden blooming with early flowers each lattice gay with geraniums and roses the blue eyed child devouring his white bread while he drives a cow to graze the hedge redolent with summer blooms the enclosed cornfields seas of golden grain weltering in the breeze the stile the track across the meadow leading through the copse under which the path winds and the meeting branches overhead which give by their dimming tracery a cathedral like solemnity to the scene the river winding with sweet inland murmur and as additional graces spots like theseoases of tastegardens of edenthe works of wealth which evince at once the greatest power and the greatest will to create beauty and yet continued neville it was with difficulty that i persuaded myself to reap the best fruits of my uncles will and to inhabit this spot familiar to my boyhood associated with unavailing regrets and recollected pain horace neville was a man of birthof wealth but he could hardly be termed a man of the world there was in his nature a gentleness a sweetness a winning sensibility allied to talent and personal distinction that gave weight to his simplest expressions and excited sympathy for all his emotions his younger cousin his junior by several years was attached to him by the tenderest sentimentssecret longbut they were now betrothed to each othera lovely happy pair she looked inquiringly but he turned away no more of this he said and giving a swifter impulse to their boat they speedily reached the shore landed and walked through the long extent of chapel wood it was dark night before they met their carriage at bishopsgate a week or two after horace received letters to call him to a distant part of the country a few days before his departure he requested his cousin to walk with him they bent their steps across several meadows to old windsor churchyard at first he did not deviate from the usual path and as they went they talked cheerfullygaily the beauteous sunny day might well exhilarate them the dancing waves sped onwards at their feet the country church lifted its rustic spire into the bright pure sky there was nothing in their conversation that could induce his cousin to think that neville had led her hither for any saddening purpose but when they were about to quit the churchyard horace as if he had suddenly recollected himself turned from the path crossed the greensward and paused beside a grave near the river no stone was there to commemorate the being who reposed beneathit was thickly grown with grass starred by a luxuriant growth of humble daisies a few dead leaves a broken bramble twig defaced its neatness neville removed these and then said juliet i commit this sacred spot to your keeping while i am away there is no monument he continued for her commands were implicitly obeyed by the two beings to whom she addressed them one day another may lie near and his name will be her epitaph i do not mean myself he said half smiling at the terror his cousins countenance expressed but promise me juliet to preserve this grave from every violation i do not wish to sadden you by the story yet if i have excited your interest i will satisfy it but not nownot here it was not till the following day when in company with her sister they again visited virginia water that seated under the shadow of its pines whose melodious swinging in the wind breathed unearthly harmony neville unasked commenced his story i was sent to eton at eleven years of age i will not dwell upon my sufferings there i would hardly refer to them did they not make a part of my present narration i was a fag to a hard taskmaster every labour he could inventand the youthful tyrant was ingenioushe devised for my annoyance early and late i was forced to be in attendance to the neglect of my school duties so incurring punishment there were worse things to bear than these it was his delight to put me to shame and finding that i had too much of my mother in my bloodto endeavour to compel me to acts of cruelty from which my nature revoltedi refused to obey speak of west indian slavery i hope things may be better now in my days the tender years of aristocratic childhood were yielded up to a capricious unrelenting cruel bondage far beyond the measured despotism of jamaica one dayi had been two years at school and was nearly thirteenmy tyrant i will give him no other name issued a command in the wantonness of power for me to destroy a poor little bullfinch i had tamed and caged in a hapless hour he found it in my room and was indignant that i should dare to appropriate a single pleasure i refused stubbornly dauntlessly though the consequence of my disobedience was immediate and terrible at this moment a message came from my tormentors tutorhis father had arrived well old lad he cried i shall pay you off some day seizing my pet at the same time he wrung its neck threw it at my feet and with a laugh of derision quitted the room never beforenever may i again feel the same swelling boiling fury in my bursting heartthe sight of my nursling expiring at my feetmy desire of vengeancemy impotence created a vesuvius within me that no tears flowed to quench could i have utteredactedmy passion it would have been less torturous it was so when i burst into a torrent of abuse and imprecation my vocabularyit must have been a choice collectionwas supplied by him against whom it was levelled but words were air i desired to give more substantial proof of my resentmenti destroyed everything in the room belonging to him i tore them to pieces i stamped on them crushed them with more than childish strength my last act was to seize a timepiece on which my tyrant infinitely prided himself and to dash it to the ground the sight of this as it lay shattered at my feet recalled me to my senses and something like an emotion of fear allayed the tumult in my heart i began to meditate an escape i got out of the house ran down a lane and across some meadows far out of bounds above eton i was seen by an elder boy a friend of my tormentor he called to me thinking at first that i was performing some errand for him but seeing that i shirked he repeated his come up in an authoritative voice it put wings to my heels he did not deem it necessary to pursue but i grow tedious my dear juliet enough that fears the most intense of punishment both from my masters and the upper boys made me resolve to run away i reached the banks of the thames tied my clothes over my head swam across and traversing several fields entered windsor forest with a vague childish feeling of being able to hide myself for ever in the unexplored obscurity of its immeasurable wilds it was early autumn the weather was mild even warm the forest oaks yet showed no sign of winter change though the fern beneath wore a yellowy tinge i got within chapel wood i fed upon chestnuts and beechnuts i continued to hide myself from the gamekeepers and woodmen i lived thus two days but chestnuts and beechnuts were sorry fare to a growing lad of thirteen years old a days rain occurred and i began to think myself the most unfortunate boy on record i had a distant obscure idea of starvation i thought of the children in the wood of their leafy shroud gift of the pious robin this brought my poor bullfinch to my mind and tears streamed in torrents down my cheeks i thought of my father and mother of you then my little baby cousin and playmate and i cried with renewed fervour till quite exhausted i curled myself up under a huge oak among some dry leaves the relics of a hundred summers and fell asleep i ramble on in my narration as if i had a story to tell yet i have little except a portraita sketchto present for your amusement or interest when i awoke the first object that met my opening eyes was a little foot delicately clad in silk and soft kid i looked up in dismay expecting to behold some gaily dressed appendage to this indication of high bred elegance but i saw a girl perhaps seventeen simply clad in a dark cotton dress her face shaded by a large very coarse straw hat she was pale even to marmoreal whiteness her chestnut coloured hair was parted in plain tresses across a brow which wore traces of extreme suffering her eyes were blue full large melancholy often even suffused with tears but her mouth had an infantine sweetness and innocence in its expression that softened the otherwise sad expression of her countenance she spoke to me i was too hungry too exhausted too unhappy to resist her kindness and gladly permitted her to lead me to her home we passed out of the wood by some broken palings on to bishopsgate heath and after no long walk arrived at her habitation it was a solitary dreary looking cottage the palings were in disrepair the garden waste the lattices unadorned by flowers or creepers within all was neat but sombre and even mean the diminutiveness of a cottage requires an appearance of cheerfulness and elegance to make it pleasing the bare floorclean it is truethe rush chairs deal table checked curtains of this cot were beneath even a peasants rusticity yet it was the dwelling of my lovely guide whose little white hand delicately gloved contrasted with her unadorned attire as did her gentle self with the clumsy appurtenances of her too humble dwelling poor child she had meant entirely to hide her origin to degrade herself to a peasants state and little thought that she for ever betrayed herself by the strangest incongruities thus the arrangements of her table were mean her fare meagre for a hermit but the linen was matchlessly fine and wax lights stood in candlesticks which a beggar would almost have disdained to own but i talk of circumstances i observed afterwards then i was chiefly aware of the plentiful breakfast she caused her single attendant a young girl to place before me and of the sweet soothing voice of my hostess which spoke a kindness with which lately i had been little conversant when my hunger was appeased she drew my story from me encouraged me to write to my father and kept me at her abode till after a few days i returned to school pardoned no long time elapsed before i got into the upper forms and my woful slavery ended whenever i was able i visited my disguised nymph i no longer associated with my schoolfellows their diversions their pursuits appeared vulgar and stupid to me i had but one object in viewto accomplish my lessons and to steal to the cottage of ellen burnet do not look grave love true others as young as i then was have loved and i might also but not ellen her profound her intense melancholy sister to despairher serious sad discourseher mind estranged from all worldly concerns forbade that but there was an enchantment in her sorrow a fascination in her converse that lifted me above commonplace existence she created a magic circle which i entered as holy ground it was not akin to heaven for grief was the presiding spirit but there was an exaltation of sentiment an enthusiasm a view beyond the grave which made it unearthly singular wild enthralling you have often observed that i strangely differ from all other men i mingle with them make one in their occupations and diversions but i have a portion of my being sacred from thema living well sealed up from their contamination lies deep in my heartit is of little use but there it is ellen opened the spring and it has flowed ever since of what did she talk she recited no past adventures alluded to no past intercourse with friend or relative she spoke of the various woes that wait on humanity on the intricate mazes of life on the miseries of passion of love remorse and death and that which we may hope or fear beyond the tomb she spoke of the sensation of wretchedness alive in her own broken heart and then she grew fearfully eloquent till suddenly pausing she reproached herself for making me familiar with such wordless misery i do you harm she often said i unfit you for society i have tried seeing you thrown upon yonder distorted miniature of a bad world to estrange you from its evil contagion i fear that i shall be the cause of greater harm to you than could spring from association with your fellow creatures in the ordinary course of things this is not wellavoid the stricken deer there were darker shades in the picture than those which i have already developed ellen was more miserable than the imagination of one like you dear girl unacquainted with woe can portray sometimes she gave words to her despairit was so great as to confuse the boundary between physical and mental sensationand every pulsation of her heart was a throb of pain she has suddenly broken off in talking of her sorrows with a cry of agonybidding me leave herhiding her face on her arms shivering with the anguish some thought awoke the idea that chiefly haunted her though she earnestly endeavoured to put it aside was self destructionto snap the silver cord that bound together so much grace wisdom and sweetnessto rob the world of a creation made to be its ornament sometimes her piety checked her oftener a sense of unendurable suffering made her brood with pleasure over the dread resolve she spoke of it to me as being wicked yet i often fancied this was done rather to prevent her example from being of ill effect to me than from any conviction that the father of all would regard angrily the last act of his miserable child once she had prepared the mortal beverage it was on the table before her when i entered she did not deny its nature she did not attempt to justify herself she only besought me not to hate her and to soothe by my kindness her last momentsi cannot live was all her explanation all her excuse and it was spoken with such fervent wretchedness that it seemed wrong to attempt to persuade her to prolong the sense of pain i did not act like a boy i wonder i did not i made one simple request to which she instantly acceded that she should walk with me to this belvidere it was a glorious sunset beauty and the spirit of love breathed in the wind and hovered over the softened hues of the landscape look ellen i cried if only such loveliness of nature existed it were worth living for true if a latent feeling did not blot this glorious scene with murky shadows beauty is as we see itmy eyes view all things deformed and evil she closed them as she said this but young and sensitive the visitings of the soft breeze already began to minister consolation dearest ellen i continued what do i not owe to you i am your boy your pupil i might have gone on blindly as others do but you opened my eyes you have given me a sense of the just the good the beautifuland have you done this merely for my misfortune if you leave me what can become of me the last words came from my heart and tears gushed from my eyes do not leave me ellen i said i cannot live without youand i cannot die for i have a mothera father she turned quickly round saying you are blessed sufficiently her voice struck me as unnatural she grew deadly pale as she spoke and was obliged to sit down still i clung to her prayed cried till shei had never seen her shed a tear beforeburst into passionate weeping after this she seemed to forget her resolve we returned by moonlight and our talk was even more calm and cheerful than usual when in her cottage i poured away the fatal draught her good night bore with it no traces of her late agitation and the next day she said i have thoughtlessly even wickedly created a new duty to myself even at a time when i had forsworn all but i will be true to it pardon me for making you familiar with emotions and scenes so dire i will behave betteri will preserve myself if i can till the link between us is loosened or broken and i am free again one little incident alone occurred during our intercourse that appeared at all to connect her with the world sometimes i brought her a newspaper for those were stirring times and though before i knew her she had forgotten all except the world her own heart enclosed yet to please me she would talk of napoleonrussia from whence the emperor now returned overthrownand the prospect of his final defeat the paper lay one day on her table some words caught her eye she bent eagerly down to read them and her bosom heaved with violent palpitation but she subdued herself and after a few moments told me to take the paper away then indeed i did feel an emotion of even impertinent inquisitiveness i found nothing to satisfy itthough afterwards i became aware that it contained a singular advertisement saying if these lines meet the eye of any one of the passengers who were on board the st mary bound for liverpool from barbadoes which sailed on the third of may last and was destroyed by fire in the high seas a part of the crew only having been saved by his majestys frigate the bellerophon they are entreated to communicate with the advertiser and if any one be acquainted with the particulars of the hon miss evershams fate and present abode they are earnestly requested to disclose them directing to l e stratton street park lane it was after this event as winter came on that symptoms of decided ill health declared themselves in the delicate frame of my poor ellen i have often suspected that without positively attempting her life she did many things that tended to abridge it and to produce mortal disease now when really ill she refused all medical attendance but she got better again and i thought her nearly well when i saw her for the last time before going home for the christmas holidays her manner was full of affection she relied she said on the continuation of my friendship she made me promise never to forget her though she refused to write to me and forbade any letters from me even now i see her standing at her humble doorway if an appearance of illness and suffering can ever he termed lovely it was in her still she was to be viewed as the wreck of beauty what must she not have been in happier days with her angel expression of face her nymph like figure her voice whose tones were music so youngso lost was the sentiment that burst even from me a young lad as i waved my hand to her as a last adieu she hardly looked more than fifteen but none could doubt that her very soul was impressed by the sad lines of sorrow that rested so unceasingly on her fair brow away from her her figure for ever floated before my eyesi put my hands before them still she was there my day my night dreams were filled by my recollections of her during the winter holidays on a fine soft day i went out to hunt you dear juliet will remember the sad catastrophe i fell and broke my leg the only person who saw me fall was a young man who rode one of the most beautiful horses i ever saw and i believe it was by watching him as he took a leap that i incurred my disaster he dismounted and was at my side in a minute my own animal had fled he called his it obeyed his voice with ease he lifted my light figure on to the saddle contriving to support my leg and so conducted me a short distance to a lodge situated in the woody recesses of elmore park the seat of the earl of d whose second son my preserver was he was my sole nurse for a day or two and during the whole of my illness passed many hours of each day by my bedside as i lay gazing on him while he read to me or talked narrating a thousand stranger adventures which had occurred during his service in the peninsula i thoughtis it for ever to be my fate to fall in with the highly gifted and excessively unhappy the immediate neighbour of lewis family was lord eversham he had married in very early youth and became a widower young after this misfortune which passed like a deadly blight over his prospects and possessions leaving the gay view utterly sterile and bare he left his surviving infant daughter under the care of lewis mother and travelled for many years in far distant lands he returned when clarice was about ten a lovely sweet child the pride and delight of all connected with her lord eversham on his returnhe was then hardly more than thirtydevoted himself to her education they were never separate he was a good musician and she became a proficient under his tutoring they rodewalkedread together when a father is all that a father may be the sentiments of filial piety entire dependence and perfect confidence being united the love of a daughter is one of the deepest and strongest as it is the purest passion of which our natures are capable clarice worshipped her parent who came during the transition from mere childhood to the period when reflection and observation awaken to adorn a commonplace existence with all the brilliant adjuncts which enlightened and devoted affection can bestow he appeared to her like an especial gift of providence a guardian angelbut far dearer as being akin to her own nature she grew under his eye in loveliness and refinement both of intellect and heart these feelings were not dividedalmost strengthened by the engagement that had taken place between her and lewislewis was destined for the army and after a few years service they were to be united it is hard when all is fair and tranquil when the world opening before the ardent gaze of youth looks like a well kept demesne unencumbered by let or hindrance for the annoyance of the young traveller that we should voluntarily stray into desert wilds and tempest visited districts lewis elmore was ordered to spain and at the same time lord eversham found it necessary to visit some estates he possessed in barbadoes he was not sorry to revisit a scene which had dwelt in his memory as an earthly paradise nor to show to his daughter a new and strange world so to form her understanding and enlarge her mind they were to return in three months and departed as on a summer tour clarice was glad that while her lover gathered experience and knowledge in a distant land she should not remain in idleness she was glad that there would be some diversion for her anxiety during his perilous absence and in every way she enjoyed the idea of travelling with her beloved father who would fill every hour and adorn every new scene with pleasure and delight they sailed clarice wrote home with enthusiastic expressions of rapture and delight from madeirayet without her father she said the fair scene had been blank to her more than half her letter was filled by the expressions of her gratitude and affection for her adored and revered parent while he in his with fewer words perhaps but with no less energy spoke of his satisfaction in her improvement his pride in her beauty and his grateful sense of her love and kindness such were they a matchless example of happiness in the dearest connection in life as resulting from the exercise of their reciprocal duties and affections a father and daughter the one all care gentleness and sympathy consecrating his life for her happiness the other fond duteous gratefulsuch had they beenand where were they nowthe noble kind respected parent and the beloved and loving child they had departed from england as on a pleasure voyage down an inland stream but the ruthless car of destiny had overtaken them on their unsuspecting way crushing them under its heavy wheelsscattering love hope and joy as the bellowing avalanche overwhelms and grinds to mere spray the streamlet of the valley they were gone but whither mystery hung over the fate of the most helpless victim and my friends anxiety was to penetrate the clouds that hid poor clarice from his sight after an absence of a few months they had written fixing their departure in the st mary to sail from barbadoes in a few days lewis at the same time returned from spain he was invalided in his very first action by a bad wound in his side he arrived and each day expected to hear of the landing of his friends when that common messenger the newspaper brought him tidings to fill him with more than anxietywith fear and agonizing doubt the st mary had caught fire and had burned in the open sea a frigate the bellerophon had saved a part of the crew in spite of illness and a physicians commands lewis set out the same day for london to ascertain as speedily as possible the fate of her he loved there he heard that the frigate was expected in the downs without alighting from his travelling chaise he posted thither arriving in a burning fever he went on board saw the commander and spoke with the crew they could give him few particulars as to whom they had saved they had touched at liverpool and left there most of the persons including all the passengers rescued from the st mary physical suffering for awhile disabled mr elmore he was confined by his wound and consequent fever and only recovered to give himself up to his exertions to discover the fate of his friendsthey did not appear nor write and all lewis inquiries only tended to confirm his worst fears yet still he hoped and still continued indefatigable in his perquisitions he visited liverpool and ireland whither some of the passengers had gone and learnt only scattered incongruous details of the fearful tragedy that told nothing of miss evershams present abode though much that confirmed his suspicion that she still lived the fire on board the st mary had raged long and fearfully before the bellerophon hove in sight and boats came off for the rescue of the crew the women were to be first embarked but clarice clung to her father and refused to go till he should accompany her some fearful presentiment that if she were saved he would remain and die gave such energy to her resolve that not the entreaties of her father nor the angry expostulations of the captain could shake it lewis saw this man after the lapse of two or three months and he threw most light on the dark scene he well remembered that transported with anger by her obstinacy he had said to her you will cause your fathers deathand be as much a parricide as if you put poison into his cup you are not the first girl who has murdered her father in her wilful mood still clarice passionately refused to gothere was no time for long parleythe point was yielded and she remained pale but firm near her parent whose arm was around her supporting her during the awful interval it was no period for regular action and calm order a tempest was rising the scorching waves blew this way and that making a fearful day of the night which veiled all except the burning ship the boats returned with difficulty and one only could contrive to approach it was nearly full lord eversham and his daughter advanced to the decks edge to get in we can only take one of you vociferated the sailors keep back on your life throw the girl to uswe will come back for you if we can lord eversham cast with a strong arm his daughter who had now entirely lost her self possession into the boat she was alive again in a minute she called to her father held out her arms to him and would have thrown herself into the sea but was held back by the sailors meanwhile lord eversham feeling that no boat could again approach the lost vessel contrived to heave a spar overboard and threw himself into the sea clinging to it the boat tossed by the huge waves with difficulty made its way to the frigate and as it rose from the trough of the sea clarice saw her father struggling with his fatebattling with the death that at last became the victor the spar floated by his arms had fallen from it were those his pallid features she neither wept nor fainted but her limbs grew rigid her face colourless and she was lifted as a log on to the deck of the frigate the captain allowed that on her homeward voyage the people had rather a horror of her as having caused her fathers death her own servants had perished few people remembered who she was but they talked together with no careful voices as they passed her and a hundred times she must have heard herself accused of having destroyed her parent she spoke to no one or only in brief reply when addressed to avoid the rough remonstrances of those around she appeared at table ate as well as she could but there was a settled wretchedness in her face that never changed when they landed at liverpool the captain conducted her to an hotel he left her meaning to return but an opportunity of sailing that night for the downs occurred of which he availed himself without again visiting her he knew he said and truly that she was in her native country where she had but to write a letter to gather crowds of friends about her and where can greater civility be found than at an english hotel if it is known that you are perfectly able to pay your bill this was all that mr elmore could learn and it took many months to gather together these few particulars he went to the hotel at liverpool it seemed that as soon as there appeared some hope of rescue from the frigate lord eversham had given his pocket book to his daughters care containing bills on a banking house at liverpool to the amount of a few hundred pounds on the second day after clarices arrival there she had sent for the master of the hotel and showed him these he got the cash for her and the next day she quitted liverpool in a little coasting vessel in vain lewis endeavoured to trace her apparently she had crossed to ireland but whatever she had done wherever she had gone she had taken infinite pains to conceal herself and all due was speedily lost lewis had not yet despaired he was even now perpetually making journeys sending emissaries employing every possible means for her discovery from the moment he told me this story we talked of nothing else i became deeply interested and we ceaselessly discussed the probabilities of the case and where she might be concealed that she did not meditate suicide was evident from her having possessed herself of money yet unused to the world young lovely and inexperienced what could be her plan what might not have been her fate meanwhile i continued for nearly three months confined by the fracture of my limb before the lapse of that time i had begun to crawl about the ground and now i considered myself as nearly recovered it had been settled that i should not return to eton but be entered at oxford and this leap from boyhood to mans estate elated me considerably yet still i thought of my poor ellen and was angry at her obstinate silence once or twice i had disobeying her command written to her mentioning my accident and the kind attentions of mr elmore still she wrote not and i began to fear that her illness might have had a fatal termination she had made me vow so solemnly never to mention her name never to inquire about her during my absence that considering obedience the first duty of a young inexperienced boy to one older than himself i resisted each suggestion of my affection or my fears to transgress her orders and now spring came with its gift of opening buds odoriferous flowers and sunny genial days i returned home and found my family on the eve of their departure for london my long confinement had weakened me it was deemed inadvisable for me to encounter the bad air and fatigues of the metropolis and i remained to rusticate i rode and hunted and thought of ellen missing the excitement of her conversation and feeling a vacancy in my heart which she had filled i began to think of riding across the country from shropshire to berks for the purpose of seeing her the whole landscape haunted my imaginationthe fields round etonthe silver thamesthe majestic forestthis lovely scene of virginia waterthe heath and her desolate cottageshe herself pale slightly bending from weakness of health awakening from dark abstraction to bestow on me a kind smile of welcome it grew into a passionate desire of my heart to behold her to cheer her as i might by my affectionate attentions to hear her and to hang upon her accents of inconsolable despair as if it had been celestial harmony as i meditated on these things a voice seemed for ever to repeat now go or it will be too late while another yet more mournful tone responded you can never see her more i was occupied by these thoughts as on a summer moonlight night i loitered in the shrubbery unable to quit a scene of entrancing beauty when i was startled at hearing myself called by mr elmore he came on his way to the coast he had received a letter from ireland which made him think that miss eversham was residing near enniscorthya strange place for her to select but as concealment was evidently her object not an improbable one yet his hopes were not high on the contrary he performed this journey more from the resolve to leave nothing undone than in expectation of a happy result he asked me if i would accompany him i was delighted with the offer and we departed together on the following morning we arrived at milford haven where we were to take our passage the packet was to sail early in the morningwe walked on the beach and beguiled the time by talk i had never mentioned ellen to lewis i felt now strongly inclined to break my vow and to relate my whole adventure with her but restrained myself and we spoke only of the unhappy clariceof the despair that must have been hers of her remorse and unavailing regret we retired to rest and early in the morning i was called to prepare for going on board i got ready and then knocked at lewis door he admitted me for he was dressed though a few of his things were still unpacked and scattered about the room the morocco case of a miniature was on his table i took it up did i never show you that said elmore poor dear clarice she was very happy when that was painted i opened itrich luxuriant curls clustered on her brow and the snow white throat there was a light zephyr appearance in the figure an expression of unalloyed exuberant happiness in the countenance but those large doves eyes the innocence that dwelt on her mouth could not be mistaken and the name of ellen burnet burst from my lips there was no doubt why had i ever doubted the thing was so plain who but the survivor of such a parent and she the apparent cause of his death could be so miserable as ellen a torrent of explanation followed and a thousand minute circumstances forgotten before now assured us that my sad hermitess was the beloved of elmore no more sea voyagenot a second of delayour chaise the horses heads tamed to the east rolled on with lightning rapidity yet far too slowly to satisfy our impatience it was not until we arrived at worcester that the tide of expectation flowing all one way ebbed suddenly even while i was telling elmore some anecdote to prove that in spite of all she would be accessible to consolation i remembered her ill health and my fears lewis saw the change my countenance underwent for some time i could not command my voice and when at last i spoke my gloomy anticipations passed like an electric shock into my friends soul when we arrived at oxford we halted for an hour or two unable to proceed yet we did not converse on the subject so near our hearts nor until we arrived in sight of windsor did a word pass between us then elmore said to morrow morning dear neville you shall visit clarice we must not be too precipitate the morrow came i arose with that intolerable weight at my breast which it is griefs worst heritage to feel a sunny day it was yet the atmosphere looked black to me my heart was dead within me we sat at the breakfast table but neither ate and after some restless indecision we left our inn and to protract the interval walked to bishopsgate our conversation belied our feelings we spoke as if we expected all to be well we felt that there was no hope we crossed the heath along the accustomed path on one side was the luxuriant foliage of the forest on the other the widespread moor her cottage was situated at one extremity and could hardly be distinguished until we should arrive close to it when we drew near lewis bade me go on alone he would wait my return i obeyed and reluctantly approached the confirmation of my fears at length it stood before me the lonely cot and desolate garden the unfastened wicket swung in the breeze every shutter was closed to stand motionless and gaze on these symbols of my worst forebodings was all that i could do my heart seemed to me to call aloud for ellenfor such was she to meher other name might be a fictionbut silent as her own life deserted lips were mine lewis grew impatient and advanced my stay had occasioned a transient ray of hope to enter his mind it vanished when he saw me and her deserted dwelling slowly we turned away and were directing our steps back again when my name was called by a child a little girl came running across some fields towards us whom at last i recognised as having seen before with ellen mr neville there is a letter for you cried the child a letter wherewho the lady left a letter for you you must go to old windsor to mr cookes he has got it for you she had left a letter was she then departed on an earthly journey i will go for it immediately mr cooke old windsor where shall i find him who is he oh sir everybody knows him said the child he lives close to the churchyard he is the sexton after the burial nancy gave him the letter to take care of had we hoped had we for a moment indulged the expectation of ever again seeing our miserable friend never o never our hearts had told us that the sufferer was at peacethe unhappy orphan with her father in the abode of spirits why then were we here why had a smile dwelt on our lips now wreathed into the expression of anguish our full hearts demanded one consolationto weep upon her grave her sole link now with us her mourners there at last my boys grief found vent in tears in lamentation you saw the spot the grassy mound rests lightly on the bosom of fair clarice of my own poor ellen stretched upon this kissing the scarcely springing turf for many hours no thought visited me but the wretched one that she had lived and was lost to me for ever if lewis had ever doubted the identity of my friend with her he loved the letter put into our hands undeceived him the handwriting was miss evershams it was directed to me and contained words like these april i have vowed never to mention certain beloved names never to communicate with beings who cherished me once to whom my deepest gratitude is due and as well as poor bankrupt can is paid perhaps it is a mere prevarication to write to you dear horace concerning them but heaven pardon me my disrobed spirit would not repose i fear if i did not thus imperfectly bid them a last farewell you know him neville and know that he for ever laments her whom he has lost describe your poor ellen to him and he will speedily see that she died on the waves of the murderous atlantic ellen had nothing in common with her save love for and interest in him tell him it had been well for him perhaps to have united himself to the child of prosperity the nursling of deep love but it had been destruction even could he have meditated such an act to wed the parrici i will not write that word sickness and near death have taken the sting from my despair the agony of woe which you witnessed is melted into tender affliction and pious hope i am not miserable now now when you read these words the hand that writes the eye that sees will be a little dust becoming one with the earth around it you perhaps he will visit my quiet retreat bestow a few tears on my fate but let them be secret they may make green my grave but do not let a misplaced feeling adorn it with any other tribute it is my last request let no stone no name mark that spot farewell dear horace farewell to one other whom i may not name may the god to whom i am about to resign my spirit in confidence and hope bless your earthly career blindly perhaps you will regret me for your own sakes but for mine you will be grateful to the providence which has snapt the heavy chain binding me to unutterable sorrow and which permits me from my lowly grass grown tomb to say to you i am at peace ellen vi the false rhyme come tell me where the maid is found whose heart can love without deceit and i will range the world around to sigh one moment at her feet moore on a fine july day the fair margaret queen of navarre then on a visit to her royal brother had arranged a rural feast for the morning following which francis declined attending he was melancholy and the cause was said to be some lovers quarrel with a favourite dame the morrow came and dark rain and murky clouds destroyed at once the schemes of the courtly throng margaret was angry and she grew weary her only hope for amusement was in francis and he had shut himself upan excellent reason why she should the more desire to see him she entered his apartment he was standing at the casement against which the noisy shower beat writing with a diamond on the glass two beautiful dogs were his sole companions as queen margaret entered he hastily let down the silken curtain before the window and looked a little confused what treason is this my liege said the queen which crimsons your cheek i must see the same it is treason replied the king and therefore sweet sister thou mayest not see it this the more excited margarets curiosity and a playful contest ensued francis at last yielded he threw himself on a huge high backed settee and as the lady drew back the curtain with an arch smile he grew grave and sentimental as he reflected on the cause which had inspired his libel against all womankind what have we here cried margaret nay this is lse majest souvent femme varie bien fou qui sy fie very little change would greatly amend your coupletwould it not run better thus souvent homme varie bien folle qui sy fie i could tell you twenty stories of mans inconstancy i will be content with one true tale of womans fidelity said francis drily but do not provoke me i would fain be at peace with the soft mutabilities for thy dear sake i defy your grace replied margaret rashly to instance the falsehood of one noble and well reputed dame not even emilie de lagny asked the king this was a sore subject for the queen emilie had been brought up in her own household the most beautiful and the most virtuous of her maids of honour she had long loved the sire de lagny and their nuptials were celebrated with rejoicings but little ominous of the result de lagny was accused but a year after of traitorously yielding to the emperor a fortress under his command and he was condemned to perpetual imprisonment for some time emilie seemed inconsolable often visiting the miserable dungeon of her husband and suffering on her return from witnessing his wretchedness such paroxysms of grief as threatened her life suddenly in the midst of her sorrow she disappeared and inquiry only divulged the disgraceful fact that she had escaped from france bearing her jewels with her and accompanied by her page robinet leroux it was whispered that during their journey the lady and the stripling often occupied one chamber and margaret enraged at these discoveries commanded that no further quest should be made for her lost favourite taunted now by her brother she defended emilie declaring that she believed her to be guiltless even going so far as to boast that within a month she would bring proof of her innocence robinet was a pretty boy said francis laughing let us make a bet cried margaret if i lose i will bear this vile rhyme of thine as a motto to my shame to my grave if i win i will break my window and grant thee whatever boon thou askest the result of this bet was long sung by troubadour and minstrel the queen employed a hundred emissariespublished rewards for any intelligence of emilieall in vain the month was expiring and margaret would have given many bright jewels to redeem her word on the eve of the fatal day the jailor of the prison in which the sire de lagny was confined sought an audience of the queen he brought her a message from the knight to say that if the lady margaret would ask his pardon as her boon and obtain from her royal brother that he might be brought before him her bet was won fair margaret was very joyful and readily made the desired promise francis was unwilling to see his false servant but he was in high good humour for a cavalier had that morning brought intelligence of a victory over the imperialists the messenger himself was lauded in the despatches as the most fearless and bravest knight in france the king loaded him with presents only regretting that a vow prevented the soldier from raising his visor or declaring his name that same evening as the setting sun shone on the lattice on which the ungallant rhyme was traced francis reposed on the same settee and the beautiful queen of navarre with triumph in her bright eyes sat beside him attended by guards the prisoner was brought in his frame was attenuated by privation and he walked with tottering steps he knelt at the feet of francis and uncovered his head a quantity of rich golden hair then escaping fell over the sunken cheeks and pallid brow of the suppliant we have treason here cried the king sir jailor where is your prisoner sire blame him not said the soft faltering voice of emilie wiser men than he have been deceived by woman my dear lord was guiltless of the crime for which he suffered there was but one mode to save himi assumed his chainshe escaped with poor robinet leroux in my attirehe joined your army the young and gallant cavalier who delivered the despatches to your grace whom you overwhelmed with honours and reward is my own enguerrard de lagny i waited but for his arrival with testimonials of his innocence to declare myself to my lady the queen has she not won her bet and the boon she asks is de lagnys pardon said margaret as she also knelt to the king spare your faithful vassal sire and reward this ladys truth francis first broke the false speaking window then he raised the ladies from their supplicatory posture in the tournament given to celebrate this triumph of ladies the sire de lagny bore off every prize and surely there was more loveliness in emilies faded cheekmore grace in her emaciated form type as they were of truest affectionthan in the prouder bearing and fresher complexion of the most brilliant beauty in attendance on the courtly festival vii a tale of the passions or the death of despina after the death of manfred king of naples the ghibellines lost their ascendency throughout italy the exiled guelphs returned to their native cities and not contented with resuming the reins of government they prosecuted their triumph until the ghibellines in their turn were obliged to fly and to mourn in banishment over the violent party spirit which had before occasioned their bloody victories and now their irretrievable defeat after an obstinate contest the florentine ghibellines were forced to quit their native town their estates were confiscated their attempts to reinstate themselves frustrated and receding from castle to castle they at length took refuge in lucca and awaited with impatience the arrival of corradino from germany through whose influence they hoped again to establish the imperial supremacy the first of may was ever a day of rejoicing and festivity at florence the youth of both sexes and of all ranks paraded the streets crowned with flowers and singing the canzonets of the day in the evening they assembled in the piazza del duomo and spent the hours in dancing the carroccio was led through the principal streets the ringing of its bell drowned in the peals that rang from every belfry in the city and in the music of fifes and drums which made a part of the procession that followed it the triumph of the reigning party in florence caused them to celebrate the anniversary of the first of may with peculiar splendour they had indeed hoped that charles danjou king of naples the head of the guelphs in italy and then vicare president of their republic would have been there to adorn the festival by his presence but the expectation of corradino had caused the greater part of his newly conquered and oppressed kingdom to revolt and he had hastily quitted tuscany to secure by his presence those conquests of which his avarice and cruelty endangered the loss but although charles somewhat feared the approaching contest with corradino the florentine guelphs newly reinstated in their city and possessions did not permit a fear to cloud their triumph the principal families vied with each other in the display of their magnificence during the festival the knights followed the carroccio on horseback and the windows were filled with ladies who leant upon gold inwoven carpets while their own dresses at once simple and elegant their only ornaments flowers contrasted with the glittering tapestry and the brilliant colours of the flags of the various communities the whole population of florence poured into the principal streets and none were left at home except the decrepit and sick unless it were some discontented ghibelline whose fear poverty or avarice had caused him to conceal his party when it had been banished from the city it was not the feeling of discontent which prevented monna gegia de becari from being among the first of the revellers and she looked angrily on what she called her ghibelline leg which fixed her to her chair on such a day of triumph the sun shone in all its glory in an unclouded sky and caused the fair florentines to draw their fazioles veils over their dark eyes and to bereave the youth of those beams more vivifying than the suns rays the same sun poured its full light into the lonely apartment of monna gegia and almost extinguished the fire which was lighted in the middle of the room over which hung the pot of minestra the dinner of the dame and her husband but she had deserted the fire and was seated by her window holding her beads in her hand while every now and then she peeped from her lattice five storeys high into the narrow lane below but no creature passed she looked at the opposite window a cat slept there beside a pot of heliotrope but no human being was heard or seenthey had all gone to the piazza del duomo monna gegia was an old woman and her dress of green calrasio stuff showed that she belonged to one of the arli minori working classes her head was covered by a red kerchief which folded triangularly hung loosely over it her grey hairs were combed back from her high and wrinkled brow the quickness of her eye spoke the activity of her mind and the slight irritability that lingered about the corners of her lips might be occasioned by the continual war maintained between her bodily and mental faculties now by st john she said i would give my gold cross to make one of them though by giving that i should appear on a festa without that which no festa yet ever found me wanting and as she spoke she looked with great complacency on a large but thin gold cross which was tied round her withered neck by a ribbon once black now of a rusty brown methinks this leg of mine is bewitched and it may well be that my ghibelline husband has used the black art to hinder me from following the carroccio with the best of thema slight sound as of footsteps in the street far below interrupted the good womans soliloquyperhaps it is monna lisabetta or messer giani dei agli the weaver who mounted the breach first when the castle of pagibonzi was takenshe looked down but could see no one and was about to relapse into her old train of thoughts when her attention was again attracted by the sound of steps ascending the stairs they were slow and heavy but she did not doubt who her visitant was when a key was applied to the hole of the door the latch was lifted up and a moment after with an unassured mien and downcast eyes her husband entered he was a short stunted man more than sixty years of age his shoulders were broad and high his lank hair was still coal black his brows were overhanging and bushy his eyes black and quick his lips as it were contradicted the sternness of the upper part of his face for their gentle curve betokened even delicacy of sentiment and his smile was inexpressibly sweet he had on a low crowned red cloth cap which he drew over his eyes and seating himself on a low bench by the fire he heaved a deep sigh he appeared disinclined to enter into any conversation but monna gegia was resolved that he should not enjoy his melancholy mood uninterrupted have you been to mass cincolo she asked beginning by a question sufficiently removed from the point she longed to approachhe shrugged his shoulders uneasily but did not replyyou are too early for your dinner continued gegia do you not go out again cincolo answered no in an accent that denoted his disinclination to further questioning but this very impatience only served to feed the spirit of contention that was fermenting in the bosom of gegia you are not used she said to pass your may days under your chimneyno answerwell she continued if you will not speak i have donemeaning that she intended to beginbut by that lengthened face of thine i see that some good news is stirring abroad and i bless the virgin for it whatever it may be come tell me what happy tidings make thee so woe begone cincolo remained silent for awhile then turning half round but not looking at his wife he replied what if old marzio the lion be dead gegia turned pale at the idea but a smile that lurked in the good natured mouth of her husband reassured her nay st john defend us she began but that is not true old marzios death would not drive you within these four walls except it were to triumph over your old wife by the blessing of st john not one of our lions have died since the eve of the battle of monte aperto and i doubt not that they were poisoned for mari who fed them that night was more than half a ghibelline in his heart besides the bells are still ringing and the drums still beating and all would be silent enough if old marzio were to die on the first of may too santa reparata is too good to us to allow such ill luckand she has more favour i trust in the seventh heaven than all the ghibelline saints in your calendar no good cincolo marzio is not dead nor the holy father nor messer carlo of naples but i would bet my gold cross against the wealth of your banished men that pisa is takenor corradinoor and i here no gegia old as i am and much as you need my help and that last is why i am here at all pisa would not be taken while this old body could stand in the breach or corradino die till this lazy blood were colder on the ground than it is in my body ask no more questions and do not rouse me there is no news no good or ill luck that i know but when i saw the neri the pulci the buondelmonti and the rest of them ride like kings through the streets whose very hands are hardly dry from the blood of my kindred when i saw their daughter crowned with flowers and thought how the daughter of arrigo dei elisei was mourning for her murdered father with ashes on her head by the hearth of a strangermy spirit must be more dead than it is if such a sight did not make me wish to drive among them and methought i could scatter their pomp with my awl for a sword but i remembered thee and am here unstained with blood that thou wilt never be cried monna gegia the colour rising in her wrinkled cheeks since the battle of monte aperto thou hast never been well washed of that shed by thee and thy confederates and how could ye for the arno has never since run clear of the blood then spilt and if the sea were red with that blood still while there is any of the guelphs to spill i am ready to spill it were it not for thee thou dost well to mention monte aperto and thou wouldst do better to remember over whom its grass now grows peace cincolo a mothers heart has more memory in it than thou thinkest and i well recollect who spurned me as i knelt and dragged my only child but sixteen years of age to die in the cause of that misbeliever manfred let us indeed speak no more woe was the day when i married thee but those were happy times when there was neither guelph nor ghibellinethey will never return neveruntil as thou sayest the arno run clear of the blood shed on its banksnever while i can pierce the heart of a guelphnever till both parties are cold under one bier and thou and i cincolo are two old fools and shall be more at peace under ground than above it rank guelph as thou art i married thee before i was a ghibelline so now i must eat from the same platter with the enemy of manfred and make shoes for guelphs instead of following the fortunes of corradino and sending them my battle axe in my hand to buy their shoes in bologna hush hush good man talk not so loud of thy party hearest thou not that some one knocks cincolo went to open the door with the air of a man who thinks himself ill used at being interrupted in his discourse and is disposed to be angry with the intruder however innocent he might be of any intention of breaking in upon his eloquent complaint the appearance of his visitor calmed his indignant feelings he was a youth whose countenance and person showed that he could not be more than sixteen but there was a self possession in his demeanour and a dignity in his physiognomy that belonged to a more advanced age his figure was slight and his countenance though beautiful was pale as monumental marble the thick and curling locks of his chestnut hair clustered over his brow and round his fair throat his cap was drawn far down on his forehead cincolo was about to usher him with deference into his humble room but the youth stayed him with his hand and uttered the words swabia cavalieri the words by which the ghibellines were accustomed to recognise each other he continued in a low and hurried tone your wife is within she is enough although i am a stranger to you i come from an old friend harbour me until nightfall we will then go out and i will explain to you the motives of my intrusion call me ricciardo de rossini of milan travelling to rome i leave florence this evening having said these words without giving cincolo time to reply he motioned that they should enter the room monna gegia had fixed her eyes on the door from the moment he had opened it with a look of impatient curiosity when she saw the youth enter she could not refrain from exclaiming gesu mariaso different was he from any one she had expected to see a friend from milan said cincolo more likely from lucca replied his wife gazing on her visitant you are doubtless one of the banished men and you are more daring than wise to enter this town however if you be not a spy you are safe with me ricciardo smiled and thanked her in a low sweet voice if you do not turn me out he said i shall remain under your roof nearly all the time i remain in florence and i leave it soon after dusk gegia again gazed on her guest nor did cincolo scrutinize him with less curiosity his black cloth tunic reached below his knees and was confined by a black leather girdle at the waist he had on trousers of coarse scarlet stuff over which were drawn short boots a cloak of common foxs fur unlined hung from his shoulder but although his dress was thus simple it was such as was then worn by the young florentine nobility at that time the italians were simple in their private habits the french army led by charles danjou into italy first introduced luxury into the palaces of the cisalpines manfred was a magnificent prince but it was his saintly rival who was the author of that trifling foppery of dress and ornaments which degrades a nation and is a sure precursor of their downfall but of ricciardohis countenance had all the regularity of a grecian head and his blue eyes shaded by very long dark eyelashes were soft yet full of expression when he looked up the heavy lids as it were unveiled the gentle light beneath and then again closed over them as shading what was too brilliant to behold his lips expressed the deepest sensibility and something perhaps of timidity had not the placid confidence of his demeanour forbidden such an idea his host and hostess were at first silent but he asked some natural questions about the buildings of their city and by degrees led them into discourse when mid day struck cincolo looked towards his pot of minestra and ricciardo followed his look asked if that was not the dinner you must entertain me he said for i have not eaten to day a table was drawn near the window and the minestra poured out into one plate was placed in the middle of it a spoon was given to each and a jug of wine filled from a barrel ricciardo looked at the two old people and seemed somewhat to smile at the idea of eating from the same plate with them he ate however though sparingly and drank of the wine though with still greater moderation cincolo however under pretence of serving his guest filled his jug a second time and was about to rise for the third measure when ricciardo placing his small white hand on his arm said are you a german my friend that you cease not after so many draughts i have heard that you florentines were a sober people cincolo was not much pleased with this reproof but he felt that it was timely so conceding the point he sat down again and somewhat heated with what he had already drank he asked his guest the news from germany and what hopes for the good cause gegia bridled at these words and ricciardo replied many reports are abroad and high hopes entertained especially in the north of italy for the success of our expedition corradino is arrived at genoa and it is hoped that although the ranks of his army were much thinned by the desertion of his german troops they will be quickly filled by italians braver and truer than those foreigners who strangers to our soil could not fight for his cause with our ardour and how does he bear himself as beseems one of the house of swabia and the nephew of manfred he is inexperienced and young he is not more than sixteen his mother would hardly consent to this expedition but wept at the fear of all he might endure for he has been nursed in every luxury and habituated to the tender care of a woman who although she be a princess has waited on him with anxious solicitude but corradino is of good heart docile but courageous obedient to his wiser friends gentle to his inferiors but noble of soul the spirit of manfred seems to animate his unfolding mind and surely if that glorious prince now enjoys the reward of his surpassing virtues he looks down with joy and approbation on him who is i trust destined to fill his throne the enthusiasm with which ricciardo spoke suffused his pale countenance with a slight blush while his eyes swam in the lustre of the dew that filled them gegia was little pleased with this harangue but curiosity kept her silent while her husband proceeded to question his guest you seem to be well acquainted with corradino i saw him at milan and was closely connected with his most intimate friend there as i have said he has arrived at genoa and perhaps has even now landed at pisa he will find many friends in that town every man there will be his friend but during his journey southward he will have to contend with our florentine army commanded by the marshals of the usurper charles and assisted by his troops charles himself has left us and is gone to naples to prepare for this war but he is detested there as a tyrant and a robber and corradino will be received in the regno as a saviour so that if he once surmount the obstacles which oppose his entrance i do not doubt his success and trust that he will be crowned within a month at rome and the week after sit on the throne of his ancestors in naples and who will crown him cried gegia unable to contain herself italy contains no heretic base enough to do such a deed unless it be a jew or he send to constantinople for a greek or to egypt for a mohammedan cursed may the race of the frederics ever be thrice cursed one who has affinity to the miscreant manfred and little do you please me young man by holding such discourse in my house cincolo looked at ricciardo as if he feared that so violent a partisan for the house of swabia would be irritated at his wifes attack but he was looking on the aged woman with a regard of the most serene benignity no contempt even was mingled with the gentle smile that played round his lips i will restrain myself he said and turning to cincolo he conversed on more general subjects describing the various cities of italy that he had visited discussing their modes of government and relating anecdotes concerning their inhabitants with an air of experience that contrasted with his youthful appearance greatly impressed cincolo who looked on him at once with admiration and respect evening came on the sound of bells died away after the ave maria had ceased to ring but the distant sound of music was wafted to them by the night air ricciardo was about to address cincolo when a knocking at the gate interrupted him it was buzeccha the saracen a famous chess player who was used to parade about under the colonnades of the duomo and challenge the young nobles to play and sometimes much stress was laid on these games and the gain and loss became the talk of florence buzeccha was a tall and ungainly man with all that good natured consequence of manner which the fame he had acquired by his proficiency in so trifling a science and the familiarity with which he was permitted to treat those superior to him in rank who were pleased to measure their forces with him might well bestow he was beginning with eh messere when perceiving ricciardo he cried who have we here a friend to good men replied ricciardo smiling then by mahomet thou art my friend my stripling thou shouldst be a saracen by thy speech said ricciardo and through the help of the prophet so am i one who in manfreds timebut no more of that we wont talk of manfred eh monna gegia i am buzeccha the chess player at your service messer lo forestiere the introduction thus made they began to talk of the procession of the day after a while buzeccha introduced his favourite subject of chess playing he recounted some wonderfully good strokes he had achieved and related to ricciardo how before the palagio del popolo in the presence of count guido novelle de giudi then vicare of the city he had played an hour at three chess boards with three of the best chess players in florence playing two by memory and one by sight and out of three games which made the board he had won two this account was wound up by a proposal to play with his host thou art a hard headed fellow cincolo and make better play than the nobles i would swear that thou thinkest of chess only as thou cobblest thy shoes every hole of your awl is a square of the board every stitch a move and a finished pair paid for checkmate to your adversary eh cincolo bring out the field of battle man ricciardo interposed i leave florence in two hours and before i go messer cincolo promised to conduct me to the piazza del duomo plenty of time good youth cried buzeccha arranging his men i only claim one game and my games never last more than a quarter of an hour and then we will both escort you and you shall dance a set into the bargain with a black eyed houri all nazarine as thou art so stand out of my light good youth and shut the window if you have heeding that the torch flare not so ricciardo seemed amused by the authoritative tone of the chess player he shut the window and trimmed the torch which stuck against the wall was the only light they had and stood by the table overlooking the game monna gegia had replaced the pot for supper and sat somewhat uneasily as if she were displeased that her guest did not talk with her cincolo and buzeccha were deeply intent on their game when a knock was heard at the door cincolo was about to rise and open it but ricciardo saying do not disturb yourself opened it himself with the manner of one who does humble offices as if ennobling them so that no one action can be more humble to them than another the visitant was welcomed by gegia alone with ah messer beppe this is kind on may day night ricciardo glanced slightly on him and then resumed his stand by the players there was little in messer beppe to attract a favourable regard he was short thin and dry his face long drawn and liny his eyes deep set and scowling his lips straight his nose hooked and his head covered by a close skull cap his hair cut close all round he sat down near gegia and began to discourse in a whining servile voice complimenting her on her good looks launching forth into praise of the magnificence of certain guelph florentines and concluded by declaring that he was hungry and tired hungry beppe said gegia that should have been your first word friend cincolo wilt thou give thy guest to eat cincolo art thou deaf art thou blind dost thou not hear wilt thou not seehere is messer giuseppe de bosticchi cincolo slowly his eyes still fixed on the board was about to rise but the name of the visitant seemed to have the effect of magic on ricciardo bosticchi he criedgiuseppe bosticchi i did not expect to find that man beneath thy roof cincolo all guelph as thy wife is for she also has eaten of the bread of elisei farewell thou wilt find me in the street below follow me quickly he was about to go but bosticchi placed himself before the door saying in a tone whose whine expressed mingled rage and servility in what have i offended this young gentleman will he not tell me my offence dare not to stop my way cried ricciardo passing his hand before his eyes nor force me again to look on thee begone cincolo stopped him thou art too hasty and far too passionate my noble guest said he however this man may have offended thee thou art too violent violent cried ricciardo almost suffocated by passionate emotion ay draw thy knife and show the blood of arrigo dei elisei with which it is still stained a dead silence followed bosticchi slunk out of the room ricciardo hid his face in his hands and wept but soon he calmed his passion and said this is indeed childish pardon me that man is gone excuse and forget my violence resume thy game cincolo but conclude it quickly for time gains on us hark an hour of night sounds from the campanile the game is already concluded said buzeccha sorrowfully thy cloak overthrew the best checkmate this head ever plannedso god forgive thee checkmate cried the indignant cincolocheckmate and my queen mowing you down rank and file let us begone exclaimed ricciardo messer buzeccha you will play out your game with monna gegia cincolo will return ere long so taking his host by the arm he drew him out of the room and descended the narrow high stairs with the air of one to whom those stairs were not unknown when in the street he slackened his pace and first looking round to assure himself that none overheard their conversation he addressed cincolo pardon me my dear friend i am hasty and the sight of that man made every drop of my blood cry aloud in my veins but i do not come here to indulge in private sorrows or private revenge and my design ought alone to engross me it is necessary for me to see speedily and secretly messer guielmo lostendardo the neapolitan commander i bear a message to him from the countess elizabeth the mother of corradino and i have some hope that its import may induce him to take at least a neutral part during the impending conflict i have chosen you cincolo to aid me in this for not only you are of that little note in your town that you may act for me without attracting observation but you are brave and true and i may confide to your known worth lostendardo resides at the palagio del governo when i enter its doors i am in the hands of my enemies and its dungeons may alone know the secret of my destiny i hope better things but if after two hours i do not appear or let you hear of my welfare carry this packet to corradino at pisa you will then learn who i am and if you feel any indignation at my fate let that feeling attach you still more strongly to the cause for which i live and die as ricciardo spoke he still walked on and cincolo observed that without his guidance he directed his steps towards the palagio del governo i do not understand this said the old man by what argument unless you bring one from the other world do you hope to induce messer guielmo to aid corradino he is so bitter an enemy of manfred that although that prince is dead yet when he mentions his name he grasps the air as it were a dagger i have heard him with horrible imprecations curse the whole house of swabia a tremor shook the frame of ricciardo but he replied lostendardo was once the firmest support of that house and the friend of manfred strange circumstances gave birth in his mind to this unnatural hatred and he became a traitor but perhaps now that manfred is in paradise the youth the virtues and the inexperience of corradino may inspire him with more generous feelings and reawaken his ancient faith at least i must make this last trial this cause is too holy too sacred to admit of common forms of reasoning or action the nephew of manfred must sit upon the throne of his ancestors and to achieve that i will endure what i am about to endure they entered the palace messer guielmo was carousing in the great hall bear this ring to him good cincolo and say that i wait be speedy that my courage my life do not desert me at the moment of trial cincolo casting one more inquisitive glance on his extraordinary companion obeyed his orders while the youth leant against one of the pillars of the court and passionately cast up his eyes to the clear firmament oh ye stars he cried in a smothered voice ye are eternal let my purpose my will be as constant as ye then more calm he folded his arms in his cloak and with strong inward struggle endeavoured to repress his emotion several servants approached him and bade him follow them again he looked at the sky and said manfred and then he walked on with slow but firm steps they led him through several halls and corridors to a large apartment hung with tapestry and well lighted by numerous torches the marble of the floor reflected their glare and the arched roof echoed the footsteps of one who paced the apartment as ricciardo entered it was lostendardo he made a sign that the servants should retire the heavy door closed behind them and ricciardo stood alone with messer guielmo his countenance pale but composed his eyes cast down as in expectation not in fear and but for the convulsive motion of his lips you would have guessed that every faculty was almost suspended by intense agitation lostendardo approached he was a man in the prime of life tall and athletic he seemed capable with a single exertion to crush the frail being of ricciardo every feature of his countenance spoke of the struggle of passions and the terrible egotism of one who would sacrifice even himself to the establishment of his will his black eyebrows were scattered his grey eyes deep set and scowling his look at once stern and haggard a smile seemed never to have disturbed the settled scorn which his lips expressed his high forehead already becoming bald was marked by a thousand contradictory lines his voice was studiously restrained as he said wherefore do you bring that ring ricciardo looked up and met his eye which glanced fire as he exclaimed despinahe seized her hand with a giants grasp i have prayed for this night and day and thou art now here nay do not struggle you are mine for by my salvation i swear that thou shalt never again escape me despina replied calmly thou mayest well believe that in thus placing myself in thy power i do not dread any injury thou canst inflict upon me or i were not here i do not fear thee for i do not fear death loosen then thy hold and listen to me i come in the name of those virtues that were once thine i come in the name of all noble sentiment generosity and ancient faith and i trust that in listening to me your heroic nature will second my voice and that lostendardo will no longer rank with those whom the good and great never name but to condemn lostendardo appeared to attend little to what she said he gazed on her with triumph and malignant pride and if he still held her his motive appeared rather the delight he felt in displaying his power over her than any fear that she would escape you might read in her pale cheek and glazed eye that if she feared it was herself alone that she mistrusted that her design lifted her above mortal dread and that she was as impassive as the marble she resembled to any event that did not either advance or injure the object for which she came they were both silent until lostendardo leading her to a seat and then standing opposite to her his arms folded every feature dilated by triumph and his voice sharpened by agitation he said well speak what wouldst thou with me i come to request that if you cannot be induced to assist prince corradino in the present struggle you will at least stand neutral and not oppose his advance to the kingdom of his ancestors lostendardo laughed the vaulted roof repeated the sound but the harsh echo though it resembled the sharp cry of an animal of prey whose paw is on the heart of its enemy was not so discordant and dishuman as the laugh itself how he asked dost thou pretend to induce me to comply this daggerand he touched the hilt of one that was half concealed in his vestureis yet stained by the blood of manfred ere long it will be sheathed in the heart of that foolish boy despina conquered the feeling of horror these words inspired and replied will you give a few minutes patient hearing i will give you a few minutes hearing and if i be not so patient as in the palagio reale fair despina must excuse me forbearance is not a virtue to which i aspire yes it was in the palagio reale at naples the palace of manfred that you first saw me you were then the bosom friend of manfred selected by him as his confidant and counsellor why did you become a traitor start not at that word if you could hear the united voice of italy and even of those who call themselves your friends they would echo that name why did you thus degrade and belie yourself you call me the cause yet i am most innocent you saw me at the court of your master an attendant on queen sibilla and one who unknown to herself had already parted with her heart her soul her will her entire being an involuntary sacrifice at the shrine of all that is noble and divine in human nature my spirit worshipped manfred as a saint and my pulses ceased to beat when his eye fell upon me i felt this but i knew it not you awoke me from my dream you said that you loved me and you reflected in too faithful a mirror my own emotions i saw myself and shuddered but the profound and eternal nature of my passion saved me i loved manfred i loved the sun because it enlightened him i loved the air that fed him i deified myself for that my heart was the temple in which he resided i devoted myself to sibilla for she was his wife and never in thought or dream degraded the purity of my affection towards him for this you hated him he was ignorant of my passion my heart contained it as a treasure which you having discovered came to rifle you could more easily deprive me of life than my devotion for your king and therefore you were a traitor manfred died and you thought that i had then forgotten him but love would indeed be a mockery if death were not the most barefaced cheat how can he die who is immortalized in my thoughtsmy thoughts that comprehend the universe and contain eternity in their graspings what though his earthly vesture is thrown as a despised weed beside the verde he lives in my soul as lovely as noble as entire as when his voice awoke the mute air nay his life is more entire more true for before that small shrine that encased his spirit was all that existed of him but now he is a part of all things his spirit surrounds me interpenetrates and divided from him during his life his death has united me to him for ever the countenance of lostendardo darkened fearfully when she paused he looked black as the sea before the heavily charged thunder clouds that canopy it dissolve themselves into rain the tempest of passion that arose in his heart seemed too mighty to admit of swift manifestation it came slowly up from the profoundest depths of his soul and emotion was piled upon emotion before the lightning of his anger sped to its destination your arguments eloquent despina he said are indeed unanswerable they work well for your purpose corradino is i hear at pisa you have sharpened my dagger and before the air of another night rust it i may by deeds have repaid your insulting words how far do you mistake me and is praise and love of all heroic excellence insult to you lostendardo when you first knew me i was an inexperienced girl i loved but knew not what love was and circumscribing my passion in narrow bounds i adored the being of manfred as i might love an effigy of stone which when broken has no longer an existence i am now much altered i might before have treated you with disdain or anger but now these base feelings have expired in my heart i am animated but by one feelingan aspiration to another life another state of being all the good depart from this strange earth and i doubt not that when i am sufficiently elevated above human weaknesses it will also be my turn to leave this scene of woe i prepare myself for that moment alone and in endeavouring to fit myself for a union with all the brave generous and wise that once adorned humanity and have now passed from it i consecrate myself to the service of this most righteous cause you wrong me therefore if you think there is aught of disdain in what i say or that any degrading feelings are mingled with my devotion of spirit when i come and voluntarily place myself in your power you can imprison me for ever in the dungeons of this palace as a returned ghibelline and spy and have me executed as a criminal but before you do this pause for your own sake reflect on the choice of glory or ignominy that you are now about to make let your old sentiments of love for the house of swabia have some sway in your heart reflect that as you are the despised enemy so you may become the chosen friend of its last descendant and receive from every heart the praise of having restored corradino to the honours and power to which he was born compare this prince to the hypocritical the bloody and mean spirited charles when manfred died i went to germany and have resided at the court of the countess elizabeth i have therefore been an hourly witness of the great and good qualities of corradino the bravery of his spirit makes him rise above the weakness of youth and inexperience he possesses all the nobility of spirit that belongs to the family of swabia and in addition a purity and gentleness that attracts the respect and love of the old and wary courtiers of frederic and conrad you are brave and would be generous did not the fury of your passions like a consuming fire destroy in their violence every generous sentiment how then can you become the tool of charles his scowling eyes and sneering lips betoken the selfishness of his mind avarice cruelty meanness and artifice are the qualities that characterize him and render him unworthy of the majesty he usurps let him return to provence and reign with paltry despotism over the luxurious and servile french the free born italians require another lord they are not fit to bow to one whose palace is the change house of money lenders whose generals are usurers whose courtiers are milliners or monks and who basely vows allegiance to the enemy of freedom and virtue clement the murderer of manfred their king like them should be clothed in the armour of valour and simplicity his ornaments his shield and spear his treasury the possessions of his subjects his army their unshaken lover charles will treat you as a tool corradino as a friend charles will make you the detested tyrant of a groaning province corradino the governor of a prosperous and happy people i cannot tell by your manner if what i have said has in any degree altered your determination i cannot forget the scenes that passed between us at naples i might then have been disdainful i am not so now your execrations of manfred excited every angry feeling in my mind but as i have said all but the feeling of love expired in my heart when manfred died and methinks that where love is excellence must be its companion you said you loved me and though in other times that love was twin brother to hatethough then poor prisoner in your heart jealousy rage contempt and cruelty were its handmaidsyet if it were love methinks that its divinity must have purified your heart from baser feelings and now that i the bride of death am removed from your sphere gentler feelings may awaken in your bosom and you may incline mildly to my voice if indeed you loved me will you not now be my friend shall we not hand in hand pursue the same career return to your ancient faith and now that death and religion have placed the seal upon the past let manfreds spirit looking down behold his repentant friend the firm ally of his successor the best and last scion of the house of swabia she ceased for the glare of savage triumph which as a rising fire at night time enlightened with growing and fearful radiance the face of lostendardo made her pause in her appeal he did not reply but when she was silent he quitted the attitude in which he had stood immovably opposite to her and pacing the hall with measured steps his head declined he seemed to ruminate on some project could it be that he weighed her reasonings if he hesitated the side of generosity and old fidelity would certainly prevail yet she dared not hope her heart beat fast she would have knelt but she feared to move lest any motion should disturb his thoughts and curb the flow of good feeling which she fondly hoped had arisen within him she looked up and prayed silently as she sat notwithstanding the glare of the torches the beams of one small star struggled through the dark window pane her eye resting on it her thoughts were at once elevated to the eternity and space which that star symbolized it seemed to her the spirit of manfred and she inwardly worshipped it as she prayed that it would shed its benign influence on the soul of lostendardo some minutes elapsed in this fearful silence and then he approached her despina allow me to reflect on your words to morrow i will answer you you will remain in this palace until the morning and then you shall see and judge of my repentance and returning faith he spoke with studious gentleness despina could not see his face for the lights shone behind him when she looked up to reply the little star twinkled just above his head and seemed with its gentle lustre to reassure her our minds when highly wrought are strangely given to superstition and despina lived in a superstitious age she thought that the star bade her comply and assured her of protection from heavenfrom where else could she expect it she said therefore i consent only let me request that you acquaint the man who gave you my ring that i am safe or he will fear for me i will do as you desire and i will confide myself to your care i cannot dare not fear you if you would betray me still i trust in the heavenly saints that guard humanity her countenance was so calmit beamed with so angelic a self devotion and a belief in good that lostendardo dared not look on her for one momentas she having ceased to speak gazed upon the starhe felt impelled to throw himself at her feet to confess the diabolical scheme he had forged and to commit himself body and soul to her guidance to obey to serve to worship her the impulse was momentary the feeling of revenge returned on him from the moment she had rejected him the fire of rage had burned in his heart consuming all healthy feeling all human sympathies and gentleness of soul he had sworn never to sleep on a bed or to drink aught but water until his first cup of wine was mingled with the blood of manfred he had fulfilled this vow a strange alteration had worked within him from the moment he had drained that unholy cup the spirit not of a man but of a devil seemed to live within him urging him to crime from which his long protracted hope of more complete revenge had alone deterred him but despina was now in his power and it seemed to him as if fate had preserved him so long only that he might now wreak his full rage upon her when she spoke of love he thought how from that he might extract pain he formed his plan and this slight human weakness now conquered he bent his thoughts to its completion yet he feared to stay longer with her so he quitted her saying that he would send attendants who would show her an apartment where she might repose he left her and several hours passed but no one came the torches burnt low and the stars of heaven could now with twinkling beams conquer their feebler light one by one these torches went out and the shadows of the high windows of the hall before invisible were thrown upon its marble pavement despina looked upon the shade at first unconsciously until she found herself counting one two three the shapes of the iron bars that lay so placidly on the stone those grates are thick she said this room would be a large but secure dungeon as by inspiration she now felt that she was a prisoner no change no word had intervened since she had walked fearlessly in the room believing herself free but now no doubt of her situation occurred to her mind heavy chains seemed to fall around her the air to feel thick and heavy as that of a prison and the star beams that had before cheered her became the dreary messengers of fearful danger to herself and of the utter defeat of all the hopes she had dared nourish of success to her beloved cause cincolo waited first with impatience and then with anxiety for the return of the youthful stranger he paced up and down before the gates of the palace hour after hour passed on the stars arose and descended and ever and anon meteors shot along the sky they were not more frequent than they always are during a clear summer night in italy but they appeared strangely numerous to cincolo and portentous of change and calamity midnight struck and at that moment a procession of monks passed bearing a corpse and chanting a solemn de profundis cincolo felt a cold tremor shake his limbs when he reflected how ill an augury this was for the strange adventurer he had guided to that palace the sombre cowls of the priests their hollow voices and the dark burden they carried augmented his agitation even to terror without confessing the cowardice to himself he was possessed with fear lest he should be included in the evil destiny that evidently awaited his companion cincolo was a brave man he had often been foremost in a perilous assault but the most courageous among us sometimes feel our hearts fail within us at the dread of unknown and fated danger he was struck with paniche looked after the disappearing lights of the procession and listened to their fading voices his knees shook a cold perspiration stood on his brow until unable to resist the impulse he began slowly to withdraw himself from the palace of government and to quit the circle of danger which seemed to hedge him in if he remained on that spot he had hardly quitted his post by the gate of the palace when he saw lights issue from it attendant on a company of men some of whom were armed as appeared from the reflection their lances heads cast and some of them carried a litter hung with black and closely drawn cincolo was rooted to the spot he could not render himself any reason for his belief but he felt convinced that the stranger youth was there about to be carried out to death impelled by curiosity and anxiety he followed the party as they went towards the porta romana they were challenged by the sentinels at the gate they gave the word and passed cincolo dared not follow but he was agitated by fear and compassion he remembered the packet confided to his care he dared not draw it from his bosom lest any guelph should be near to overlook and discover that it was addressed to corradino he could not read but he wished to look at the arms of the seal to see whether they bore the imperial ensigns he returned back to the palagio del governo all there was dark and silent he walked up and down before the gates looking up at the windows but no sign of life appeared he could not tell why he was thus agitated but he felt as if all his future peace depended on the fate of this stranger youth he thought of gegia her helplessness and age but he could not resist the impulse that impelled him and he resolved that very night to commence his journey to pisa to deliver the packet to learn who the stranger was and what hopes he might entertain for his safety he returned home that he might inform gegia of his journey this was a painful task but he could not leave her in doubt he ascended his narrow stairs with trepidation at the head of them a lamp twinkled before a picture of the virgin evening after evening it burnt there guarding through its influence his little household from all earthly or supernatural dangers the sight of it inspired him with courage he said an ave maria before it and then looking around him to assure himself that no spy stood on the narrow landing place he drew the packet from his bosom and examined the seal all italians in those days were conversant in heraldry since from ensigns of the shields of the knights they learned better than from their faces or persons to what family and party they belonged but it required no great knowledge for cincolo to decipher these arms he had known them from his childhood they were those of the elisei the family to whom he had been attached as a partisan during all these civil contests arrigo de elisei had been his patron and his wife had nursed his only daughter in those happy days when there was neither guelph nor ghibelline the sight of these arms reawakened all his anxiety could this youth belong to that house the seal showed that he really did and this discovery confirmed his determination of making every exertion to save him and inspired him with sufficient courage to encounter the remonstrances and fears of monna gegia he unlocked his door the old dame was asleep in her chair but awoke as he entered she had slept only to refresh her curiosity and she asked a thousand questions in a breath to which cincolo did not reply he stood with his arms folded looking at the fire irresolute how to break the subject of his departure monna gegia continued to talk after you went we held a consultation concerning this hot brained youth of this morning i buzeccha beppe de bosticchi who returned and monna lissa from the mercato nuovo we all agreed that he must be one of two persons and be it one or the other if he have not quitted florence the stinchi will be his habitation by sunrise eh cincolo man you do not speak where did you part with your prince footnote the name of the common prison at florence prince gegia are you madwhat prince nay he is either a prince or a baker either corradino himself or ricciardo the son of messer tommaso de manelli he that lived oth arno and baked for all that sesto when count guido de giudi was vicario by this token that messer tommaso went to milan with ubaldo de gargalandi and ricciardo who went with his father must now be sixteen he had the fame of kneading with as light a hand as his father but he liked better to follow arms with the gargalandi he was a fair likely youth they said and so to say the truth was our youngster of this morning but monna lissa will have it that it must be corradino himself cincolo listened as if the gossip of two old women could unravel his riddle he even began to doubt whether the last conjecture extravagant as it was had not hit the truth every circumstance forbade such an idea but he thought of the youth and exceeding beauty of the stranger and he began to doubt there was none among the elisei who answered to his appearance the flower of their youth had fallen at monte aperto the eldest of the new generation was but ten the other males of that house were of a mature age gegia continued to talk of the anger that beppe de bosticchi evinced at being accused of the murder of arrigo de elisei if he had done that deed she cried never more should he have stood on my hearth but he swore his innocence and truly poor man it would be a sin not to believe him why if the stranger were not an elisei should he have shown such horror on viewing the supposed murderer of the head of that family cincolo turned from the fire he examined whether his knife hung safely in his girdle and he exchanged his sandal like shoes for stronger boots of common undressed fur this last act attracted the attentions of gegia what are you about good man she cried this is no hour to change your dress but to come to bed to night you will not speak but to morrow i hope to get it all out from you what are you about i am about to leave you my dear gegia and heaven bless and take care of you i am going to pisa gegia uttered a shriek and was about to remonstrate with great volubility while the tears rolled down her aged cheeks tears also filled the eyes of cincolo as he said i do not go for the cause you suspect i do not go into the army of corradino though my heart will be with it i go but to carry a letter and will return without delay you will never return cried the old woman the commune will never let you enter the gates of this town again if you set foot in that traitorous pisa but you shall not go i will raise the neighbours i will declare you mad gegia no more of this here is all the money i have before i go i will send your cousin nunziata to you i must go it is not the ghibelline cause or corradino that obliges me to risk your ease and comforts but the life of one of the elisei is at stake and if i can save him would you have me rest here and afterwards curse you and the hour when i was born what is he but no there is none among the elisei so young as he and none so lovely except her whom these arms carried when an infantbut she is a female no no this is a tale trumped up to deceive me and gain my consent but you shall never have it mind that you will never have it and i prophesy that if you do go your journey will be the death of both of us she wept bitterly cincolo kissed her aged cheek and mingled his tears with hers and then recommending her to the care of the virgin and the saints he quitted her while grief choked her utterance the name of the elisei had deprived her of all energy to resist his purpose it was four in the morning before the gates of florence were opened and cincolo could leave the city at first he availed himself of the carts of the contadini to advance on his journey but as he drew near pisa all modes of conveyance ceased and he was obliged to take by roads and act cautiously not to fall into the hands of the florentine outposts or of some fierce ghibelline who might suspect him and have him carried before the podesta of the village for if once suspected and searched the packet addressed to corradino would convict him and he would pay for his temerity with his life having arrived at vico pisano he found a troop of pisan horse there on guard he was known to many of the soldiers and he obtained a conveyance for pisa but it was night before he arrived he gave the ghibelline watchword and was admitted within the gates he asked for prince corradino he was in the city at the palace of the lanfranchi he crossed the arno and was admitted into the palace by the soldiers who guarded the door corradino had just returned from a successful skirmish in the lucchese states and was reposing but when count gherardo doneratico his principal attendant saw the seal of the packet he immediately ushered the bearer into a small room where the prince lay on a foxs skin thrown upon the pavement the mind of cincolo had been so bewildered by the rapidity of the events of the preceding night by fatigue and want of sleep that he had overwrought himself to believe that the stranger youth was indeed corradino and when he had heard that that prince was in pisa by a strange disorder of ideas he still imagined that he and ricciardo were the same that the black litter was a phantom and his fears ungrounded the first sight of corradino his fair hair and round saxon features destroyed this idea it was replaced by a feeling of deep anguish when count gherardo announcing him said one who brings a letter from madonna despina dei elisei waits upon your highness the old man sprang forward uncontrolled by the respect he would otherwise have felt for one of so high lineage as corradino from despina did you say from her oh unsay your words not from my beloved lost foster child tears rolled down his cheeks corradino a youth of fascinating gentleness attempted to reassure him oh my gracious lord cried cincolo open that packet and see if it be from my blessed childif in the disguise of ricciardo i led her to destruction he wrung his hands corradino pale as death with fear for the destiny of his lovely and adventurous friend broke the seal the packet contained an inner envelope without any direction and a letter which corradino read while horror convulsed every feature he gave it to gherardo it is indeed from her she says that the bearer can relate all that the world will probably know of her fate and you old man who weep so bitterly you to whom my best and lovely friend refers me tell me what you know of her cincolo told his story in broken accents may these eyes be for ever blinded he cried when he had concluded that knew not despina in those soft looks and heavenly smiles dotard that i am when my wife railed at your family and princely self and the sainted manfred why did i not read her secret in her forbearance would she have forgiven those words in any but her who had nursed her infancy and been a mother to her when madonna pia died and when she taxed bosticchi with her fathers death i blind fool did not see the spirit of the elisei in her eyes my lord i have but one favour to ask you let me hear her letter that i may judge from that what hopes remainbut there are nonenone read to him my dear count said the prince i will not fear as he fears i dare not fear that one so lovely and beloved is sacrificed for my worthless cause gherardo read the letter cincolo de becari my foster father will deliver this letter into your hands my respected and dear corradino the countess elizabeth has urged me to my present undertaking i hope nothing from it except to labour for your cause and perhaps through its event to quit somewhat earlier a life which is but a grievous trial to my weak mind i go to endeavour to arouse the feelings of fidelity and generosity in the soul of the traitor lostendardo i go to place myself in his hands and i do not hope to escape from them again corradino my last prayer will be for your success mourn not for one who goes home after a long and weary exile burn the enclosed packet without opening it the mother of god protect thee despina corradino had wept as this epistle was reading but then starting up he said to revenge or death we may yet save her a blight had fallen on the house of swabia and all their enterprises were blasted beloved by their subjects noble and with every advantage of right on their side except those the church bestowed they were defeated in every attempt to defend themselves against a foreigner and a tyrant who ruled by force of arms and those in the hands of a few only over an extensive and warlike territory the young and daring corradino was also fated to perish in this contest having overcome the troops of his adversary in tuscany he advanced towards his kingdom with the highest hopes his arch enemy pope clement iv had shut himself up in viterbo and was guarded by a numerous garrison corradino passed in triumph and hope before the town and proudly drew out his troops before it to display to the holy father his forces and humiliate him by this show of success the cardinals who beheld the lengthened line and good order of the army hastened to the papal palace clement was in his oratory praying the frightened monks with pale looks related how the excommunicated heretic dared to menace the town where the holy father himself resided adding that if the insult were carried to the pitch of an assault it might prove dangerous warfare the pope smiled contemptuously do not fear he said the projects of these men will dissipate in smoke he then went on the ramparts and saw corradino and frederic of austria who defiled the line of knights in the plain below he watched them for a time then turning to his cardinals he said they are victims who permit themselves to be led to sacrifice his words were a prophecy notwithstanding the first successes of corradino and the superior numbers of his army he was defeated by the artifice of charles in a pitched battle he escaped from the field and with a few friends arrived at a tower called asturi which belonged to the family of frangipani of rome here he hired a vessel embarked and put out to sea directing his course for sicily which having rebelled against charles would he hoped receive him with joy they were already under weigh when one of the family of the frangipani seeing a vessel filled with germans making all sail from shore suspected that they were fugitives from the battle of taglicozzo he followed them in other vessels and took them all prisoners the person of corradino was a rich prey for him he delivered him into the hands of his rival and was rewarded by the donation of a fief near benevento the dastardly spirit of charles instigated him to the basest revenge and the same tragedy was acted on those shores which has been renewed in our days a daring and illustrious prince was sacrificed with the mock forms of justice at the sanguinary altar of tyranny and hypocrisy corradino was tried one of his judges alone a provenal dared to condemn him and he paid with his life the forfeit of his baseness for scarcely had he solitary among his fellows pronounced the sentence of death against this prince than robert of flanders the brother in law of charles himself struck him on the breast with a staff crying it behoves not thee wretch to condemn to death so noble and worthy a knight the judge fell dead in the presence of the king who dared not avenge his creature on the th of october corradino and his friends were led out to die in the market place of naples by the seaside charles was present with all his court and an immense multitude surrounded the triumphant king and his more royal adversary about to suffer an ignominious death the funereal procession approached its destination corradino agitated but controlling his agitation was drawn in an open car after him came a close litter hung with black with no sign to tell who was within the duke of austria and several other illustrious victims followed the guard that conducted them to the scaffold was headed by lostendardo a malicious triumph laughed in his eyes and he rode near the litter looking from time to time first at it and then at corradino with the dark look of a tormenting fiend the procession stopped at the foot of the scaffold and corradino looked at the flashing light which every now and then arose from vesuvius and threw its reflection on the sea the sun had not yet risen but the halo of its approach illuminated the bay of naples its mountains and its islands the summits of the distant hills of bai gleamed with its first beams corradino thought by the time those rays arrive here and shadows are cast from the persons of these menprinces and peasantsaround me my living spirit will be shadowless then he turned his eyes on the companions of his fate and for the first time he saw the silent and dark litter that accompanied them at first he thought it is my coffin but then he recollected the disappearance of despina and would have sprang towards it his guards stopped him he looked up and his glance met that of lostendardo who smileda smile of dread but the feeling of religion which had before calmed him again descended on him he thought that her sufferings as well as his would soon be over they were already over and the silence of the grave is upon those events which had occurred since cincolo beheld her carried out of florence until now that she was led by her fierce enemy to behold the death of the nephew of manfred she must have endured much for when as corradino advanced to the front of the scaffold the litter being placed opposite to it lostendardo ordered the curtains to be withdrawn the white hand that hung inanimate from the side was thin as a winter leaf and her fair face pillowed by the thick knots of her dark hair was sunken and ashy pale while you could see the deep blue of her eyes struggle through the closed eyelids she was still in the attire in which she had presented herself at the house of cincolo perhaps her tormentor thought that her appearance as a youth would attract less compassion than if a lovely woman were thus dragged to so unnatural a scene corradino was kneeling and praying when her form was thus exposed he saw her and saw that she was dead about to die himself about pure and innocent to die ignominiously while his base conqueror in pomp and glory was spectator of his death he did not pity those who were at peace his compassion belonged to the living alone and as he arose from his prayer he exclaimed my beloved mother what profound sorrow will the news thou art about to hear cause thee he looked upon the living multitude around him and saw that the hard visaged partisans of the usurper wept he heard the sobs of his oppressed and conquered subjects so he drew his glove from his hand and threw it among the crowd in token that he still held his cause good and submitted his head to the axe during many years after those events lostendardo enjoyed wealth rank and power when suddenly while at the summit of glory and prosperity he withdrew from the world took the vows of a severe order in a convent in one of the desolate and unhealthy plains by the sea shore in calabria and after having gained the character of a saint through a life of self inflicted torture he died murmuring the names of corradino manfred and despina viii the mortal immortal july this is a memorable anniversary for me on it i complete my three hundred and twenty third year the wandering jewcertainly not more than eighteen centuries have passed over his head in comparison with him i am a very young immortal am i then immortal this is a question which i have asked myself by day and night for now three hundred and three years and yet cannot answer it i detected a grey hair amidst my brown locks this very daythat surely signifies decay yet it may have remained concealed there for three hundred yearsfor some persons have become entirely white headed before twenty years of age i will tell my story and my reader shall judge for me i will tell my story and so contrive to pass some few hours of a long eternity become so wearisome to me for ever can it be to live for ever i have heard of enchantments in which the victims were plunged into a deep sleep to wake after a hundred years as fresh as ever i have heard of the seven sleepersthus to be immortal would not be so burthensome but oh the weight of never ending timethe tedious passage of the still succeeding hours how happy was the fabled nourjahadbut to my task all the world has heard of cornelius agrippa his memory is as immortal as his arts have made me all the world has also heard of his scholar who unawares raised the foul fiend during his masters absence and was destroyed by him the report true or false of this accident was attended with many inconveniences to the renowned philosopher all his scholars at once deserted himhis servants disappeared he had no one near him to put coals on his ever burning fires while he slept or to attend to the changeful colours of his medicines while he studied experiment after experiment failed because one pair of hands was insufficient to complete them the dark spirits laughed at him for not being able to retain a single mortal in his service i was then very youngvery poorand very much in love i had been for about a year the pupil of cornelius though i was absent when this accident took place on my return my friends implored me not to return to the alchymists abode i trembled as i listened to the dire tale they told i required no second warning and when cornelius came and offered me a purse of gold if i would remain under his roof i felt as if satan himself tempted me my teeth chatteredmy hair stood on endi ran off as fast as my trembling knees would permit my failing steps were directed whither for two years they had every evening been attracteda gently bubbling spring of pure living water beside which lingered a dark haired girl whose beaming eyes were fixed on the path i was accustomed each night to tread i cannot remember the hour when i did not love bertha we had been neighbours and playmates from infancyher parents like mine were of humble life yet respectableour attachment had been a source of pleasure to them in an evil hour a malignant fever carried off both her father and mother and bertha became an orphan she would have found a home beneath my paternal roof but unfortunately the old lady of the near castle rich childless and solitary declared her intention to adopt her henceforth bertha was clad in silkinhabited a marble palaceand was looked on as being highly favoured by fortune but in her new situation among her new associates bertha remained true to the friend of her humbler days she often visited the cottage of my father and when forbidden to go thither she would stray towards the neighbouring wood and meet me beside its shady fountain she often declared that she owed no duty to her new protectress equal in sanctity to that which bound us yet still i was too poor to marry and she grew weary of being tormented on my account she had a haughty but an impatient spirit and grew angry at the obstacles that prevented our union we met now after an absence and she had been sorely beset while i was away she complained bitterly and almost reproached me for being poor i replied hastily i am honest if i am poorwere i not i might soon become rich this exclamation produced a thousand questions i feared to shock her by owning the truth but she drew it from me and then casting a look of disdain on me she said you pretend to love and you fear to face the devil for my sake i protested that i had only dreaded to offend herwhile she dwelt on the magnitude of the reward that i should receive thus encouragedshamed by herled on by love and hope laughing at my late fears with quick steps and a light heart i returned to accept the offers of the alchymist and was instantly installed in my office a year passed away i became possessed of no insignificant sum of money custom had banished my fears in spite of the most painful vigilance i had never detected the trace of a cloven foot nor was the studious silence of our abode ever disturbed by demoniac howls i still continued my stolen interviews with bertha and hope dawned on mehopebut not perfect joy for bertha fancied that love and security were enemies and her pleasure was to divide them in my bosom though true of heart she was somewhat of a coquette in manner and i was jealous as a turk she slighted me in a thousand ways yet would never acknowledge herself to be in the wrong she would drive me mad with anger and then force me to beg her pardon sometimes she fancied that i was not sufficiently submissive and then she had some story of a rival favoured by her protectress she was surrounded by silk clad youthsthe rich and gay what chance had the sad robed scholar of cornelius compared with these on one occasion the philosopher made such large demands upon my time that i was unable to meet her as i was wont he was engaged in some mighty work and i was forced to remain day and night feeding his furnaces and watching his chemical preparations bertha waited for me in vain at the fountain her haughty spirit fired at this neglect and when at last i stole out during the few short minutes allotted to me for slumber and hoped to be consoled by her she received me with disdain dismissed me in scorn and vowed that any man should possess her hand rather than he who could not be in two places at once for her sake she would be revenged and truly she was in my dingy retreat i heard that she had been hunting attended by albert hoffer albert hoffer was favoured by her protectress and the three passed in cavalcade before my smoky window methought that they mentioned my name it was followed by a laugh of derision as her dark eyes glanced contemptuously towards my abode jealousy with all its venom and all its misery entered my breast now i shed a torrent of tears to think that i should never call her mine and anon i imprecated a thousand curses on her inconstancy yet still i must stir the fires of the alchymist still attend on the changes of his unintelligible medicines cornelius had watched for three days and nights nor closed his eyes the progress of his alembics was slower than he expected in spite of his anxiety sleep weighed upon his eyelids again and again he threw off drowsiness with more than human energy again and again it stole away his senses he eyed his crucibles wistfully not ready yet he murmured will another night pass before the work is accomplished winzy you are vigilantyou are faithfulyou have slept my boyyou slept last night look at that glass vessel the liquid it contains is of a soft rose colour the moment it begins to change its hue awaken metill then i may close my eyes first it will turn white and then emit golden flashes but wait not till then when the rose colour fades rouse me i scarcely heard the last words muttered as they were in sleep even then he did not quite yield to nature winzy my boy he again said do not touch the vesseldo not put it to your lips it is a philtera philter to cure love you would not cease to love your berthabeware to drink and he slept his venerable head sunk on his breast and i scarce heard his regular breathing for a few minutes i watched the vesselthe rosy hue of the liquid remained unchanged then my thoughts wanderedthey visited the fountain and dwelt on a thousand charming scenes never to be renewednever serpents and adders were in my heart as the word never half formed itself on my lips false girlfalse and cruel never more would she smile on me as that evening she smiled on albert worthless detested woman i would not remain unrevengedshe should see albert expire at her feetshe should die beneath my vengeance she had smiled in disdain and triumphshe knew my wretchedness and her power yet what power had shethe power of exciting my hatemy utter scornmyoh all but indifference could i attain thatcould i regard her with careless eyes transferring my rejected love to one fairer and more true that were indeed a victory a bright flash darted before my eyes i had forgotten the medicine of the adept i gazed on it with wonder flashes of admirable beauty more bright than those which the diamond emits when the suns rays are on it glanced from the surface of the liquid an odour the most fragrant and grateful stole over my sense the vessel seemed one globe of living radiance lovely to the eye and most inviting to the taste the first thought instinctively inspired by the grosser sense was i willi must drink i raised the vessel to my lips it will cure me of loveof torture already i had quaffed half of the most delicious liquor ever tasted by the palate of man when the philosopher stirred i startedi dropped the glassthe fluid flamed and glanced along the floor while i felt corneliuss gripe at my throat as he shrieked aloud wretch you have destroyed the labour of my life the philosopher was totally unaware that i had drunk any portion of his drug his idea was and i gave a tacit assent to it that i had raised the vessel from curiosity and that frighted at its brightness and the flashes of intense light it gave forth i had let it fall i never undeceived him the fire of the medicine was quenchedthe fragrance died awayhe grew calm as a philosopher should under the heaviest trials and dismissed me to rest i will not attempt to describe the sleep of glory and bliss which bathed my soul in paradise during the remaining hours of that memorable night words would be faint and shallow types of my enjoyment or of the gladness that possessed my bosom when i woke i trod airmy thoughts were in heaven earth appeared heaven and my inheritance upon it was to be one trance of delight this it is to be cured of love i thought i will see bertha this day and she will find her lover cold and regardless too happy to be disdainful yet how utterly indifferent to her the hours danced away the philosopher secure that he had once succeeded and believing that he might again began to concoct the same medicine once more he was shut up with his books and drugs and i had a holiday i dressed myself with care i looked in an old but polished shield which served me for a mirror methought my good looks had wonderfully improved i hurried beyond the precincts of the town joy in my soul the beauty of heaven and earth around me i turned my steps towards the castlei could look on its lofty turrets with lightness of heart for i was cured of love my bertha saw me afar off as i came up the avenue i know not what sudden impulse animated her bosom but at the sight she sprung with a light fawn like bound down the marble steps and was hastening towards me but i had been perceived by another person the old high born hag who called herself her protectress and was her tyrant had seen me also she hobbled panting up the terrace a page as ugly as herself held up her train and fanned her as she hurried along and stopped my fair girl with a how now my bold mistress whither so fast back to your cagehawks are abroad bertha clasped her handsher eyes were still bent on my approaching figure i saw the contest how i abhorred the old crone who checked the kind impulses of my berthas softening heart hitherto respect for her rank had caused me to avoid the lady of the castle now i disdained such trivial considerations i was cured of love and lifted above all human fears i hastened forwards and soon reached the terrace how lovely bertha looked her eyes flashing fire her cheeks glowing with impatience and anger she was a thousand times more graceful and charming than ever i no longer lovedoh no i adoredworshippedidolized her she had that morning been persecuted with more than usual vehemence to consent to an immediate marriage with my rival she was reproached with the encouragement that she had shown himshe was threatened with being turned out of doors with disgrace and shame her proud spirit rose in arms at the threat but when she remembered the scorn that she had heaped upon me and how perhaps she had thus lost one whom she now regarded as her only friend she wept with remorse and rage at that moment i appeared oh winzy she exclaimed take me to your mothers cot swiftly let me leave the detested luxuries and wretchedness of this noble dwellingtake me to poverty and happiness i clasped her in my arms with transport the old dame was speechless with fury and broke forth into invective only when we were far on our road to my natal cottage my mother received the fair fugitive escaped from a gilt cage to nature and liberty with tenderness and joy my father who loved her welcomed her heartily it was a day of rejoicing which did not need the addition of the celestial potion of the alchymist to steep me in delight soon after this eventful day i became the husband of bertha i ceased to be the scholar of cornelius but i continued his friend i always felt grateful to him for having unawares procured me that delicious draught of a divine elixir which instead of curing me of love sad cure solitary and joyless remedy for evils which seem blessings to the memory had inspired me with courage and resolution thus winning for me an inestimable treasure in my bertha i often called to mind that period of trance like inebriation with wonder the drink of cornelius had not fulfilled the task for which he affirmed that it had been prepared but its effects were more potent and blissful than words can express they had faded by degrees yet they lingered longand painted life in hues of splendour bertha often wondered at my lightness of heart and unaccustomed gaiety for before i had been rather serious or even sad in my disposition she loved me the better for my cheerful temper and our days were winged by joy five years afterwards i was suddenly summoned to the bedside of the dying cornelius he had sent for me in haste conjuring my instant presence i found him stretched on his pallet enfeebled even to death all of life that yet remained animated his piercing eyes and they were fixed on a glass vessel full of a roseate liquid behold he said in a broken and inward voice the vanity of human wishes a second time my hopes are about to be crowned a second time they are destroyed look at that liquoryou remember five years ago i had prepared the same with the same successthen as now my thirsting lips expected to taste the immortal elixiryou dashed it from me and at present it is too late he spoke with difficulty and fell back on his pillow i could not help saying how revered master can a cure for love restore you to life a faint smile gleamed across his face as i listened earnestly to his scarcely intelligible answer a cure for love and for all thingsthe elixir of immortality ah if now i might drink i should live for ever as he spoke a golden flash gleamed from the fluid a well remembered fragrance stole over the air he raised himself all weak as he wasstrength seemed miraculously to re enter his framehe stretched forth his handa loud explosion startled mea ray of fire shot up from the elixir and the glass vessel which contained it was shivered to atoms i turned my eyes towards the philosopher he had fallen backhis eyes were glassyhis features rigidhe was dead but i lived and was to live for ever so said the unfortunate alchymist and for a few days i believed his words i remembered the glorious intoxication that had followed my stolen draught i reflected on the change i had felt in my framein my soul the bounding elasticity of the onethe buoyant lightness of the other i surveyed myself in a mirror and could perceive no change in my features during the space of the five years which had elapsed i remembered the radiant hues and grateful scent of that delicious beverageworthy the gift it was capable of bestowingi was then immortal a few days after i laughed at my credulity the old proverb that a prophet is least regarded in his own country was true with respect to me and my defunct master i loved him as a mani respected him as a sagebut i derided the notion that he could command the powers of darkness and laughed at the superstitious fears with which he was regarded by the vulgar he was a wise philosopher but had no acquaintance with any spirits but those clad in flesh and blood his science was simply human and human science i soon persuaded myself could never conquer natures laws so far as to imprison the soul for ever within its carnal habitation cornelius had brewed a soul refreshing drinkmore inebriating than winesweeter and more fragrant than any fruit it possessed probably strong medicinal powers imparting gladness to the heart and vigour to the limbs but its effects would wear out already were they diminished in my frame i was a lucky fellow to have quaffed health and joyous spirits and perhaps long life at my masters hands but my good fortune ended there longevity was far different from immortality i continued to entertain this belief for many years sometimes a thought stole across mewas the alchymist indeed deceived but my habitual credence was that i should meet the fate of all the children of adam at my appointed timea little late but still at a natural age yet it was certain that i retained a wonderfully youthful look i was laughed at for my vanity in consulting the mirror so often but i consulted it in vainmy brow was untrenchedmy cheeksmy eyesmy whole person continued as untarnished as in my twentieth year i was troubled i looked at the faded beauty of berthai seemed more like her son by degrees our neighbours began to make similar observations and i found at last that i went by the name of the scholar bewitched bertha herself grew uneasy she became jealous and peevish and at length she began to question me we had no children we were all in all to each other and though as she grew older her vivacious spirit became a little allied to ill temper and her beauty sadly diminished i cherished her in my heart as the mistress i had idolized the wife i had sought and won with such perfect love at last our situation became intolerable bertha was fiftyi twenty years of age i had in very shame in some measure adopted the habits of a more advanced age i no longer mingled in the dance among the young and gay but my heart bounded along with them while i restrained my feet and a sorry figure i cut among the nestors of our village but before the time i mention things were alteredwe were universally shunned we wereat least i wasreported to have kept up an iniquitous acquaintance with some of my former masters supposed friends poor bertha was pitied but deserted i was regarded with horror and detestation what was to be done we sat by our winter firepoverty had made itself felt for none would buy the produce of my farm and often i had been forced to journey twenty miles to some place where i was not known to dispose of our property it is true we had saved something for an evil daythat day was come we sat by our lone firesidethe old hearted youth and his antiquated wife again bertha insisted on knowing the truth she recapitulated all she had ever heard said about me and added her own observations she conjured me to cast off the spell she described how much more comely grey hairs were than my chestnut locks she descanted on the reverence and respect due to agehow preferable to the slight regard paid to mere children could i imagine that the despicable gifts of youth and good looks outweighed disgrace hatred and scorn nay in the end i should be burnt as a dealer in the black art while she to whom i had not deigned to communicate any portion of my good fortune might be stoned as my accomplice at length she insinuated that i must share my secret with her and bestow on her like benefits to those i myself enjoyed or she would denounce meand then she burst into tears thus beset methought it was the best way to tell the truth i revealed it as tenderly as i could and spoke only of a very long life not of immortalitywhich representation indeed coincided best with my own ideas when i ended i rose and said and now my bertha will you denounce the lover of your youthyou will not i know but it is too hard my poor wife that you should suffer from my ill luck and the accursed arts of cornelius i will leave youyou have wealth enough and friends will return in my absence i will go young as i seem and strong as i am i can work and gain my bread among strangers unsuspected and unknown i loved you in youth god is my witness that i would not desert you in age but that your safety and happiness require it i took my cap and moved towards the door in a moment berthas arms were round my neck and her lips were pressed to mine no my husband my winzy she said you shall not go alonetake me with you we will remove from this place and as you say among strangers we shall be unsuspected and safe i am not so very old as quite to shame you my winzy and i daresay the charm will soon wear off and with the blessing of god you will become more elderly looking as is fitting you shall not leave me i returned the good souls embrace heartily i will not my bertha but for your sake i had not thought of such a thing i will be your true faithful husband while you are spared to me and do my duty by you to the last the next day we prepared secretly for our emigration we were obliged to make great pecuniary sacrificesit could not be helped we realized a sum sufficient at least to maintain us while bertha lived and without saying adieu to any one quitted our native country to take refuge in a remote part of western france it was a cruel thing to transport poor bertha from her native village and the friends of her youth to a new country new language new customs the strange secret of my destiny rendered this removal immaterial to me but i compassionated her deeply and was glad to perceive that she found compensation for her misfortunes in a variety of little ridiculous circumstances away from all tell tale chroniclers she sought to decrease the apparent disparity of our ages by a thousand feminine artsrouge youthful dress and assumed juvenility of manner i could not be angry did not i myself wear a mask why quarrel with hers because it was less successful i grieved deeply when i remembered that this was my bertha whom i had loved so fondly and won with such transportthe dark eyed dark haired girl with smiles of enchanting archness and a step like a fawnthis mincing simpering jealous old woman i should have revered her grey locks and withered cheeks but thusit was my work i knew but i did not the less deplore this type of human weakness her jealousy never slept her chief occupation was to discover that in spite of outward appearances i was myself growing old i verily believe that the poor soul loved me truly in her heart but never had woman so tormenting a mode of displaying fondness she would discern wrinkles in my face and decrepitude in my walk while i bounded along in youthful vigour the youngest looking of twenty youths i never dared address another woman on one occasion fancying that the belle of the village regarded me with favouring eyes she brought me a grey wig her constant discourse among her acquaintances was that though i looked so young there was ruin at work within my frame and she affirmed that the worst symptom about me was my apparent health my youth was a disease she said and i ought at all times to prepare if not for a sudden and awful death at least to awake some morning white headed and bowed down with all the marks of advanced years i let her talki often joined in her conjectures her warnings chimed in with my never ceasing speculations concerning my state and i took an earnest though painful interest in listening to all that her quick wit and excited imagination could say on the subject why dwell on these minute circumstances we lived on for many long years bertha became bedrid and paralytic i nursed her as a mother might a child she grew peevish and still harped upon one stringof how long i should survive her it has ever been a source of consolation to me that i performed my duty scrupulously towards her she had been mine in youth she was mine in age and at last when i heaped the sod over her corpse i wept to feel that i had lost all that really bound me to humanity since then how many have been my cares and woes how few and empty my enjoyments i pause here in my historyi will pursue it no further a sailor without rudder or compass tossed on a stormy seaa traveller lost on a widespread heath without landmark or stone to guide himsuch have i been more lost more hopeless than either a nearing ship a gleam from some far cot may save them but i have no beacon except the hope of death death mysterious ill visaged friend of weak humanity why alone of all mortals have you cast me from your sheltering fold oh for the peace of the grave the deep silence of the iron bound tomb that thought would cease to work in my brain and my heart beat no more with emotions varied only by new forms of sadness am i immortal i return to my first question in the first place is it not more probable that the beverage of the alchymist was fraught rather with longevity than eternal life such is my hope and then be it remembered that i only drank half of the potion prepared by him was not the whole necessary to complete the charm to have drained half the elixir of immortality is but to be half immortalmy for ever is thus truncated and null but again who shall number the years of the half of eternity i often try to imagine by what rule the infinite may be divided sometimes i fancy age advancing upon me one grey hair i have found fool do i lament yes the fear of age and death often creeps coldly into my heart and the more i live the more i dread death even while i abhor life such an enigma is manborn to perishwhen he wars as i do against the established laws of his nature but for this anomaly of feeling surely i might die the medicine of the alchymist would not be proof against fireswordand the strangling waters i have gazed upon the blue depths of many a placid lake and the tumultuous rushing of many a mighty river and have said peace inhabits those waters yet i have turned my steps away to live yet another day i have asked myself whether suicide would be a crime in one to whom thus only the portals of the other world could be opened i have done all except presenting myself as a soldier or duellist an object of destruction to myno not my fellow mortals and therefore i have shrunk away they are not my fellows the inextinguishable power of life in my frame and their ephemeral existence places us wide as the poles asunder i could not raise a hand against the meanest or the most powerful among them thus i have lived on for many a yearalone and weary of myselfdesirous of death yet never dyinga mortal immortal neither ambition nor avarice can enter my mind and the ardent love that gnaws at my heart never to be returnednever to find an equal on which to expend itselflives there only to torment me this very day i conceived a design by which i may end allwithout self slaughter without making another man a cainan expedition which mortal frame can never survive even endued with the youth and strength that inhabits mine thus i shall put my immortality to the test and rest for everor return the wonder and benefactor of the human species before i go a miserable vanity has caused me to pen these pages i would not die and leave no name behind three centuries have passed since i quaffed the fatal beverage another year shall not elapse before encountering gigantic dangerswarring with the powers of frost in their homebeset by famine toil and tempesti yield this body too tenacious a cage for a soul which thirsts for freedom to the destructive elements of air and water or if i survive my name shall be recorded as one of the most famous among the sons of men and my task achieved i shall adopt more resolute means and by scattering and annihilating the atoms that compose my frame set at liberty the life imprisoned within and so cruelly prevented from soaring from this dim earth to a sphere more congenial to its immortal essence ix transformation forthwith this frame of mine was wrenchd with a woful agony which forced me to begin my tale and then it set me free since then at an uncertain hour that agony returns and till my ghastly tale is told this heart within me burns coleridges ancient mariner i have heard it said that when any strange supernatural and necromantic adventure has occurred to a human being that being however desirous he may be to conceal the same feels at certain periods torn up as it were by an intellectual earthquake and is forced to bare the inner depths of his spirit to another i am a witness of the truth of this i have dearly sworn to myself never to reveal to human ears the horrors to which i once in excess of fiendly pride delivered myself over the holy man who heard my confession and reconciled me to the church is dead none knows that once why should it not be thus why tell a tale of impious tempting of providence and soul subduing humiliation why answer me ye who are wise in the secrets of human nature i only know that so it is and in spite of strong resolveof a pride that too much masters meof shame and even of fear so to render myself odious to my speciesi must speak genoa my birthplaceproud city looking upon the blue mediterraneandost thou remember me in my boyhood when thy cliffs and promontories thy bright sky and gay vineyards were my world happy time when to the young heart the narrow bounded universe which leaves by its very limitation free scope to the imagination enchains our physical energies and sole period in our lives innocence and enjoyment are united yet who can look back to childhood and not remember its sorrows and its harrowing fears i was born with the most imperious haughty tameless spirit i quailed before my father only and he generous and noble but capricious and tyrannical at once fostered and checked the wild impetuosity of my character making obedience necessary but inspiring no respect for the motives which guided his commands to be a man free independent or in better words insolent and domineering was the hope and prayer of my rebel heart my father had one friend a wealthy genoese noble who in a political tumult was suddenly sentenced to banishment and his property confiscated the marchese torella went into exile alone like my father he was a widower he had one child the almost infant juliet who was left under my fathers guardianship i should certainly have been unkind to the lovely girl but that i was forced by my position to become her protector a variety of childish incidents all tended to one pointto make juliet see in me a rock of defence i in her one who must perish through the soft sensibility of her nature too rudely visited but for my guardian care we grew up together the opening rose in may was not more sweet than this dear girl an irradiation of beauty was spread over her face her form her step her voicemy heart weeps even now to think of all of relying gentle loving and pure that she enshrined when i was eleven and juliet eight years of age a cousin of mine much older than eitherhe seemed to us a mantook great notice of my playmate he called her his bride and asked her to marry him she refused and he insisted drawing her unwillingly towards him with the countenance and emotions of a maniac i threw myself on himi strove to draw his swordi clung to his neck with the ferocious resolve to strangle him he was obliged to call for assistance to disengage himself from me on that night i led juliet to the chapel of our house i made her touch the sacred relicsi harrowed her childs heart and profaned her childs lips with an oath that she would be mine and mine only well those days passed away torella returned in a few years and became wealthier and more prosperous than ever when i was seventeen my father died he had been magnificent to prodigality torella rejoiced that my minority would afford an opportunity for repairing my fortunes juliet and i had been affianced beside my fathers deathbedtorella was to be a second parent to me i desired to see the world and i was indulged i went to florence to rome to naples thence i passed to toulon and at length reached what had long been the bourne of my wishes paris there was wild work in paris then the poor king charles the sixth now sane now mad now a monarch now an abject slave was the very mockery of humanity the queen the dauphin the duke of burgundy alternately friends and foesnow meeting in prodigal feasts now shedding blood in rivalrywere blind to the miserable state of their country and the dangers that impended over it and gave themselves wholly up to dissolute enjoyment or savage strife my character still followed me i was arrogant and self willed i loved display and above all i threw off all control my young friends were eager to foster passions which furnished them with pleasures i was deemed handsomei was master of every knightly accomplishment i was disconnected with any political party i grew a favourite with all my presumption and arrogance was pardoned in one so young i became a spoiled child who could control me not the letters and advice of torellaonly strong necessity visiting me in the abhorred shape of an empty purse but there were means to refill this void acre after acre estate after estate i sold my dress my jewels my horses and their caparisons were almost unrivalled in gorgeous paris while the lands of my inheritance passed into possession of others the duke of orleans was waylaid and murdered by the duke of burgundy fear and terror possessed all paris the dauphin and the queen shut themselves up every pleasure was suspended i grew weary of this state of things and my heart yearned for my boyhoods haunts i was nearly a beggar yet still i would go there claim my bride and rebuild my fortunes a few happy ventures as a merchant would make me rich again nevertheless i would not return in humble guise my last act was to dispose of my remaining estate near albaro for half its worth for ready money then i despatched all kinds of artificers arras furniture of regal splendour to fit up the last relic of my inheritance my palace in genoa i lingered a little longer yet ashamed at the part of the prodigal returned which i feared i should play i sent my horses one matchless spanish jennet i despatched to my promised bride its caparisons flamed with jewels and cloth of gold in every part i caused to be entwined the initials of juliet and her guido my present found favour in hers and in her fathers eyes still to return a proclaimed spendthrift the mark of impertinent wonder perhaps of scorn and to encounter singly the reproaches or taunts of my fellow citizens was no alluring prospect as a shield between me and censure i invited some few of the most reckless of my comrades to accompany me thus i went armed against the world hiding a rankling feeling half fear and half penitence by bravado i arrived in genoa i trod the pavement of my ancestral palace my proud step was no interpreter of my heart for i deeply felt that though surrounded by every luxury i was a beggar the first step i took in claiming juliet must widely declare me such i read contempt or pity in the looks of all i fancied that rich and poor young and old all regarded me with derision torella came not near me no wonder that my second father should expect a sons deference from me in waiting first on him but galled and stung by a sense of my follies and demerit i strove to throw the blame on others we kept nightly orgies in palazzo carega to sleepless riotous nights followed listless supine mornings at the ave maria we showed our dainty persons in the streets scoffing at the sober citizens casting insolent glances on the shrinking women juliet was not among themno no if she had been there shame would have driven me away if love had not brought me to her feet i grew tired of this suddenly i paid the marchese a visit he was at his villa one among the many which deck the suburb of san pietro darena it was the month of may the blossoms of the fruit trees were fading among thick green foliage the vines were shooting forth the ground strewed with the fallen olive blooms the firefly was in the myrtle hedge heaven and earth wore a mantle of surpassing beauty torella welcomed me kindly though seriously and even his shade of displeasure soon wore away some resemblance to my fathersome look and tone of youthful ingenuousness softened the good old mans heart he sent for his daughterhe presented me to her as her betrothed the chamber became hallowed by a holy light as she entered hers was that cherub look those large soft eyes full dimpled cheeks and mouth of infantine sweetness that expresses the rare union of happiness and love admiration first possessed me she is mine was the second proud emotion and my lips curled with haughty triumph i had not been the enfant gt of the beauties of france not to have learnt the art of pleasing the soft heart of woman if towards men i was overbearing the deference i paid to them was the more in contrast i commenced my courtship by the display of a thousand gallantries to juliet who vowed to me from infancy had never admitted the devotion of others and who though accustomed to expressions of admiration was uninitiated in the language of lovers for a few days all went well torella never alluded to my extravagance he treated me as a favourite son but the time came as we discussed the preliminaries to my union with his daughter when this fair face of things should be overcast a contract had been drawn up in my fathers lifetime i had rendered this in fact void by having squandered the whole of the wealth which was to have been shared by juliet and myself torella in consequence chose to consider this bond as cancelled and proposed another in which though the wealth he bestowed was immeasurably increased there were so many restrictions as to the mode of spending it that i who saw independence only in free career being given to my own imperious will taunted him as taking advantage of my situation and refused utterly to subscribe to his conditions the old man mildly strove to recall me to reason roused pride became the tyrant of my thought i listened with indignationi repelled him with disdain juliet thou art mine did we not interchange vows in our innocent childhood are we not one in the sight of god and shall thy cold hearted cold blooded father divide us be generous my love be just take not away a gift last treasure of thy guidoretract not thy vowslet us defy the world and setting at nought the calculations of age find in our mutual affection a refuge from every ill fiend i must have been with such sophistry to endeavour to poison that sanctuary of holy thought and tender love juliet shrank from me affrighted her father was the best and kindest of men and she strove to show me how in obeying him every good would follow he would receive my tardy submission with warm affection and generous pardon would follow my repentanceprofitless words for a young and gentle daughter to use to a man accustomed to make his will law and to feel in his own heart a despot so terrible and stern that he could yield obedience to nought save his own imperious desires my resentment grew with resistance my wild companions were ready to add fuel to the flame we laid a plan to carry off juliet at first it appeared to be crowned with success midway on our return we were overtaken by the agonized father and his attendants a conflict ensued before the city guard came to decide the victory in favour of our antagonists two of torellas servitors were dangerously wounded this portion of my history weighs most heavily with me changed man as i am i abhor myself in the recollection may none who hear this tale ever have felt as i a horse driven to fury by a rider armed with barbed spurs was not more a slave than i to the violent tyranny of my temper a fiend possessed my soul irritating it to madness i felt the voice of conscience within me but if i yielded to it for a brief interval it was only to be a moment after torn as by a whirlwind awayborne along on the stream of desperate ragethe plaything of the storms engendered by pride i was imprisoned and at the instance of torella set free again i returned to carry off both him and his child to france which hapless country then preyed on by freebooters and gangs of lawless soldiery offered a grateful refuge to a criminal like me our plots were discovered i was sentenced to banishment and as my debts were already enormous my remaining property was put in the hands of commissioners for their payment torella again offered his mediation requiring only my promise not to renew my abortive attempts on himself and his daughter i spurned his offers and fancied that i triumphed when i was thrust out from genoa a solitary and penniless exile my companions were gone they had been dismissed the city some weeks before and were already in france i was alonefriendless with neither sword at my side nor ducat in my purse i wandered along the sea shore a whirlwind of passion possessing and tearing my soul it was as if a live coal had been set burning in my breast at first i meditated on what i should do i would join a band of freebooters revengethe word seemed balm to me i hugged it caressed it till like a serpent it stung me then again i would abjure and despise genoa that little corner of the world i would return to paris where so many of my friends swarmed where my services would be eagerly accepted where i would carve out fortune with my sword and make my paltry birthplace and the false torella rue the day when they drove me a new coriolanus from her walls i would return to paristhus on foota beggarand present myself in my poverty to those i had formerly entertained sumptuously there was gall in the mere thought of it the reality of things began to dawn upon my mind bringing despair in its train for several months i had been a prisoner the evils of my dungeon had whipped my soul to madness but they had subdued my corporeal frame i was weak and wan torella had used a thousand artifices to administer to my comfort i had detected and scorned them all and i reaped the harvest of my obduracy what was to be done should i crouch before my foe and sue for forgivenessdie rather ten thousand deathsnever should they obtain that victory hatei swore eternal hate hate from whomto whomfrom a wandering outcastto a mighty noble i and my feelings were nothing to them already had they forgotten one so unworthy and juliether angel face and sylph like form gleamed among the clouds of my despair with vain beauty for i had lost herthe glory and flower of the world another will call her histhat smile of paradise will bless another even now my heart fails within me when i recur to this rout of grim visaged ideas now subdued almost to tears now raving in my agony still i wandered along the rocky shore which grew at each step wilder and more desolate hanging rocks and hoar precipices overlooked the tideless ocean black caverns yawned and for ever among the seaworn recesses murmured and dashed the unfruitful waters now my way was almost barred by an abrupt promontory now rendered nearly impracticable by fragments fallen from the cliff evening was at hand when seaward arose as if on the waving of a wizards wand a murky web of clouds blotting the late azure sky and darkening and disturbing the till now placid deep the clouds had strange fantastic shapes and they changed and mingled and seemed to be driven about by a mighty spell the waves raised their white crests the thunder first muttered then roared from across the waste of waters which took a deep purple dye flecked with foam the spot where i stood looked on one side to the widespread ocean on the other it was barred by a rugged promontory round this cape suddenly came driven by the wind a vessel in vain the mariners tried to force a path for her to the open seathe gale drove her on the rocks it will perishall on board will perish would i were among them and to my young heart the idea of death came for the first time blended with that of joy it was an awful sight to behold that vessel struggling with her fate hardly could i discern the sailors but i heard them it was soon all over a rock just covered by the tossing waves and so unperceived lay in wait for its prey a crash of thunder broke over my head at the moment that with a frightful shock the vessel dashed upon her unseen enemy in a brief space of time she went to pieces there i stood in safety and there were my fellow creatures battling how hopelessly with annihilation methought i saw them strugglingtoo truly did i hear their shrieks conquering the barking surges in their shrill agony the dark breakers threw hither and thither the fragments of the wreck soon it disappeared i had been fascinated to gaze till the end at last i sank on my kneesi covered my face with my hands i again looked up something was floating on the billows towards the shore it neared and neared was that a human form it grew more and more distinct and at last a mighty wave lifting the whole freight lodged it upon a rock a human being bestriding a sea chesta human being yet was it one surely never such had existed beforea misshapen dwarf with squinting eyes distorted features and body deformed till it became a horror to behold my blood lately warming towards a fellow being so snatched from a watery tomb froze in my heart the dwarf got off his chest he tossed his straight struggling hair from his odious visage by st beelzebub he exclaimed i have been well bested he looked round and saw me oh by the fiend here is another ally of the mighty one to what saint did you offer prayers friendif not to mine yet i remember you not on board i shrank from the monster and his blasphemy again he questioned me and i muttered some inaudible reply he continued your voice is drowned by this dissonant roar what a noise the big ocean makes schoolboys bursting from their prison are not louder than these waves set free to play they disturb me i will no more of their ill timed brawling silence hoary onewinds avauntto your homesclouds fly to the antipodes and leave our heaven clear as he spoke he stretched out his two long lank arms that looked like spiders claws and seemed to embrace with them the expanse before him was it a miracle the clouds became broken and fled the azure sky first peeped out and then was spread a calm field of blue above us the stormy gale was exchanged to the softly breathing west the sea grew calm the waves dwindled to riplets i like obedience even in these stupid elements said the dwarf how much more in the tameless mind of man it was a well got up storm you must allowand all of my own making it was tempting providence to interchange talk with this magician but power in all its shapes is respected by man awe curiosity a clinging fascination drew me towards him come dont be frightened friend said the wretch i am good humoured when pleased and something does please me in your well proportioned body and handsome face though you look a little woe begone you have suffered a landi a sea wreck perhaps i can allay the tempest of your fortunes as i did my own shall we be friendsand he held out his hand i could not touch it well then companionsthat will do as well and now while i rest after the buffeting i underwent just now tell me why young and gallant as you seem you wander thus alone and downcast on this wild sea shore the voice of the wretch was screeching and horrid and his contortions as he spoke were frightful to behold yet he did gain a kind of influence over me which i could not master and i told him my tale when it was ended he laughed long and loud the rocks echoed back the sound hell seemed yelling around me oh thou cousin of lucifer said he so thou too hast fallen through thy pride and though bright as the son of morning thou art ready to give up thy good looks thy bride and thy well being rather than submit thee to the tyranny of good i honour thy choice by my soulso thou hast fled and yield the day and mean to starve on these rocks and to let the birds peck out thy dead eyes while thy enemy and thy betrothed rejoice in thy ruin thy pride is strangely akin to humility methinks as he spoke a thousand fanged thoughts stung me to the heart what would you that i should do i cried ioh nothing but lie down and say your prayers before you die but were i you i know the deed that should be done i drew near him his supernatural powers made him an oracle in my eyes yet a strange unearthly thrill quivered through my frame as i said speakteach mewhat act do you advise revenge thyself manhumble thy enemiesset thy foot on the old mans neck and possess thyself of his daughter to the east and west i turn cried i and see no means had i gold much could i achieve but poor and single i am powerless the dwarf had been seated on his chest as he listened to my story now he got off he touched a spring it flew open what a mine of wealthof blazing jewels beaming gold and pale silverwas displayed therein a mad desire to possess this treasure was born within me doubtless i said one so powerful as you could do all things nay said the monster humbly i am less omnipotent than i seem some things i possess which you may covet but i would give them all for a small share or even for a loan of what is yours my possessions are at your service i replied bitterlymy poverty my exile my disgracei make a free gift of them all good i thank you add one other thing to your gift and my treasure is yours as nothing is my sole inheritance what besides nothing would you have your comely face and well made limbs i shivered would this all powerful monster murder me i had no dagger i forgot to praybut i grew pale i ask for a loan not a gift said the frightful thing lend me your body for three daysyou shall have mine to cage your soul the while and in payment my chest what say you to the bargainthree short days we are told that it is dangerous to hold unlawful talk and well do i prove the same tamely written down it may seem incredible that i should lend any ear to this proposition but in spite of his unnatural ugliness there was something fascinating in a being whose voice could govern earth air and sea i felt a keen desire to comply for with that chest i could command the worlds my only hesitation resulted from a fear that he would not be true to his bargain then i thought i shall soon die here on these lonely sands and the limbs he covets will be mine no moreit is worth the chance and besides i knew that by all the rules of art magic there were formula and oaths which none of its practisers dared break i hesitated to reply and he went on now displaying his wealth now speaking of the petty price he demanded till it seemed madness to refuse thus is itplace our bark in the current of the stream and down over fall and cataract it is hurried give up our conduct to the wild torrent of passion and we are away we know not whither he swore many an oath and i adjured him by many a sacred name till i saw this wonder of power this ruler of the elements shiver like an autumn leaf before my words and as if the spirit spake unwillingly and perforce within him at last he with broken voice revealed the spell whereby he might be obliged did he wish to play me false to render up the unlawful spoil our warm life blood must mingle to make and to mar the charm enough of this unholy theme i was persuadedthe thing was done the morrow dawned upon me as i lay upon the shingles and i knew not my own shadow as it fell from me i felt myself changed to a shape of horror and cursed my easy faith and blind credulity the chest was therethere the gold and precious stones for which i had sold the frame of flesh which nature had given me the sight a little stilled my emotions three days would soon be gone they did pass the dwarf had supplied me with a plenteous store of food at first i could hardly walk so strange and out of joint were all my limbs and my voiceit was that of the fiend but i kept silent and turned my face to the sun that i might not see my shadow and counted the hours and ruminated on my future conduct to bring torella to my feetto possess my juliet in spite of himall this my wealth could easily achieve during dark night i slept and dreamt of the accomplishment of my desires two suns had setthe third dawned i was agitated fearful oh expectation what a frightful thing art thou when kindled more by fear than hope how dost thou twist thyself round the heart torturing its pulsations how dost thou dart unknown pangs all through our feeble mechanism now seeming to shiver us like broken glass to nothingnessnow giving us a fresh strength which can do nothing and so torments us by a sensation such as the strong man must feel who cannot break his fetters though they bend in his grasp slowly paced the bright bright orb up the eastern sky long it lingered in the zenith and still more slowly wandered down the west it touched the horizons vergeit was lost its glories were on the summits of the cliffthey grew dun and grey the evening star shone bright he will soon be here he came notby the living heavens he came notand night dragged out its weary length and in its decaying age day began to grizzle its dark hair and the sun rose again on the most miserable wretch that ever upbraided its light three days thus i passed the jewels and the goldoh how i abhorred them well welli will not blacken these pages with demoniac ravings all too terrible were the thoughts the raging tumult of ideas that filled my soul at the end of that time i slept i had not before since the third sunset and i dreamt that i was at juliets feet and she smiled and then she shriekedfor she saw my transformationand again she smiled for still her beautiful lover knelt before her but it was not iit was he the fiend arrayed in my limbs speaking with my voice winning her with my looks of love i strove to warn her but my tongue refused its office i strove to tear him from her but i was rooted to the groundi awoke with the agony there were the solitary hoar precipicesthere the plashing sea the quiet strand and the blue sky over all what did it mean was my dream but a mirror of the truth was he wooing and winning my betrothed i would on the instant back to genoabut i was banished i laughedthe dwarfs yell burst from my lipsi banished oh no they had not exiled the foul limbs i wore i might with these enter without fear of incurring the threatened penalty of death my own my native city i began to walk towards genoa i was somewhat accustomed to my distorted limbs none were ever so ill adapted for a straightforward movement it was with infinite difficulty that i proceeded then too i desired to avoid all the hamlets strewed here and there on the sea beach for i was unwilling to make a display of my hideousness i was not quite sure that if seen the mere boys would not stone me to death as i passed for a monster some ungentle salutations i did receive from the few peasants or fishermen i chanced to meet but it was dark night before i approached genoa the weather was so balmy and sweet that it struck me that the marchese and his daughter would very probably have quitted the city for their country retreat it was from villa torella that i had attempted to carry off juliet i had spent many an hour reconnoitring the spot and knew each inch of ground in its vicinity it was beautifully situated embosomed in trees on the margin of a stream as i drew near it became evident that my conjecture was right nay moreover that the hours were being then devoted to feasting and merriment for the house was lighted up strains of soft and gay music were wafted towards me by the breeze my heart sank within me such was the generous kindness of torellas heart that i felt sure that he would not have indulged in public manifestations of rejoicing just after my unfortunate banishment but for a cause i dared not dwell upon the country people were all alive and flocking about it became necessary that i should conceal myself and yet i longed to address some one or to hear others discourse or in any way to gain intelligence of what was really going on at length entering the walks that were in immediate vicinity to the mansion i found one dark enough to veil my excessive frightfulness and yet others as well as i were loitering in its shade i soon gathered all i wanted to knowall that first made my very heart die with horror and then boil with indignation to morrow juliet was to be given to the penitent reformed beloved guidoto morrow my bride was to pledge her vows to a fiend from hell and i did thismy accursed pridemy demoniac violence and wicked self idolatry had caused this act for if i had acted as the wretch who had stolen my form had actedif with a mien at once yielding and dignified i had presented myself to torella saying i have done wrong forgive me i am unworthy of your angel child but permit me to claim her hereafter when my altered conduct shall manifest that i abjure my vices and endeavour to become in some sort worthy of her i go to serve against the infidels and when my zeal for religion and my true penitence for the past shall appear to you to cancel my crimes permit me again to call myself your son thus had he spoken and the penitent was welcomed even as the prodigal son of scripture the fatted calf was killed for him and he still pursuing the same path displayed such open hearted regret for his follies so humble a concession of all his rights and so ardent a resolve to reacquire them by a life of contrition and virtue that he quickly conquered the kind old man and full pardon and the gift of his lovely child followed in swift succession oh had an angel from paradise whispered to me to act thus but now what would be the innocent juliets fate would god permit the foul unionor some prodigy destroying it link the dishonoured name of carega with the worst of crimes to morrow at dawn they were to be married there was but one way to prevent thisto meet mine enemy and to enforce the ratification of our agreement i felt that this could only be done by a mortal struggle i had no swordif indeed my distorted arms could wield a soldiers weaponbut i had a dagger and in that lay my hope there was no time for pondering or balancing nicely the question i might die in the attempt but besides the burning jealousy and despair of my own heart honour mere humanity demanded that i should fall rather than not destroy the machinations of the fiend the guests departedthe lights began to disappear it was evident that the inhabitants of the villa were seeking repose i hid myself among the treesthe garden grew desertthe gates were closedi wandered round and came under a windowah well did i know the samea soft twilight glimmered in the roomthe curtains were half withdrawn it was the temple of innocence and beauty its magnificence was tempered as it were by the slight disarrangements occasioned by its being dwelt in and all the objects scattered around displayed the taste of her who hallowed it by her presence i saw her enter with a quick light stepi saw her approach the windowshe drew back the curtain yet further and looked out into the night its breezy freshness played among her ringlets and wafted them from the transparent marble of her brow she clasped her hands she raised her eyes to heaven i heard her voice guido she softly murmuredmine own guido and then as if overcome by the fulness of her own heart she sank on her kneesher upraised eyesher graceful attitudethe beaming thankfulness that lighted up her faceoh these are tame words heart of mine thou imagest ever though thou canst not portray the celestial beauty of that child of light and love i heard a stepa quick firm step along the shady avenue soon i saw a cavalier richly dressed young and methought graceful to look on advance i hid myself yet closer the youth approached he paused beneath the window she arose and again looking out she saw him and saidi cannot no at this distant time i cannot record her terms of soft silver tenderness to me they were spoken but they were replied to by him i will not go he cried here where you have been where your memory glides like some heaven visiting ghost i will pass the long hours till we meet never my juliet again day or night to part but do thou my love retire the cold morn and fitful breeze will make thy cheek pale and fill with languor thy love lighted eyes ah sweetest could i press one kiss upon them i could methinks repose and then he approached still nearer and methought he was about to clamber into her chamber i had hesitated not to terrify her now i was no longer master of myself i rushed forwardi threw myself on himi tore him awayi cried o loathsome and foul shaped wretch i need not repeat epithets all tending as it appeared to rail at a person i at present feel some partiality for a shriek rose from juliets lips i neither heard nor sawi felt only mine enemy whose throat i grasped and my daggers hilt he struggled but could not escape at length hoarsely he breathed these words dostrike home destroy this bodyyou will still live may your life be long and merry the descending dagger was arrested at the word and he feeling my hold relax extricated himself and drew his sword while the uproar in the house and flying of torches from one room to the other showed that soon we should be separated in the midst of my frenzy there was much calculationfall i might and so that he did not survive i cared not for the death blow i might deal against myself while still therefore he thought i paused and while i saw the villanous resolve to take advantage of my hesitation in the sudden thrust he made at me i threw myself on his sword and at the same moment plunged my dagger with a true desperate aim in his side we fell together rolling over each other and the tide of blood that flowed from the gaping wound of each mingled on the grass more i know noti fainted again i return to life weak almost to death i found myself stretched upon a bedjuliet was kneeling beside it strange my first broken request was for a mirror i was so wan and ghastly that my poor girl hesitated as she told me afterwards but by the mass i thought myself a right proper youth when i saw the dear reflection of my own well known features i confess it is a weakness but i avow it i do entertain a considerable affection for the countenance and limbs i behold whenever i look at a glass and have more mirrors in my house and consult them oftener than any beauty in genoa before you too much condemn me permit me to say that no one better knows than i the value of his own body no one probably except myself ever having had it stolen from him incoherently i at first talked of the dwarf and his crimes and reproached juliet for her too easy admission of his love she thought me raving as well she might and yet it was some time before i could prevail on myself to admit that the guido whose penitence had won her back for me was myself and while i cursed bitterly the monstrous dwarf and blest the well directed blow that had deprived him of life i suddenly checked myself when i heard her say amen knowing that him whom she reviled was my very self a little reflection taught me silencea little practice enabled me to speak of that frightful night without any very excessive blunder the wound i had given myself was no mockery of oneit was long before i recoveredand as the benevolent and generous torella sat beside me talking such wisdom as might win friends to repentance and mine own dear juliet hovered near me administering to my wants and cheering me by her smiles the work of my bodily cure and mental reform went on together i have never indeed wholly recovered my strengthmy cheek is paler sincemy person a little bent juliet sometimes ventures to allude bitterly to the malice that caused this change but i kiss her on the moment and tell her all is for the best i am a fonder and more faithful husband and true is thisbut for that wound never had i called her mine i did not revisit the sea shore nor seek for the fiends treasure yet while i ponder on the past i often think and my confessor was not backward in favouring the idea that it might be a good rather than an evil spirit sent by my guardian angel to show me the folly and misery of pride so well at least did i learn this lesson roughly taught as i was that i am known now by all my friends and fellow citizens by the name of guido il cortese x the swiss peasant why is the mind of man so apt to be swayed by contraries why does the imagination for ever paint the impossible in glittering tints and the hearts of wayward mortals cling with the greatest tenacity to what eel like is bent on escaping from their grasp whyto bring the matter homeis solitude abhorrent to me now that i enjoy it in perfection i have apostrophized the coy nymph in ball rooms when the bright lamps of heaven were shamed by brighter earth stars and lamented her absence at a picnic party where the nightingale was silenced by the fiddle and now o solitude i abjure thee in thy fitting templein switzerlandamong cloud piercing mountains by the resounding waves of the isle surrounding lake i am beside the waters of uriwhere tell livedin brunen where the swiss patriots swore to die for freedom it rainsmagic word to destroy the spell to which these words give risethe clouds envelop the hillsthe white mists veil the ravinesthere is a roar and a splash in my earsand now and then the vapours break and scatter themselves and i see something dark between which is the hoar side of a dark precipice but which might as well be the turf stack or old wall that bounded cumberlands view as he wrote the wheel of fortune the sole book that i possess is the prisoner of chillon i have read it through three times within an hour its noble author composed it to beguile weary hours like these when he remained rain bound for three days in a little inn on the shores of the lake of geneva and cannot i following with unequal steps so cheat the minutes in this dim spot i never by the by could invent the commonest incident as a man of honour of course i never lie but as a nursery child and schoolboy i never did simply as i remember because i never could concoct onebut a true tale was lately narrated to me by its very heroine the incidents of which haunt my memory adorned as they were by her animated looks and soft silvery accent let me try to record them stripped though they must be of their greatest charm i was but a week ago travelling with my friend ashburn in a coupe in the district of subiaco in the ecclesiastical territory we were jolted along a rough ravine through which the river anio sped and beetling mountains and shady trees a distant convent and a picturesque cell on a hill formed a view which so awoke the pictorial propensities of my friend that he stopped the coupe though we were assured that we should never reach our inn by nightfall and that the road was dangerous in the dark took out his portfolio and began to sketch as he drew i continued to speak in support of an argument we had entered upon before i had been complaining of the commonplace and ennui of life ashburn insisted that our existence was only too full of variety and changetragic variety and wondrous incredible change even said the painter as sky and earth and water seem for ever the same to the vulgar eye and yet to the gifted one assume a thousand various guises and huesnow robed in purplenow shrouded in blacknow resplendent with living goldand anon sinking into sober and unobtrusive grey so do our mortal lives change and vary no living being among us but could tell a tale of soul subduing joys and heart consuming woes worthy had they their poet of the imagination of shakespeare or goethe the veriest weather worn cabin is a study for colouring and the meanest peasant will offer all the acts of a drama in the apparently dull routine of his humble life this is pure romance i replied put it to the test let us take for example yonder woman descending the mountain path what a figure cried ashburn oh that she would stay thus but one quarter of an hourshe has come down to bathe her childher upturned faceher dark hairher picturesque costumethe little plump fellow bestriding herthe rude scenery around and the romantic tale she has to tell i would wager a louis that hers has been no common fate she steps a goddessher attitude her looks are all filled with majesty i laughed at his enthusiasm and accepted his bet we hurried to join our fair peasantess and thus formed acquaintance with fanny chaumont a sudden storm as we were engaged conversing with her came driven down from the tempest bearing hills and she gave us a cordial invitation to her cottage it was situated on a sunny yet sheltered slope there was a look of cheerfulness and aisance about it beyond what is usually met in that part of switzerland reminding me of the cottages of the inhabitants of the free states there also we found her husband i always feel curious to know on whom a woman who bears the stamp of superior intellect who is beautiful and refinedfor peasant as she was fanny was bothhas been induced to bestow herself louis chaumont was considerably older than his wife he was handsome with brown lively eyes curly chestnut hair a visage embrowned by the sun bearing every mark of having led an active even an adventurous life there was besides an expression which if it were not ferocity resembled it in his vivacious glances and in the sternness of his deeply lined forehead while she in spite of her finely formed brow her majestic person and her large expressive eyes looked softness and patience itself there was something incongruous in the pair and more strangely matched they seemed when we heard their story it lost me my louis but proved fanny at once to be a fitting heroine for romance and was a lesson moreover to teach the strange pranks love can play with us mingling fire and water blending in one harmonious concord the harsh base and melodious tenor of two differently stringed instruments though their child was five years old fanny and her husband were attached to each other with the tenderness and passion of early love they were happyhis faults were tempered by her angel disposition and her too melancholy and feeling fraught spirit was enlivened and made plastic to the purposes of this world by his energy and activity fanny was a bernese by birth she was the child of humble cottagers one among a large family they lived on the brow of one summit and at the foot of another the snowy mountains were piled about them thaw fed torrents brawled around during the night a sound like thunder a crash among the tempest beaten pines would tell of an avalanche or the snowdrift whirring past the lattice threatened to bury the little fabric winter was the season of peace in the deep vales not so in the higher district the peasant was often kept waking by the soft falling snow which threatened insidiously to encroach on and to overwhelm his habitation or a straying cow would lead him far into the depths of the stormy hills and his fearful family would count in agony the hours of his absence perpetual hardship and danger however rather brutify than exalt the soul of man and those of the swiss who are most deeply planted among the rocky wilds are often stultified and sullen fanny opened her youthful eyes and observation on this scene she was one of those lovely children whose beauty is heartfelt but indescribable hers was the smooth candid brow the large hazel eyes half soft half wild the round dimpled cheek the full sensitive mouth the pointed chin and as framework to the picture the luxuriant curly chestnut hair and voice which is sweetest music the exceeding beauty of little fanny gained her the observation of the wife of the owner of the chateau which overlooked and commanded the district and at ten years of age she became a frequent visitor there fannys little soul was love so she soon twined herself round the kind ladys heart became a pet with her husband and the favourite playmate of their only son one fte day fanny had dined at the chateau it had been fine warm spring weather but wind and storm came on with the setting sun the snow began to fall thickly and it was decided that fanny must pass the night in the chateau she had been unusually eager to return home and when the tempest came on she crept near her protectress and begged to be sent to her mother cest impossiblefanny pressed no further but she clambered to a window and looked out wistfully to where hidden by the hills her parents cottage stood it was a fatal night for her the thunders of frequent avalanches the roaring of torrents the crash of trees spoke of devastation and her home was its chief prey father mother brothers and sisters not one survived where the day before cottage and outhouse and flower garden had stood the little lawn where she played and the grove that sheltered her there was now a monumental pile of snow and the rocky path of a torrent no trace remained not one survivor to tell the tale from that night fanny became a constant inmate of the chateau it was madame de marvilles project to give her a bourgeois education which would raise her from the hardships of a peasants life and yet not elevate her above her natural position in society she was brought up kindly but humbly it was the virtues of her disposition which raised her in the eyes of all around hernot any ill judged favour of her benefactress the night of the destruction of her family never passed away from her memory it set a seal of untimely seriousness on her childish brow awoke deep thoughts in her infant heart and a strong resolve that while she lived her beloved friends should find her as far as her humble powers admitted a source of good alonea reason to rejoice that they had saved her from the destruction that had overwhelmed her family thus fanny grew up in beauty and in virtue her smiles were as the rainbows of her native torrents her voice her caresses her light step her unalterable sweetness and ceaseless devotion to the wishes of others made her the idol of the family henry the only child of her protectors was of her own age or but a few months her senior every time henry returned from school to visit his parents he found fanny more beautiful more kind more attractive than before and the first passion his youthful heart knew was for the lovely peasant girl whose virtues sanctified his home a look a gesture betrayed his secret to his mother she turned a hasty glance on fanny and saw on her countenance innocence and confidence alone half reassured yet still fearful madame de marville began to reflect on some cure for the threatened evil she could not bear to send away fanny she was solicitous that her son should for the present reside in his home the lovely girl was perfectly unconscious of the sentiments of the young seigneur but would she always continue so and was the burning heart that warmed her gentle bosom to be for ever insensible to the despotic and absorbing emotions of love it was with wonder and a curious mixture of disappointed maternal pride and real gladness that the lady at length discovered a passion dawning in fair fannys heart for louis chaumont a peasant some ten years older than herself it was natural that one with such high wrought feelings as our heroine should love one to whom she could look up and on whom to depend rather than her childhoods playmatethe gay thoughtless henry louiss family had been the victim of a moral ruin as hers of a physical one they had been oppressed reduced to poverty driven from their homes by a feudal tyrant and had come poor and forlorn from a distant district his mother accustomed to a bourgeois life died broken hearted his father a man of violent passions nourished in his own and in his sons heart sentiments of hatred and revenge against the proud oppressors of the land they were obliged to labour hard yet in the intervals of work father and son would read or discourse concerning the ills attendant on humanity and they traced all to the social system which made the few the tyrants of the many louis was handsome bold and active he excelled his compeers in every hardy exercise his resolution his daring made him in spite of his poverty a kind of leader among them he had many faults he was too full of passion of the spirit of resistance and revenge but his heart was kind his understanding when not thwarted strong and the very depth of his feelings made him keenly susceptible to love fanny in her simple but majestic beauty in her soft kindness of manner mingled with the profoundest sensibility made a deep impression on the young mans heart his converse so different and so superior to those of his fellows won her attention hitherto fanny had never given utterance to the secrets of her soul habitual respect held her silent with madame and henry as spirited and as heedless as a chamois could ill understand her but louis became the depository of the many feelings which piled up in secrecy and silence were half awful to herself he brought reason or what he deemed such to direct her heart born conclusions to have heard them talk of life and death and all its shows you would have wondered by what freak philosophy had dressed herself in youth and a peasants garb and wandered from the schools to these untaught wilds madame de marville saw and encouraged this attachment louis was not exactly the person she would have selected for fanny but he was the only being for whom she had ever evinced a predilection and besides the danger of a misalliance which threatened her own son rendered her eager to build an insurmountable wall between him and the object of his affections thus fanny enjoyed the heart gladdening pride of hearing her choice applauded and praised by the person she most respected and loved in the world as yet however love had been covert the soul but not the apparent body of their intercourse louis was kept in awe by this high minded girl and fanny had not yet learned her own secret it was henry who made the discovery for themhenry who with all the impetuosity of his vivacious character contrived a thousand ways to come between them who stung by jealousy to injustice reviled louis for his ruin his poverty his opinions and brought the spirit of dissension to disquiet a mind entirely bent as she imagined on holy and pure thoughts under this clash of passion the action of the drama rapidly developed itself and for nearly a year a variety of scenes were acted among these secluded mountains of no interest save to the parties themselves but to them fateful and engrossing louis and fanny exchanged vows but that sufficed not fanny insisted on the right of treating with uniform kindness the son of her best friend in spite of his injustice and insolence the young men were often during the rural festivals brought into angry collision fanny was the peacemaker but a woman is the worst possible mediator between her rival lovers henry was sometimes irritated to complain to his father of louis presumption the spirit of the french revolution then awakening rendered a peasants assumptions peculiarly grating and it required madame de marvilles impartial gentleness to prevent fannys betrothed as now he was almost considered from being further oppressed at length it was decided that henry should absent himself for a time and visit paris he was enraged in the extreme by what he called his banishment noble and generous as he naturally was love was the tyrant of his soul and drove him almost to crime he entered into a fierce quarrel with his rival on the very eve of his departure it ended in a scene of violence and bloodshed no great real harm was done but monsieur de marville hitherto scarcely kept back from such a measure by his wife suddenly obtained an order for louis his father had died a year before to quit the territory within twelve hours fanny was commanded as she valued the favour of her friends to give him up the young men were both gone before any intercession could avail and that kind of peace which resembles desolation took possession of the chateau aware of the part she had taken in encouraging fannys attachment to her peasant lover madame de marville did not make herself a party to the tyranny of her husband she requested only of her protge to defer any decisive step and not to quit her guardianship until the return of her son which was to take place the following year fanny consented to such a delay although in doing so she had to resist the angry representations of her lover who exacted that she should quit the roof of his oppressors it was galling to his proud spirit that she should continue to receive benefits from them and injurious to his love that she should remain where his rivals name was the constant theme of discourse and the object of interest fanny in vain represented her debt of gratitude the absence of henry the impossibility that she could feel any undue sentiment towards the young seigneur not to hate him was a crime in louis eyes yet how in spite of his ill conduct could fanny hate her childhoods playmateher brother his violent passions excited to their utmost heightjealousy and the sense of impotent indignation raging in his heartlouis swore to revenge himself on the marvillesto forget and to abhor his mistresshis last words were a malediction on them and a violent denunciation of scorn upon her it will all be well yet thought fanny as she strove to calm the tumultuous and painful emotions to which his intemperate passion gave rise not only are storms the birth of the wild elements but of the heart of man and we can oppose patience and fortitude alone to their destructive violence a year will passi shall quit the chateau louis will acknowledge my truth and retract his frightful words she continued therefore to fulfil her duties cheerfully not permitting her thoughts to dwell on the idea that in spite of her struggles too painfully occupied herthe probability that louis would in the end renounce or forget her but committing her cause to the spirit of good she trusted that its influence would in the end prevail she had however much to endure for months passed and no tidings reached her of louis often she felt sick at heart often she became the prey of the darkest despair above all her tender heart missed the fond attentions of love the bliss of knowing that she bestowed happiness and the unrestrained intercourse to which mutual affection had given rise she cherished hope as a duty and faith in love rather than in her unjust and cruelly neglectful lover it was a hard task for she had nowhere to turn for consolation or encouragement madame de marville marked with gladness the total separation between them now that the danger that threatened her son was averted she relented having been influential in producing an attachment between fanny and one whom she deemed unworthy of her she redoubled her kindness and in the true continental fashion tried to get up a match between her and some one among her many and more prosperous admirers she failed but did not despair till she saw the poor girls cheek grow pale and her vivacity desert her as month after month passed away and the very name of louis appeared to be forgotten by all except herself the stirring and terrible events that took place at this time in france added to fannys distress of mind she had been familiarized to the discussion of the theories now attempted to be put in practice by the conversations of chaumont as each fresh account brought information of the guilty and sanguinary acts of men whose opinions were the same as those of her lover her fears on his account increased in a few words i shall hurry over this part of her story switzerland became agitated by the same commotions as tore the near kingdom the peasantry rose in tumult acts of violence and blood were committed at first at a distance from her retired valley but gradually approaching its precincts until at last the tree of liberty was set up in the neighbouring village monsieur de marville was an aristocrat of the most bigoted species in vain was the danger represented to him and the unwarlike state of his retinue he armed themhe hurried downhe came unawares on the crowd who were proclaiming the triumph of liberty rather by feasting than force on the first attack they were dispersed and one or two among them were wounded the pole they had gathered round was uprooted the emblematic cap trampled to the earth the governor returned victorious to his chateau this act of violence on his part seemed the match to fire a train of organized resistance to his authority of which none had dreamt before strangers from other cantons thronged into the valley rustic labours were cast aside popular assemblies were held and the peasants exercised in the use of arms one was coming to place himself at their head it was said who had been a party in the tumults at geneva louis chaumont was comingthe champion of liberty the sworn enemy of m de marville the influence of his presence soon became manifest the inhabitants of the chateau were besieged if one ventured beyond a certain limit he was assailed it was the resolve of louis that all within its walls should surrender themselves to his mercy what that might be the proud curl of his lip and the fire that glanced from his dark eyes rendered scarcely problematic fanny would not believe the worst of her lover but monsieur and madame de marville no longer restrained by any delicacy spoke of the leveller in unmeasured terms of abhorrence comparing him to the monsters who then reigned in france while the danger they incurred through him added a bitter sting to their words the peril grew each day famine began to make its appearance in the chateau while the intelligence which some of the more friendly peasants brought was indicative of preparations for a regular attack of the most formidable nature a summons at last came from the insurgents they were resolved to destroy the emblem of their slaverythe feudal halls of their tyrants they declared their intention of firing the chateau the next day and called on all within to deliver themselves up if they would not be buried in its ruins they offered their lives and free leave to depart to all save the governor himself who must place himself unconditionally at the mercy of their leader the wretch exclaimed his lady who thirsts for your blood fly if there is yet time for flight we you see are safe fly nor suffer these cruel dastards to boast of having murdered you m de marville yielded to these entreaties and representations he had sent for a military force to aid himit had been denied he saw that he himself as the detested person was the cause of danger to his family it was therefore agreed that he should seek a chlet situated on a mountain ten leagues distant where he might lie concealed till his family joined him accordingly in a base disguise he quitted at midnight the walls he was unable to defend a miserable night for the unfortunate beings left behind the coming day was to witness the destruction of their home and they beggars in the world were to wander through the inhospitable mountains till with caution and terror they could unobserved reach the remote and miserable chlet and learn the fate of the unhappy fugitive it was a sleepless night for all to add to madames agony she knew that her sons life was in danger in paristhat he had been denouncedand though yet untaken his escape was still uncertain from the turret of the castle that situated high on a rock commanded the valley below she sat the livelong night watching for every soundfearful of some shout some report of firearms which would announce the capture of her husband it was september the nights were chill pale and trembling she saw day break over the hills fanny had busied herself during these anxious hours by preparing for their departure the terrified domestics had already fled she the lady and the old lame gardener were all that remained at dawn she brought forth the mule and harnessed him to the rude vehicle which was to convey them to their place of refuge whatever was most valuable in the chateau had already been sent away long before or was secreted a few necessaries alone she provided and now she ascended the turret stairs and stood before her protectress announcing that all was ready and that they must depart at this last moment madame de marville appeared deprived of strength she strove to riseshe sank to the ground in a fit forgetful of her deserted state fanny called aloud for help and then her heart beat wildly as a quick youthful step was heard on the stairs who could he be would he come to insult their wretchednesshe the author of their woe the first glance changed the object of her terror henry flew to his mothers side and with broken exclamations and agitated questions demanded an explanation of what he saw he had fled for safety to the habitation of his parentshe found it deserted the first voice he heard was that of fanny crying for helpthe first sight that presented itself was his mother to all appearance dead lying on the floor of the turret her recovery was followed by brief explanations and a consultation of how his safety was to be provided for the name of chaumont excited his bitterest execrations with a soldiers haughty resolve he was darting from the castle to meet and to wreak vengeance on his rival his mother threw herself at his feet clasping his knees calling wildly on him not to desert her fannys gentle sweet voice was of more avail to calm his passion chevalier she said it is not thus that you must display your courage or protect the helpless to encounter yonder infuriated mob would be to run on certain death you must preserve yourself for your familyyou must have pity on your mother who cannot survive you be guided by me i beseech you henry yielded to her voice and a more reasonable arrangement took place the departure of madame de marville and fanny was expected at the village and a pledge had been given that they should proceed unmolested but deeply had the insurgents sworn that if the governor or his son whose arrival in the chateau had been suspected attempted to escape with them they should be immediately sacrificed to justice no disguise would sufficethe active observation of their enemies was known every inhabitant of the castle had been numberedthe fate of each ascertained save that of the two most detestedthe governor whose flight had not been discovered and his son whose arrival was so unexpected and ill timed as still they consulted a beat to arms was heard in the valley below it was the signal that the attack on the empty castle walls would soon begin there was no time for delay or hesitation henry placed himself at the bottom of the charrette straw and a variety of articles were heaped upon him the two women ascended in trepidation and the old gardener sat in front and held the reins in consequence of the disturbed state of the districts through which they were to passwhere the appearance of one of the upper classes excited the fiercest enmity and frightful insult if not death was their sure welcomemadame and her friend assumed a peasants garb and thus they wound their way down the steep the unhappy lady weeping bitterly fanny with tearless eyes but with pale cheek and compressed lips gazing for the last time on the abode which had been her refuge when in helpless infancy she was left an orphanwhere kindness and benevolence had waited on her and where her days had passed in innocence and peace and he drives us awayhim whom i lovedwhom i loveo misery they reached the foot of the eminence on which the chateau was placed and proceeded along the road which led directly through the village with the approach of danger vain regrets were exchanged for a lively sense of fear in the bosom of the hapless mother and for the exertion of her courage and forethought in fannys more energetic mind they passed a peasant or two who uttered a malediction or imprecation on them as they went then groups of two or three who were even more violent in gesture and menace when suddenly the sound of many steps came on their ears and at a turn of the road they met chaumont with a band of about twenty disciplined men fear not he said to madame de marville i will protect you from danger till you are beyond the village with a shriek the lady in answer threw herself in fannys arms fear not madamehe dares not injure you begone louis insult us not by your presence begone i say fanny spoke angrily she had not adopted this tone but that the ladys terror and the knowledge that even then the young soldier crouched at their feet burnt to spring up and confront his enemy made her use an authority which a woman always imagines that a lover dare not resist i do not insult you repeated chaumonti save you i have no quarrel with the lady tyrants alone need fear me you are not safe without my escort do not you false girl irritate me i have ensured her escape but yoursyou are in my power a violent movement at the bottom of the charrette called forth all fannys terrors take me she cried do with me what you please but you dare not you cannot raise a finger against the innocent begone i say let me never see you more you are obeyed on you fall the consequences thus after many months of separation did fanny and her lover meet she had purposed when she should see him to make an appeal to his better naturehis reason she had meant to use her all persuasive voice to recall him from the dangerous path he was treading several times indeed since his arrival in the valley she had endeavoured to obtain an interview with him but he dreaded her influence he had resolved on revenge and he feared to be turned back but now the unexpected presence of his rival robbed her of her self possession and forced her to change her plans she saw frightful danger in their meeting and all her endeavours were directed to the getting rid of her lover louis and his companions proceeded towards the chateau while the charrette of the fugitives moved on in the opposite direction they met many a ferocious group who were rushing forward to aid in the destruction of their home and glad they were in that awful hour that any object had power to divert the minds of their enemies from attention to themselves the road they pursued wound through the valley the precipitous mountain on one side a brawling stream on the other now they ascended higher and now again descended in their route while the road broken by the fall of rocks intersected by torrents which tore their way athwart it made their progress slow to get beyond the village was the aim of their desires when lo just as they came upon it and were in the very midst of its population which was pouring towards the castle suddenly the charrette sank in a deep rut it half upset and every spoke in the wheel giving way rendered the vehicle wholly useless fanny had indeed already sprung to the ground to examine what hope remained there was none grand dieu we are lost were the first words that escaped her while madame stood aghast trembling almost insensible knowing that the hope of her life the existence of her son depended on these miserable moments a peasant who owed fanny some kindness now advanced and in a kind of cavalier way as if to blemish as much as he could the matter of his offer by its manner told them that for the pleasure of getting rid of the aristocrats he would lend his carthere it was let them quickly bestow their lading in it and pursue their way as he spoke he caught up a box and began the transfer from one car to the other no no cried madame de marville as with a scream she sprang forward and grasped the arm of the man as he was in the very act of discovering her sons hiding place we will accept nothing from our base enemiesbegone with your offers we will die here rather than accept anything from such canaille the word was electric the fierce passions of the mob excited by the mischief they were about to perpetrate now burst like a stream into this new channel with violent execrations they rushed upon the unfortunate woman they would have torn her from the car but already her son had sprung from his hiding place and striking a violent blow at the foremost assailant checked for a moment their brutal outrages then again with a yell such as the savage indians alone could emulate they rushed on their prey mother and son were torn asunder and cries of a bas les aristocratsa la lanterne declared too truly their sanguinary designs at this moment louis appearedlouis whose fears for fanny had overcome his indignation and who returned to guard her while she perceiving him with a burst of joy called on him to rescue her friends his cry of arretez vous was loud and distinct amidst the uproar it was obeyed and then first he beheld his rival his oppressor his enemy in his power at first rage inflamed every feature to be replaced by an expression of triumph and implacable hatred fanny caught the fierce glance of his eye and grew pale she trembled as trying to be calm she said yes you behold he is here and you must save himand your own soul rescue him from death and be blest that your evil career enables you at least to perform this one good action for a moment louis seemed seeking for a word as a man meaning to stab may fumble for his daggers hilt unable in his agitation to grasp his weapon my friends at length he said let the women departwe have promised it ye may deal with the young aristocrat according to his merits a la lanterne burst in response from a hundred voices let his mother first depart could it be louis that spoke these words and had she loved this man to appeal to him was to rouse a tiger from his lair another thought darted into fannys mind she scarcely knew what she said or did but already knives were drawn already with a thrill of horror she thought she saw the blood of her childhoods playmate spilt like water on the earth she rushed forwardshe caught the upraised arm of onehe is no aristocrat she cried he is my husbandwill you murder one who forgetting his birth his duty his honour has married a peasant girlone of yourselves even this appeal had little effect upon the mob but it strangely affected her cruel lover grasping her arm with iron fingers he cried is this tale true art thou married to that manhis wife even sothe words died on her lips as she strove to form them terrified by their purport and the effect they might produce an inexplicable expression passed over chaumonts face the fierceness that jealousy had engendered for a moment was exalted almost to madness and then faded wholly away the stony heart within him softened at once a tide of warm human and overpowering emotion flowed into his soul he looked on her he had loved on her whom he had lost for ever and tears rushed into his eyes as he saw her trembling before him fear not at last he said fear neither for him nor yourself poor girl so young you shall not lose allso young you shall not become a widow he shall be saved yet it was no easy task even for him to stem the awakened passions of the bloodthirsty mob he had spent many an hour in exciting them against their seigneurs and now at once to control the violence to which he had given rise seemed impossible yet his energy his strong will overcame all opposition they should pierce the chevaliers heart he swore through his alone he prevailed he took the rein of their mule and led them out of the village all were silent fanny knew not what to say and surprise held the others mute louis went with them until a turn in the road hid them from the view of the village what his thoughts were none could guess he looked calm as resigning the rein into the chevaliers hands he gently bade them farewell touching his hat in reply to their salutations they moved on and fanny looked back to catch a last view of her lover he was standing where they left him when suddenly instead of returning on his steps into the village she saw him with rapid strides ascend the mountain side taking a well known path that conducted him away from the scene of his late exploits his pace was that of a man flying from pursuerssoon he was lost to sight astonishment still kept the fugitives silent as they pursued their way and when at last joy broke forth and madame de marville rejoicing in their escape embraced again and again her son he with the softest tenderness thanked fanny for his life she answered not but wept bitterly late that night they reached the destined chlet and found monsieur de marville arrived it was a half ruined miserable habitation perched among the snows cold and bare food was ill to be obtained and danger breathed around them fanny attended on them with assiduous care but she never spoke of the scene in the village and though she strove to look the same henry never addressed her but she grew pale and her voice trembled she could not divine her absent lovers thoughts but she knew that he believed her married to another and that other earnestly though she strove to rule her feelings became an object of abhorrence to her three weeks they passed in this wretched abode three weeks replete with alarm for the district around was in arms and the life of monsieur de marville loudly threatened they never slept but they dreaded the approach of the murderers food they had little and the inclement season visited them roughly fanny seemed to feel no inconvenience her voice was cheerful to console encourage and assist her friends appeared to occupy her whole heart at length one night they were roused by a violent knocking at the door of their hut monsieur de marville and henry were on their feet in a moment seizing their weapons as they rose it was a domestic of their own come to communicate the intelligence that the troubles were over that the legal government had reasserted its authority and invited the governor to return to berne they descended from their mountain refuge and the name of louis hovered on fannys lips but she spoke it not he seemed everywhere forgotten it was not until some time afterwards that she ascertained the fact that he had never been seen or heard of since he had parted from her on the morning of their escape the villagers had waited for him in vain they suspended their designs for they all depended upon him but he came not monsieur and madame de marville returned to their chateau with their son but fanny remained behind she would not inhabit the same roof as henry she recoiled even from receiving further benefits from his parents what could she do louis would doubtless discover the falsehood of her marriage but he dared not return and even if he communicated with her even though yet she loved him could she unite herself with one accused too truly of the most frightful crimes at first these doubts agitated her but by degrees they faded as oblivion closed over chaumonts name and he came not and she heard not of him and he was as dead to her then the memory of the past revived in her heart her love awoke with her despair his mysterious flight became the sole occupation of her thoughts time rolled on and brought its changes madame de marville diedhenry was united to anotherfanny remained to her own thoughts alone in the world a relation who lived at subiaco sent for her and there she went to take up her abode in vain she strove to wean herself from the memory of louisher love for him haunted her soul there was war in europe and every man was converted into a soldier the country was thinned of its inhabitants and each victory or defeat brought a new conscription at length peace came again and its return was celebrated with rejoicing many a soldier returned to his homeand one came back who had no home a man evidently suffering from recent wounds wayworn and sick asked for hospitality at fannys cottage it was readily afforded and he sat at her cottage fire and removed his cap from his brow his person was bent his cheeks fallen in yet those eyes of fire that quick animated look which almost brought the bright expression of youth back into his face could never be forgotten fanny gazed almost in alarm and then in joy and at last in her own sweet voice she said et toi louistu aussi es de retour louis had endured many a sorrow and many a hardship and most of all he had been called on to wage battle with his own fierce spirit the rage and hate which he had sedulously nourished suddenly became his tormentors and his tyrantsat the moment that love before too closely allied to them emancipated itself from their control love which is the source of all that is most generous and noble in our nature of self devotion and of high intent separated from the alloy he had blended with it asserted its undivided power over him strange that it should be so at the moment that he believed that he had lost her he loved for ever all his plans had been built for revenge he would destroy the family that oppressed him unbuild stone by stone the proud abode of their inheritance he would be the sole refuge and support of his mistress in exile and in poverty he had entered upon his criminal career with this design alone and with the anticipation of ending all by heaping benefits and the gifts of fortune upon fanny the very steps he had taken he now believed to be those that occasioned his defeat he had lost herthe lovely and the goodhe had lost her by proving unworthy yet not so unworthy was he as to make her the victim of his crimes the family he had vowed to ruin was now hers and every injury that befell them visited her to save her he must unweave his pernicious webs to keep her scatheless his dearest designs must fall to the ground a veil seemed rent before his eyes he had fled for he would not assist in the destruction of her fortunes he had not returned for it was torture to him to know that she lived the wife of another he entered the french army but in every change his altered feelings pursued him and to prove himself worthy of her he had lost was the constant aim of his ambition his excellent conduct led to his promotion and yet mishap still waited on him he was wounded even dangerously and became so incapable of service as to be forced to solicit his dismission this had occurred at the end of a hard campaign in germany and his intention was to pass into italy where a friend with whom he had formed an intimacy in the army promised to procure him some employment under government he passed through subiaco in his way and ignorant of its occupiers had asked for hospitality in his mistresss cottage if guilt can be expiated by repentance and reform as is the best lesson of religion louis had expiated his if constancy in love deserve reward these lovers deserved that which they reaped in the happiness consequent on their union her image side by side with all that is good in our nature had dwelt in his heart which thus became a shrine at which he sacrificed every evil passion it was a greater bliss than he had ever dared to anticipate to find that in so doing he had at the same time been conducing to the welfare of her he loved and that the lost and idolized being whom he worshipped founded the happiness of her life upon his return to virtue and the constancy of his affection xi the invisible girl this slender narrative has no pretensions to the regularity of a story or the development of situations and feelings it is but a slight sketch delivered nearly as it was narrated to me by one of the humblest of the actors concerned nor will i spin out a circumstance interesting principally from its singularity and truth but narrate as concisely as i can how i was surprised on visiting what seemed a ruined tower crowning a bleak promontory overhanging the sea that flows between wales and ireland to find that though the exterior preserved all the savage rudeness that betokened many a war with the elements the interior was fitted up somewhat in the guise of a summer house for it was too small to deserve any other name it consisted but of the ground floor which served as an entrance and one room above which was reached by a staircase made out of the thickness of the wall this chamber was floored and carpeted decorated with elegant furniture and above all to attract the attention and excite curiosity there hung over the chimney piecefor to preserve the apartment from damp a fireplace had been built evidently since it had assumed a guise so dissimilar to the object of its constructiona picture simply painted in water colours which deemed more than any part of the adornments of the room to be at war with the rudeness of the building the solitude in which it was placed and the desolation of the surrounding scenery this drawing represented a lovely girl in the very pride and bloom of youth her dress was simple in the fashion of the beginning of the eighteenth century her countenance was embellished by a look of mingled innocence and intelligence to which was added the imprint of serenity of soul and natural cheerfulness she was reading one of those folio romances which have so long been the delight of the enthusiastic and young her mandoline was at her feether parroquet perched on a huge mirror near her the arrangement of furniture and hangings gave token of a luxurious dwelling and her attire also evidently that of home and privacy yet bore with it an appearance of ease and girlish ornament as if she wished to please beneath this picture was inscribed in golden letters the invisible girl rambling about a country nearly uninhabited having lost my way and being overtaken by a shower i had lighted on this dreary looking tenement which seemed to rock in the blast and to be hung up there as the very symbol of desolation i was gazing wistfully and cursing inwardly my stars which led me to a ruin that could afford no shelter though the storm began to pelt more seriously than before when i saw an old womans head popped out from a kind of loophole and as suddenly withdrawna minute after a feminine voice called to me from within and penetrating a little brambly maze that screened a door which i had not before observed so skilfully had the planter succeeded in concealing art with nature i found the good dame standing on the threshold and inviting me to take refuge within i had just come up from our cot hard by she said to look after the things as i do every day when the rain came onwill ye walk up till it is over i was about to observe that the cot hard by at the venture of a few rain drops was better than a ruined tower and to ask my kind hostess whether the things were pigeons or crows that she was come to look after when the matting of the floor and the carpeting of the staircase struck my eye i was still more surprised when i saw the room above and beyond all the picture and its singular inscription naming her invisible whom the painter had coloured forth into very agreeable visibility awakened my most lively curiosity the result of this of my exceeding politeness towards the old woman and her own natural garrulity was a kind of garbled narrative which my imagination eked out and future inquiries rectified till it assumed the following form some years before in the afternoon of a september day which though tolerably fair gave many tokens of a tempestuous night a gentleman arrived at a little coast town about ten miles from this place he expressed his desire to hire a boat to carry him to the town of about fifteen miles farther on the coast the menaces which the sky held forth made the fishermen loathe to venture till at length two one the father of a numerous family bribed by the bountiful reward the stranger promised the other the son of my hostess induced by youthful daring agreed to undertake the voyage the wind was fair and they hoped to make good way before nightfall and to get into port ere the rising of the storm they pushed off with good cheer at least the fishermen did as for the stranger the deep mourning which he wore was not half so black as the melancholy that wrapt his mind he looked as if he had never smiledas if some unutterable thought dark as night and bitter as death had built its nest within his bosom and brooded therein eternally he did not mention his name but one of the villagers recognised him as henry vernon the son of a baronet who possessed a mansion about three miles distant from the town for which he was bound this mansion was almost abandoned by the family but henry had in a romantic fit visited it about three years before and sir peter had been down there during the previous spring for about a couple of months the boat did not make so much way as was expected the breeze failed them as they got out to sea and they were fain with oar as well as sail to try to weather the promontory that jutted out between them and the spot they desired to reach they were yet far distant when the shifting wind began to exert its strength and to blow with violent though unequal blasts night came on pitchy dark and the howling waves rose and broke with frightful violence menacing to overwhelm the tiny bark that dared resist their fury they were forced to lower every sail and take to their oars one man was obliged to bale out the water and vernon himself took an oar and rowing with desperate energy equalled the force of the more practised boatmen there had been much talk between the sailors before the tempest came on now except a brief command all were silent one thought of his wife and children and silently cursed the caprice of the stranger that endangered in its effects not only his life but their welfare the other feared less for he was a daring lad but he worked hard and had no time for speech while vernon bitterly regretting the thoughtlessness which had made him cause others to share a peril unimportant as far as he himself was concerned now tried to cheer them with a voice full of animation and courage and now pulled yet more strongly at the oar he held the only person who did not seem wholly intent on the work he was about was the man who baled every now and then he gazed intently round as if the sea held afar off on its tumultuous waste some object that he strained his eyes to discern but all was blank except as the crests of the high waves showed themselves or far out on the verge of the horizon a kind of lifting of the clouds betokened greater violence for the blast at length he exclaimed yes i see itthe larboard oarnow if we can make yonder light we are saved both the rowers instinctively turned their headsbut cheerless darkness answered their gaze you cannot see it cried their companion but we are nearing it and please god we shall outlive this night soon he took the oar from vernons hand who quite exhausted was failing in his strokes he rose and looked for the beacon which promised them safetyit glimmered with so faint a ray that now he said i see it and again it is nothing still as they made way it dawned upon his sight growing more steady and distinct as it beamed across the lurid waters which themselves became smoother so that safety seemed to arise from the bosom of the ocean under the influence of that flickering gleam what beacon is it that helps us at our need asked vernon as the men now able to manage their oars with greater ease found breath to answer his question a fairy one i believe replied the elder sailor yet no less a true it burns in an old tumble down tower built on the top of a rock which looks over the sea we never saw it before this summer and now each night it is to be seenat least when it is looked for for we cannot see it from our villageand it is such an out of the way place that no one has need to go near it except through a chance like this some say it is burnt by witches some say by smugglers but this i know two parties have been to search and found nothing but the bare walls of the tower all is deserted by day and dark by night for no light was to be seen while we were there though it burned sprightly enough when we were out at sea i have heard say observed the younger sailor it is burnt by the ghost of a maiden who lost her sweetheart in these parts he being wrecked and his body found at the foot of the tower she goes by the name among us of the invisible girl the voyagers had now reached the landing place at the foot of the tower vernon cast a glance upwardthe light was still burning with some difficulty struggling with the breakers and blinded by night they contrived to get their little bark to shore and to draw her up on the beach they then scrambled up the precipitous pathway overgrown by weeds and underwood and guided by the more experienced fisherman they found the entrance to the tower door or gate there was none and all was dark as the tomb and silent and almost as cold as death this will never do said vernon surely our hostess will show her light if not herself and guide our darkling steps by some sign of life and comfort we will get to the upper chamber said the sailor if i can but hit upon the broken down steps but you will find no trace of the invisible girl nor her light either i warrant truly a romantic adventure of the most disagreeable kind muttered vernon as he stumbled over the unequal ground she of the beacon light must be both ugly and old or she would not be so peevish and inhospitable with considerable difficulty and after divers knocks and bruises the adventurers at length succeeded in reaching the upper storey but all was blank and bare and they were fain to stretch themselves on the hard floor when weariness both of mind and body conduced to steep their senses in sleep long and sound were the slumbers of the mariners vernon but forgot himself for an hour then throwing off drowsiness and finding his rough couch uncongenial to repose he got up and placed himself at the hole that served for a windowfor glass there was none and there being not even a rough bench he leant his back against the embrasure as the only rest he could find he had forgotten his danger the mysterious beacon and its invisible guardian his thoughts were occupied on the horrors of his own fate and the unspeakable wretchedness that sat like a nightmare on his heart it would require a good sized volume to relate the causes which had changed the once happy vernon into the most woful mourner that ever clung to the outer trappings of grief as slight though cherished symbols of the wretchedness within henry was the only child of sir peter vernon and as much spoiled by his fathers idolatry as the old baronets violent and tyrannical temper would permit a young orphan was educated in his fathers house who in the same way was treated with generosity and kindness and yet who lived in deep awe of sir peters authority who was a widower and these two children were all he had to exert his power over or to whom to extend his affection rosina was a cheerful tempered girl a little timid and careful to avoid displeasing her protector but so docile so kind hearted and so affectionate that she felt even less than henry the discordant spirit of his parent it is a tale often told they were playmates and companions in childhood and lovers in after days rosina was frightened to imagine that this secret affection and the vows they pledged might be disapproved of by sir peter but sometimes she consoled herself by thinking that perhaps she was in reality her henrys destined bride brought up with him under the design of their future union and henry while he felt that this was not the case resolved to wait only until he was of age to declare and accomplish his wishes in making the sweet rosina his wife meanwhile he was careful to avoid premature discovery of his intentions so to secure his beloved girl from persecution and insult the old gentleman was very conveniently blind he lived always in the country and the lovers spent their lives together unrebuked and uncontrolled it was enough that rosina played on her mandoline and sang sir peter to sleep every day after dinner she was the sole female in the house above the rank of a servant and had her own way in the disposal of her time even when sir peter frowned her innocent caresses and sweet voice were powerful to smooth the rough current of his temper if ever human spirit lived in an earthly paradise rosina did at this time her pure love was made happy by henrys constant presence and the confidence they felt in each other and the security with which they looked forward to the future rendered their path one of roses under a cloudless sky sir peter was the slight drawback that only rendered their tte tte more delightful and gave value to the sympathy they each bestowed on the other all at once an ominous personage made its appearance in vernon place in the shape of a widow sister of sir peter who having succeeded in killing her husband and children with the effects of her vile temper came like a harpy greedy for new prey under her brothers roof she too soon detected the attachment of the unsuspicious pair she made all speed to impart her discovery to her brother and at once to restrain and inflame his rage through her contrivance henry was suddenly despatched on his travels abroad that the coast might be clear for the persecution of rosina and then the richest of the lovely girls many admirers whom under sir peters single reign she was allowed nay almost commanded to dismiss so desirous was he of keeping her for his own comfort was selected and she was ordered to marry him the scenes of violence to which she was now exposed the bitter taunts of the odious mrs bainbridge and the reckless fury of sir peter were the more frightful and overwhelming from their novelty to all she could only oppose a silent tearful but immutable steadiness of purpose no threats no rage could extort from her more than a touching prayer that they would not hate her because she could not obey there must be something we dont see under all this said mrs bainbridge take my word for it brother she corresponds secretly with henry let us take her down to your seat in wales where she will have no pensioned beggars to assist her and we shall see if her spirit be not bent to our purpose sir peter consented and they all three took up their abode in the solitary and dreary looking house before alluded to as belonging to the family here poor rosinas sufferings grew intolerable before surrounded by well known scenes and in perpetual intercourse with kind and familiar faces she had not despaired in the end of conquering by her patience the cruelty of her persecutorsnor had she written to henry for his name had not been mentioned by his relatives nor their attachment alluded to and she felt an instinctive wish to escape the dangers about her without his being annoyed or the sacred secret of her love being laid bare and wronged by the vulgar abuse of his aunt or the bitter curses of his father but when she was taken to wales and made a prisoner in her apartment when the flinty mountains about her seemed feebly to imitate the stony hearts she had to deal with her courage began to fail the only attendant permitted to approach her was mrs bainbridges maid and under the tutelage of her fiend like mistress this woman was used as a decoy to entice the poor prisoner into confidence and then to be betrayed the simple kind hearted rosina was a facile dupe and at last in the excess of her despair wrote to henry and gave the letter to this woman to be forwarded the letter in itself would have softened marble it did not speak of their mutual vows it but asked him to intercede with his father that he would restore her to the place she had formerly held in his affections and cease from a cruelty that would destroy her for i may die wrote the hapless girl but marry anothernever that single word indeed had sufficed to betray her secret had it not been already discovered as it was it gave increased fury to sir peter as his sister triumphantly pointed it out to him for it need hardly be said that while the ink of the address was yet wet and the seal still warm rosinas letter was carried to this lady the culprit was summoned before them what ensued none could tell for their own sakes the cruel pair tried to palliate their part voices were high and the soft murmur of rosinas tone was lost in the howling of sir peter and the snarling of his sister out of doors you shall go roared the old man under my roof you shall not spend another night and the words infamous seductress and worse such as had never met the poor girls ear before were caught by listening servants and to each angry speech of the baronet mrs bainbridge added an envenomed point worse than all more dead then alive rosina was at last dismissed whether guided by despair whether she took sir peters threats literally or whether his sisters orders were more decisive none knew but rosina left the house a servant saw her cross the park weeping and wringing her hands as she went what became of her none could tell her disappearance was not disclosed to sir peter till the following day and then he showed by his anxiety to trace her steps and to find her that his words had been but idle threats the truth was that though sir peter went to frightful lengths to prevent the marriage of the heir of his house with the portionless orphan the object of his charity yet in his heart he loved rosina and half his violence to her rose from anger at himself for treating her so ill now remorse began to sting him as messenger after messenger came back without tidings of his victim he dared not confess his worst fears to himself and when his inhuman sister trying to harden her conscience by angry words cried the vile hussy has too surely made away with herself out of revenge to us an oath the most tremendous and a look sufficient to make even her tremble commanded her silence her conjecture however appeared too true a dark and rushing stream that flowed at the extremity of the park had doubtless received the lovely form and quenched the life of this unfortunate girl sir peter when his endeavours to find her proved fruitless returned to town haunted by the image of his victim and forced to acknowledge in his own heart that he would willingly lay down his life could he see her again even though it were as the bride of his sonhis son before whose questioning he quailed like the veriest coward for when henry was told of the death of rosina he suddenly returned from abroad to ask the causeto visit her grave and mourn her loss in the groves and valleys which had been the scenes of their mutual happiness he made a thousand inquiries and an ominous silence alone replied growing more earnest and more anxious at length he drew from servants and dependents and his odious aunt herself the whole dreadful truth from that moment despair struck his heart and misery named him her own he fled from his fathers presence and the recollection that one whom he ought to revere was guilty of so dark a crime haunted him as of old the eumenides tormented the souls of men given up to their torturings his first his only wish was to visit wales and to learn if any new discovery had been made and whether it were possible to recover the mortal remains of the lost rosina so to satisfy the unquiet longings of his miserable heart on this expedition was he bound when he made his appearance at the village before named and now in the deserted tower his thoughts were busy with images of despair and death and what his beloved one had suffered before her gentle nature had been goaded to such a deed of woe while immersed in gloomy reverie to which the monotonous roaring of the sea made fit accompaniment hours flew on and vernon was at last aware that the light of morning was creeping from out its eastern retreat and dawning over the wild ocean which still broke in furious tumult on the rocky beach his companions now roused themselves and prepared to depart the food they had brought with them was damaged by sea water and their hunger after hard labour and many hours fasting had become ravenous it was impossible to put to sea in their shattered boat but there stood a fishers cot about two miles off in a recess in the bay of which the promontory on which the tower stood formed one side and to this they hastened to repair they did not spend a second thought on the light which had saved them nor its cause but left the ruin in search of a more hospitable asylum vernon cast his eyes round as he quitted it but no vestige of an inhabitant met his eye and he began to persuade himself that the beacon had been a creation of fancy merely arriving at the cottage in question which was inhabited by a fisherman and his family they made a homely breakfast and then prepared to return to the tower to refit their boat and if possible bring her round vernon accompanied them together with their host and his son several questions were asked concerning the invisible girl and her light each agreeing that the apparition was novel and not one being able to give even an explanation of how the name had become affixed to the unknown cause of this singular appearance though both of the men of the cottage affirmed that once or twice they had seen a female figure in the adjacent wood and that now and then a stranger girl made her appearance at another cot a mile off on the other side of the promontory and bought bread they suspected both these to be the same but could not tell the inhabitants of the cot indeed appeared too stupid even to feel curiosity and had never made any attempt at discovery the whole day was spent by the sailors in repairing the boat and the sound of hammers and the voices of the men at work resounded along the coast mingled with the dashing of the waves this was no time to explore the ruin for one who whether human or supernatural so evidently withdrew herself from intercourse with every living being vernon however went over the tower and searched every nook in vain the dingy bare walls bore no token of serving as a shelter and even a little recess in the wall of the staircase which he had not before observed was equally empty and desolate quitting the tower he wandered in the pine wood that surrounded it and giving up all thought of solving the mystery was soon engrossed by thoughts that touched his heart more nearly when suddenly there appeared on the ground at his feet the vision of a slipper since cinderella so tiny a slipper had never been seen as plain as shoe could speak it told a tale of elegance loveliness and youth vernon picked it up he had often admired rosinas singularly small foot and his first thought was a question whether this little slipper would have fitted it it was very strangeit must belong to the invisible girl then there was a fairy form that kindled that lighta form of such material substance that its foot needed to be shod and yet how shodwith kid so fine and of shape so exquisite that it exactly resembled such as rosina wore again the recurrence of the image of the beloved dead came forcibly across him and a thousand home felt associations childish yet sweet and lover like though trifling so filled vernons heart that he threw himself his length on the ground and wept more bitterly than ever the miserable fate of the sweet orphan in the evening the men quitted their work and vernon returned with them to the cot where they were to sleep intending to pursue their voyage weather permitting the following morning vernon said nothing of his slipper but returned with his rough associates often he looked back but the tower rose darkly over the dim waves and no light appeared preparations had been made in the cot for their accommodation and the only bed in it was offered vernon but he refused to deprive his hostess and spreading his cloak on a heap of dry leaves endeavoured to give himself up to repose he slept for some hours and when he awoke all was still save that the hard breathing of the sleepers in the same room with him interrupted the silence he rose and going to the window looked out over the now placid sea towards the mystic tower the light was burning there sending its slender rays across the waves congratulating himself on a circumstance he had not anticipated vernon softly left the cottage and wrapping his cloak round him walked with a swift pace round the bay towards the tower he reached it still the light was burning to enter and restore the maiden her shoe would be but an act of courtesy and vernon intended to do this with such caution as to come unaware before its wearer could with her accustomed arts withdraw herself from his eyes but unluckily while yet making his way up the narrow pathway his foot dislodged a loose fragment that fell with crash and sound down the precipice he sprung forward on this to retrieve by speed the advantage he had lost by this unlucky accident he reached the door he entered all was silent but also all was dark he paused in the room below he felt sure that a slight sound met his ear he ascended the steps and entered the upper chamber but blank obscurity met his penetrating gaze the starless night admitted not even a twilight glimmer through the only aperture he closed his eyes to try on opening them again to be able to catch some faint wandering ray on the visual nerve but it was in vain he groped round the room he stood still and held his breath and then listening intently he felt sure that another occupied the chamber with him and that its atmosphere was slightly agitated by anothers respiration he remembered the recess in the staircase but before he approached it he spokehe hesitated a moment what to say i must believe he said that misfortune alone can cause your seclusion and if the assistance of a manof a gentleman an exclamation interrupted him a voice from the grave spoke his namethe accents of rosina syllabled henryis it indeed henry whom i hear he rushed forward directed by the sound and clasped in his arms the living form of his own lamented girlhis own invisible girl he called her for even yet as he felt her heart beat near his and as he entwined her waist with his arm supporting her as she almost sank to the ground with agitation he could not see her and as her sobs prevented her speech no sense but the instinctive one that filled his heart with tumultuous gladness told him that the slender wasted form he pressed so fondly was the living shadow of the hebe beauty he had adored the morning saw this pair thus strangely restored to each other on the tranquil sea sailing with a fair wind for l whence they were to proceed to sir peters seat which three months before rosina had quitted in such agony and terror the morning light dispelled the shadows that had veiled her and disclosed the fair person of the invisible girl altered indeed she was by suffering and woe but still the same sweet smile played on her lips and the tender light of her soft blue eyes were all her own vernon drew out the slipper and showed the cause that had occasioned him to resolve to discover the guardian of the mystic beacon even now he dared not inquire how she had existed in that desolate spot or wherefore she had so sedulously avoided observation when the right thing to have been done was to have sought him immediately under whose care protected by whose love no danger need be feared but rosina shrunk from him as he spoke and a deathlike pallor came over her cheek as she faintly whispered your fathers curseyour fathers dreadful threats it appeared indeed that sir peters violence and the cruelty of mrs bainbridge had succeeded in impressing rosina with wild and unvanquishable terror she had fled from their house without plan or forethoughtdriven by frantic horror and overwhelming fear she had left it with scarcely any money and there seemed to her no possibility of either returning or proceeding onward she had no friend except henry in the wide world whither could she goto have sought henry would have sealed their fates to misery for with an oath sir peter had declared he would rather see them both in their coffins than married after wandering about hiding by day and only venturing forth at night she had come to this deserted tower which seemed a place of refuge how she had lived since then she could hardly tell she had lingered in the woods by day or slept in the vault of the tower an asylum none were acquainted with or had discovered by night she burned the pinecones of the wood and night was her dearest time for it seemed to her as if security came with darkness she was unaware that sir peter had left that part of the country and was terrified lest her hiding place should be revealed to him her only hope was that henry would returnthat henry would never rest till he had found her she confessed that the long interval and the approach of winter had visited her with dismay she feared that as her strength was failing and her form wasting to a skeleton that she might die and never see her own henry more an illness indeed in spite of all his care followed her restoration to security and the comforts of civilised life many months went by before the bloom revisiting her cheeks and her limbs regaining their roundness she resembled once more the picture drawn of her in her days of bliss before any visitation of sorrow it was a copy of this portrait that decorated the tower the scene of her suffering in which i had found shelter sir peter overjoyed to be relieved from the pangs of remorse and delighted again to see his orphan ward whom he really loved was now as eager as before he had been averse to bless her union with his son mrs bainbridge they never saw again but each year they spent a few months in their welsh mansion the scene of their early wedded happiness and the spot where again poor rosina had awoke to life and joy after her cruel persecutions henrys fond care had fitted up the tower and decorated it as i saw and often did he come over with his invisible girl to renew in the very scene of its occurrence the remembrance of all the incidents which had led to their meeting again during the shades of night in that sequestered ruin xii the brother and sister an italian story it is well known that the hatred borne by one family against another and the strife of parties which often led to bloodshed in the italian cities during the middle ages so vividly described by shakespeare in romeo and juliet was not confined to the montecchi and ciapelletti of verona but existed with equal animosity in almost every other town of that beautiful peninsula the greatest men among them were the victims and crowds of exilesfamilies who but the day before were in the full enjoyment of the luxuries of life and the endearing associations of homewere every now and then seen issuing from the gates of their native cities deprived of every possession and with melancholy and slow steps dragging their wearied limbs to the nearest asylum offered them thence to commence a new career of dependence and poverty to endure to the end of their lives or until some lucky accident should enable them to change places with their enemies making those the sufferers who were late the tyrants in that country where each town formed an independent state to change one for the other was to depart from the spot cherished as a country and a home for distant banishmentor worse for as each city entertained either hatred or contempt for its neighbour it often happened that the mourning exile was obliged to take up his abode among a people whom he had injured or scoffed foreign service offered a resource to the young and bold among the men but lovely italy was to be left the ties of young hearts severed and all the endearing associations of kin and country broken and scattered for ever the italians were always peculiarly susceptible to these misfortunes they loved their native walls the abodes of their ancestors the familiar scenes of youth with all the passionate fervour characteristic of that clime it was therefore no uncommon thing for any one among them like foscari of venice to prefer destitution and danger in their own city to a precarious subsistence among strangers in distant lands or if compelled to quit the beloved precincts of their native walls still to hover near ready to avail themselves of the first occasion that should present itself for reversing the decree that condemned them to misery for three days and nights there had been warfare in the streets of sienablood flowed in torrentsyet the cries and groans of the fallen but excited their friends to avenge themnot their foes to spare on the fourth morning ugo mancini with a scanty band of followers was driven from the town succours from florence had arrived for his enemies and he was forced to yield burning with rage writhing with an impotent thirst for vengeance ugo went round to the neighbouring villages to rouse them not against his native town but the victorious tolomei unsuccessful in these endeavours he next took the more equivocal step of seeking warlike aid from the pisans but florence kept pisa in check and ugo found only an inglorious refuge where he had hoped to acquire active allies he had been wounded in these struggles but animated by a superhuman spirit he had forgotten his pain and surmounted his weakness nor was it until a cold refusal was returned to his energetic representations that he sank beneath his physical sufferings he was stretched on a bed of torture when he received intelligence that an edict of perpetual banishment and confiscation of property was passed against him his two children beggars now were sent to him his wife was dead and these were all of near relations that he possessed his bitter feelings were still too paramount for him to receive comfort from their presence yet these agitated and burning emotions appeared in after times a remnant of happiness compared to the total loss of every hopethe wasting inaction of sickness and of poverty for five years ugo mancini lay stretched on his couch alternating between states of intense pain and overpowering weakness and then he died during this interval the wreck of his fortunes consisting of the rent of a small farm and the use of some money lent scantily supported him his few relatives and followers were obliged to seek their subsistence elsewhere and he remained alone to his pain and to his two children who yet clung to the paternal side hatred to his foes and love for his native town were the sentiments that possessed his soul and which he imparted in their full force to the plastic mind of his son which received like molten metal the stamp he desired to impress lorenzo was scarcely twelve years old at the period of his fathers exile and he naturally turned with fondness towards the spot where he had enjoyed every happiness where each hour had been spent in light hearted hilarity and the kindness and observance of many attended on his steps now how sad the contrastdim penurya solitude cheered by no encouraging smiles or sunny flatteriesperpetual attendance on his father and untimely cares cast their dark shadows over his altered lot lorenzo was a few years older than his sister friendless and destitute as was the exiles family it was he who overlooked its moderate disbursements who was at once his fathers nurse and his sisters guardian and acted as the head of the family during the incapacity of his parent but instead of being narrowed or broken in spirit by these burdens his ardent soul rose to meet them and grew enlarged and lofty from the very calls made upon it his look was serious not careworn his manner calm not humble his voice had all the tenderness of a womanhis eye all the pride and fire of a hero still his unhappy father wasted away and lorenzos hours were entirely spent beside his bed he was indefatigable in his attentionsweariness never seemed to overcome him his limbs were always alerthis speech inspiriting and kind his only pastime was during any interval in his parents sufferings to listen to his eulogiums on his native town and to the history of the wrongs which from time immemorial the mancini had endured from the tolomei lorenzo though replete with noble qualities was still an italian and fervent love for his birthplace and violent hatred towards the foes of his house were the darling passions of his heart nursed in loneliness they acquired vigour and the nights he spent in watching his father were varied by musing on the career he should hereafter followhis return to his beloved siena and the vengeance he would take on his enemies ugo often said i die because i am an exileat length these words were fulfilled and the unhappy man sank beneath the ills of fortune lorenzo saw his beloved father expirehis father whom he loved he seemed to deposit in his obscure grave all that best deserved reverence and honour in the world and turning away his steps he lamented the loss of the sad occupation of so many years and regretted the exchange he made from his fathers sick bed to a lonely and unprized freedom the first use he made of the liberty he had thus acquired was to return to siena with his sister he entered his native town as if it were a paradise and he found it a desert in all save the hues of beauty and delight with which his imagination loved to invest it there was no one to whom he could draw near in friendship within the whole circuit of its walls according to the barbarous usage of the times his fathers palace had been razed and the mournful ruins stood as a tomb to commemorate the fall of his fortunes not as such did lorenzo view them he often stole out at nightfall when the stars alone beheld his enthusiasm and clambering to the highest part of the massy fragments spent long hours in mentally rebuilding the desolate walls and in consecrating once again the weed grown hearth to family love and hospitable festivity it seemed to him that the air was more balmy and light breathed amidst these memorials of the past and his heart warmed with rapture over the tale they told of what his progenitors had beenwhat he again would be yet had he viewed his position sanely he would have found it full of mortification and pain and he would have become aware that his native town was perhaps the only place in the world where his ambition would fail in the attainment of its aim the tolomei reigned over it they had led its citizens to conquest and enriched them with spoils they were adored and to flatter them the populace were prone to revile and scoff at the name of mancini lorenzo did not possess one friend within its walls he heard the murmur of hatred as he passed along and beheld his enemies raised to the pinnacle of power and honour and yet so strangely framed is the human heart that he continued to love siena and would not have exchanged his obscure and penurious abode within its walls to become the favoured follower of the german emperor such a place through education and the natural prejudices of man did siena hold in his imagination that a lowly condition there seemed a nobler destiny than to be great in any other spot to win back the friendship of its citizens and humble his enemies was the dream that shed so sweet an influence over his darkened hours he dedicated his whole being to this work and he did not doubt but that he should succeed the house of tolomei had for its chief a youth but a year or two older than himselfwith him when an opportunity should present itself he would enter the lists it seemed the bounty of providence that gave him one so nearly equal with whom to contend and during the interval that must elapse before they could clash he was busy in educating himself for the struggle count fabian dei tolomei bore the reputation of being a youth full of promise and talent and lorenzo was glad to anticipate a worthy antagonist he occupied himself in the practice of arms and applied with perseverance to the study of the few books that fell in his way he appeared in the market place on public occasions modestly attired yet his height his dignified carriage and the thoughtful cast of his noble countenance drew the observation of the bystandersthough such was the prejudice against his name and the flattery of the triumphant party that taunts and maledictions followed him his nobility of appearance was called pride his affability meanness his aspiring views factionand it was declared that it would be a happy day when he should no longer blot their sunshine with his shadow lorenzo smiledhe disdained to resent or even to feel the mistaken insults of the crowd who if fortune changed would the next day throw up their caps for him it was only when loftier foes approached that his brow grew dark that he drew himself up to his full height repaying their scorn with glances of defiance and hate but although he was ready in his own person to encounter the contumely of his townsmen and walked on with placid mien regardless of their sneers he carefully guarded his sister from such scenes she was led by him each morning closely veiled to hear mass in an obscure church and when on feast days the public walks were crowded with cavaliers and dames in splendid attire and with citizens and peasants in their holiday garb this gentle pair might be seen in some solitary and shady spot flora knew none to love except her brothershe had grown under his eyes from infancy and while he attended on the sick bed of their father he was father brother tutor guardian to herthe fondest mother could not have been more indulgent and yet there was mingled a something beyond pertaining to their difference of sex uniformly observant and kind he treated her as if she had been a high born damsel nurtured in her gayest bower her attire was simplebut thus she was instructed it befitted every damsel to dress her needle works were such as a princess might have emulated and while she learnt under her brothers tutelage to be reserved studious of obscurity and always occupied she was taught that such were the virtues becoming her sex and no idea of dependence or penury was raised in her mind had he been the sole human being that approached her she might have believed herself to be on a level with the highest in the land but coming in contact with dependants in the humble class of life flora became acquainted with her true position and learnt at the same time to understand and appreciate the unequalled kindness and virtues of her brother two years passed while brother and sister continued in obscurity and poverty cherishing hope honour and mutual love if an anxious thought ever crossed lorenzo it was for the future destiny of flora whose beauty as a child gave promise of perfect loveliness hereafter for her sake he was anxious to begin the career he had marked out for himself and resolved no longer to delay his endeavours to revive his party in siena and to seek rather than avoid a contest with the young count fabian on whose overthrow he would risecount fabian the darling of the citizens vaunted as a model for a youthful cavalier abounding in good qualities and so adorned by gallantry subtle wit and gay winning manners that he stepped by right of nature as well as birth on the pedestal which exalted him the idol of all around it was on a day of public feasting that lorenzo first presented himself in rivalship with fabian his person was unknown to the count who in all the pride of rich dress and splendid accoutrements looked with a smile of patronage on the poorly mounted and plainly attired youth who presented himself to run a tilt with him but before the challenge was accepted the name of his antagonist was whispered to fabian then all the bitterness engendered by family feuds all the spirit of vengeance which had been taught as a religion arose at once in the young nobles heart he wheeled round his steed and riding rudely up to his competitor ordered him instantly to retire from the course nor dare to disturb the revels of the citizens by the hated presence of a mancini lorenzo answered with equal scorn and fabian governed by uncontrollable passion called together his followers to drive the youth with ignominy from the lists a fearful array was mustered against the hateful intruder but had their number been trebled the towering spirit of lorenzo had met them all one fellanother was disabled by his weapon before he was disarmed and made prisoner but his bravery did not avail to extract admiration from his prejudiced foes they rather poured execrations on him for its disastrous effects as they hurried him to a dungeon and called loudly for his punishment and death far from this scene of turmoil and bloodshed in her poor but quiet chamber in a remote and obscure part of the town sat flora occupied by her embroidery musing as she worked on her brothers project and anticipating his success hours passed and lorenzo did not return the day declined and still he tarried floras busy fancy forged a thousand causes for the delay her brothers prowess had awaked the chilly zeal of the partisans of their familyhe was doubtless feasting among them and the first stone was laid for the rebuilding of their house at last a rush of steps upon the staircase and a confused clamour of female voices calling loudly for admittance made her rise and open the doorin rushed several womendismay was painted on their facestheir words flowed in torrentstheir eager gestures helped them to a meaning and though not without difficulty amidst the confusion flora heard of the disaster and imprisonment of her brotherof the blood shed by his hand and the fatal issue that such a deed ensured she grew pale as marble her young heart was filled with speechless terror she could form no image of the thing she dreaded but its indistinct idea was full of fear lorenzo was in prisoncount fabian had placed him therehe was to die overwhelmed for a moment by such tidings yet she rose above their benumbing power and without proffering a word or listening to the questions and remonstrances of the women she rushed past them down the high staircase into the street and then with swift pace to where the public prison was situated she knew the spot she wished to reach but she had so seldom quitted her home that she soon got entangled among the streets and proceeded onwards at random breathless at length she paused before the lofty portal of a large palaceno one was nearthe fast fading twilight of an italian evening had deepened into absolute darkness at this moment the glare of flambeaux was thrown upon the street and a party of horsemen rode up they were talking and laughing gaily she heard one addressed as count fabian she involuntarily drew back with instinctive hate and then rushed forward and threw herself at his horses feet exclaiming save my brother the young cavalier reined up shortly his prancing steed angrily reproving her for her heedlessness and without deigning another word entered the courtyard he had not perhaps heard her prayerhe could not see the suppliant he spoke but in the impatience of the momentbut the poor child deeply wounded by what had the appearance of a personal insult turned proudly from the door repressing the bitter tears that filled her eyes still she walked on but night took from her every chance of finding her way to the prison and she resolved to return home to engage one of the women of the house of which she occupied a part to accompany her but even to find her way back became matter of difficulty and she wandered on discovering no clue to guide her and far too timid to address any one she might chance to meet fatigue and personal fear were added to her other griefs and tears streamed plentifully down her cheeks as she continued her hopeless journey at length at the corner of a street she recognised an image of the madonna in a niche with a lamp burning over it familiar to her recollection as being near her home with characteristic piety she knelt before it in thankfulness and was offering a prayer for lorenzo when the sound of steps made her start up and her brothers voice hailed and her brothers arms encircled her it seemed a miracle but he was there and all her fears were ended lorenzo anxiously asked whither she had been straying her explanation was soon given and he in return related the misfortunes of the morningthe fate that impended over him averted by the generous intercession of young fabian himself and yethe hesitated to unfold the bitter truthhe was not freely pardonedhe stood there a banished man condemned to die if the morrows sun found him within the walls of siena they had arrived meanwhile at their home and with feminine care flora placed a simple repast before her brother and then employed herself busily in making various packages lorenzo paced the room absorbed in thought at length he stopped and kissing the fair girl said where can i place thee in safety how preserve thee my flower of beauty while we are divided flora looked up fearfully do i not go with you she asked i was making preparations for our journey impossible dearest i go to privation and hardship and i would share them with thee it may not be sweet sister replied lorenzo fate divides us and we must submit i go to campsto the society of rude men to struggle with such fortune as cannot harm me but which for thee would be fraught with peril and despair no my flora i must provide safe and honourable guardianship for thee even in this town and again lorenzo meditated deeply on the part he should take till suddenly a thought flashed on his mind it is hazardous he murmured and yet i do him wrong to call it so were our fates reversed should i not think myself highly honoured by such a trust and then he told his sister to don hastily her best attire to wrap her veil round her and to come with him she obeyedfor obedience to her brother was the first and dearest of her duties but she wept bitterly while her trembling fingers braided her long hair and she hastily changed her dress at length they walked forth again and proceeded slowly as lorenzo employed the precious minutes in consoling and counselling his sister he promised as speedy a return as he could accomplish but if he failed to appear as soon as he could wish yet he vowed solemnly that if alive and free she should see him within five years from the moment of parting should he not come before he besought her earnestly to take patience and to hope for the best till the expiration of that period and made her promise not to bind herself by any vestal or matrimonial vow in the interim they had arrived at their destination and entered the courtyard of a spacious palace they met no servants so crossed the court and ascended the ample stairs flora had endeavoured to listen to her brother he had bade her be of good cheer and he was about to leave her he told her to hope and he spoke of an absence to endure five yearsan endless term to her youthful anticipations she promised obedience but her voice was choked by sobs and her tottering limbs would not have supported her without his aid she now perceived that they were entering the lighted and inhabited rooms of a noble dwelling and tried to restrain her tears as she drew her veil closely around her they passed from room to room in which preparations for festivity were making the servants ushered them on as if they had been invited guests and conducted them into a hall filled with all the nobility and beauty of siena each eye turned with curiosity and wonder on the pair lorenzos tall person and the lofty expression of his handsome countenance put the ladies in good humour with him while the cavaliers tried to peep under floras veil it is a mere child they said and a sorrowing onewhat can this mean the youthful master of the house however instantly recognised his uninvited and unexpected guest but before he could ask the meaning of his coming lorenzo had advanced with his sister to the spot where he stood and addressed him i never thought count fabian to stand beneath your roof and much less to approach you as a suitor but that supreme power to whose decrees we must all bend has reduced me to such adversity as if it be his will may also visit you notwithstanding the many friends that now surround you and the sunshine of prosperity in which you bask i stand here a banished man and a beggar nor do i repine at this my fate most willing am i that my right arm alone should create my fortunes and with the blessing of god i hope so to direct my course that we may yet meet upon more equal terms in this hope i turn my steps not unwillingly from this city dear as its name is to my heartand dear the associations which link its proud towers with the memory of my forefathers i leave it a soldier of fortune how i may return is written in the page where your unread destiny is traced as well as mine but my care ends not with myself my dying father bequeathed to me this child my orphan sister whom i have until now watched over with a parents love i should ill perform the part intrusted to me were i to drag this tender blossom from its native bower into the rude highways of life lord fabian i can count no man my friend for it would seem that your smiles have won the hearts of my fellow citizens from me and death and exile have so dealt with my house that not one of my name exists within the walls of siena to you alone can i intrust this precious charge will you accept it until called upon to render it back to me her brother or to the juster hands of our creator pure and untarnished as i now deliver her to you i ask you to protect her helplessness to guard her honour will youdare you accept a treasure with the assurance of restoring it unsoiled unhurt the deep expressive voice of the noble youth and his earnest eloquence enchained the ears of the whole assembly and when he ceased fabian proud of the appeal and nothing loath in the buoyant spirit of youth to undertake a charge which thus proffered before his assembled kinsmen and friends became an honour answered readily i agree and solemnly before heaven accept your offer i declare myself the guardian and protector of your sister she shall dwell in safety beneath my kind mothers care and if the saints permit your return she shall be delivered back to you as spotless as she now is lorenzo bowed his head something choked his utterance as he thought that he was about to part for ever from flora but he disdained to betray this weakness before his enemies he took his sisters hand and gazed upon her slight form with a look of earnest fondness then murmuring a blessing over her and kissing her brow he again saluted count fabian and turning away with measured steps and lofty mien left the hall flora scarcely understanding what had passed stood trembling and weeping under her veil she yielded her passive hand to fabian who leading her to his mother said madam i ask of your goodness and the maternal indulgence you have ever shown to assist me in fulfilling my promise by taking under your gracious charge this young orphan you command here my son said the countess and your will shall be obeyed then making a sign to one of her attendants flora was conducted from the hall to where in solitude and silence she wept over her brothers departure and her own strange position flora thus became an inmate of the dwelling of her ancestral foes and the ward of the most bitter enemy of her house lorenzo was gone she knew not whither and her only pleasure consisted in reflecting that she was obeying his behests her life was uniform and tranquil her occupation was working tapestry in which she displayed taste and skill sometimes she had the more mortifying task imposed on her of waiting on the countess de tolomei who having lost two brothers in the last contest with the mancini nourished a deep hatred towards the whole race and never smiled on the luckless orphan flora submitted to every command imposed upon her she was buoyed up by the reflection that her sufferings wore imposed on her by lorenzo schooling herself in any moment of impatience by the idea that thus she shared his adversity no murmur escaped her though the pride and independence of her nature were often cruelly offended by the taunts and supercilious airs of her patroness or mistress who was not a bad woman but who thought it virtue to ill treat a mancini often indeed she neither heard nor heeded these things her thoughts were far away and grief for the loss of her brothers society weighed too heavily on her to allow her to spend more than a passing sigh on her personal injuries the countess was unkind and disdainful but it was not thus with floras companions they were amiable and affectionate girls either of the bourgeois class or daughters of dependants of the house of tolomei the length of time which had elapsed since the overthrow of the mancini had erased from their young minds the bitter duty of hatred and it was impossible for them to live on terms of daily intercourse with the orphan daughter of this ill fated race and not to become strongly attached to her she was wholly devoid of selfishness and content to perform her daily tasks in inoffensive silence she had no envy no wish to shine no desire of pleasure she was nevertheless ever ready to sympathize with her companions and glad to have it in her power to administer to their happiness to help them in the manufacture of some piece of finery to assist them in their work and perfectly prudent and reserved herself to listen to all their sentimental adventures to give her best advice and to aid them in any difficulty were the simple means she used to win their unsophisticated hearts they called her an angel they looked up to her as to a saint and in their hearts respected her more than the countess herself one only subject ever disturbed floras serene melancholy the praise she perpetually heard lavished on count fabian her brothers too successful rival and oppressor was an unendurable addition to her other griefs content with her own obscurity her ambition her pride her aspiring thoughts were spent upon her brother she hated count fabian as lorenzos destroyer and the cause of his unhappy exile his accomplishments she despised as painted vanities his person she contemned as the opposite of his prototype his blue eyes clear and open as day his fair complexion and light brown hair his slight elegant person his voice whose tones in song won each listeners heart to tenderness and love his wit his perpetual flow of spirits and unalterable good humour were impertinences and frivolities to her who cherished with such dear worship the recollection of her serious ardent noble hearted brother whose soul was ever set on high thoughts and devoted to acts of virtue and self sacrifice whose fortitude and affectionate courtesy seemed to her the crown and glory of manhood how different from the trifling flippancy of fabian name an eagle she would say and we raise our eyes to heaven there to behold a creature fashioned in natures bounty but it is a degradation to waste one thought on the insect of a day some speech similar to this had been kindly reported to the young counts lady mother who idolized her son as the ornament and delight of his age and country she severely reprimanded the incautious flora who for the first time listened proudly and unyieldingly from this period her situation grew more irksome all she could do was to endeavour to withdraw herself entirely from observation and to brood over the perfections while she lamented yet more keenly the absence of her brother two or three years thus flew away and flora grew from a childish looking girl of twelve into the bewitching beauty of fifteen she unclosed like a flower whose fairest petals are yet shut but whose half veiled loveliness is yet more attractive it was at this time that on occasion of doing honour to a prince of france who was passing on to naples the countess tolomei and her son with a bevy of friends and followers went out to meet and to escort the royal traveller on his way assembled in the hall of the palace and waiting for the arrival of some of their number count fabian went round his mothers circle saying agreeable and merry things to all wherever his cheerful blue eyes lighted there smiles were awakened and each young heart beat with vanity at his harmless flatteries after a gallant speech or two he espied flora retired behind her companions what flower is this he said playing at hide and seek with her beauty and then struck by the modest sweetness of her aspect her eyes cast down and a rosy blush mantling over her cheek he added what fair angel makes one of your company an angel indeed my lord exclaimed one of the younger girls who dearly loved her best friend she is flora mancini mancini exclaimed fabian while his manner became at once respectful and kind are you the orphan daughter of ugothe sister of lorenzo committed by him to my care for since then through her careful avoidance fabian had never even seen his fair ward she bowed an assent to his questions while her swelling heart denied her speech and fabian going up to his mother said madam i hope for our honours sake that this has not before happened the adverse fortune of this young lady may render retirement and obscurity befitting but it is not for us to turn into a menial one sprung from the best blood in italy let me entreat you not to permit this to occur again how shall i redeem my pledged honour or answer to her brother for this unworthy degradation would you have me make a friend and a companion of a mancini asked the countess with raised colour i ask you not mother to do aught displeasing to you replied the young noble but flora is my ward not our servantpermit her to retire she will probably prefer the privacy of home to making one among the festive crowd of her houses enemies if not let the choice be herssay gentle one will you go with us or retire she did not speak but raising her soft eyes curtsied to him and to his mother and quitted the room so tacitly making her selection from this time flora never quitted the more secluded apartments of the palace nor again saw fabian she was unaware that he had been profuse in his eulogium on her beauty but that while frequently expressing his interest in his ward he rather avoided the dangerous power of her loveliness she led rather a prison life walking only in the palace garden when it was else deserted but otherwise her time was at her own disposal and no commands now interfered with her freedom her labours were all spontaneous the countess seldom even saw her and she lived among this ladys attendants like a free boarder in a convent who cannot quit the walls but who is not subservient to the rules of the asylum she was more busy than ever at her tapestry frame because the countess prized her work and thus she could in some degree repay the protection afforded her she never mentioned fabian and always imposed silence on her companions when they spoke of him but she did this in no disrespectful terms he is a generous enemy i acknowledge she would say but still he is my enemy and while through him my brother is an exile and a wanderer upon earth it is painful to me to hear his name after the lapse of many months spent in entire seclusion and tranquillity a change occurred in the tenor of her life the countess suddenly resolved to pass the easter festival at rome floras companions were wild with joy at the prospect of the journey the novelty and the entertainment they promised themselves from this visit and pitied the dignity of their friend which prevented her from making one in their mistresss train for it was soon understood that flora was to be left behind and she was informed that the interval of the ladys absence was to be passed by her in a villa belonging to the family situated in a sequestered nook among the neighbouring apennines the countess departed in pomp and pride on her so called pilgrimage to the sacred city and at the same time flora was conveyed to her rural retreat the villa was inhabited only by the peasant and his family who cultivated the farm or podere attached to it and the old cassire or housekeeper the cheerfulness and freedom of the country were delightful and the entire solitude consonant to the habits of the meditative girl accustomed to the confinement of the city and the intrusive prattle of her associates spring was opening with all the beauty which that season showers upon favoured italy the almond and peach trees were in blossom and the vine dresser sang at his work perched with his pruning knife among the vines blossoms and flowers in laughing plenty graced the soil and the trees swelling with buds ready to expand into leaves seemed to feel the life that animated their dark old boughs flora was enchanted the country labours interested her and the hoarded experience of old sandra was a treasure house of wisdom and amusement her attention had hitherto been directed to giving the most vivid hues and truest imitation to her transcript with her needle of some picture given her as a model but here was a novel occupation she learned the history of the bees watched the habits of the birds and inquired into the culture of plants sandra was delighted with her new companion and though notorious for being cross yet could wriggle her antique lips into smiles for flora to repay the kindness of her guardian and his mother she still devoted much time to her needle this occupation but engaged half her attention and while she pursued it she could give herself up to endless reverie on the subject of lorenzos fortunes three years had flown since he had left her and except a little gold cross brought to her by a pilgrim from milan but one month after his departure she had received no tidings of him whether from milan he had proceeded to france germany or the holy land she did not know by turns her fancy led him to either of these places and fashioned the course of events that might have befallen him she figured to herself his toilsome journeyshis life in the camphis achievements and the honours showered on him by kings and nobles her cheek glowed at the praises he received and her eye kindled with delight as it imaged him standing with modest pride and an erect but gentle mien before them then the fair enthusiast paused it crossed her recollection like a shadow that if all had gone prosperously he had returned to share his prosperity with her and her faltering heart turned to sadder scenes to account for his protracted absence sometimes while thus employed she brought her work into the trellised arbour of the garden or when it was too warm for the open air she had a favourite shady window which looked down a deep ravine into a majestic wood whence the sound of falling water met her ears one day while she employed her fingers upon the spirited likeness of a hound which made a part of the hunting piece she was working for the countess a sharp wailing cry suddenly broke on her ear followed by trampling of horses and the hurried steps and loud vociferations of men they entered the villa on the opposite side from that which her window commanded but the noise continuing she rose to ask the reason when sandra burst into the room crying o madonna he is dead he has been thrown from his horse and he will never speak more flora for an instant could only think of her brother she rushed past the old woman down into the great hall in which lying on a rude litter of boughs she beheld the inanimate body of count fabian he was surrounded by servitors and peasants who were all clasping their hands and tearing their hair as with frightful shrieks they pressed round their lord not one of them endeavouring to restore him to life floras first impulse was to retire but casting a second glance on the livid brow of the young count she saw his eyelids move and the blood falling in quick drops from his hair on the pavement she exclaimed he is not deadhe bleeds hasten some of you for a leech and meanwhile she hurried to get some water sprinkled it on his face and dispersing the group that hung over him and impeded the free air the soft breeze playing on his forehead revived him and he gave manifest tokens of life so that when the physician arrived he found that though he was seriously and even dangerously hurt every hope might be entertained of his recovery flora undertook the office of his nurse and fulfilled its duties with unwearied attention she watched him by night and waited on him by day with that spirit of christian humility and benevolence which animates a sister of charity as she tends the sick for several days fabians soul seemed on the wing to quit its earthly abode and the state of weakness that followed his insensibility was scarcely less alarming at length he recognised and acknowledged the care of flora but she alone possessed any power to calm and guide him during the state of irritability and fever that then ensued nothing except her presence controlled his impatience before her he was so lamb like that she could scarcely have credited the accounts that others gave her of his violence but that whenever she returned after leaving him for any time she heard his voice far off in anger and found him with flushed cheeks and flashing eyes all which demonstrations subsided into meek acquiescence when she drew near in a few weeks he was able to quit his room but any noise or sudden sound drove him almost insane so loud is an italians quietest movements that flora was obliged to prevent the approach of any except herself and her soft voice and noiseless footfall were the sweetest medicine she could administer to her patient it was painful to her to be in perpetual attendance on lorenzos rival and foe but she subdued her heart to her duty and custom helped to reconcile her as he grew better she could not help remarking the intelligence of his countenance and the kindness and cordiality of his manners there was an unobtrusive and delicate attention and care in his intercourse with her that won her to be pleased when he conversed his discourse was full of entertainment and variety his memory was well stored with numerous fabliaux novelle and romances which he quickly discovered to be highly interesting to her and so contrived to have one always ready from the exhaustless stock he possessed these romantic stories reminded her of the imaginary adventures she had invented in solitude and silence for her brother and each tale of foreign countries had a peculiar charm which animated her face as she listened so that fabian could have gone on for ever only to mark the varying expression of her countenance as he proceeded yet she acknowledged these attractions in him as a catholic nun may the specious virtues of a heretic and while he contrived each day to increase the pleasure she derived from his society she satisfied her conscience with regard to her brother by cherishing in secret a little quiet stock of family hate and by throwing over her manners whenever she could recollect so to do a cold and ceremonious tone which she had the pleasure of seeing vexed him heartily nearly two months had passed and he was so well recovered that flora began to wonder that he did not return to siena and of course to fulfil her duty by wishing that he should and yet while his cheek was sunk through past sickness and his elastic step grown slow she as a nurse desirous of completing her good work felt averse to his entering too soon on the scene of the busy town and its noisy pleasures at length two or three of his friends having come to see him he agreed to return with them to the city a significant glance which they cast on his young nurse probably determined him he parted from her with a grave courtesy and a profusion of thanks unlike his usual manner and rode off without alluding to any probability of their meeting again she fancied that she was relieved from a burden when he went and was surprised to find the days grow tedious and mortified to perceive that her thoughts no longer spent themselves so spontaneously on her brother and to feel that the occupation of a few weeks could unhinge her mind and dissipate her cherished reveries thus while she felt the absence of fabian she was annoyed at him the more for having in addition to his other misdeeds invaded the sanctuary of her dearest thoughts she was beginning to conquer this listlessness and to return with renewed zest to her usual occupations when in about a week after his departure fabian suddenly returned he came upon her as she was gathering flowers for the shrine of the madonna and on seeing him she blushed as rosy red as the roses she held he looked infinitely worse in health than when he went his wan cheeks and sunk eyes excited her concern and her earnest and kind questions somewhat revived him he kissed her hand and continued to stand beside her as she finished her nosegay had any one seen the glad fond look with which he regarded her as she busied herself among the flowers even old sandra might have prognosticated his entire recovery under her care flora was totally unaware of the feelings that were excited in fabians heart and the struggle he made to overcome a passion too sweet and too seductive when awakened by so lovely a being ever to be subdued he had been struck with her some time ago and avoided her it was through his suggestion that she passed the period of the countesss pilgrimage in this secluded villa nor had he thought of visiting her there but riding over one day to inquire concerning a foal rearing for him his horse had thrown him and caused him that injury which had made him so long the inmate of the same abode already prepared to admire herher kindness her gentleness and her unwearied patience during his illness easily conquered a heart most ready and yet most unwilling to yield he had returned to siena resolved to forget her but he came back assured that his life and death were in her hands at first count fabian had forgot that he had any but his own feelings and prejudices and those of his mother and kindred to overcome but when the tyranny of love vanquished these he began to fear a more insurmountable impediment in flora the first whisper of love fell like mortal sin upon her ear and disturbed and even angry she replied methinks you wholly forget who i am and what you are i speak not of ancient feuds though these were enough to divide us for ever know that i hate you as my brothers oppressor restore lorenzo to merecall him from banishmenterase the memory of all that he has suffered through youwin his love and approbationand when all this is fulfilled which never can be speak a language which now it is as the bitterness of death for me to hear and saying this she hastily retired to conceal the floods of tears which this as she termed it insult had caused to flow to lament yet more deeply her brothers absence and her own dependence fabian was not so easily silenced and flora had no wish to renew scenes and expressions of violence so foreign to her nature she imposed a rule on herself by never swerving from which she hoped to destroy the ill omened love of her protector she secluded herself as much as possible and when with him assumed a chilling indifference of manner and made apparent in her silence so absolute and cold a rejection of all his persuasions that had not love with its unvanquishable hopes reigned absolutely in young fabians heart he must have despaired he ceased to speak of his affection so to win back her ancient kindness this was at first difficult for she was timid as a young bird whose feet have touched the limed twigs but naturally credulous and quite inexperienced she soon began to believe that her alarm was exaggerated and to resume those habits of intimacy which had heretofore subsisted between them by degrees fabian contrived to insinuate the existence of his attachmenthe could not help it he asked no return he would wait for lorenzos arrival which he was sure could not be far distant her displeasure could not change nor silence destroy a sentiment which survived in spite of both intrenched in her coldness and her indifference she hoped to weary him out by her defensive warfare and fancied that he would soon cease his pursuit in disgust the countess had been long away she had proceeded to view the feast of san gennaro at naples and had not received tidings of her sons illness her return was now expected and fabian resolved to return to siena in time to receive her both he and flora were therefore surprised one day when she suddenly entered the apartment where they both were flora had long peremptorily insisted that he should not intrude while she was employed on her embroidery frame but this day he had made so good a pretext that for the first time he was admitted and then suffered to stay a few minutesthey now neither of them knew how long she was busy at her work and he sitting near gazing unreproved on her unconscious face and graceful figure felt himself happier than he had ever been before the countess was sufficiently surprised and not a little angry but before she could do more than utter one exclamation fabian interrupted by entreating her not to spoil all he drew her away he made his own explanations and urged his wishes with resistless persuasion the countess had been used to indulge him in every wish it was impossible for her to deny any strongly urged request his pertinacity his agitation his entreaties half won her and the account of his illness and his assurances seconded by those of all the family that flora had saved his life completed the conquest and she became in her turn a suitor for her son to the orphan daughter of mancini flora educated till the age of twelve by one who never consulted his own pleasures and gratifications but went right on in the path of duty regardless of pain or disappointment had no idea of doing aught merely because she or others might wish it since that time she had been thrown on her own resources and jealously cherishing her individuality every feeling of her heart had been strengthened by solitude and by a sense of mental independence she was the least likely of any one to go with the stream or to yield to the mere influence of circumstances she felt she knew what it became her to do and that must be done in spite of every argument the countesss expostulations and entreaties were of no avail the promise she had made to her brother of engaging herself by no vow for five years must be observed under every event it was asked from her at the sad and solemn hour of their parting and was thus rendered doubly sacred so constituted indeed were her feelings that the slightest wish she ever remembered having been expressed by lorenzo had more weight with her than the most urgent prayers of another he was a part of her religion reverence and love for him had been moulded into the substance of her soul from infancy their very separation had tended to render these impressions irradicable she brooded over them for years and when no sympathy or generous kindness was afforded herwhen the countess treated her like an inferior and a dependant and fabian had forgotten her existence she had lived from month to month and from year to year cherishing the image of her brother and only able to tolerate the annoyances that beset her existence by considering that her patience her fortitude and her obedience were all offerings at the shrine of her beloved lorenzos desires it is true that the generous and kindly disposition of fabian won her to regard him with a feeling nearly approaching tenderness though this emotion was feeble the mere ripple of the waves compared to the mighty tide of affection that set her will all one way and made her deem everything trivial except lorenzos returnlorenzos existenceobedience to lorenzo she listened to her lovers persuasions so unyieldingly that the countess was provoked by her inflexibility but she bore her reproaches with such mildness and smiled so sweetly that fabian was the more charmed she admitted that she owed him a certain submission as the guardian set over her by her brother fabian would have gladly exchanged this authority for the pleasure of being commanded by her but this was an honour he could not attain so in playful spite he enforced concessions from her at his desire she appeared in society dressed as became her rank and filled in his house the station a sister of his own would have held she preferred seclusion but she was averse to contention and it was little that she yielded while the purpose of her soul was as fixed as ever the fifth year of lorenzos exile was now drawing to a close but he did not return nor had any intelligence been received of him the decree of his banishment had been repealed the fortunes of his house restored and his palace under fabians generous care rebuilt these were acts that demanded and excited floras gratitude yet they were performed in an unpretending manner as if the citizens of siena had suddenly become just and wise without his interference but these things dwindled into trifles while the continuation of lorenzos absence seemed the pledge of her eternal misery and the tacit appeal made to her kindness while she had no thought but for her brother drove her to desperation she could no longer tolerate the painful anomaly of her situation she could not endure her suspense for her brothers fate nor the reproachful glances of fabians mother and his friends he himself was more generoushe read her heart and as the termination of the fifth year drew nigh ceased to allude to his own feelings and appeared as wrapt as herself in doubt concerning the fate of the noble youth whom they could scarcely entertain a hope of ever seeing more this was small comfort to flora she had resolved that when the completion of the fifth year assured her that her brother was for ever lost she would never see fabian again at first she had resolved to take refuge in a convent and in the sanctity of religious vows but she remembered how averse lorenzo had always shown himself to this vocation and that he had preferred to place her beneath the roof of his foe than within the walls of a nunnery besides young as she was and despite of herself full of hope she recoiled from shutting the gates of life upon herself for ever notwithstanding her fears and sorrow she clung to the belief that lorenzo lived and this led her to another plan when she had received her little cross from milan it was accompanied by a message that he believed he had found a good friend in the archbishop of that place this prelate therefore would know whither lorenzo had first bent his steps and to him she resolved to apply her scheme was easily formed she possessed herself of the garb of a pilgrim and resolved on the day following the completion of the fifth year to depart from siena and bend her steps towards lombardy buoyed up by the hope that she should gain some tidings of her brother meanwhile fabian had formed a similar resolve he had learnt the fact from flora of lorenzo having first resorted to milan and he determined to visit that city and not to return without certain information he acquainted his mother with his plan but begged her not to inform flora that she might not be tortured by double doubt during his absence the anniversary of the fifth year was come and with it the eve of these several and separate journeys flora had retired to spend the day at the villa before mentioned she had chosen to retire thither for various reasons her escape was more practicable thence than in the town and she was anxious to avoid seeing both fabian and his mother now that she was on the point of inflicting severe pain on them she spent the day at the villa and in its gardens musing on her plans regretting the quiet of her past lifesaddened on fabians accountgrieving bitterly for lorenzo she was not alone for she had been obliged to confide in one of her former companions and to obtain her assistance poor little angeline was dreadfully frightened with the trust reposed in her but did not dare expostulate with or betray her friend and she continued near her during this last day by turns trying to console and weeping with her towards evening they wandered together into the wood contiguous to the villa flora had taken her harp with her but her trembling fingers refused to strike its chords she left it she left her companion and strayed on alone to take leave of a spot consecrated by many a former visit here the umbrageous trees gathered about her and shaded her with their thick and drooping foliagea torrent dashed down from neighbouring rock and fell from a height into a rustic basin hollowed to receive it then overflowing the margin at one spot it continued falling over successive declivities till it reached the bottom of a little ravine when it stole on in a placid and silent course this had ever been a favourite resort of flora the twilight of the wood and the perpetual flow the thunder the hurry and the turmoil of the waters the varied sameness of the eternal elements accorded with the melancholy of her ideas and the endless succession of her reveries she came to it now she gazed on the limpid cascadefor the last time a soft sadness glistened in her eyes and her attitude denoted the tender regret that filled her bosom her long bright tresses streaming in elegant disorder her light veil and simple yet rich attire were fitfully mirrored in the smooth face of the rushing waters at this moment the sound of steps more firm and manly than those of angeline struck her ear and fabian himself stood before her he was unable to bring himself to depart on his journey without seeing her once again he had ridden to the villa and finding that she had quitted it sought and found her in the lone recess where they had often spent hours together which had been full of bliss to him flora was sorry to see him for her secret was on her lips and yet she resolved not to give it utterance he was ruled by the same feeling their interview was therefore short and neither alluded to what sat nearest the heart of each they parted with a simple good night as if certain of meeting the following morning each deceived the other and each was in turn deceived there was more of tenderness in floras manner than there had ever been it cheered his faltering soul about to quit her while the anticipation of the blow he was about to receive from her made her regard as venial this momentary softening towards her brothers enemy fabian passed the night at the villa and early the next morning he departed for milan he was impatient to arrive at the end of his journey and often he thrust his spurs into his horses sides and put him to his speed which even then appeared slow yet he was aware that his arrival at milan might advance him not a jot towards the ultimate object of his journey and he called flora cruel and unkind until the recollection of her kind farewell consoled and cheered him he stopped the first night at empoli and crossing the arno began to ascend the apennines on the northern side soon he penetrated their fastnesses and entered deep into the ilex woods he journeyed on perseveringly and yet the obstructions he met with were many and borne with impatience at length on the afternoon of the third day he arrived at a little rustic inn hid deep in a wood which showed signs of seldom being visited by travellers the burning sun made it a welcome shelter for fabian and he deposited his steed in the stable which he found already partly occupied by a handsome black horse and then entered the inn to seek refreshment for himself there seemed some difficulty in obtaining this the landlady was the sole domestic and it was long before she made her appearance and then she was full of trouble and dismay a sick traveller had arriveda gentleman to all appearance dying of a malignant fever his horse his well stored purse and rich dress showed that he was a cavalier of consequencethe more the pity there was no help nor any means of carrying him forward yet half his pain seemed to arise from his regret at being detainedhe was so eager to proceed to siena the name of his own town excited the interest of count fabian and he went up to visit the stranger while the hostess prepared his repast meanwhile flora awoke with the lark and with the assistance of angeline attired herself in her pilgrims garb from the stir below she was surprised to find that count fabian had passed the night at the villa and she lingered till he should have departed as she believed on his return to siena then she embraced her young friend and taking leave of her with many blessings and thanks alone with heaven as she trusted for her guide she quitted fabians sheltering roof and with a heart that maintained its purpose in spite of her feminine timidity began her pilgrimage her journey performed on foot was slow so that there was no likelihood that she could overtake her lover already many miles in advance now that she had begun it her undertaking appeared to her gigantic and her heart almost failed her the burning sun scorched her never having before found herself alone in a highway a thousand fears assailed her and she grew so weary that soon she was unable to support herself by the advice of a landlady at an inn where she stopped she purchased a mule to help her on her long journey yet with this help it was the third night before she arrived at empoli and then crossing the arno as her lover had done before her difficulties seemed to begin to unfold themselves and to grow gigantic as she entered the dark woods of the apennines and found herself amidst the solitude of its vast forests her pilgrims garb inspired some respect and she rested at convents by the way the pious sisters held up their hands in admiration of her courage while her heart beat faintly with the knowledge that she possessed absolutely none yet again and again she repeated to herself that the apennines once passed the worst would be over so she toiled on now weary now frightenedvery slowly and yet very anxious to get on with speed on the evening of the seventh day after quitting her home she was still entangled in the mazes of these savage hills she was to sleep at a convent on their summit that night and the next day arrive at bologna this hope had cheered her through the day but evening approached the way grew more intricate and no convent appeared the sun had set and she listened anxiously for the bell of the ave maria which would give her hope that the goal she sought was nigh but all was silent save the swinging boughs of the vast trees and the timid beating of her own heart darkness closed around her and despair came with the increased obscurity till a twinkling light revealing itself among the trees afforded her some relief she followed this beamy guide till it led her to a little inn where the sight of a kind looking woman and the assurance of safe shelter dispelled her terrors and filled her with grateful pleasure seeing her so weary the considerate hostess hastened to place food before her and then conducted her to a little low room where her bed was prepared i am sorry lady said the landlady in a whisper not to be able to accommodate you better but a sick cavalier occupies my best roomit is next to thisand he sleeps now and i would not disturb him poor gentleman i never thought he would rise more and under heaven he owes his life to one who whether he is related to him or not i cannot tell for he did not accompany him four days ago he stopped here and i told him my sorrowhow i had a dying guest and he charitably saw him and has since then nursed him more like a twin brother than a stranger the good woman prattled on flora heard but little of what she said and overcome by weariness and sleep paid no attention to her tale but having performed her orisons and placed her head on the pillow she was quickly lapped in the balmy slumber she so much needed early in the morning she was awoke by a murmur of voices in the next room she started up and recalling her scattered thoughts tried to remember the account the hostess had given her the preceding evening the sick man spoke but his accent was low and the words did not reach herhe was answeredcould flora believe her senses did she not know the voice that spoke these wordsfear nothing a sweet sleep has done you infinite good and i rejoice in the belief that you will speedily recover i have sent to siena for your sister and do indeed expect that flora will arrive this very day more was said but flora heard no more she had risen and was hastily dressing herself in a few minutes she was by her brothers her lorenzos bedside kissing his wan hand and assuring him that she was indeed flora these are indeed wonders he at last said and if you are mine own flora you perhaps can tell me who this noble gentleman is who day and night has watched beside me as a mother may by her only child giving no time to repose but exhausting himself for me how dearest brother said flora can i truly answer your question to mention the name of our benefactor were to speak of a mask and a disguise not a true thing he is my protector and guardian who has watched over and preserved me while you wandered far his is the most generous heart in italy offering past enmity and family pride as sacrifices at the altar of nobleness and truth he is the restorer of your fortunes in your native town and the lover of my sweet sisteri have heard of these things and was on my way to confirm his happiness and to find my own when sickness laid me thus low and would have destroyed us both for ever but for fabian tolomei who how exerts his expiring authority to put an end to this scene interrupted the young count not till this day has lorenzo been sufficiently composed to hear any of these explanations and we risk his returning health by too long a conversation the history of these things and of his long wanderings now so happily ended must be reserved for a future hour when assembled in our beloved siena exiles and foes no longer we shall long enjoy the happiness which providence after so many trials has bounteously reserved for us xiii the parvenue why do i write my melancholy story is it as a lesson to prevent any other from wishing to rise to rank superior to that in which they are born no miserable as i am others might have been happy i doubt not in my position the chalice has been poisoned for me alone am i evil mindedam i wicked what have been my errors that i am now an outcast and wretched i will tell my storylet others judge me my mind is bewildered i cannot judge myself my father was land steward to a wealthy nobleman he married young and had several children he then lost his wife and remained fifteen years a widower when he married again a young girl the daughter of a clergyman who died leaving a numerous offspring in extreme poverty my maternal grandfather had been a man of sensibility and genius my mother inherited many of his endowments she was an angel on earth all her works were charity all her thoughts were love within a year after her marriage she gave birth to twinsi and my sister soon after she fell into ill health and from that time was always weakly she could endure no fatigue and seldom moved from her chair i see her nowher white delicate hands employed in needlework her soft love lighted eyes fixed on me i was still a child when my father fell into trouble and we removed from the part of the country where we had hitherto lived and went to a distant village where we rented a cottage with a little land adjoining we were poor and all the family assisted each other my elder half sisters were strong industrious rustic young women and submitted to a life of labour with great cheerfulness my father held the plough my half brothers worked in the barns all was toil yet all seemed enjoyment how happy my childhood was hand in hand with my dear twin sister i plucked the spring flowers in the hedges turned the hay in the summer meadows shook the apples from the trees in the autumn and at all seasons gambolled in delicious liberty beneath the free air of heaven or at my mothers feet caressed by her i was taught the sweetest lessons of charity and love my elder sisters were kind we were all linked by strong affection the delicate fragile existence of my mother gave an interest to our monotony while her virtues and her refinement threw a grace over our homely household i and my sister did not seem twins we were so unlike she was robust chubby full of life and spirits i tall slim fair and even pale i loved to play with her but soon grew tired and then i crept to my mothers side and she sang me to sleep and nursed me in her bosom and looked on me with her own angelic smile she took pains to instruct me not in accomplishments but in all real knowledge she unfolded to me the wonders of the visible creation and to each tale of bird and beast of fiery mountain or vast river was appended some moral derived from her warm heart and ardent imagination above all she impressed upon me the precepts of the gospel charity to every fellow creature the brotherhood of mankind the rights that every sentient creature possesses to our services i was her almoner for poor as she was she was the benefactress of those who were poorer being delicate i helped her in her task of needlework while my sister aided the rest in their household or rustic labours when i was seventeen a miserable accident happened a hayrick caught fire it communicated to our outhouses and at last to the cottage we were roused from our beds at midnight and escaped barely with our lives my father bore out my mother in his arms and then tried to save a portion of his property the roof of the cottage fell in on him he was dug out after an hour scorched maimed crippled for life we were all saved but by a miracle only was i preserved i and my sister were awoke by cries of fire the cottage was already enveloped in flames susan with her accustomed intrepidity rushed through the flames and escaped i thought only of my mother and hurried to her room the fire raged around me it encircledhemmed me in i believed that i must die when suddenly i felt myself seized upon and borne away i looked on my preserverit was lord reginald desborough for many sundays past when at church i knew that lord reginalds eyes were fixed on me he had met me and susan in our walks he had called at our cottage there was fascination in his eye in his soft voice and earnest gaze and my heart throbbed with gladness as i thought that he surely loved me to have been saved by him was to make the boon of life doubly precious there is to me much obscurity in this part of my story lord reginald loved me it is true why he loved me so far as to forget pride of rank and ambition for my sake he who afterwards showed no tendency to disregard the prejudices and habits of rank and wealth i cannot tell it seems strange he had loved me before but from the hour that he saved my life love grew into an overpowering passion he offered us a lodge on his estate to take refuge in and while there he sent us presents of game and still more kindly fruits and flowers to my mother and came himself especially when all were out except my mother and myself and sat by us and conversed soon i learnt to expect the soft asking look of his eyes and almost dared answer it my mother once perceived these glances and took an opportunity to appeal to lord reginalds good feelings not to make me miserable for life by implanting an attachment that could only be productive of unhappiness his answer was to ask me in marriage i need not say that my mother gratefully consented that my father confined to his bed since the fire thanked god with rapture that my sisters were transported by delight i was the least surprised then though the most happy now i wonder much what could he see in me so many girls of rank and fortune were prettier i was an untaught low born portionless girl it was very strange then i only thought of the happiness of marrying him of being loved of passing my life with him my wedding day was fixed lord reginald had neither father nor mother to interfere with his arrangements he told no relation he became one of our family during the interval he saw no deficiencies in our mode of lifein my dress he was satisfied with all he was tender assiduous and kind even to my elder sisters he seemed to adore my mother and became a brother to my sister susan she was in love and asked him to intercede to gain her parents consent for her choice he did so and though before lawrence cooper the carpenter of the place had been disdained supported by him he was accepted lawrence cooper was young well looking well disposed and fondly attached to susan my wedding day came my mother kissed me fondly my father blessed me with pride and joy my sisters stood round radiant with delight there was but one drawback to the universal happinessthat immediately on my marriage i was to go abroad from the church door i stepped into the carriage having once and again been folded in my dear mothers embrace the wheels were in motion and we were away i looked out from the window there was the dear group my old father white headed and aged in his large chair my mother smiling through her tears with folded hands and upraised looks of gratitude anticipating long years of happiness for her child susan and lawrence standing side by side unenvious of my greatness happy in themselves my sisters conning over with pride and joy the presents made to them and the prosperity that flowed in from my husbands generosity all looked happy and it seemed as if i were the cause of all this happiness we had been indeed saved from dreadful evils ruin had ensued from the fire and we had been sunk in adversity through that very event from which our good fortune took its rise i felt proud and glad i loved them all i thought i make them happythey are prosperous through me and my heart warmed with gratitude towards my husband at the idea we spent two years abroad it was rather lonely for me who had always been surrounded as it were by a populous world of my own to find myself cast upon foreigners and strangers the habits of the different sexes in the higher ranks so separate them from each other that after a few months i spent much of my time in solitude i did not repine i had been brought up to look upon the hard visage of life if not unflinchingly at least with resignation i did not expect perfect happiness marriages in humble life are attended with so much care i had none of this my husband loved me and though i often longed to see the dear familiar faces that thronged my childhoods home and above all pined for my mothers caresses and her wise maternal lessons yet for a time i was content to think of them and hope for a reunion still many things pained me i had poor myself been brought up among the poor and nothing since i can remember forming an idea so much astonished and jarred with my feelings as the thought of how the rich could spend so much on themselves while any of their fellow creatures were in destitution i had none of the patrician charity though such is praiseworthy which consists in distributing thin soup and coarse flannel petticoatsa sort of instinct or sentiment of justice the offspring of my lowly paternal hearth and my mothers enlightened piety was deeply implanted in my mind that all had as good a right to the comforts of life as myself or even as my husband my charities they were calledthey seemed to me the payment of my debts to my fellow creatureswere abundant lord reginald peremptorily checked them but as i had a large allowance for my own expenses i denied myself a thousand luxuries for the sake of feeding the hungry nor was it only that charity impelled me but that i could not acquire a taste for spending money on myselfi disliked the apparatus of wealth my husband called my ideas sordid and reproved me severely when instead of outshining all competitors at a fte i appeared dowdily dressed and declared warmly that i could not i would not spend twenty guineas on a gown while i could dress many sad faces in smiles and bring much joy to many drooping hearts by the same sum was i right i firmly believe that there is not one among the rich who will not affirm that i did wrong that to please my husband and do honour to his rank was my first duty yet shall i confess it even now rendered miserable by this faulti cannot give it that namei can call it a misfortunei have wasted at the slow fire of knowing that i lost my husbands affections because i performed what i believed to be a duty but i am not come to that yet it was not till my return to england that the full disaster crushed me we had often been applied to for money by my family and lord reginald had acceded to nearly all their requests when we reached london after two years absence my first wish was to see my dear mother she was at margate for her health it was agreed that i should go there alone and pay a short visit before i went lord reginald told me what i did not know before that my family had often made exorbitant demands on him with which he was resolved not to comply he told me that he had no wish to raise my relatives from their station in society and that indeed there were only two among them whom he conceived had any claims upon memy mother and my twin sister that the former was incapable of any improper request and the latter by marrying cooper had fixed her own position and could in no way be raised from the rank of her chosen husband i agreed to much that he said i replied that he well knew that my own taste led me to consider mediocrity the best and happiest situation that i had no wish and would never consent to supply any extravagant demands on the part of persons however dear to me whose circumstances he had rendered easy satisfied with my reply we parted most affectionately and i went on my way to margate with a light and glad heart and the cordial reception i received from my whole family collected together to receive me was calculated to add to my satisfaction the only drawback to my content was my mothers state she was wasted to a shadow they all talked and laughed around her but it was evident to me that she had not long to live there was no room for me in the small furnished house in which they were all crowded so i remained at the hotel early in the morning before i was up my father visited me he begged me to intercede with my husband that on the strength of his support he had embarked in a speculation which required a large capital that many families would be ruined and himself dishonoured if a few hundreds were not advanced i promised to do what i could resolving to ask my mothers advice and make her my guide my father kissed me with an effusion of gratitude and left me i cannot enter into the whole of these sad details all my half brothers and sisters had married and trusted to their success in life to lord reginalds assistance each evidently thought that they asked little in not demanding an equal share of my luxuries and fortune but they were all in difficultyall needed large assistanceall depended on me lastly my own sister susan appealed to mebut hers was the most moderate request of allshe only wished for twenty pounds i gave it her at once from my own purse as soon as i saw my mother i explained to her my difficulties she told me that she expected this and that it broke her heart i must summon courage and resist these demands that my fathers imprudence had ruined him and that he must encounter the evil he had brought on himself that my numerous relatives were absolutely mad with the notion of what i ought to do for them i listened with griefi saw the torments in store for mei felt my own weakness and knew that i could not meet the rapacity of those about me with any courage or firmness that same night my mother fell into convulsions her life was saved with difficulty from susan i learned the cause of her attack she had had a violent altercation with my father she insisted that i should not be appealed to while he reproached her for rendering me undutiful and bringing ruin and disgrace on his grey hairs when i saw my pale mother trembling fainting dyingwhen i was again and again assured that she must be my fathers victim unless i yielded what wonder that in the agony of my distress i wrote to my husband to implore his assistance oh what thick clouds now obscured my destiny how do i remember with a sort of thrilling horror the boundless sea white cliffs and wide sands of margate the summer day that had welcomed my arrival changed to bleak wintry weather during this intervalwhile i waited with anguish for my husbands answer well do i remember the evening on which it came the waves of the sea showed their white crests no vessel ventured to meet the gale with any canvas except a topsail the sky was bared clear by the wind the sun was going down fiery red i looked upon the troubled watersi longed to be borne away upon them away from care and misery at this moment a servant followed me to the sands with my husbands answerit contained a refusal i dared not communicate it the menaces of bankruptcy the knowledge that he had instilled false hopes into so many the fears of disgrace rendered my father always rough absolutely ferocious life flickered in my dear mothers frame it seemed on the point of expiring when she heard my fathers step if he came in with a smooth brow her pale lips wreathed into her own sweet smile and a delicate pink tinged her fallen cheeks if he scowled and his voice was high every limb shivered she turned her face to her pillow while convulsive tears shook her frame and threatened instant dissolution my father sought me alone one day as i was walking in melancholy guise upon the sands he swore that he would not survive his disgrace and do you think fanny he added that your mother will survive the knowledge of my miserable end i saw the resolution of despair in his face as he spokei asked the sum needed the time when it must be givena thousand pounds in two days was all that was asked i set off to london to implore my husband to give this sum no no i cannot step by step record my wretchednessthe money was giveni extorted it from lord reginald though i saw his very heart closed on me as he wrote the cheque worse had happened since i had left him susan had used the twenty pounds i gave her to reach town to throw herself at my husbands feet and implore his compassion rendered absolutely insane by the idea of having a lord for a brother in law cooper had launched into a system of extravagance incredible as it was wicked he was many thousand pounds in debt and when at last lord reginald wrote to refuse all further supply the miserable man committed forgery two hundred pounds prevented exposure and preserved him from an ignominious end five hundred more were advanced to send him and his wife to america to settle there out of the way of temptation i parted from my dear sisteri loved her fondly she had no part in her husbands guilt yet she was still attached to him and her child bound them together they went into solitary miserable exile ah had we remained in virtuous poverty cried my broken hearted sister i had not been forced to leave my dying mother the thousand pounds given to my father was but a drop of water in the ocean again i was appealed to again i felt the slender thread of my mothers life depended on my getting a supply again trembling and miserable i implored the charity of my husband i am content he said to do what you ask to do more than you ask but remember the price you payeither give up your parents and your family whose rapacity and crimes deserve no mercy or we part for ever you shall have a proper allowance you can maintain all your family on it if you please but their names must never be mentioned to me again choose between usyou never see them more or we part for ever did i do righti cannot tellmisery is the resultmisery frightful endless unredeemed my mother was dearer to me than all the world i did not replyi rushed to my room and that night in a delirium of grief and horror i set out for margatesuch was my reply to my husband three years have passed since then and during all this time i was grateful to heaven for being permitted to do my duty by my mother and though i wept over the alienation of my husband i did not repent but she my angelic support is no more my father survived my mother but two months remorse for all he had done and made me suffer cut short his life his family by his first wife are gathered round me they importune they rob they destroy me last week i wrote to lord reginald i communicated the death of my parents i represented that my position was altered and that if he still cared for his unhappy wife all might be well yesterday his answer cameit was too late he saidi had myself torn asunder the ties that united usthey never could be knit together again by the same post came a letter from susan she is happy cooper awakened to a manly sense of the duties of life is thoroughly reformed he is industrious and prosperous susan asks me to join her i am resolved to go oh my home and recollections of my youth where are ye now envenomed by serpents stings i long to close my eyes on every scene i have ever viewed let me seek a strange land a land where a grave will soon be opened for me i desire to die i am told that lord reginald loves another a high born girl that he openly curses our union as the obstacle to his happiness the memory of this will poison the oblivion i go to seek he will soon be free soon will the hand he once so fondly took in his and made his own which now flung away trembles with misery as it traces these lines moulder in its last decay xiv the pole it was near the close of day that a travelling calche coming from rome was seen approaching at full gallop towards mola di gaeta the road leading to the inn is rocky and narrow on one side is an orange grove extending to the sea on the other an old roman wall overgrown by blossoming shrubs enormous aloes floating tangles of vines and a thousand species of parasite plants peculiar to the south scarcely had the calche entered this defile when the careless postillion drove one of the wheels over a protruding ledge of rock and overturned it and in the next moment a crowd of people came running to the spot not one of them however thought of relieving the traveller within the fallen vehicle but with violent gestures and loud outcries began to examine what damage the calche had sustained and what profit they might derive from it the wheelwright declared every wheel was shattered the carpenter that the shafts were splintered whilst the blacksmith passing and repassing under the carriage tugged at every clamp and screw and nail with all the violence necessary to ensure himself a handsome job the traveller it contained having quietly disengaged himself from various cloaks books and maps now slowly descended and for a moment the busy crowd forgot their restlessness to gaze upon the noble figure of the stranger he seemed to be scarcely two and twenty in stature he was tall and his form was moulded in such perfect proportions that it presented a rare combination of youthful lightness and manly strength his countenance had you taken from it its deep thoughtfulness and its expression of calm intrepid bravery might have belonged to the most lovely woman so transparently blooming was his complexion so regular his features so blond and luxuriant his hair of all those present he seemed the least concerned at the accident he neither looked at the calche nor paid any attention to the offers of service that were screamed from a dozen mouths but drawing out his watch asked his servant if the carriage was broken pann the shafts are snapped two of the springs are injured and the linch pin has flown footnote my lord in polish how long will it take to repair them twenty four hours it is now four oclock see that everything be in order again by to morrows daybreak pann with these lazy italians i fear it will be impossible ya paswalam replied the traveller coldly but decidedly pay what you will but let all be ready for the hour i have mentioned footnote i will it in polish without another word he walked towards the inn followed by the crowd teasing for alms a few seconds ago they had all been active and healthy beings so full of employment they could not afford to mend his calche unless tempted by some extraordinary reward now the men declared themselves cripples and invalids the children were orphans the women helpless widows and they would all die of hunger if his eccellenza did not bestow a few grani what a tedious race exclaimed the traveller casting a handful of coins upon the ground which caused a general scramble and enabled him to proceed unmolested at the inn new torments awaited him a fresh crowd composed of the landlord the landlady and their waiters and hostlers gathered round and assailed him with innumerable questions the landlord hoped none of his limbs were broken and begged him to consider himself master of the house the waiters desired to know at what hour he would sup what fare he chose how long he intended to stay where he came from whither he was going and the landlady led him ostentatiously through all the rooms of the inn expatiating endlessly upon the peculiar and indescribable advantages of each ineffably weary of their officiousness the traveller at last traversed a long and spacious hall and took refuge in a balcony that looked upon the bay of gaeta the inn is built upon the site of ciceros villa beneath the balcony and on each side along the whole curve of the bay stretched a thick grove of orange trees which sloped down to the very verge of the mediterranean balls of golden fruit and blossoms faint with odour and fair as stars studded this amphitheatre of dark foliage and at its extremity the liquid light of the waves pierced the glossy leaves mingling their blue splendour with earths green paradise every rock and mountain glowed with a purple hue so intense and soft they resembled violet vapours dissolving into the pale radiance of the evening sky far away in the deep broad flood of the ocean rose the two mountain islands of ischia and procida between which vesuvius thrust in his jagged form and his floating banner of snow white smoke the solitary heaven was without sun or moon without a star or cloud but smiled in that tender vestal light which speaks of eternal immutable peace it would be difficult to define the feelings of the traveller as he gazed on this scene his countenance uplifted to heaven was animated with a profound and impassioned melancholy with an expression of an earnest and fervid pleading against some vast and inevitable wrong he was thinking of his country and whilst he contrasted its ruined villages and devastated fields with the splendour and glow of the fair land before him was breathing inwardly a passionate appeal against that blind and cruel destiny which had consigned poland to the desolating influence of russian despotism his reverie was interrupted by the sound of a female voice singing in polish among the orange trees at his feet the singer was invisible but the sweetness of her voice and the singular reference of the words the following prose translation conveys their meaning to the thoughts of his own mind filled the traveller with surprise when thou gazest upon the azure heaven so mighty in its calm do not say o bright enchantment hast thou no pity that thou dawnest thus in unattainable loveliness upon my world wearied eyes when the southern wind softly breathes do not say reproachfully thy cradle is the ether of the morning sun thou drinkest the odorous essence of myrtle and lemon blossoms thou shouldst bear upon thy wings all sweet emotions all soft desires why bringest thou then no healing to the anguish i endure neither in the dark hour when thou thinkest upon thy country and thy friends say not with grief they are lost they are not say rather with joy they were illustrious and it is bliss to know that they have been it were wise in me to obey thy lesson sweet songstress thought the traveller and revolving in his mind the singularity of the serenade he continued to gaze upon the trees below there was no rustling amid their branches no sound which told a human being was concealed beneath their foliage nothing was heard beyond the almost imperceptible breathings of the evening air did such things exist anywhere but in the imagination of the poet he could almost have believed that the spirit of that divine scene had assumed a human voice and human words to soothe his melancholy so floating and airy had been the strain so deep the silence that succeeded it one moment more and there arose from the same spot cries for help uttered in italian and shrieks of distress so piercing they made the traveller fly with the speed of lightning through the great hall down the staircase into the garden the first object that met his eyes was the figure of a girl about sixteen her one arm tightly embracing the stem of a tree her other angrily repelling a young man who was endeavouring to drag her away i will not go with youi love you no longer giorgioand go with you i will not shrieked the girl in tones of mingled violence and fear you mustyou shall retorted her aggressor in a voice of thunder i have found you again and i wont be duped by your fooleries mariettaand who are you and who begged you to interfere added he turning fiercely upon the traveller whose strong grasp had torn him from marietta an officer as it should seem by your dressbe pleased to know that i am also an officer and risk my displeasure no further no officer would ill treat a defenceless girl the pole replied with quiet contempt at this taunt giorgio quivered with rage his features handsome and regular as those of italians generally are became quite distorted his hands with convulsive movements sought about his breast for the dagger that was concealed there his dark flashing eyes fixed intently at the same time upon his adversary as if he hoped the fiendish spirit that burned within them might previously annihilate him be on your guardhe is a perfect wretch cried marietta rushing towards her protector the arrival of several servants from the inn dispelled all idea of present danger they dragged off giorgio telling him that although the girl was his sister he had no right to separate her from the corps dopera with whom she was travelling through gaeta e vero verissimo cried marietta with joyful triumph what is it to him if i like my liberty and prefer wandering about singing here and there marietta beware dare not to speak ill of me screamed the retiring giorgio looking back over his shoulder and accompanying his words with a look of such frightful menace as completely subdued his sister she watched in anxious silence till he had disappeared and then with affectionate humility and a graceful quickness that allowed not of its prevention knelt lightly down and pressed the strangers hand to her lips you have more than repaid me for the song i sang to you she said rising and leading the way to the inn and if you like it i will sing others to you whilst you sup are you a pole inquired the traveller a fine demand how can i be a pole did you not say yourself there was no longer any such country as poland i not that i recollect if you did not say it confess at least that you thought it the poles are all become russians and for nothing in the world signor would i be a russian why in all their language they have no word that expresses honour no rather than be a russian much as i hate it i would go with giorgio footnote this is true the russian language is without that word are you an italian nonot exactly what are you then um i am what i am who can be more but signor one thing i must beg of you do not ask me any questions about myself nor any about giorgio i will sing to you talk to you wait upon youanything of that kind you please but i will not answer questions on those subjects seating herself upon a stool in a dark corner of the travellers apartment as far removed as possible from him and all other interruptions marietta passed the evening in playing on her guitar and singing she was a most accomplished singer possessing and managing all the intricacies of the art with perfect ease but this scarcely excited admiration in comparison with the natural beauty of her voice there was a profound melancholy in its intense sweetness that dissolved the soul of the traveller in grief all that was dear to him in the memory of the pastthe joys of home and childhood the tenderness and truth of his first friendships the glow of patriotism every cherished hour every endeared spot all that he had loved and all that he had lost upon earth seemed again to live and again to fade as he listened to her strains without paying any attention to him and apparently without any effort to herself she breathed forth melody after melody for her own pleasure like some lone nightingale that in a home of green leaves sings to cheer its solitude with sweet sounds her countenance and figure would have been beautiful had they been more fully developed they resembled those sketches of a great artist in which there are only a few lightly traced lines but those so full of spirit and meaning that you easily imagine what a masterpiece it would have been when finished the first visit of our traveller on arriving next day at naples was to the princess dashkhoff she was a russian lady whose high birth immense wealth and talents for intrigue had procured for her the intimacy of half the crowned heads of europe and had made her all powerful at the court of st petersburg detesting the cold barbarism of her native country she had established herself at naples in a splendid mansion near the strada nuova and affecting an extravagant admiration for italy by her munificent patronage of the arts and artists and by perpetual exhibitions of her own skill in drawing and singing dancing and acting had obtained the name of the corinna of the north her salon was the evening resort of the wise the idle the witty and the dissipated not to know corinna was to be yourself unknown and not to frequent her conversazioni was as far as society was concerned to be banished from all that was fashionable or delightful in naples it was the hour of evening reception the pole burned with impatience to speak to the princess for on her influence at petersburg depended the fate of his only brother a splendid suite of apartments blazing with lights crowded with company lay open before him without allowing himself to be announced he entered them when a highly imaginative mind is absorbed by some master feeling all opposing contrasts all glowing extremes serve but to add depth and intensity to that feeling the festal scene of marble columns garlanded by roses the walls of venetian mirror reflecting the light of innumerable tapers and the forms of lovely women and gay youths floating in the mazy dance seemed to him deceitful shows that veiled some frightful sorrow and with eager rapid steps as if borne along by the impulse of his own thoughts he hurried past them scarcely knowing how he had arrived there he at length found himself standing beside the princess in a marble colonnade open above to the moonlight and the stars of heaven and admitting at its sides the odours of the blossoming almond trees of the adjacent gardens ladislas exclaimed the lady starting is it possibleto see you here almost exceeds belief after remaining some moments in deep silence collecting and arranging his thoughts the pole replied a conversation ensued in so low a voice as to be only audible to themselves from their attitudes and gestures it might be inferred that ladislas was relating some tale of deep anguish mixed with solemn and impressive adjurations to which the princess listened with a consenting tranquillizing sympathy they issued from the recess walked up the colonnade and entered a small temple that terminated it from the centre of its airy dome hung a lighted alabaster lamp of a boat like shape beneath which a youthful female was seated alone sketching a range of moonlight hills that appeared between the columns idalie said the princess i have brought you a new subject for your penciland such a subject my loveone whose fame has already made him dear to your imagination no less a person than the hero of ostrolenka and the vistula so call up one of those brightest happiest moods of your genius in which all succeeds to you and enrich my album with his likeness spreading it before her footnote at ostrolenka the russian and polish armies were in sight of one another the destruction of the poles seemed inevitable not expecting the attack their lines were not formed and the russians were triple in number and advancing in the most perfect order in this emergency three hundred students from the university of warsaw drew hastily up in a body and devoting themselves willingly to death marched forward to meet the onset of the enemy they were headed by a young man who distinguished himself by the most exalted courage and was the only one of their numbers who escaped he stationed his band in a small wood that lay directly in the path of the russians and checked their progress for the space of three hours every tree of that wood now waves above a patriots grave in the meantime the polish army formed bore down and gained a brilliant victory it is difficult to refuse any request to a person who has just granted us an important favour ladislas suffered himself to be seated and as soon as the princess had quitted them the gloom which had shadowed his brow at the names of ostrolenka and the vistula vanished the surpassing beauty of the young artist would have changed the heaviest penance into a pleasure she was lovely as one of raffaelles madonnas and like them there was a silent beauty in her presence that struck the most superficial beholder with astonishment and satisfaction her hair of a golden and burnished brown the colour of the autumnal foliage illuminated by the setting sun fell in gauzy wavings round her face throat and shoulders her small clear forehead gleaming with gentle thought her curved soft and rosy lips the delicate moulding of the lower part of the face expressing purity and integrity of nature were all perfectly grecian her hazel eyes with their arched lids and dark arrowy lashes pierced the soul with their full and thrilling softness she was clad in long and graceful drapery white as snow but pure as this garment was it seemed a rude disguise to the resplendent softness of the limbs it enfolded the delicate light that gleamed from the alabaster lamp above them was a faint simile of the ineffable spirit of love that burned within idalies fair transparent frame and the one trembling shining star of evening that palpitates responsively to happy lovers never seemed more divine or more beloved than she did to ladislas as she sat there now fixing a timid but attentive gaze upon his countenance and then dropping it upon the paper before her and not alone for ladislas was this hour the dawn of passionate love the same spell was felt in the heart of idalie one moment their eyes met and glanced upon each other the look of exalted eternal lovemute blessed and inexpressible their lids fell and were raised no more rapture thrilled their breasts and swelled their full hearts for motionless and in deep silence as if every outward faculty were absorbed in reverence they continued each inwardly knowing hearing seeing nothing but the divine influence and attraction of the other i know not if the portrait was finished i believe it was not noiselessly idalie arose and departed to seek the princess and ladislas followed who is that lovely being inquired an english traveller some time afterward pointing out idalie from a group of ladies a polish girla protge of mine was the reply of the princess a daughter of one of kosciuskos unfortunate followers who died here poor and unknown she has a great genius for drawing and painting but she is so different in her nature from the generality of people that i am afraid she will never get on in the world all the family are wild and strange there is a brother who they say is a complete ruffian brave as a pole and as unprincipled as an italian a villain quite varnished in picturesque like one of your lord byrons corsairs and giaours then there is a younger sister the most uncontrollable little creature who chose to pretend my house was insupportable and ran away into calabria or campagna and set up as a prima donna but these to be sure are the children of a second wife an italian and idalie i must confess has none of their lawlessness but is remarkably gentle and steady disgusted with this heartless conversation which disturbed his ecstasy ladislas hastily quitted the dashkhoff palace and entered the villa reale whose embowering trees promised solitude not one straggler of the gay crowds that frequent this luxurious garden from morning till midnight was now to be seen with its straight walks buried in gloom and shadow its stone fonts of sleeping water its marble statues its heaven pointing obelisks and its midnight air it was silent as a deserted oratory when the last strain of the vesper hymn has died away the last taper has ceased to burn the last censer has been flung and both priests and worshippers have departed ladislas cast himself upon a stone seat in the ilex grove that skirts the margin of the bay i dreamt not of love he exclaimed i sought her not i had renounced life and all its train of raptures hopes and joys cold and void of every wish the shadow of death lay upon my heart suddenly she stood before me lovely as an angel that heralds departed spirits to the kingdom of eternal bliss fearless but mild she poured the magic of her gaze upon my soul i speak the word of the hour she shall be mineor i will die reclining in the ilex grove ladislas passed the remaining hours of that too short night entranced in bliss as if the bright form of his beloved were still shining beside him gradually every beauty of the wondrous and far famed bay of naples impressed itself upon his attention the broad and beamless moon sinking behind the tall elms of posilippo the broken starlight on the surface of the wavestheir rippling sound as they broke at his feet sorrentos purple promontory and the gentle wind that blew from it the solitary grandeur of capris mountain island rising out of the middle of the bay a colossal sphinx guarding two baths of azure light vesuvius breathing its smoke and flame and sparks in the cloudless etherall became mingled in inexplicable harmony with his new born passion and were indelibly associated with his recollection of that night the next morning idalie was sketching in the villa reale she had seated herself on the outside of a shady alley two persons passed behind her and the childish petulant voice of one of them drew her attention that voice so sweet even in its impatience certainly belonged to her fugitive sister it is she exclaimed idalie gliding swift as thought between the trees and folding the speaker to her bosom mariettamy dear little marietta at last you are come back again cattivella now promise to stay with me you know not how miserable i have been about you no i cannot promise anything of the kind replied marietta playing with the ribands of her guitar i choose to have my liberty idalies arms sunk and her eyes were cast upon the ground when she heard the cold and decided tone in which this refusal was pronounced on raising the latter they glanced upon the companion of her sister and were filled with unconquerable emotion at discovering ladislas the elected of her heart i met your sister here a few minutes ago explained he partaking her feelings and having been so fortunate the other day as to render her a slight service oh yes interrupted marietta i sung for him a whole evening at gaeta it was a curious adventure his carriage was overturned close to the inn i had arrived there half an hour before and was walking in an orange grove near the spot and saw the accident happen and heard him speak in polish to his servant my heart beat with joy he looked wondrous melancholy i thought it must be about his country so i crept as softly as a mouse among the trees under his balcony and sung him a salve song in polish i improvised it on the spur of the moment i do not very well recollect it but it was about azure heavens southern winds myrtle and lemon blossoms and the illustrious unfortunate and it ought to have pleased him just as i had finished out starts our blessed brother giorgio from the inn and began one of his most terrific bothers imagine how frightened i was for i thought he was gone to sicily with his regiment however they got him away and i followed this stranger into his room and sang to him the rest of the evening all my best songsthe mio ben quando verr nina pazza per amore the all armi of generali the dolce cara patria from tancredi the deh calma from otelloall my whole stock i assure you thus rattled on marietta and then as if her quick eye had already discovered the secret of their attachment she added with an arch smile but dont be frightened idalie though his eyes filled with tears whilst i sung as yours often do not a word of praise did the sarmatian bestow on me then return and live with me dear marietta and i will praise you as much and more than you desire santa maria del pi di grotta what a tiresome person you are idalie when you have got an idea into your head an earthquake would not get it out again have i not told you that i will not if you knew the motive you would approve my resolution i said i liked my liberty and so forth but that was not the reason of my flight i do not choose to have anything to do with giorgio and the princess for believe me dearest idalie disgraceful as my present mode of life seems to you it is innocence itself compared with the crimes they were leading me into some suspicion of this did once cross my mind her sister replied with a sigh but i rejected it as too horrible dear child think no more about them do you not know that i have left the princess house and am living by myself in a little pavilion far up on the strada nuova there you need not fear their molestations is not giorgio then with you no i have not seen him for some time i doubt if he be in naples so messer giorgio you have deceived me again but i might have known that for he never speaks a word of truth be assured however he is in naples for i caught a glimpse of him this morning mounting the hill that leads to the barracks at pizzofalcone and he is as intimate with the princess as ever though she pretends to disown him as for me i am engaged at san carlos the writing is signed and sealed and cannot be broken without forfeiting a heavy sum of money otherwise i should be happy to live peacefully with you for you know not idalie all i have had to suffer how sad and ill treated i have been how often pinched with want and hunger and worse than that when giorgio takes it into his head to pursue me and plants himself in the pit fixing his horrible looks upon me as i sing how many times i have rushed out of the theatre and spent the nights in the great wide maremma beset by robbers buffaloes and wild boars till i was almost mad with fear and bewilderment there is a curse upon our family i think did not our father once live in a splendid castle of his own with a hundred retainers to wait upon him and do you remember the miserable garret in which he died but i cannot stay any longer i am wanted at the rehearsal so farewell dearest idalie be you at least happy and leave me to fulfil the evil destiny that hangs over our race no no exclaimed ladislas that must not bethe writing must be cancelledand then with the affection and unreserve of a brother he entered into their sentiments with sweet and persuasive arguments overcame their scruples of receiving a pecuniary obligation from him and finally taking marietta by the hand led her away to san carlos in order to cancel her engagement and in another hour it was cancelled marietta was once more free and joyful and affectionate as old friends the three met again in the little pavilion which was idalies home it stood alone in a myrtle wood on the last of the green promontories which form the strada nuova and separate the bay of naples from the bay of baiaa lonely hermitage secluded from the noise and turmoil of the city whose only visitors were the faint winds of morning and evening the smiles of the fair italian heaven its wandering clouds and perchance a solitary bird from every part of the building you could see the baian ocean sparkling breathlessly beneath the sun through the windows and the columns of the portico you beheld the mountains of the distant coast shining on hour after hour like amethysts in a thrilling vapour of purple transparent light so ardent yet halcyon so bright and unreal a poet would have chosen it to emblem the radiant atmosphere that glows around elysian isles of eternal peace and joy marietta soon left the building to join some fisher boys who were dancing the tarantella upon the beach below idalie took her drawing which was her daily employment and furnished her the means of subsistence and ladislas sat by her side there was no sound of rolling carriages no tramp of men and horse no distant singing no one speaking near the wind awoke no rustling amid the leaves of the myrtle wood and the wave died without a murmur on the shore ladislas deep but melodious voice alone broke the crystal silence of the noonday air italy was around him robed in two splendours of blue and green but he was an exile and the recollections of his native land thronged into his memory during the three months it had taken him to effect his escape from warsaw to naples his lips had been closed in silence whilst his mind had been wrapt in the gloom of the dreadful images that haunted it in idalies countenance there was that expression of innocence and sublimity of soul of purity and strength that excited the warmest admiration and inspired sudden and deep confidence she looked like some supernatural being that walks through the world untouched by its corruptions like one that unconsciously yet with delight confers pleasure and peace and ladislas felt that in speaking to her of the dark sorrows of his country they would lose their mortal weight and be resolved into beauty by her sympathy in glowing terms he described the heroic struggle of poland for liberty the triumph and exultation that had filled every bosom during the few months they were free the hardships and privations they had endured the deeds of daring bravery of the men the heroism it had awakened in the women and then its fallthe return of the russians the horrible character of russian despotism its sternness and deceit its pride and selfish ignorance the loss of public and private integrity the disbelief of good the blighted hopeless joyless life endured by those whom it crushes beneath its servitude thus passed the hours of the forenoon then ladislas fixing his eyes upon the coast of baia and expressing at the same time his impatience to visit that ancient resort of heroes and of emperors idalie led the way by a small path down the hill to the beach there they found a skiff and unmooring it from its rocky haven embarked in it it had been sweet to mark the passage of that light bark freighted with these happy lovers when borne by its sails it swept through the little ocean channel that lies between the beaked promontories of the mainland and the closing cliffs of the island of nisida and when with gentler motion it glided into the open expanse of the bay of baia and cut its way through the translucent water above the ruins of temples and palaces overgrown by seaweed on which the rays of the sun were playing creating a thousand rainbow hues that varied with every wave that flowed over them in all that plane of blue light it was the only moving thing and as if it had been the child of the ocean that bore it and the sun that looked down on it it sped gaily along in their smiles past the fortress where brutus and cassius sought shelter after the death of csar past the temples of jupiter and neptune by the ruins of that castle in which three romans once portioned out the world between them to the cumean hill that enshadows the beloved linternum of scipio africanus and in which he died the whole of this coast is a paradise of natural beauty investing with its own loveliness the time eaten wrecks with which it is strewn the mouldering past is mingled with the vivid present ruin and grey annihilation are decked in eternal spring the woody windings of the shore reveal in their deep recesses the gleaming marble fragments of the abodes of ancient heroes the verdurous hues of the promontories mingle with the upright columns of shattered temples or clothe with natures voluptuous bloom the pale funereal urns of departed gods whilst the foliage and the inland fountains and the breaking waves upon the shore were murmuring around their woven minstrelsy of love and joy earth sea and sky blazed like three gods with tranquil but animated loveliness with a splendour that did not dazzlewith a richness that could not satiate the air on that beautiful warm coast was as a field of fragrance the refreshing sea breeze seemed to blow from paradise quickening the senses and bringing to them the odour of a thousand unknown blossoms what world is this exclaimed ladislas in a tone of rapture that nearly answered its own question i could imagine i had entered an enchanted garden four heavens surround methe one above the pure element beneath me with its waves that shine and tremble as stars the adorned earth that hangs over it and the heaven of delight they create within my breast morning is here a rose day a tulip night a lily evening is like morning again a rose and life seems a choral hymn of beautiful and glowing sentiments that i go singing to myself as i wander along this perpetual path of flowers it was night ere they again reached the pavilion it stood dark and deserted in the clear moonshine the door was locked after calling and knocking repeatedly without obtaining any answer it became evident that marietta had quitted the dwelling in the first moment of surprise which this occurrence occasioned they had not observed a written sheet of paper of a large size which lay unfolded and placed directly before the door as if to attract attention idalie took it up and read the following lines traced by marietta oh idalie but a few hours ago how calm and secure we were in happinessnow danger and perhaps destruction is our portion one chance yet remains the moment you get this persuadenot only persuadebut compel that adorable stranger to fly instantly from naples he is not safe here an instant longer do not doubt what i say or his life may be the forfeit how can i impress this on your mind i would not willingly betray any one but how else can i save him giorgio has been here oh the frightful violence of that man he raved like an insane person and let fall such dark and bloody hints as opened worlds of horror to me i am gone to discover what i can i know his haunts and his associates and shall soon find out if there be any truth in what he threatens i could not await your return neither dare i leave the pavilion open who knows if in the interval between my departure and your return an assassin might not conceal himself within and your first welcome be to see the stranger fall lifeless at your feet his every step is watched by spies armed for his destruction i know not what to doand yet it seems to me that my going may possibly avert the catastrophe marietta ladislas listened to these lines unmoved but the effect they produced on idalie was dreadful she gave implicit credence to them and every word sounded as a knell she lost all presence of mind every reflection that might have taught her to avert the stroke she so much dreaded was swallowed up in anguish as if the deed that was to be consummated were already done what task can be more difficult than to describe the overwhelming agony which heavy and unexpected misery produces to have lived the day that idalie had just liveda day in which all the beauty of existence had been unveiled to its very depths to have dreamt as she had done a dream of love that steeped her soul in divine and almost uncommunicable joy and now to sink from this pinnacle of happiness into a black and lampless cavern the habitation of death whose spectral form and chilling spirit was felt through all the air this is but a feeble metaphor of the sudden transition from rapture to misery which idalie experienced she looked upon ladislas and beheld him bright and full of life the roseate hues of health upon his cheek his eyes beaming with peaceful joy his noble countenance varying not in the least from that imperturbable self possession which was its habitual expression and as her imagination made present to her the fatal moment when beneath the dagger of the assassin this adored being should sink bleeding wounded and then be for ever lost in death her blood rushed to her heart a deadly pause ensued from which she awoke in a bewildering mist of horror ladislas beheld her excess of emotion with pain in which however all was not pain for it was blended with that triumphant exultation that a lover ever feels when he for the first time becomes assured that he is beloved by the object of his love with an affection tender and intense as his own as soon as idalie recovered some presence of mind with passionate supplications she entreated ladislas to leave her to fly this solitary spot and to seek safety amid the crowded streets of naples he would not hear of this he gently remonstrated with her upon the unreasonableness of her terrors urging how little probable it was that his passing rencontre with giorgio at gaeta could have awakened in him such a deadly spirit of revenge as marietta represented he viewed the whole thing lightly attributing it either to the vivacity of mariettas imagination which had made her attach a monstrous import to some angry expressions of her brother or looking upon it as a merry device which she had contrived in order to frighten them and tranquillized idalie by assurances that they would shortly see her wild sister return laughing and full of glee at the success of her plot in this expectation two hours passed away but still no marietta appeared and it had grown too late to seek another shelter without exposing idalie to the slander of evil minded people they passed the rest of the night therefore in the portico idalie sometimes pale and breathless with recurring fears and sometimes calm and happy as ladislas poured forth his tale of passionate love his feelings on the contrary were pure and unalloyed where idalie was there was the whole universe to him where she was not there was only a formless void he had an insatiable thirst for her presence which only grew intenser with the enjoyment of its own desire and he blessed the fortunate occurrence that prolonged his bliss during hours which otherwise would have been spent pining in absence from her no other considerations intruded blessings kindled within his eyes as he gazed upon that lovely countenance and faultless form and angels might have envied his happiness morning came bright and serene the sun arose the ocean and the mountains again resumed their magic splendour the myrtle woods and every minuter bloom of the garden shone out beneath the sun and the whole earth was a happy form made perfect by the power of light they recollected that they had promised to join the princess dashkhoff and a large party of her friends at eight oclock in an excursion to pstum the point of meeting was the shore of the villa reale where the numerous guests were to embark in a steamer which had been engaged for the occasion in idalies present homeless and uncertain condition this plan offered some advantages it would enable them to pass the day in each others society under the auspices of the princess and it was to be hoped that on their return the mystery of mariettas disappearance would be unravelled and idalie find her home once more open to her they had scarcely settled to go ere one of those horse calessini which ply in the streets of naples was seen coming towards them its driver a ragged boy sat on the shaft singing as he drove another urchin all in tatters stood as lacquey behind and between them sat marietta the paleness of fear was on her cheeks and her eyes had the staggered affrighted look of one who has gazed upon some appalling horror she hastily descended and bade the calessino retire to some distance and await further orders why is he yet here said she to her sister you foolish blind idalie why did you not mind my lettertoo proud i suppose to obey any but yourself but mark you would not hear my warningswe shall lose him and you will feel them in your hearts core she then with all the violent gesticulation of an italian threw herself at the feet of ladislas and with a countenance that expressed her own full conviction in what she said besought him to fly instantly not only from naples but from italy for his life would never be safe in that land of assassins and traitors with entreaties almost as violent as her own ladislas and idalie urged her to explain but this only threw her into a new frenzy she declared the peril was too urgent to admit of explanationevery moment was preciousanother hours stay in naples would be his death the situation of ladislas was a curious one he had served in the russian campaigns against persia and turkey and had been there daily exposed to the chances of destruction in the late struggle between poland and russia he had performed actions of such determined and daring bravery as had made his name a glory to his countrymen and a terror to their enemies in all these exploits he had devoted himself so unreservedly to death that his escape was considered as a miraculous interposition of heaven it was not to be expected that this mars in a human form this achilles who had braved death in a thousand shapes should now consent to fly before the uplifted finger and visionary warnings of a dream sick girl for such marietta appeared to him to be he pitied her sufferings endeavoured to soothe her but asserted he had seen no reason that could induce him to quit naples a full quarter of an hour elapsed before an explanation could be wrung from marietta the chaos that reigned in her mind may easily be imagined she had become possessed of a secret which involved the life of two persons ladislas refused to save himself unless she revealed what might place her brothers life in jeopardy whichever way she looked destruction closed the view nature had bestowed on her a heart exquisitely alive to the sufferings of others a mind quick in perceiving the nicest lines of moral rectitude and strenuous in endeavouring to act up to its perceptions any deviations in her conduct from these principles had been the work of a fate that strong and fierce as a tempest had bent down her weak youth like a reed beneath its force she had once loved giorgio he had played with and caressed her in infancywith the fond patronage of an elder brother had procured her the only indulgences her orphaned childhood had ever known fraternal love called loudly on her not to endanger his life gratitude as loudly called on her not to allow her benefactor to become his victim this last idea was too horrible to be endured the present moment is ever all powerful with the young and marietta related what she knew well might the poor child be wild and disordered she had passed the night in the catacombs of san gennaro under capo di monte in these subterranean galleries were held the nightly meetings of the band of desperate bravi of whom giorgio was in secret the chief the entrance to the catacombs is in a deserted vineyard and is overgrown by huge aloes rooted in stones and sharp rocks they lift their thorny leaves above the opening and conceal it effectually a solitary fig tree that grows near renders the spot easily recognisable by those already acquainted with the secret the catacombs themselves are wide winding caves the burial place of the dead of past ages piles of human bones white and bleached by time are heaped along the rocky sides of these caverns in one of these walks whilst they were friends giorgio had shown the place to marietta in those days he feared not to entrust his mysterious way of life to her for although in all common concerns she was wild and untractable yet in all that touched the interests of those few whom she loved marietta was silent and reserved as epicharis herself the menaces giorgio let fall in his visit on the preceding forenoon had excited her highest alarm and she determined at any risk to learn the extent of the danger that hung over the stranger after waiting in vain for idalies return till the close of evening she had hastened to capo di monte entered the catacombs alone and concealed behind a pile of bones had awaited the arrival of the confederates they assembled at midnight their first subject of consultation was the stranger giorgio acquainted them with his history which he told them had been communicated to him that very morning by a russian lady of high rank who had likewise charged him with the business he had to unfold to them he described ladislas as a fugitive unprotected by any government he bore about his person certain papers which had been found in the palace of warsaw and were the confidential communications of the russian autocrat to his brother the viceroy of poland and were of such a nature as to rouse all europe against their writer these papers had been entrusted to ladislas whose intention was to proceed to paris and publish them there private business however of the greatest importance had forced him to visit naples first the russian government had traced him to naples and had empowered a certain russian lady to take any step or go any lengths in order to obtain these papers from ladislas this lady had made giorgio her emissary her name he carefully concealed but marietta averred from his description that it could be no other than the princess dashkhoff after much consulting among the band the assassination of the pole had been decided upon this seemed to be the only sure method for he carried the papers ever about his person was distinguished for his bravery and if openly attacked would resist to the last giorgio was no stickler in the means he employed and told his companions he had the less reason to be so in this case as he had received assurances from the highest quarter that his crime should go unpunished and the reward be enormous ladislas was almost unknown in naples the government would not interest itself for a fugitive without passport country or name and what friends had he here to inquire into the circumstances of his destruction or to interest themselves to avenge it such was mariettas tale and ladislas instantly acknowledged the necessity of flight he was too well acquainted with russian perfidy to doubt that even a lady of a rank so distinguished as the princess dashkhoff might be induced to undertake as foul a task as that attributed to her by marietta the worldly and artificial manners of this lady in an italian or a french woman would only have resulted from habits of intrigue but a russian unaccustomed to look on human life as sacred taught by the government of her own country that cruelty and treachery are venial offences wholly destitute of a sense of honour concealed under such an exterior vices the most odious and a callousness to guilt unknown in more civilised lands ladislas knew this and he knew that the badness of the neapolitan government afforded scope for crime which could not exist elsewhere and he felt that on every account it were better to withdraw himself immediately from the scene of danger while musing on these things idalies beseeching eyes were eloquent in imploring him to fly he consented but a condition was annexed to his consent that idalie should share his flight he urged his suit with fervour it were easy for them on a very brief notice to seek the young ladys confessor induce him to bestow on them the nuptial benediction and thus to sanctify their departure together marietta seconded the lovers entreaties and idalie blushing and confused could only reply my accompanying you would but increase your danger and facilitate the bravos means of tracing you how could i get a passport how leave this place i have a plan for all replied ladislas and he then related that the sully steam packet lay in the harbour of naples ready to sail on the shortest notice he would engage that for their conveyance and so speedily bid adieu to the shores of naples and all its perils but that boat exclaimed idalie is the very one engaged by the princess for the excursion to pstum this for a time seemed to disarrange their schemes but they considered that no danger could happen to ladislas while one of a party of pleasure with the princess who from this act of his would be quite unsuspicious of his intended departure at night upon their return from pstum when the rest of the party should have disembarked at naples ladislas and idalie would remain on board and the vessel immediately commence its voyage for france this plan thus assumed a very feasible appearance while ladislas in accents of fond reproach asked idalie wherefore she refused to share his fortunes and accompany him in his journey and marietta clapping her hands exclaimed she consents she consents do not ask any more she has already yielded we will all return to naples ladislas shall go immediately to seek out the captain of the sully and arrange all with him while without loss of time we will proceed to the convent of father basil and get everything ready by the time ladislas shall join us which must be with as much speed as he can contrive idalie silently acquiesced in this arrangement and ladislas kissed her hand with warm and overflowing gratitude they now contrived to stow themselves in the little calessino and as they proceeded on their way ladislas said we seem to have forgotten the future destiny of our dear marietta all this time the friendless condition in which we shall leave her fills me with anxiety she is the preserver of my life and we are both under the deepest obligations to her what shall you do marietta when we are gone fear not for me exclaimed the wild girl it is necessary i should remain behind to arrange those things which idalies sudden departure will leave in sad disorder but you will see me soon in paris for how can i exist apart from my sister when near to naples ladislas alighted from the calessino and directed his steps towards the port while the fair girls proceeded on their way to the convent what the bashful conscious idalie would have done without her sisters help it is difficult to guess marietta busied herself about all won over the priest to the sudden marriage contrived to put up articles of dress for the fair brides journey and thinking of everything seemed the guardian angel of the lovers ladislas arrived at the convent he had been successful with the master of the steam packet and all was prepared marietta heard this from his own lips and carried the happy news to idalie he did not see her till they met at the altar where kneeling before the venerable priest they were united for ever and now time as it sped on gave them no moment to indulge their various and overpowering feelings idalie embraced her sister again and again and entreating her to join them speedily in paris made her promise to write and then escorted by her husband proceeded to the sully on board of which most of the party were already assembled the steamer proceeded on its course farewell to naplesthat elysian city as the poet justly calls it that favourite of sea and land and sky the hills that surround it smooth their rugged summits and descend into gentle slopes and opening defiles to receive its buildings and habitations temples domes and marble palaces are ranged round the crescent form of the bay and above them arise dark masses and wooded clefts and fair gardens whose trees are ever vernal before it the mighty sea binds its wild streams and smoothes them into gentlest waves as they kiss the silver pebbly shore and linger with dulcet murmur around the deep based promontories the skywho has not heard of the italian skyone intense diffusion one serene omnipresence for ever smiling above the boundless sea and for ever bending in azure mirth over the flowing outlines of the distant mountains they first passed castel a mare and then the abrupt promontories on which sorrento and ancient amalfi are situated the sublimity and intense loveliness of the scene wrapt in delight each bosom the hills covered with ilex dark laurel and bright leaved myrtle were mirrored in the pellucid waves which the lower branches caressed and kissed as the winds waved them behind arose other hills also covered with wood and more distant forming the grand background was sketched the huge ridge of lofty apennines still proceeding on their way to pstum they exchanged the rocky beach for a low and dreary shore the dusky mountains retired inland and leaving a wastethe abode of malaria and the haunt of robbersthe landscape assumed a gloomy magnificence in place of the romantic and picturesque loveliness which had before charmed their eyes ladislas leaned from the side of the vessel and gazed upon the beauty of nature with sentiments too disturbed for happiness he was annoyed by the unpropitious presence of the idle and the gay he saw idalie in the midst of them and did not even wish to join her while thus situated he shrank into himself and tried forgetting the immediate discomforts of his position to think only of that paradise into which love had led him to compensate for his patriotic sorrows he strove patiently to endure the tedious hours of this never ending day during which he must play a false part and see his bride engaged by others while his attention was thus occupied the voice of the princess dashkhoff startled him and looking up he wondered how a face that seemed so bland and a voice that spoke so fair could hide so much wickedness and deceit as the hours passed on his situation became irksome in the extreme once or twice he drew near idalie and tried to disengage her from the crowd but each time he saw the princess watching him stealthily while his young bride with feminine prudence avoided every opportunity of conversing apart with him ladislas could ill endure this he began to fancy that he had a thousand things to say and that their mutual safety depended on his being able to communicate them to her he wrote a few lines hastily on the back of a letter with a pencil conjuring her to find some means of affording him a few minutes conversation and telling her that if this could not be done before he should take occasion while the rest of the company were otherwise occupied to steal from them that evening to the larger temple and there await her joining him for that everything depended on his being able to speak to her he scarcely knew what he meant as he wrote this but driven by contradiction and impatience and desirous of learning exactly how she meant to conduct herself on the princesss disembarking at naples it seemed to him of the last importance that his request should be complied with he was folding the paper when the princess was at his side and addressed him a sonnet count ladislas surely a poetic imagination inspires you may i not see it and she held out her hand taken unaware ladislas darted at her a look which made her step back trembling and in surprise was she discovered the idea was fraught with terror but ladislas perceiving the indiscretion of his conduct masked his sensations with a smile and replied they are words of a polish song which i wish idalie to translate for the amusement of your friends and stepping forward he gave idalie the paper and made his request all pressed to know what the song was idalie glanced at the writing and changing colour was scarcely able to command her voice to make such an excuse as was rendered necessary she said that it required time and thought and that she could not at that moment comply then crushing the paper between her trembling fingers began confusedly to talk of something else the company interchanged smiles but even the princess only suspected some lover like compliment to her protge nay she said we must at least know the subject of these verses what is it tell us i entreat you treachery said ladislas unable to control his feelings the princess became ashy pale all her self possession fled and she turned from the searching glance of the pole with sickness of heart they were now drawing near their destination idalie grasping the paper longed to read it before they should reach the shore she tried to recede from the party and ladislas watching her movements in order to facilitate her designs entered into conversation with the princess he had effectually roused her fears and her curiosity and she eagerly seized the opportunity which he offered her of conversing with him endeavouring to find out whether he indeed suspected anything or whether her own guilty conscience suggested the alarm with which his strange expression had filled her ladislas thus contrived to engross her entire attention and led her insensibly towards the stern of the vessel and as they leant over its side and gazed on the waters beneath idalie was effectually relieved from all observation she now disengaged herself from the rest of the party and walking forward read the lines pencilled by ladislas then terrified by the secret they contained she tore the paper as if fearful that its contents might be guessed and was about to throw the fragments into the sea when she perceived the position of the princess and ladislas and was aware that the ladys quick eye would soon discern the floating scraps as the boat passed on idalie feared the least shadow of danger so she retreated from the vessels side but still anxious to get rid of the perilous papers she determined to throw them into the hold she approached it and looked down had the form of a serpent met her eye she had not been more horror struck a shriek hovered on her lips but with a strong effort she repressed it and staggering on leant against the mast trembling and aghast she could not be deceived it was giorgios dark and scowling eye that she had encounteredhis sinister countenance upturned could not be mistaken was danger then so near so pressing or so inevitable how could she convey the fatal intelligence to her husband and put him on his guard she remembered his written request with which she had previously determined in prudence not to comply but it would now afford her an opportunity should no other offer of informing him whom she had seen thus perfidy hate and fear possessed the hearts of these human beings who had a cursory observer seen them as they glided over that sea of beauty beneath the azure heaven along that enchanted shore attended by every luxury waited on by every obvious blessing of lifehe would have imagined that they had been selected from the world for the enjoyment of perfect happiness but sunny sky and laughing sea appeared to idalie only as the haunt and resort of tigers and serpents a dark mist seemed to blot the splendour of the sky as the guilty souls of her fellow creatures cast their deforming shadows over its brightness they had now arrived close on the low shore and horses and two or three light open carriages were at the waters edge to convey them to the temples they landed ladislas presented himself to hand idalie across the plank from the vessel to the beach yeshe asked her in a voice of entreaty as he pressed her hand she softly returned the pressure and the word beware trembled on her lips when the young englishman who had before admired her and had endeavoured to engross her attention the whole day was again at her side to tell her that the princess was waiting for her in her carriage and entreated her not to delay the party proceeded to where those glorious relics stand between the mountains and the sea rising from the waste and barren soil alone on the wide and dusky shore a few sheep grazed at the base of the columns and two or three wild eyed men clothed in garments of undressed sheepskin loitered about exclamations of wonder and delight burst from all while ladislas stealing away to the more distant ruin gladly escaped from the crowd to indulge in lonely reverie what is man in his highest glory he thought had we burst the bonds of poland and had she in her freedom emulated the magical achievements of greece nevertheless when time with insidious serpent windings had dragged its length through a few more centuries the monuments we had erected would have fallen like these and our monumentsa new pstumhave existed merely to excite idle wonder and frivolous curiosity ladislas was certainly in no good humour while he thus vented his spleen but was annoyed by two circumstances sufficient to irritate a young philosopher he beheld a scene whose majestic beauty filled his soul with sensibility and awe in the midst of a crowd of pretenders more intent on the prospect of their picnic dinner than on regarding the glories of art and he saw his bride surrounded by strangers engrossed by their conversation and flattery and unable to interchange one word or look of confidence with him he sighed for the hours passed under the portico of idalies solitary pavilion and the near prospect of their voyage did not reconcile him to the present for his soul was disturbed by the necessity of interchanging courtesies with his enemy and haunted by images of treacherous attempts from which his valour could not protect him it had been arranged that the party should dine at the archbishops palace and not embark again until ten oclock when the moon would rise after a couple of hours spent among the ruins the servants informed them that their repast was ready it was now nearly six oclock and after they had dined more than two hours must elapse before they could depart night had fallen on the landscape and the darkness did not invite even the most romantic to wander again among the ruins the princess eager to provide for the amusement of her guests contrived to discover a violin a flute and a pipe and with the assistance of this music which in the hands of italian rustics was as true to time and expression as if weippert himself had presided they commenced dancing idalies hand was sought by the englishman she looked round the room ladislas was not there he had doubtless repaired to the temple to wait for her and ignorant of the presence of giorgio wholly unsuspicious and off his guard to what dangers might he not be exposed her blood ran cold at the thought she decidedly refused to dance and perceiving the princess whirling round in a waltz she hastily quitted the house and hurried along over the grass towards the ruins when she first emerged into the night the scene seemed wrapped in impenetrable darkness but the stars shed their faint rays and in a few moments she began to distinguish objects and as she drew near the temple she saw a mans form moving slowly among the columns she did not doubt that it was her husband wrapped in his cloak awaiting her she was hurrying towards him when leaning against one of the pillars she saw ladislas himself and the other at the same moment exchanging his stealthy pace for a tiger like spring she saw a dagger flashing in his hand she darted forward to arrest his arm and the blow descended on her with a faint shriek she fell on the earth when ladislas turned and closed with the assassin a mortal struggle ensued already had ladislas wrested the poignard from his grasp when the villain drew another knife ladislas warded off the blow and plunged his own stiletto in the bravos breast he fell to earth with a heavy groan and then the silence of the tomb rested on the scene the white robe of idalie who lay fainting on the ground directed ladislas to her side he raised her up in speechless agony as he beheld the blood which stained her dress but by this time she had recovered from her swoon she assured him her wound was slight that it was nothing but again sank into his arms insensible in a moment his plan was formed ever eager and impetuous he executed it ere any second thought could change it he had before resolved not to rejoin the party in the archbishops palace but after his interview with idalie to hasten on board the steamboat he had therefore ordered his horse to be saddled had led it to the temple and fastened it to one of the columns he lifted the senseless idalie carefully in his arms mounted his horse and turning his steps from the lighted and noisy palace wound his way to the lonely shore where he found the captain and his crew already preparing for their homeward voyage with their help idalie was taken on board and ladislas gave orders for the instant heaving of the anchor and their immediate departure the captain asked for the rest of the company they return by land said ladislas as he spoke the words he felt a slight sensation of remorse remembering the difficulty they would have to get there and how during the darkness of night they might fear to proceed on their journey on a tract of country infested by banditti but the senseless and pale form of idalie dissipated these thoughts to arrive at naples to procure assistance for her and then if as he hoped her wound was slight to continue their voyage before the princess dashkhoffs return were motives too paramount to allow him to hesitate the captain of the sully asked no more questions the anchor was weighed and in the silver light of the moon they stood off from the shore and made their swift way back to naples they had not gone far before the care of ladislas revived his fair bride her wound was in her arm and had merely grazed the skin terror for her husband horror for the mortal strife which had endangered his life had caused her to faint more than pain or loss of blood she bound up her own arm and then as there appeared no necessity for medical aid ladislas revoked his orders for returning to naples but stretching out at once to sea they began their voyage to marseilles meanwhile during a pause in the dance the absence of ladislas and idalie was observed by the feasters in the archbishops palace it excited some few sarcasms which as it continued grow more bitter the princess dashkhoff joined in these and yet she could not repress the disquietude of her heart had ladislas alone been absent her knowledge of the presence of giorgio and his designs had sufficiently explained its cause and its duration to her but that idalie also should not be found might bring a witness to the crime committed and discover her own guilty share in the deed of blood perpetrated at her instigation at length the rising of the moon announced the hour when they were to repair to the shore the horses and carriages were brought to the door and then it was found that the steed of ladislas was missing but the signora idalie had she not provided herself with a palfrey asked the englishman sneering they were now about to mount when it was proposed to take a last look of the temples by moonlight the princess opposed this but vainly her conscience made her voice faint and took from her the usual decision of her manner so she walked on silently half fearful that her foot might strike against some object of terror and at every word spoken by the party anticipating an exclamation of horror the fitful moonbeams seemed to disclose here and there ghastly countenances and mangled limbs and the dew of night appeared to her excited imagination as the slippery moisture of the life blood of her victim they had scarcely entered the temple when a peasant brought the news that the steamboat was gonehe led ladislas horse who had put the bridle into the mans hands on embarking and the fellow declared that the fainting idalie was his companion terror at the prospect of their dark ride indignation at the selfish proceeding of the lovers raised every voice against them and the princess whom conscience had before made the most silent hearing that the pole was alive and safe was now loudest and most bitter in her remarks as they were thus all gathered together in dismay debating what was to be done and the princess dashkhoff in no gentle terms railing at the impropriety and ingratitude of idalies behaviour and declaring that poles alone could conduct themselves with such mingled deceit and baseness a figure all bloody arose from the ground at her feet and as the moon cast its pale rays on his yet paler countenance she recognised giorgio the ladies shrieked the men rushed towards him while the princess desiring the earth to open and swallow her stood transfixed as by a spell gazing on the dying man in terror and despair he has escaped lady said giorgio ladislas has escaped your plots and i am become their victim he fell as he spoke these words and when the englishman drew near to raise and if possible assist him he found that life had entirely flown thus ended the adventures of the pole at naples the princess returned in her calche alone for none would bear her company the next day she left naples and was on her way to russia where her crime was unknown except to those who had been accomplices in it marietta spread the intelligence of her sisters marriage and thus entirely cleared idalies fair fame and quitting italy soon after joined the happy ladislas and his bride at paris xv euphrasia a tale of greece it was not long after the breaking out of the greek revolution that harry valency visited greece many an englishman was led thither at that time by the spirit of adventure and many perished valency was not nineteen his spirit was wild and recklessthought or care had never touched his brow his heart was too light for love restless and energetic he longed to try his powers with the instinct that leads the young deer to butt against trees or to wrestle with each other in the forest dells he was the only son of a widowed mother whose life was wrapped in his and he loved her fondly yet left her impelled by a desire for adventure unable to understand what anxiety and fear meant and in his own person eager to meet even misfortune so that it came in a guise to call forth manly and active struggles he longed to have the pages of his young life written over by deeds that would hereafter be memories to which he could turn with delight the cause of greece warmed his soul he was in a transport of ecstasy when he touched the shores of that antique land and looked around on mountain and mountain stream whose names were associated with the most heroic acts and the most sublime poetry man ever achieved or wrote yes he was now in greece he was about to fight in her cause against the usurping turk he had prepared himself by a sedulous study of romaic he was on his way to the seat of government to offer his services to proceed thither from the spot where he had disembarked was a matter of some difficulty the turkish troops being then in possession of many of the passes at length he heard that a band of about fifty greek soldiers headed by a young but brave and renowned chief was about to pursue the same road he asked and obtained leave to accompany them how delightful was the commencement of the journey how beautiful the countrydefile and steep hill side by which they proceeded where the grey olive clothed the upland or vines embracing elms red now with late summer tints varied the scene the mountain tops were bare or crowned with pines and torrents ran down the sides and fed a stream in the dell the air was balmy the cicada loud and merryto live was to be happy valency was mounted on a spirited horse he made it leap and caracole he threw a spear against a tree and dashed after to recover it he fired at a mark as he hurried on at full gallop every feat was insufficient to tame his exhaustless spirits the chief marked him with eyes whose deep melancholy expression darkened as he gazed he was known as bravest among the brave yet gentle as a woman he was young and singularly handsome his countenance was stamped with traces of intellectual refinement while his person was tall muscular and strong but so gracefully formed that every attitude reminded you of some praxitilean shape of his own native land once he had been more beautiful joy as well as tenderness and a soldiers ardour had lighted up his dark eye his lip had been the home of smiles and the thoughts which presided in his brow had been as clear and soft and gladsome as that godlike brow itself now this was changed grief had become a master passion his cheeks were sunken his eye seemed to brood eternally over melancholy regrets his measured harmonious voice was attuned to the utterance of no light fancy or gay sallies he spoke only the necessary words of direction to his followers and then silence and gloom gathered over his face his sorrow was respected for it was known to be well founded and to spring from a recent disaster if any of his troop desired to indulge in merriment they withdrew from his vicinity it was strange to them to hear the light laugh of the english youth ring through the grove and to catch the tones of his merry voice as he sang some of their own gayest songs the chief gazed with interest there was a winning frankness in the boy he was so very young and all he did was in graceful accordance with his age we are alike mere youths thought the chief and how different yet soon he may become like me he soars like an eagle but the eagle may be wounded and stoop to earth because earth contains its secret and its regret suddenly valency who was some hundred yards in advance was encountered by a greek riding at full speed towards the advancing troop back back silence the man cried he was a scout who had been sent on before and now brought tidings that a troop of three or four hundred of the turkish army were entering the defile and would soon advance on the handful of men which valency accompanied the scout rode directly up to the leader and made his report adding we have yet time if we fall back but a quarter of a mile there is a path i know by which i can guide you across the mountain on the other side we shall be safe a smile of scorn for a moment wreathed the lip of the chief at the word safety but his face soon reassumed its usual sad composure the troop had halted each man bent his eye on the leader valency in particular marked the look of scorn and felt that he would never retreat before danger comrades the chief thus addressed his men it shall never be said that greeks fell back to make way for the destroyers we will betake ourselves to our old warfare before we entered this olive wood we passed a thick cover where the dark jutting mountain side threw a deep shadow across our path and the torrent drowned all sound of voice or hoof there we shall find ambush there the enemy will meet death he turned his horses head and in a few minutes reached the spot he named the men were mostly eager for the fraywhile one or two eyed the mountain side and then the path that led to the village which they had quitted that morning the chief saw their look and he glanced also at the english youth who had thrown himself from his horse and was busy loading and priming his arms the chief rode up to him you are our guest and fellow traveller he said but not our comrade in the fight we are about to meet dangerit may be that not one of us shall escape you have no injuries to avenge no liberty to gain you have friendsprobably a motherin your native land you must not fall with us i am going to send a message to warn the village we last passed throughdo you accompany my messengers valency had listened attentively at first but as the chief continued his attention reverted to his task of loading his pistols the last words called a blush into his cheek you treat me as a boy he cried i may be one in aspect but you shall find me a man in heart this day you also young i have not deserved your scorn the chief caught the youths flashing eye he held out his hand to him saying forgive me i will said valency on one condition give me a post of dangerof honour you owe it to me in reparation of the insult you offered be it so said the chief your place shall be at my side a few minutes more and his dispositions were madetwo of the most down hearted of the troop were despatched to alarm the village the rest were placed behind the rocks beneath the bushes wherever broken ground or tuft of underwood or fragment from the cliff afforded shelter and concealment a man was placed while the chief himself took his stand on an elevated platform and sheltered by a tree gazed upon the road soon the tramp of horses the busy sound of feet and voices were heard overpowering the rushing of the stream and turban and musket could be distinguished as the enemys troop threaded the defile the shout of battlethe firingthe clash of weapons were over above the crest of the hill whose side had afforded ambush to the greeks the crescent moon hung just about to dip behind the stars in her train burnt bright as lamps floating in the firmament while the fire flies flashed among the myrtle underwood and up the mountain side and sometimes the steel of the arms strewn around dropped from the hand of the dead caught and reflected the flashes of the celestial or earthly stars the ground was strewn with the slain such of the enemy as had cut their way through were already farthe sound of their horses hoofs had died away the greeks who had fled across the mountain had reached a place of safetynone lay there but the silent deadcold as the moonbeam that rested for a moment on their pale faces all were still and motionless some lay on the hill side among the underwoodsome on the open roadhorses and men had fallen pell mellnone movednone breathed yet there was a sighit was lost in the murmur of the stream a groan succeeded and then a voice feeble and broken my mother my poor motherthe pale lips that spoke these words could form no other a gush of tears followed the cry seemed to awake another form from among the dead one of the prostrate bodies raised itself slowly and painfully on its arm the eyes were filmy the countenance pallid from approaching death the voice was hollow yet firm that said who speakswho liveswho weeps the question struck shame to the wounded man he checked his overflow of passionate sobbings the other spoke again it was not the voice of a greekyet i thought i had saved that gallant boythe ball meant for him is now in my sidespeak again young englishmanon whom do you call on her who will weep my death too bitterlyon my mother replied valency and tears would follow the loved name art thou wounded to death asked the chief thus unaided i must die he replied yet could i reach those waters i might livei must try and valency rose he staggered a few steps and fell heavily at the feet of the chief he had fainted the greek looked on the ghastly pallor of his face he half rosehis own wound did not bleed but it was mortal and a deadly sickness had gathered round his heart and chilled his brow which he strove to master that he might save the english boy the effort brought cold drops on his brow as he rose on his knees and stooped to raise the head of valency he shuddered to feel the warm moisture his hand encountered it is his blood his life blood he thought and again he placed his head on the earth and continued a moment still summoning what vitality remained to him to animate his limbs then with a determined effort he rose and staggered to the banks of the stream he held a steel cap in his handand now he stooped down to fill it but with the effort the ground slid from under him and he fell there was a ringing in his earsa cold dew on his browhis breath came thickthe cap had fallen from his handhe was dying the bough of a tree shot off in the mornings mele lay nearthe mind even of a dying man can form swift unerring combinations of thoughtit was his last chancethe bough was plunged in the waters and he scattered the grateful reviving drops over his face vigour returned with the act and he could stoop and fill the cap and drink a deep draught which for a moment restored the vital powers and now he carried water to valency he dipped the unfolded turban of a turk in the stream and bound the youths wound which was a deep sabre cut in the shoulder that had bled copiously valency revivedlife gathered warm in his hearthis cheeks though still pale lost the ashy hue of deathhis limbs again seemed willing to obey his willhe sat up but he was too weak and his head dropped as a mother tending her sick first born the greek chief hovered over him he brought a cloak to pillow his head as he picked up this he found that some careful soldier had brought a small bag at his saddle bow in which was a loaf and a bunch or two of grapes he gave them to the youth who ate valency now recognised his saviour at first he wondered to see him there tending on him apparently unhurt but soon the chief sank to the ground and valency could mark the rigidity of feature and ghastliness of aspect that portended death in his turn he would have assisted his friend but the chief stopped himyou die if you move he said your wound will bleed afresh and you will die while you cannot aid me my weakness does not arise from mere loss of blood the messenger of death has reached a vital partyet a little while and the soul will obey the summons it is slow slow is the deliverance yet the long creeping hour will come at last and i shall be free do not speak thus cried valency i am strong nowi will go for help there is no help for me replied the chief save the death i desire i command you move not valency had risen but the effort was vain his knees bent under him his head spun round before he could save himself he had sunk to the ground why torture yourself said the chief a few hours and help will come it will not injure you to pass this interval beneath this calm sky the cowards who fled will alarm the country by dawn succour will be here you must wait for it i too must waitnot for help but for death it is soothing even to me to die here beneath this sky with the murmurs of yonder stream in my ear the shadows of my native mountains thrown athwart could aught save me it would be the balmy airs of this most blessed night my soul feels the bliss though my body is sick and fast stiffening in death such was not the hour when she died whom soon i shall meet my euphrasia my own sweet sister in heaven it was strange valency said that at such an hour but half saved from death and his preserver in the grim destroyers clutches that he should feel curiosity to know the greek chiefs story his youth his beauty his valourthe act which valency well remembered of his springing forward so as to shield him with his own personhis last words and thoughts devoted to the soft recollection of a beloved sisterawakened an interest beyond even the present hour fraught as it was with the chances of life and death he questioned the chief probably fever had succeeded to his previous state of weakness imparted a deceitful strength and even inclined him to talk for thus dying unaided and unsheltered with the starry sky overhead he willingly reverted to the years of his youth and to the miserable event which a few months before had eclipsed the sun of his life and rendered death welcome theybrother and sister constantine and euphrasiawere the last of their race they were orphans their youth was passed under the guardianship of the brother by adoption of their father whom they named father and who loved them he was a glorious old man nursed in classic lore and more familiar with the deeds of men who had glorified his country several thousand years before than with any more modern names yet all who had ever done and suffered for greece were embalmed in his memory and honoured as martyrs in the best of causes he had been educated in paris and travelled in europe and america and was aware of the progress made in the science of politics all over the civilised world he felt that greece would soon share the benefits to arise from the changes then operating and he looked forward at no distant day to its liberation from bondage he educated his young ward for that day had he believed that greece would have continued hopelessly enslaved he had brought him up as a scholar and a recluse but assured of the impending struggle he made him a warrior he implanted a detestation of the oppressor a yearning love for the sacred blessings of freedom a noble desire to have his name enrolled among the deliverers of his country the education he bestowed on euphrasia was yet more singular he knew that though liberty must be bought and maintained by the sword yet that its dearest blessings must be derived from civilisation and knowledge and he believed women to be the proper fosterers of these they cannot handle a sword nor endure bodily labour for their country but they could refine the manners exalt the soulsimpart honour and truth and wisdom to their relatives and their children euphrasia therefore he made a scholar by nature she was an enthusiast and a poet the study of the classic literature of her country corrected her taste and exalted her love of the beautiful while a child she improvised passionate songs of liberty and as she grew in years and loveliness and her heart opened to tenderness and she became aware of all the honour and happiness that a woman must derive from being held the friend of man not his slave she thanked god that she was a greek and a christian and holding fast by the advantages which these names conferred she looked forward eagerly to the day when mohammedanism should no longer contaminate her native land and when her countrywomen should be awakened from ignorance and sloth in which they were plunged and learn that their proper vocation in the creation was that of mothers of heroes and teachers of sages her brother was her idol her hope her joy and he who had been taught that his career must be that of deeds not words yet was fired by her poetry and eloquence to desire glory yet more eagerly and to devote himself yet more entirely and with purer ardour to the hope of one day living and dying for his country the first sorrow the orphans knew was the death of their adopted father he descended to the grave full of years and honour constantine was then eighteen his fair sister had just entered her fifteenth year often they spent the night beside the revered tomb of their lost friend talking of the hopes and aspirations he had implanted the young can form such sublime such beautiful dreams no disappointment no evil no bad passion shadows their glorious visions to dare and do greatly for greece was the ambition of constantine to cheer and watch over her brother to regulate his wilder and more untaught soul to paint in celestial colours the bourne he tended towards by action were euphrasias tasks there is a heaven said the dying man as he told his talethere is a paradise for those who die in the just cause i know not what joys are there prepared for the blest but they can scarcely transcend those that were mine as i listened to my own sweet sister and felt my heart swell with patriotism and fond warm affection at length there was a stir through the land and constantine made a journey of some distance to confer with the capitani of the mountains and to prepare for the outbreak of the revolution the moment came sooner even than he expected as an eagle chained when the iron links drop from him and with clang of wing and bright undazzled eye he soars to heaven so did constantine feel when freedom to greece became the war cry he was still among the mountains when first the echoes of his native valleys repeated that animating that sacred word instead of returning as he intended to his athenian home he was hurried off to western greece and became a participator in a series of warlike movements the promised success of which filled him with transport suddenly a pause came in the delirium of joy which possessed his soul he received not the accustomed letters from his sistermissives which had been to him angelic messengers teaching him patience with the unworthyhope in disappointmentcertainty of final triumph those dear letters ceased and he thought he saw in the countenances of his friends around a concealed knowledge of evil he questioned them their answers were evasive at the same time they endeavoured to fill his mind with the details of some anticipated exploit in which his presence and co operation was necessary day after day passed he could not leave his post without injury to the cause without even the taint of dishonour he belonged to a band of albanians by whom he had been received as a brother and he could not desert them in the hour of danger but the suspense grew too terrible and at length finding that there was an interval of a few days which he might call his own he left the camp resting neither day nor night dismounting from one horse only to bestride another in forty eight hours he was in athens before his vacant desecrated home the tale of horror was soon told athens was still in the hands of the turks the sister of a rebel had become the prey of the oppressor she had none to guard her her matchless beauty had been seen and marked by the son of the pasha she had for the last two months been immured in his harem despair is a cold dark feeling said the dying warrior if i may name that despair which had a hopea certaintyan aim had euphrasia died i had wept now my eyes were hornmy heart stone i was silent i neither expressed resentment nor revenge i concealed myself by day at night i wandered round the tyrants dwelling it was a pleasure palace one of the most luxurious in our beloved athens at this time it was carefully guarded my character was known and euphrasias worth and the oppressor feared the result of his deed still under shadow of darkness i drew near i marked the position of the womens apartmentsi learned the numberthe length of the watchthe orders they received and then i returned to the camp i revealed my project to a few select spirits they were fired by my wrongs and eager to deliver my euphrasia constantine broke offa spasm of pain shook his body after this had passed he lay motionless for a few minutes then starting up as fever and delirium excited by the exertion of speaking increased by the agonies of recollection at last fully possessed him what is this he cried fire yes the palace burns do you not hear the roaring of the flames and thunder toothe artillery of heaven levelled against the unblest ha a shothe fallsthey are driven backnow fling the torchesthe wood cracklesthere there are the womens roomsha poor victims lo you shudder and fly fear not give me only my euphrasiamy own euphrasia no disguise can hide thee dressed as a turkish bride crowned with flowers thy lovely face the seat of unutterable woestill my sweet sister even in this smoke and tumult of this house thou art the angel of my life spring into my arms poor frightened bird cling to

notwhat eyes glarefear not euphrasia he is deadthe miserable retainers of the tyrant fell beneath our onsetha a shotgracious panagia is this thy protection thus did he continue to rave the onset the burning of the palace the deliverance of his sister all seemed to pass again vividly as if in present action his eyes glared he tossed up his arms he shouted as if calling his followers around him and then in tones of heartfelt tenderness he addressed the fair burden he fancied that he boretill with a shriek he cried again a shot and sank to the ground as if his heartstrings had broken an interval of calm succeeded he was exhausted his voice was broken what have i told thee he continued feebly i have said how a mere handful of men attacked the palace and drove back the guardshow we strove in vain to make good our entrancefresh troops were on their waythere was no alternative we fired the palace deep in the seclusion of the harem the women had retreated a herd of frightened deer one alone stood erect her eyes bent on the intrudersa dagger in her handmajestic and fearless her face was marked with traces of passed suffering but at the moment the stern resolution her soft features expressed was more than human the moment she saw me all was changed the angel alone beamed in her countenance her dagger fell from her handshe was in my armsi bore her from the burning roofthe rest you know have i not said it some miscreant who survived the slaughter and yet lay as dead on the earth aimed a deadly shot she did not shriek at first she clung closer to my neck and then i felt her frame shiver in my arms and her hold relax i trusted that fear alone moved her but she knew not fearit was death horses had been prepared and were waiting a few hours more and i hoped to be on our way to the west to that portion of greece that was free but i felt her head fall on my shoulder i heard her whisper i die my brother carry me to our fathers tomb my soul yearned to comply with her request but it was impossible the city was alarmed troops gathering from all quarters our safety lay in flight for still i thought that her wound was not mortal i bore her to the spot where we had left our horses here two or three of my comrades speedily joined me they had rescued the women of the harem from the flames but the various sounds denoting the advance of the turkish soldiery caused them to hurry from the scene i leapt on my horse and placed my sweet sister before me and we fled amain through desert streets i well knew how to choose and along the lanes of the suburbs into the open country where deviating from the high road along which i directed my companions to proceed in all hastealone with my beloved burden i sought a solitary unsuspected spot among the neighbouring hills the storm which had ceased for a time now broke afresh the deafening thunder drowned every other sound while the frequent glare of the lightning showed us our path my horse did not quail before it euphrasia still lay clinging to me no complaint escaped her a few words of fondness of encouragement of pious resignation she now and then breathed forth i knew not she was dying till at last entering a retired valley where an olive wood afforded shelter and still better the portico of a fallen ancient temple i dismounted and bore her to the marble steps on which i placed her then indeed i felt how near the beloved one was to death from which i could not save her the lightning showed me her facepale as the marble which pillowed it her dress was dabbled in warm blood which soon stained the stones on which she lay i took her hand it was deathly cold i raised her from the marble i pillowed her cheek upon my heart i repressed my despair or rather my despair in that hour was mild and soft as herself there was no helpno hope the life blood oozed fast from her side scarce could she raise her heavy eyelids to look on me her voice could no longer articulate my name the burden of her fair limbs grew heavier and more chill soon it was a corpse only that i held when i knew that her sufferings were over i raised her once more in my arms and once more i placed her before me on my horse and betook me to my journey the storm was over now and the moon bright above earth glittered under the rays and a soft breeze swept by as if heaven itself became clear and peaceful to receive her stainless soul and present it to its maker by mornings dawn i stopped at a convent gate and rang to the holy maidens within i consigned my own fair euphrasia i kissed but once again her dear brow which spoke of peace in death and then saw her placed upon a bier and was away back to my camp to live and die for greece he grew more silent as he became weaker now and then he spoke a few words to record some other of euphrasias perfections or to repeat some of her dying words to speak of her magnanimity her genius her love and his own wish to die i might have lived he said till her image had faded in my mind or been mingled with less holy memories i die young all her own his voice grew more feeble after this he complained of cold valency continued i contrived to rise and crawl about and to collect a capote or two and a pelisse from among the slain with some of which i covered him and then i drew one over myself for the air grew chill as midnight had passed away and the morning hour drew near the warmth which the coverings imparted calmed the aching of my wound and strange to say i felt slumber creep over me i tried to watch and wake at first the stars above and the dark forms of the mountains mingled with my dreamy feelings but soon i lost all sense of where i was and what i had suffered and slept peacefully and long the morning sunbeams as creeping down the hill side they at last fell upon my face awoke me at first i had forgotten all thought of the events of the past night and my first impulse was to spring up crying aloud where am i but the stiffness of my limbs and their weakness soon revealed the truth gladly i now welcomed the sound of voices and marked the approach of a number of peasants along the ravine hitherto strange to say i had thought only of myself but with the ideas of succour came the recollection of my companion and the tale of the previous night i glanced eagerly to where he lay his posture disclosed his state he was still and stiff and dead yet his countenance was calm and beautiful he had died in the dear hope of meeting his sister and her image had shed peace over the last moment of life i am ashamed to revert to myself the death of constantine is the true end of my tale my wound was a severe one i was forced to leave greece and for some months remained between life and death in cefalonia till a good constitution saved me when at once i returned to england xvi the elder son my father was the second son of a wealthy baronet as he and his elder brother formed all the family of my grandfather he inherited the whole of his mothers fortune which was considerable and settled on the younger children he married a lady whom he tenderly loved and having taken orders and procured preferment retired to his deanery in the north of ireland and there took up his abode when i was about ten years old he lost my mother i was their only child my father was something of an ascetic if such name can be given to a rigid adherence to the precepts of morality which arose from the excess and not the absence of feeling he adored my mother he mourned for her to the verge of insanity but his grief was silent devouring and gloomy he never formed another matrimonial engagement secluding himself entirely from society and given up to the duties of his sacred calling he passed his days in solitude or in works of charity among the poor even now i cannot remember him without awe he was a tall and i thought a venerable looking man for he was thin and pale and he was partly bald his manners were cold and reserved he seldom spoke and when he did it was in such measured phrase in so calm and solemn a voice and on such serious topics as resembled rather oracular enunciation than familiar conversation he never caressed me if ever he stroked my head or drew me on his knee i felt a mingled alarm and delight difficult to describe yet strange to say my father loved me almost to idolatry and i knew this and repaid his affection with enthusiastic fondness notwithstanding his reserve and my awe he was something greater and wiser and better in my eyes than any other human being i was the sole creature he loved the object of all his thoughts by day and his dreams by night abstracted and even severe as he seemed he has visited my bedside at night subdued by womanly fears and hung over me for hours to assure himself of my life and well being he has watched by me in sickness night after night with unwearied assiduity he never spoke harshly to me and treated me at once with a distance and gentleness hard to be understood when i was eighteen he died during his last illness the seal was taken from his lips and his heart threw off that husk within which he had hitherto concealed its true nature he died of a rapid consumption which terminated his existence within six months of his being first taken ill his body wasted under the effects of mortal disease but his soul assumed new life and energy and his temper became as soft and demonstrative as it had hitherto been repulsive and concentrated he became my father friend and brother all in one a thousand dear relationships combined in one stronger than any this sudden melting this divine sensibility which expanded at once having been so long shut up and hid was like a miracle it fascinated and entranced me i could not believe that i was about to lose him at the moment when we discovered each others worth i mean by that expression as regards myself all the happiness that he derived from the truth and vivacity of my filial affection it were vain to attempt to refer even to our conversations the sublime morality he inculcated the tenderness and charity of his expressions the overflowing and melting eloquence with which he talked of the affections of this world and his aspirations after a better he died suddenly at last as i was playing to him a simple air my mother loved it was a moment of horror yet of solemn and pious resignation his soul had sought its native heaven and congenial companionmight it be blest yet i had lost him and grief immeasurable was the result the impression of the misery i suffered can never be entirely worn from my mind i often wonder my heart did not break with the violence of my sorrow i had been brought up at the deanery apart from all acquaintances i had had a governess a most worthy woman who married just before my father was taken ill and who kindly came to me when all was over to endeavour to console the inconsolable one of my fathers objects in life had been to accumulate a fortune for me not for the sake of placing me in the dangerous situation of an heiress but to render me independent it thus happened that by his ever lamented death i inherited considerable wealth his own fortune my mothers and his savings formed the sum of fifty thousand pounds he left me under the guardianship of his elder brother sir richard gray with only one restriction that i was not to marry even with my uncles consent till i was twenty one he wished thus to secure me freedom of choice and time for deliberation to this sagacious clause i owe the happiness of my life as soon as my health and the first agony of my grief would permit i left the deanery my kind governess accompanied me to dublin and sir richard gray came hither himself to fetch me and to carry me to his seat in england i was beyond measure surprised when i saw my uncle he was a year older than my fathermy venerable fatherand he looked in comparison a boy he was indeed under fifty and had at first sight a juvenility of aspect quite astonishing on examination the traces of years and care became perceptible and there was a haggardness in his face which contrasted strangely with its expression of thoughtlessness no one could be kinder than he was to me and yet his very kindness was revolting from the contrast he formed with my lost parent the world society and pleasure occupied his time and thoughts solitude and misery were synonymous terms with him and he called everything solitude that did not include the idea of a crowd he rattled away during our journey thinking his anecdotes and good stories would enliven me he was so sorry that it was not the season that i could go to londonhe would have invited his daughter lady hythe to his seat that he might arrange a party to enliven it for me but she was on the continent and his other married daughter was resident in scotland what was to be done he had engagements himself during the shooting season at various gentlemens houses and i should be moped to death at beech grove this account of the seclusion of my retreat was all my comfort i declared that nothing should induce me to go into society for several years he stared and then smiled and in his usual caressing gallant manner said i should do as i liked he would never contradict me in anything he only hoped that he should be always able to please and gratify me my uncles story is soon told he married very early in life a girl of inferior rank his relations were exceedingly enraged and discarded him his father died and his grandfather fearing that he would sell his expectations and squander the whole property offered him a large immediate income upon condition that he would entail the estate upon his eldest son he consented a few years after his grandfather died and he came into the titles and estate the new lady gray made herself many friends from the extreme propriety of her conduct they had a large family but lost many children and she died in childbed of her youngest five only survived the eldest son was abroad two daughters were well married and the youngest a girl of only twelve years of age lived with her governess at the family seat at hampshire sir richard talked kindly of his children but chiefly of his eldest son against whom therefore i conceived a prejudice because from his fathers description i considered him dissipated and worthless such indeed was my uncle but i did not dislike him for by the charm of manner he vanquished aversion and i transferred to his favourite son the disapprobation he had at first excited i was glad to hear that my cousin was at vienna and that i was not likely to see him we arrived at beech grove on the th august it was a fine summer day and the country in all its glory the house was spacious and elegant and situated in an extensive park laid out with infinite taste and kept up with extreme care all looked so gay and smiling so unlike the sombre scenes i had left on the shores of the dark northern ocean that i contemplated my new abode with distaste such is the force of habit my uncle had expected that i should be enchanted with the novel beauty of an english park and mansion and was disappointed at my languid praise there were no rocks no sea no extensive moors groves of beech a river threading verdant wooded banks a variety of upland and valley glade and copse did not command my admiration so true it is that we seldom admire that which is absolutely new a few months totally altered this first impression the cheerfulness of the scene imperceptibly acted on my spirits i became reconciled to its to a certain degree tameness and learnt at last to love its refined and elegant beauty sir richard talked of visiting and company he would have called his neighbours round us and forced me to accept invitations at the various houses where in the shooting season were assembled large parties of the rich and gay i earnestly assured him that my depressed spirits and deep rooted sorrow needed tranquillitythat the seclusion which his house promised was its principal attractionthat i was most happy to be alone he could not believe my assertions it hurt his feelings to leave me in this desert he actually delayed his departure for two days not liking to quit me at last he went and speedily in the pursuit of pleasure forgot my existence i was not absolutely alone in his house my cousin marianne inhabited it with me she was a pretty agreeable girl of twelve years of age and we got on very well together i had recourse to her society when over weary of thought and she was so young that i could leave her and betake myself to my mournful lonely reveries whenever i liked without ceremony i had not been at beech grove more than a week when late one afternoon on returning from a drive we distinguished lights in the dining room can it be my brother cried marianne can clinton have arrived i hope not i said oh do not say so replied the little girl you would love clinton he is so lively and deareverybody loves him she scarce waited for the steps to be let down but jumped from the carriage she returned to me in a minute with an air of disappointment it is only my brother vernon she said and you do not care about him oh yes she replied vernon is very good and all that but he is quite different from clinton he may stay a month in the house and i not see him twice the habit of solitude had rendered me a little bashful i had dined early with my cousin and the new comer was at dinner i went into the drawing room therefore and made her stay with me and awaited his entrance with some alarm he soon joined us as he entered i was struck with his being the handsomest man i had ever seen his complexion was a clear olive his eyes a dark blue his head small and well shaped his figure scarcely above the middle size but slender and elegant i expected the courteous manners of my uncle to correspond with the grace of his appearance but vernon had no vivacity no softness his words were pregnant with meaning and his eyes flashed fire as he spoke but his address was abrupt his conversation pointed and sarcastic and a disagreeable ironical smile in which he indulged deteriorated greatly from his good looks still he was very handsome very clever and very entertaining one part of mariannes description at least was erroneous he spent every day and all day with us he rode or walked with us in the morning read to us in the evening conversed as we worked or painted and did all that a person most sedulous to please could do except turning over the leaves of our music books he did not like musicof which my father was so passionately fond in all else his tastes seemed mine he gave me italian lessons and except when i drove him away was never absent from our side marianne declared that her brother vernon was an altered man i thought that i knew whence the alteration sprung what girl of eighteen just emerged from solitude could perceive the birth of love in the heart of a young accomplished and handsome man and not feel her vanity gratified my peculiar education had prevented my having any of the coquettishness of beauty or the insolence of wealth i own i felt elated i became of consequence in my own eyes and my silly heart swelled with conscious triumph vernon grew each day more openly devoted to me more solicitous to please more flattering and attentive he advanced with imperceptible steps to the desired bourne and no impatience of temper disturbed for a moment his progress stealthy as a serpent and as wily he became necessary to my comfort and i had compromised myself by displaying my vain triumph in my conquest before he betrayed himself by a word when i found that he sought a return for his love i was frightened i discovered that with all his talents and agreeable qualities i scarcely liked him and certainly could never feel a sentiment more tender than friendship i reproached myself for my ingratitudei felt ashamed of my vacillation he saw my struggleshe was all humilityhe did not deserve betterhe was satisfied if i would only be a sister to himpity himendure his presence i agreed and reassumed my familiarity and good humour it is impossible to describe his refined artifice or the wonderful assiduity with which he watched by his concealed net till i was completely immeshed he contrived first that i should consent to listen to him talking of his passion then he excited my pity for his sufferingshe was eloquent in describing them and in exalting my merits he asked for so little he seemed so humble but he was importunate and never gave up the smallest advantage he had once gained forgotten by my uncle unknown and unregarded by the rest of the world i was delivered over to his machinations day after day he renewed them he discerned and worked upon every weakness of my character my fear to do wrong my alarm at the idea of being the occasion of pain my desire to preserve my integrity without a flawthese might be termed virtues but distorted and exaggerated by natural conceit and youthful inexperience they rendered me a too easy prey at last he extracted from me a promise to marry him when i should be of age this pledge seemed the only method left me to prove my delicacy and truth i gave it the more readily because i admired his talents and believed that he deserved a better wife than i and that my want of love was a fault in me for which i ought to compensate to him with all the rashness and inexperience of my age i confess that i even tried to conceal my latent aversion so that when after having obtained my promise he went away for a week i willingly assented to his request that i should correspond with him and my letters were full of affection i found it easier to write than speak what i did not really feel and was glad to show my gratitude and my sense of his attachment at an easy rate at the same time i consented to keep our engagement secret that thus i might have an excuse for preserving the reserve of my conduct i took advantage of this wish on his part to insist on his leaving me for a time i was glad when he went yet mortified at the readiness of his obedience i must not be unjust vernon had many faults but coldness of feeling was not among them vehemence and passion were his characteristics though he could unite them to a deliberation in design and a wiliness in execution without example he had determined before he saw me to win me and my fortune but such was the violence of his disposition that he was unavoidably caught in his own toils and the project that was founded on self interest ended in making him the slave of loveof a girl whom he despised he went when i bade him eagerly but he fulfilled his aim better by so doing my letters were to be confirmations strong against mein case that hereafter as he too justly feared i should wish to retract my vows i heedlessly accomplished his ends beyond his most sanguine expectations my letters were those of a betrothed bride and what they might want in tenderness was made up by their uncompromising acknowledgment of our relative position having obtained these testimonies he returned i was not sorry i was too little pleased with myself to be in love with solitude his presence kept alive the feeling of irresistible fate to which i had yielded and his society enlivened the monotonous quiet of beech grove at length christmas came and my uncle returned and filled his house with visitors then the darker shades of vernons character became apparent he was as jealous as an italian his disposition was sombre and averse to sociable pleasures god knows grief sat too heavy at my heart to allow me to be very vivacious still i wished to please my uncle and thought that i had no right to cloud the good humour of the company and added to this was the elastic spirit of youth which sprung eagerly and spontaneously from the gloom and mystery of vernons artifices into the more congenial atmosphere of friendly intercourse he saw me unlike anything he had ever seen in me beforesprightly and ready to share the amusement of the hour he groaned in bitterness of spirit he reproachedreprehendedand became a very taskmaster i was naturally timid and docilein vain did my spirit revolt from his injustice he gained and kept complete ascendency over me yet my soul was in arms against him even while i submitted to his control and dislike began to develop itself in my bosom i tasked myself severely for my ingratitude i became in appearance kinder than ever but every internal struggle and every outward demonstration had unfortunately one resultto alienate my affections more and more from my lover cousin our guests left us my uncle went up to town he told me he hoped i would accompany him there as soon as lady hythe returned to chaperon me but i was more averse than ever to visiting london bound to vernon by my promises and wishing to keep my faith with him i did not like to expose myself to the temptation of seeing others i should like better besides the memory of my father was still unfaded and i resolved not to appear in public till the year of mourning was expired vernon accompanied his father to town but returned again to us almost immediately we appeared to revert to our former mode of life but the essence of it was changed he was moodyi anxious i almost ventured to accuse him of ill temper and tyranny till reading in my own heart its indifference i was inclined to consider myself the cause of his discontent i tried to restore his complacency by kindness and in some degree succeeded one day sir richard suddenly appeared at beech grove he seemed surprised to find vernon and care and even anxiety clouded his usual hilarity he told us that he expected clinton daily and should immediately on his arrival bring him down to hampshire to celebrate my birthday asked vernon with a sardonic smile i am of age on friday no said his father he will not be here so soon nor i so honoured said vernon clintons coming of age was celebrated by tumultuous rejoicings but he is the elder son sir richard gave vernon who spoke sneeringly a quick glancean indescribable expression of pain crossed his countenance have you been staying here since christmas he asked at last vernon would have replied evasively but marianne said oh yes he is always here now you appear to have become very fond of beech grove of a sudden continued his father i felt that sir richards eye was fixed on me as he spoke and i was conscious that not only my cheeks but my temples and neck were crimsoned with blushes some time after i saw my uncle in the shrubbery he was alone and the want of society was always so painful to him that i thought it but a mark of duteous kindness to join him i wondered as i approached to see every token of haggard care on a face usually so smiling he saw me and smoothed his brow he began talking of london of my elder cousin of his desire that i should conquer my timidity and consent to be presented this spring at length he suddenly stopped short and scrutinizing me as he spoke said pardon me dear ellen if i annoy you but i am your guardian your second fatheram i not do not be angry therefore if i ask you are you attached to my son vernon my natural frankness prompted one reply but a thousand feelings inexplicable but powerful hung on my tongue i answered stammering noi believe soi like him but you do not love him what a question dear uncle i replied covered with confusion is it even so cried sir richard and is he to succeed in all you mistake i said for i had a horror of confessing an attachment which after all i did not feel and so of making our engagement more binding but i blushed deeply as i spoke and my uncle looked incredulous and said yet it would make you very unhappy if he married another oh no i cried he has my free leave i should wish him joy with all my heart the ideathe hope that he was playing me false and might release me from my trammels darted through my mind with a quick thrill of delight sir richard saw that i was in earnest and his countenance cleared what a strange thing is maiden coyness he observed you blushed so prettily ellen that i could have sworn you had given your heart to vernon but i see i was mistaken i am glad of it for he would not suit you no more was said but i felt conscience stricken and miserable i had deceived my uncle and yet i had not i had declared that i did not love him to whom i had pledged my hand and the whole was a mystery and an entanglement that degraded me in my own eyes i longed to make a full confession yet then all would be overwe should both be inextricably bound as it was some caprice might cause vernon to transfer his affection to another and i could give him entire freedom without any human being knowing how foolishly i had acted we had no guests at dinner sir richard was to leave us early the next morning after dinner i speedily retired to the drawing room leaving father and son together they remained two hours i was on the point of withdrawing to my own room to avoid a meeting which alarmed me i knew not why when they entered it seemed as if in the interval of my absence they had received sudden intelligence of a dear friends death and yet not quite so for though vernon looked absorbed in thought his gloom was strangely interspersed with glances of swelling triumph his smiles were no longer sneersyet they did not betray a sunshine of the heart but rather joy on a bad victory he looked on me askance with a kind of greedy satisfaction and at his father with scorn i trembled and turned to my uncle but sadness and confusion marked his featureshe was stamped as with disgrace and quailed beneath my eye though presently he rallied drew a chair near and was kinder than ever he told me that he was going up to town on the morrow and that vernon was to accompany him he asked me if there was anything he could do for me and testified his affection by a thousand little attentions vernon said nothing and took leave of me so coldly that i thought his manner implied that he expected to see me in the morning thinking it right to indulge him i rose early but he did not come down till long after sir richard who thanked me for my kindness in disturbing myself on his account they went away immediately after breakfast and vernons formal adieu again struck me with wonder was it possible that he was indeed going to marry another this doubt was all my comfort for i was painfully agitated by the false position in which i had entangled myself by the mystery that enveloped my actions and the falsehood which my lips perpetually implied if they did not utter i was habitually an early riser on the third morning after the departure of my relations before i rose and while i was dressing i thought that pebbles were thrown at my window but my mind was too engrossed to pay attention till at last after my toilette had been leisurely completed i looked from my window and saw vernon below in the secluded part of the park which it overlooked i hurried down my heart palpitating with anxiety i have been waiting for you these two hours he said angrily did you not hear my signal i know of no signal i replied i am not accustomed to clandestine appointments and yet you can carry on a clandestine engagement excellently well you told sir richard that you did not love methat you should be glad if i married another an indignant reply was bursting from my lips but he saw the rising storm and hastened to allay it he changed his tone at once from reproach to tender protestations it broke my heart to leave you as i did he said but i could do no less sir richard insisted on my accompanying himi was obliged to comply even now he believes me to be in town i have travelled all night he half suspected me because i refused to dine with him to day and i was forced to promise to join him at a ball to night i need not be there till twelve or one and so can stay two hours with you but why this hurried journey i asked why do you come he answered by pleading the vehemence of his affection and spoke of the risk he ran of losing me for ever do you not know he said that my father has set his heart upon your marrying my brother he is very good i replied disdainfully but i am not a slave to be bought and sold my cousin clinton is the last person in the world whom you need fear oh ellen how much do you comforttransport me by this generous contempt for wealth and rank you ask why i am hereit were worth the fatigue twice ten thousand times told to have these assurances i have trembledi have fearedbut you will not love this favoured of fortunethis elder son i cannot describe vernons look as he said this methought envy malice and demoniac exultation were all mingled he laughed aloudi shrunk from him dismayed he became calmer a moment after my life is in your hands ellen he saidbut why repeat his glossing speeches in which deceit and truth were so kneaded into one mass that the poison took the guise of the wholesome substance while the whole was impregnated with destruction i felt that i liked him less than ever yet i yielded to his violence i believed myself the victim of a venial but irreparable mistake of my own i confirmed my promises and pledged my faith most solemnly it is true that i undeceived him as much as i could with regard to the extent of my attachment at first he was furious at my coldness then overwhelmed me with entreaties for forgivenesstears even streamed from his eyesand then again he haughtily reminded me that i forfeited every virtue of my sex and became a monument of falsehood if i failed him we separated at lasti promised to write every day and saw him ride away with a sensation as if relieved from the infliction of the torture a week after this scenemy spirits still depressed and often weeping my dear fathers death which i considered the root of every evili was reading or rather trying to read in my dressing room but in reality brooding over my sorrows when i heard mariannes cheerful laugh in the shrubbery and her voice calling me to join her i roused myself from my sad reverie and resolved to cast aside care and misery while vernons absence afforded me a shadow of freedom and in fulfilment of this determination went down to join my young light hearted cousin she was not alone clinton was with her there was no resemblance between him and vernon his countenance was all sunshine his light blue eyes laughed in their own gladness and purity his beaming smile his silver toned voice his tall manly figure and above all his open hearted engaging manners were all the reverse of his dark mysterious brother i saw him and felt that my prejudices had been ridiculous we became intimate in a moment i know not how it was but we seemed like brother and sistereach feeling each thought being laid bare to the other i was naturally frank but rendered timid by education so that it charmed me doubly when the unreserve of another invited me to indulge in the unguarded confidence of my disposition how speedily the days now flew they contained but one drawback my correspondence with my cousinnot that i felt myself unfaithful towards him my affection for my new found relation did not disturb my consciencethat was pure undisguised sisterly we had met from across the ocean of lifetwo beings who formed a harmonized whole but the sympathy was too perfect too untinged by earthly dross to be compared with the selfish love given and exacted by vernon yet i feared that his jealousy might be awakened while i felt less inclined than ever to belie my own heart and with aversion and hesitation penned letters containing the formula of affection and engaged vows sir richard came down to beech grove he was highly pleased to see the cordial friendship that subsisted between his son and me did i not tell you that you would like him he said every one must i replied he is formed to win all hearts and suits you much better than vernon i did not know what to answer it was a tender string that he touched but i resolved not to feel or think sir richards were all flying visits he was to leave us in the evening he had during the morning a long conversation with clinton and immediately after he sought for an opportunity to talk to me ellen he said i have not been a wise but i am a fond father i have done clinton many injuries of which he poor fellow is wholly unconscious and i have wished to compensate for all in giving him a wife worthy of him his temper is generous his spirit clear and noble by my soul i think he has every virtue under heaven and you alone deserve him do not interrupt me i beseech you hear me this once i confess that ever since you became my ward this has been my favourite project there have been several obstacles but the most serious ones seem to vanish you have seen each other and i flatter myself have each discovered and appreciated the good qualities of the other is it so ellen i know not whence my fears arise and yet they intrude themselves i fear while i have been endeavouring to secure my boys happiness i may have been adding to the ruin already heaped on his head by my means i have talked with him to day he has no disguise in his nature and he avows that he loves you i know that this confession would come better from himself but your fortune your beauty make him fear to be misinterpreted do not mistakehe is wholly unaware of my intention of speaking to you i see your distress dear ellen have patience but for one word moredo not trifle with clintons feelings as sometimesforgive meit has appeared to me that you have trifled with vernonsdo not foster hopes not to be fulfilled be frank be honest despite the bashfulness and coquetry of your sex after these words fearful of having offendedovercome by more agitation than i could have imagined him capable of feelingmy uncle drew me towards him pressed me convulsively to his bosom and then rushed from the room i cannot describe the state in which he left mea spasm of pain passed through my frame i became sick and faint till a flood of tears relieved my bursting heart i wept longi sobbed in agonyi felt the veriest wretch that ever trod the earth my uncle had rent the veil that concealed me from myself i loved clintonhe was the whole world to meall the world of light and joy and i had shut myself out from him for ever and he also was my victim i beheld his dear face beaming with hope i heard his thrilling voice harmonized by love and saw the fearless cordiality of his manners which bespoke his confidence in my sympathy while i knew that i held a poisoned dagger which i was about to plunge into his heart sometimes i thought to treat him coldly sometimesoh i cannot tell the various imaginations that haunted mesome self sacrificing others wicked and falseall ended in one way my uncle departed we were left together our full hearts beating to respond to each other without any division or reserve i felt that every moment might cause clinton to open his soul to me and to seek in mine for a feeling too truly and too fondly alive there but which was sinful and fatal to both to prevent his confession my own preceded it i revealed to him my engagement to vernon and declared my resolve not to swerve from my faith he commended me i saw despair at losing me painted in his countenance mingled with horror at supplanting his brother and alarm that he the elder born gifted by fortune with every blessing should be suspected of the intention of stealing the sole remaining good which vernon had won by his diligence perhaps by his deserts forbid it heaven i saw in the clear mirror of his expressive countenance the struggle of passion and principle and the triumph of honour and virtue exalted over the truest love that ever warmed mans breast our gaiety was flown our laughter stilled we talked sadly and seriously together neither lamenting our fate nor acknowledging our sufferings tamed to endurance and consoling each other by such demonstrations of affection as were permitted to our near relationship we read clearly each others hearts and supported each other in the joint sacrifice and this without any direct acknowledgment clinton talked of returning to the continent i of my seclusion and tranquillity at beech grove the time was distanttwo years was an eternity at our agebefore vernon could claim my hand and we did not advert to that fatal consummation we gave up each other and that single misery sufficed without a more cruel addition i was calm pale and tearless i had brought it all on myself and must submit i could not cast aside the younger son to select the elder and if in my secret thoughts i cherished a hope to induce vernon to forego his claims that very circumstance would the more entirely divide me from clinton as my brother in law i might see himin some sort our fortunes were shared but as a rival to vernon a stream of blood separated us for ever the hours of sad sympathy which we passed were very dear to us we knew that they were brief clinton had fixed the day and hour of his departureeach moment it drew nearer we should never meet again till after my marriage but till the hour of separation for two short days we were all in all to each other despite the wall of adamant which was raised between us we tried each to pretend to think and talk of indifferent subjects and we never spoke of that nearest our heartsbut how superfluous are words as interpreters between lovers as we walked or rode and spent hours in each others society we exchanged thoughts more intimately during long periods of absolute silence than vernon with his vehemence and eloquence could have conceived had we spoken folio volumes we could have said no more our looksthe very casting down of our eyes and mutual tacit avoidance told our resolve to fulfil our duties and to conquer our love and yet how by a glance or a faltering word when the future was alluded to did we promise never to forget but to cherish mutual esteem and tenderness as all that was left of the paradise from which we were so ruthlessly driven now and then a playful expression on his part or a blush on mine betrayed more feeling than we considered right the one was checked by a sigh the other by an assumption of indifference i had been spending many hours in tears and anguish when resolved to overcome my weakness and to recover an appearance of serenity before my cousin returned from his ride i went into mariannes schoolroom and took up a book the exhaustion of weeping had calmed me and i thought of my kinsmanhis endearing qualities and of the tie between us with softened feelings as i indulged in reverie my head resting on my hand my book falling from my fingers my eyes closed i passed from the agitated sense of life and sorrow into the balmy forgetfulness of sleep clinton had wished to make a portrait of me yet had not ventured to ask me to sithe came in at this moment marianne whispering told him not to disturb me he took her drawing materials and made a hasty sketch which genius and love united to render a perfect likeness i awoke and saw his work it was beyond our contract i asked him for it he felt that i was right and gave it this sacrifice on his part proved that he did not palter with his sense of right on the morrow we were to part and he would preserve no memorial beyond a remembrance which he could not destroy that morrow came clinton asked me and his sister to walk through the park with him to join his chariot at the farther lodge we consented but at the moment of going marianne who knew nothing certainly but who darkly guessed that all was not right excused herself i joined him alone there was something in his person and manner that so promised protection and tenderness that i felt it doubly hard to be torn from him a dignified reserve foreign to his usual nature founded on a resolve to play only the brothers part checked me somewhat yet i loved him the more for it while i would have laid down my existence so that it had only been permitted us to throw aside the mask but for one short hour and to use the language of nature and troth it could not be and our conversation was upon indifferent subjects when we approached the lodge we found that the chariot had not come and we retreated a little and sat down on a turfy bank then clinton said a few words the only ones that at all revealed the agitation he was enduring i have a little more experience than you ellen he said and besides i am haunted by strange presentiments we seem to know what we ought to do and what we are to do and act accordinglyyet life is a strange wild thing i wish to ensure for you a friend more willing and active than sir richard i have a sister to whom i am fondly attached she is now on the continent but i shall hasten to her and entreat her to afford you a friendship you so richly deserve you will love lady hythe for her own sake as well as for mine i was desirous of thanking him for this mark of kindness but my voice failed me and i burst into tears overcome by the excess of anguish that deluged my heart i tried to conceal my tearsi could not do not ellen dear ellen i beseech youcommand yourself clinton spoke in a voice so broken so full of misery that he inspired me at once with fear and courage the tread of a horse roused usa horse at swift gallop i raised my eyes and uttered a shriek for reining in the animal with a sudden strong pull vernon halted close to us the most violent passions convulsed his countenance he threw himself from the horse and casting the bridle from him came up what he meant to say or do i cannot tell perhaps to conceal the workings of his heartand the quick departure of clinton would have smoothed all but i saw the barrel of a pistol peep from the pocket of his coat i was seized with terrori shrieked aloud clinton terrified at my alarm would have supported me but vernon pushed him rudely away dare not to approach or touch her as you value your life he cried my life you talk idly vernon i value her securityone moment of peace to herfar more you confess it exclaimed vernon and you too false and treacherous girl ha did you think to betray me and be unpunished do you think if i so chose it that i would not force you to look on till the blood of one of the brothers flowed at your feet but there are other punishments in store for you the expressions of menace used towards myself restored my courage and i exclaimed beware that you do not break the tie that binds usat least that bound us a moment agoperhaps it is already broken doubtless he cried grinding his teeth with rage it is broken and a new one created to bind you to the elder son oh yes you would fain cast aside the poor miserable beggar who has vainly fawned on you and madly lovedyou would take the rich the honourable and honoured sir clinton base hollow hearted fool vernon said clinton whatever your claims are on our cousin i cannot stand by and see her insulted you forget yourself the forgetfulness sir is on your part proud in your seniority to rival your brother to drive him from his all has been a may game for you but know proud fool or villaintake which name you willyour hour is passed byyour reign at an end your station is a fiction your very existence a disgrace clinton and i both began to think that vernon was really mada suspicion confirmed by his violent gestures we looked at each other in alarm stay exclaimed the infuriated man seizing my arm with a fierce grasp while fearful to induce clintons interference i yielded stay and listen to what your lover isor shall i wound your delicate ears there are soft phrases and silken words to adorn that refuse of the worlda bastard vernon dare notbeware sir and begone clintons face crimsoned his voice his majestic indignation almost forced the ruffian to quail he threw my arm from him take him fair ellen it is true you take what i saya natural son do you think that my information is not correct ask our father for he is yours clinton and our mother is the same you are the first born of richard gray and matilda towers but i am the eldest son of mr and mrs gray it could not have been that vernon would have acted this cowardly and foolish part had he not been driven by a kind of madness in truth sir richard had to quench his hopes for ever with that carelessness of truthhis fatal propensityaffirmed that clinton and i were acknowledged lovers and he came goaded by worse than jealousyby a spirit of hatred and revenge seeing us together obviously engaged by the most engrossing feelings his temper which had been worked into fury during his journey burst forth beyond the bounds he had prescribed for himself i have called him a serpent and such he was in every respect he could crawl and coil and hide his wily advance but he could erect his crest dart out his forked tongue and infix the deadly venom when roused as he now was clinton turned alternately pale and red be it as you will he said my fortunes and yours are of slight moment in comparison to ellens safety if there is any truth in this tale of yours there will be time enough to discover it and to act upon it meanwhile dear cousin i see they have brought my chariot to the lodge you cannot walk homeget into it it will drive you to the house and come back for me i looked at him inquiringly do not fear to be deserted by me he said or that i shall do anything rashly vernon must accompany me to townto our fathers presence there to expiate this foul calumny or to prove it be assured he shall not approach you without your leave i will watch over him and guard you clinton spoke aloud and vernon became aware that he must yield to this arrangement and satisfied that he had divided us clinton led me to his carriage you will hear soon from some one of us ellen he said and let me implore you to be patientto take care of yourselfto fear nothing i can make no remarkaffirm deny nothing now but you shall not be kept in suspense promise me to be patient and calm and do you i said at last commanding my trembling voice promise not to be rash and promise not to leave england without seeing me again i promise not to leave england for any time without your leave oh trust me my dear cousin it is not in such storms as these that you shall be ashamed of me one sentiment may subdue me but poverty disgrace and every angry passion i can master vernon did not dare interrupt us he felt that he had destroyed his carefully woven web through his own rashness and gnawed his lips in silent rage i looked at him once and turned away my eyes in contempt i got into the chariot it drove me to the house and went back to take clinton up to town thus we were separated as we intended and yet how differently hope was reborn in my heart out of the very ashes of its despair two mortal days passed and i was still in my solitude receiving no intelligence except indeed such as was contained in a letter from vernon in this he demanded me as a right and fiercely insisted that i should keep my faith with him but he did not allude to the scene in the park nor to his strange assertions there i threw the letter from me as unworthy of notice or thought the third morning brought me one from my uncle i tore it open with uncontrollable impatience these were the contents clinton my dear ellen insists that i should join you at beech grove but i cannot persuade myself to do so till i have your leavetill i have confessed my villainy and besought your forgiveness in addition to that of my noble hearted boy whom i devoted to ruin before his birth and who has pardoned me it is a hateful subjectunfit for your ears my gentle virtuous girl and i must hurry it over when i first knew miss towers i had no idea of marrying her for she was poor and of humble birth we loved each other and she was willing to become mine on my own terms our intercourse was betrayed to her parents and to appease them and please matilda i declared that we were married my assertion was credited matilda assumed my name and all the world all her little world was deceived while at the same time i declared to my father that she was merely my mistress he did not believe me thus i became entangled a little before the birth of our second boy my father died and my grandfather offered me two thousand a year on condition that i would secure the whole estate to my eldest son i loved matilda my fears were dissipated by my fathers death and by this acknowledgment of my union by my grandfather i married her and three days after vernons birth signed the settlement of entail such is my story lady grays character necessitated the concealment from every human being of the period when the marriage was celebrated my noble beloved clinton assumed the elder sons place i dared not reveal the truth nay i fancied that i benefited him by allowing him to fill this false position till my death he has undeceived me but he has not cursed me from the moment i saw you i designed that you should repair my faults towards him as you alone could i believed that you were formed for each other i was not mistaken there i meant to acknowledge all before your marriage but i believed that if once your affections were engaged you would not reject my son from base and worldly minded considerations am i not right also in this meanwhile clinton was abroad and i became uneasy at observing the pains which vernon took to ingratiate himself with you and the intimacy which you encouraged i forbade him to remain with you at beech grovehe defied me then i tried to entice him away from you and as a last bribe disclosed the secret of his birth he in return promised to leave the field open to clinton you know the rest he never meant to give you up he was my heir and he grasped at your fortune besidesshall he succeed clinton is all kindness and soothing angelic goodnessbut he insists on no longer filling a situation to which he has no claim andis gone abroad he fears to leave you exposed to vernons violence and has made me promise to go down to beech grove and to prevent his brother from seeing you without your free and entire consent as i have said i cannot prevail on myself to visit you till you are in full possession of all the facts now they are in your hands you may expect me to morrow do not fear vernon i will take care that he shall not commit further outrage on you nor injure the interest which i fondly trust that you preserve for my godlike my beloved clinton i read and reread this letter a thousand times my soul was in tumults at first i could only think of the facts that it contained and proudly and joyfully determined to compensate to clinton as i believed i could for every evil and then again i read the letter and many parts of it filled me with wonder and dismay clinton was gone abroadagainst his promisewithout a word and there was something so indelicate in the way in which my uncle espoused his cause it was strangeunlike any conduct i had expected on my dear cousins part of course he would writeand yet he was gone and no letter came and then i dreaded to see sir richard the wrongful penitent father the total indifference which he displayed to moral principlenot founded like vernons on selfishness but on weakness of character and natural callousness to truthrevolted me where was my own dear father he had thrown me from the sacred shelter of his virtue into a system of dissimulation and guilt which even clinton i thought deserting me as he did did not redeem i struggled with these feelings but their justice confounded and overcame me yet even in the midst of these disquieting reflections a deep sense of happiness pervaded my soul the mystery the tyranny which had enveloped me was brushed away like a spiders web i was freei might follow the dictates of my feelings and it was no longer sin to love him to whom my heart was irrevocably given the hours of the day flew on while i lived as in a dream absorbed by wonder hope doubt and joy at length at six in the evening a carriage drove up the avenue a kind of terror at the expectation of seeing my uncle seized me and i retreated hastily to my own room gasping for breath in a few minutes my servant tapped at my door she told me that it was lady hythe who had arrived and delivered me a letter the letter was from clinton it was dated the same day in london i pressed it passionately to my lips and heart and devoured its contents with eagerness at length dear ellen he wrote i am satisfied i was long uneasy on your account i besought my father to go down to you yet even that did not content mefor you did not so much need protection as sympathy and true disinterested friendship my thoughts turned towards my earliest and dearest friend my sister caroline she was on the continenti set out immediately to meet her to tell everything and to ask her advice and assistance fortune befriended mei found her at calaisshe is now with you she is my better self her delicacy of character her accurate judgment and warm heart joined to her position as a woman married to the best and most generous fellow breathing render her the very person to whom i can intrust your happiness i do not speak of myselffortune cannot overcome my spirits and my way is clear before me i pity my father and family but caroline will explain to you better than i can my views and hopes adieu dear cousin heaven bless you as you deserve your fortitude i am sure has not deserted you yet i am very anxious to hear that your health has not suffered by my brothers violence caroline will write to me and rejoice me by telling me of your well being i hurried down immediately to welcome clintons sister and from that moment my perplexities and sorrows vanished lady hythe was a feminine likeness of clinton the same active kindness of heart gentleness of temper and adorable frankness we were friends and sisters on the instant and her true affection repaid me for every suffering none of which i should have experienced had she been in england on my arrival clinton had told her of his love but left me to reveal my own sentiments detailing only the artifices and jealousy of vernon i was without disguise for we were all one family with the same objects hopes and pleasures we went up to town immediately and there i saw clinton and we exchanged our reserved sad intercourse for a full acknowledgment of every thought and feeling the only piece of prudence that sir richard had practised was placing clinton in the army and purchasing promotion for him he was so beloved by his fellow officers that on the discovery of his unfortunate birth they all united in giving him the support of their friendship and good opinion clinton resolved therefore to enter at once on active service and to follow up his profession with energy two years were to elapse before i could marry and he expressed a wish that we should neither of us consider ourselves under any engagement how vain are such words heaven designed us for each other and the mere phrase of engagement or freedom could not affect a tie founded on affection esteem or beyond this the passion that caused us to find happiness in each other only he went with his regiment to ireland and we were a good deal divided during the two years that elapsed before i was twenty one i continued to reside with lady hythe and enjoyed with her that peace of mind which true friendship affords at length the day came when i completed my twenty first year sir richard had wished to be present at our nuptials but was unable from ill health i went to him and saw him for the first time since the fatal discovery for on finding that i was happily placed with his daughter he had carefully avoided seeing me his character indeed was wholly changed while carrying on a system of dissimulation he had appeared gay he was extravagant given up to pleasure and spending even beyond his large income despite the ruin in which he knew that his son would be involved on his death he made him indeed a princely allowance as if that was to compensate to him while in fact clinton was only thus habituated to expense as soon as the discovery was made sir richard by one of those inconceivable changes which sometimes occur in the history of human nature set his heart on saving a fortune for his beloved boy he thought that i might be fickle he feared his own death and the loss of power to benefit him he gave up his establishment in townhe let beech grovehe saved every farthing that he could and was enabled to settle twenty thousand pounds on clinton on the day of our marriage i went to see him in a little lodging at camberwell whither he had retreated he was emaciated and ill his eyes brightened a little on seeing clinton and me together i would fain live a little longer he said to increase my sons fortune but gods will be doneyou will make him happy ellen we were inexpressibly shocked he had concealed his penurious style of life and declining health all this time and nothing but his illness and our insisting upon seeing him caused him to betray it now our first care after our marriage was to oblige him to take up his abode with us and we devoted ourselves to calming his remorse and smoothing his path to the grave he survived only four months but he had the comfort of knowing that clinton was satisfied and happy and that we both from our hearts forgave the errors which he at last expiated so dearly we never saw vernon again nor can i tell what has happened to him except that he lives the life of the rich in england apparently attended by prosperity lady hythe stood between me and him and screened me from his violence and reproaches he has never married i have never seen him since the day when in the park at beech grove he unawares conferred on me every blessing of life by releasing me from the ties that bound me to him the happiness of clinton and myself has been unclouded i at last persuaded him to give up his profession and we live principally abroad lord and lady hythe frequently visit us and every event of our livesthe unimportant events of domestic lifetends to increase our prosperity and the entire affection we cherish for each other xvii the pilgrims the twilight of one of those burning days of summer whose unclouded sky seems to speak to man of happier realms had already flung broad shadows over the valley of unspunnen whilst the departing rays of a gorgeous sunset continued to glitter on the summits of the surrounding hills gradually however the glowing tints deepened then grew darker and darker until they finally yielded to the still more sober hues of night beneath an avenue of lime trees which from their size and luxuriance appeared almost coeval with the soil in which they grew burkhardt of unspunnen wandered to and fro with uneasy step as if some recent sorrow occupied his troubled mind at times he stood with his eyes stedfastly fixed on the earth as if he expected to see the object of his contemplation start forth from its bosom at other times he would raise his eyes to the summits of the trees whose branches now gently agitated by the night breeze seemed to breathe sighs of compassion in remembrance of those happy hours which had once been passed beneath their welcome shade when however advancing from beneath them he beheld the deep blue heavens with the bright host of stars hope sprang up within him at the thoughts of that glory to which those heavens and those stars all lovely and beauteous as they seem are but the faint heralds and for a time dissipated the grief which had so long weighed heavily upon his heart from these reflections he was suddenly aroused by the tones of a manly voice addressing him burkhardt advancing beheld standing in the light of the moon two pilgrims clothed in the usual coarse and sombre garb with their broad hats drawn over their brows praise be to god said the pilgrim who had just before awakened burkhardts attention and who from his height and manner appeared to be the elder of the two his words were echoed by a voice whose gentle and faultering accents showed the speaker to be still but of tender years whither are you going friends what seek you here at this late hour said burkhardt if you wish to rest you after your journey enter and with gods blessing and my hearty welcome recruit yourselves noble sir you have more than anticipated our petition replied the elder pilgrim our duty has led us far from our native land being bound on a pilgrimage to fulfil the vow of a beloved parent we have been forced during the heat of the day to climb the steep mountain paths and the strength of my brother whose youth but ill befits him for such fatigues began to fail when the sight of your castles towers which the moons clear beams discovered to us revived our hopes we resolved to beg a nights lodging under your hospitable roof that we might be enabled on to morrows dawn to pursue our weary way follow me my friends said burkhardt as he with quickened step preceded them that he might give some orders for their entertainment the pilgrims rejoicing in so kind a reception followed the knight in silence into a high vaulted saloon over which the tapers that were placed in branches against the walls cast a solemn but pleasing light well in accordance with the present feelings of the parties the knight then discerned two countenances the pleasing impression of which was considerably heightened by the modest yet easy manner with which the youthful pair received their hosts kind attentions much struck with their appearance and demeanour burkhardt was involuntarily led back into the train of thoughts from which their approach had aroused him and the scenes of former days flitted before him as he recollected that in this hall his beloved child was ever wont to greet him with her welcome smile on his return from the battle or the chase brief scenes of happiness which had been followed by events that had cankered his heart and rendered memory but an instrument of bitterness and chastisement supper was soon after served and the pilgrims were supplied with the greatest attention yet conversation wholly languished for his melancholy reflections occupied burkhardt and respect or perhaps a more kindly feeling towards their host and benefactor seemed to have sealed the lips of his youthful guests after supper however a flask of the barons old wine cheered his flagging spirits and emboldened the elder pilgrim to break through the spell which had chained them pardon me noble sir said he for i feel it must seem intrusive in me to seek the cause of that sorrow which renders you so sad a spectator of the bounty and happiness which you liberally bestow upon others believe me it is not the impulse of a mere idle curiosity that makes me express my wonder that you can thus dwell alone in this spacious and noble mansion the prey to a deeply rooted sorrow would that it were in our power to alleviate the cares of one who with such bounteous hand relieves the wants of his poorer brethren i thank you for your sympathy good pilgrim said the old noble but what can it avail you to know the story of those griefs which have made this earth a desert and which are with rapid pace conducting me where alone i can expect to find rest spare me then the pain of recalling scenes which i would fain bury in oblivion as yet you are in the spring of life when no sad remembrance gives a discordant echo of past follies or of joys irrecoverably lost seek not to darken the sunshine of your youth with a knowledge of those fierce guilty beings who in listening to the fiend like suggestions of their passions are led astray from the paths of rectitude and tear asunder the ties of nature burkhardt thus sought to avoid the entreaty of the pilgrim but the request was still urged with such earnest though delicate persuasion and the rich tones of the strangers voice awoke within him so many thoughts of days long long past that the knight felt himself almost irresistibly impelled to unburden his long closed heart to one who seemed to enter into its feelings with a sincere cordiality your artless sympathy has won my confidence my young friends said he and you shall learn the cause of my sorrow you see me here lonely and forsaken but fortune once looked upon me with her blandest smiles and i felt myself rich in the consciousness of my prosperity and the gifts which bounteous heaven had bestowed my powerful vassals made me a terror to those enemies which the protection that i was ever ready to afford to the oppressed and helpless brought against me my broad and fertile possessions enabled me with liberal hand to relieve the wants of the poor and to exercise the rights of hospitality in a manner becoming my state and my name but of all the gifts which heaven had showered upon me that which i most prized was a wife whose virtues had made her the idol of both the rich and the poor but she who was already an angel and unfitted for this grosser world was too soon alas claimed by her kindred spirits one brief year alone had beheld our happiness my grief and anguish were most bitter and would soon have laid me in the same grave with her but that she had left me a daughter for whose dear sake i struggled earnestly against my affliction in her were now centred all my cares all my hopes all my happiness as she grew in years so did her likeness to her sainted mother increase and every look and gesture reminded me of my agnes with her mothers beauty i had with fond presumption dared to cherish the hope that ida would inherit her mothers virtues greatly did i feel the void that my irreparable loss had made but the very thought of marrying again seemed to me a profanation if however even for a single instant i had entertained this disposition one look at our child would have crushed it and made me cling with still fonder hope to her in the fond confidence that she would reward me for every sacrifice that i could make alas my friends this hope was built on an unsure foundation and my heart is even now tortured when i think on those delusive dreams ida with the fondest caresses would dispel each care from my brow in sickness and in health she watched me with the tenderest solicitude her whole endeavour seemed to be to anticipate my wishes but alas like the serpent which only fascinates to destroy she lavished these caresses and attentions to blind me and wrap me in fatal security many and deep were the affronts revenged indeed but not forgotten which had long since caused with shame i avow it a deadly hatred between myself and rupert lord of wdischwyl which the slightest occasion seemed to increase to a degree of madness as he dared no longer throw down the gauntlet he found means much harder than steel or iron to glut his revenge upon me duke berchtold of zhringen one of those wealthy and powerful tyrants who are the very pests of that society of whose rights they ought to be the ready guardians had made a sudden irruption on the peaceful inhabitants of the mountains seizing their herds and flocks and insulting their wives and daughters though possessed of great courage yet being not much used to warfare these unhappy men found it impossible to resist the tyrant and hastened to entreat my instant succour without a moments delay i assembled my brave vassals and marched against the spoiler after a long and severe struggle god blessed our cause and our victory was complete on the morning that i was to depart on my return to my castle one of my followers announced to me that the duke had arrived in my camp and wished an immediate interview with me i instantly went forth to meet him and berchtold hastening towards me with a smile offered me his hand in token of reconciliation i frankly accepted it not suspecting that falsehood could lurk beneath so open and friendly an aspect my friend said he for such i must call you your valour in this contest has won my esteem although i could at once convince you that i have just cause of quarrel with the insolent mountaineers but in spite of your victory in this unjust strife into which doubtless you were induced to enter by the misrepresentations of those villains yet as my nature abhors to prolong dissensions i would willingly cease to think that we are enemies and commence a friendship which on my part at least shall not be broken in token therefore that you do not mistrust a fellow soldier return with me to my castle that we may there drown all remembrance of our past dissensions during a long time i resisted his importunity for i had now been more than a year absent from my home and was doubly impatient to return as i fondly imagined that my delay would occasion much anxiety to my daughter but the duke with such apparent kindness and in such a courteous manner renewed and urged his solicitations that i could resist no longer his highness entertained me with the greatest hospitality and unremitted attention but i soon perceived that an honest man is more in his element amidst the toils of the battle than amongst the blandishments of a court where the lip and the gesture carry welcome but where the heart to which the tongue is never the herald is corroded by the unceasing strifes of jealousy and envy i soon too saw that my rough and undisguised manners were an occasion of much mirth to the perfumed and essenced nothings who crowded the halls of the duke i however stifled my resentment when i considered that these creatures lived but in his favour like those swarms of insects which are warmed into existence from the dunghill by the suns rays i had remained the unwilling guest of the duke during some days when the arrival of a stranger of distinction was announced with much ceremony this stranger i found to be my bitterest foe rupert of wdischwyl the duke received him with the most marked politeness and attention and more than once i fancied that i perceived the precedence of me was studiously given to my enemy my frank yet haughty nature could ill brook this disparagement and besides it seemed to me that i should but play the hypocrite if i partook of the same cup with the man for whom i entertained a deadly hatred i resolved therefore to depart and sought his highness to bid him farewell he appeared much distressed at my resolution and earnestly pressed me to avow the cause of my abrupt departure i candidly confessed that the undue favour which i thought he showed to my rival was the cause i am hurt deeply hurt said the duke affecting an air of great sorrow that my friend and that friend the valiant unspunnen should think thus unjustly dare i add thus meanly of me no i have not even in thought wronged you and to prove my sincerity and my regard for your welfare know that it was not chance which conducted your adversary to my court he comes in consequence of my eager wish to reconcile two men whom i so much esteem and whose worth and excellence place them amongst the brightest ornaments of our favoured land let me therefore said he taking my hand and the hand of rupert who had entered during our discourse let me have the satisfaction of reconciling two such men and of terminating your ancient discord you cannot refuse a request so congenial to that holy faith which we all profess suffer me therefore to be the minister of peace and to suggest that in token and in confirmation of an act which will draw down heavens blessing on us all you will permit our holy church to unite in one your far famed lovely daughter with lord ruperts only son whose virtues if reports speak truly render him no undeserving object of her love a rage which seemed in an instant to turn my blood into fire and which almost choked my utterance took possession of me what exclaimed i what think you that i would thus sacrifice thus cast away my precious jewel thus debase my beloved ida no by her sainted mother i swear that rather than see her married to his son i would devote her to the cloister nay i would rather see her dead at my feet than suffer her purity to be sullied by such contamination but for the presence of his highness cried rupert wrathfully your life should instantly answer for this insult nathless i will well mark you and watch you too my lord and if you escape my revenge you are more than man indeed indeed my lord of unspunnen said the duke you are much too rash your passion has clouded your reason and believe me you will live to repent having so scornfully refused my friendly proposal you may judge me rash my lord duke and perhaps think me somewhat too bold because i dare assert the truth in the courts of princes but since my tongue cannot frame itself to speak that which my heart does not dictate and my plain but honest manner seems to displease you i will with your highnesss permission withdraw to my own domain whence i have been but too long absent undoubtedly my lord you have my permission said the duke haughtily and at the same time turning coldly from me my horse was brought i mounted him with as much composure as i could command and i breathed more freely as i left the castle far behind during the second days journey i arrived within a near view of my own native mountains and i felt doubly invigorated as their pure breezes were wafted towards me still the fond anxiety of a father for his beloved child and that child his only treasure made the way seem doubly long but as i approached the turn of the road which is immediately in front of my castle i almost then wished the way lengthened for my joy my hopes and my apprehensions crowded upon me almost to suffocation a few short minutes however i thought and then the truth ill or good will be known to me when i came in full sight of my dwelling all seemed in peace nought exhibited any change since i had left it i spurred my horse on to the gate but as i advanced the utter stillness and desertion of all around surprised me not a domestic not a peasant was to be seen in the courts it appeared as if the inhabitants of the castle were still asleep merciful heaven i thought what can this stillness forebode is she is my beloved child dead i could not summon courage to pull the bell thrice i attempted yet thrice the dread of learning the awful truth prevented me one moment one word even one sign and i might be a forlorn childless wretched man for ever none but a father can feel or fully sympathize in the agony of those moments none but a father can ever fitly describe them i was aroused from this inactive state by my faithful dog springing towards me to welcome my return with his boisterous caresses and deep and loud toned expressions of his joy then the old porter attracted by the noise came to the gate which he instantly opened but as he was hurrying forward to meet me i readily perceived that some sudden and painful recollection checked his eagerness i leaped from my horse quickly and entered the hall all the other domestics now came forward except my faithful steward wilfred he who had been always the foremost to greet his master where is my daughter where is your mistress i eagerly exclaimed let me but know that she lives the faithful wilfred who had now entered the hall threw himself at my feet and with the tears rolling down his furrowed cheeks earnestly pressed my hand and hesitatingly informed me that my daughter lived was well he believed buthad quitted the castle now speak more quickly old man said i hastily and passionately interrupting him what is it you can mean my daughter lives my ida is well but she is not here now have you and my vassals proved recreants and suffered my castle in my absence to be robbed of its greatest treasure speak speak plainly i command ye it is with anguish as great almost as your own can be my beloved master that i make known to you the sad truth that your daughter has quitted her fathers roof to become the wife of conrad the son of the lord of wdischwyl the wife of lord ruperts son my ida the wife of the son of him whose very name my soul loathes my wrath now knew no bounds the torments of hell seemed to have changed the current of my blood in the madness of my passion i even cursed my own dear daughter yes pilgrim i even cursed her on whom i so fondly doted for whose sake alone life for me had any charms oh how often since have i attempted to recall that curse and these bitter tears which even now i cannot control witness how severe has been my repentance of that awful and unnatural act dreadful were the imprecations which i heaped upon my enemy and deep was the revenge i swore i know not to what fearful length my unbridled passion would have hurried me had i not from its very excess sunk senseless into the arms of my domestics when i recovered i found myself in my own chamber and wilfred seated near me some time however elapsed before i came to a clear recollection of the past events and when i did it seemed as if an age of crime and misery had weighed me down and chained my tongue my eye involuntarily wandered to that part of the chamber where hung my daughters portrait but this the faithful old manwho had not removed it no doubt thinking that to do so would have offended mehad contrived to hide by placing before it a piece of armour which seemed as though it had accidentally fallen into that position many more days elapsed ere i was enabled to listen to the particulars of my daughters flight which i will not to detain you longer with my griefs now briefly relateit appeared that urged by the fame of her beauty and by a curiosity most natural i confess to youth conrad of wdischwyl had for a long time sought but sought in vain to see my ida chance at length however favoured him on her way to hear mass at our neighbouring monastery he beheld her and beheld her but to love her holy errand did not prevent him from addressing her and well he knew how to gain the ear of one so innocent so unsuspicious as my ida too soon alas did his flatteries win their way to her guiltless heart my childs affection for her father was unbounded and readily would she have sacrificed her life for mine but when love has once taken possession of the female heart too quickly drives he thence those sterner guests reason and duty suffice it therefore to say she was won and induced to unite herself to wdischwyl before my return by his crafty and insidious argument that i should be more easily persuaded to give them my pardon and my blessing when i found that the step that she had taken was irrevocable with almost equal art he pleaded too that their union would doubtless heal the breach between the families of wdischwyl and unspunnen and thus terminate that deadly hatred which my gentle ida ever the intercessor for peace had always condemned by this specious of sophistry my poor child was prevailed upon to tear herself from the heart of a fond parent to unite herself with the son of that parents most bitter enemy the pain of these recollections so overcame burkhardt that some time elapsed ere he could master his feelings at length he proceeded my soul seemed now to have but one feeling revenge all other passions were annihilated by this master one and i instantly prepared myself and my vassals to chastise this worse than robber but such satisfaction was i now thank god denied me for the duke of zhringen soon gave me memorable cause to recollect his parting words having attached himself with his numerous followers to my rivals party these powerful chiefs suddenly invaded my domain a severe struggle against most unequal numbers ensued but at length though my brave retainers would fain have prolonged the hopeless strife resolved to stop a needless waste of blood i left the field to my foes and with the remnant of my faithful soldiers hastened in deep mortification to bury myself within these walls this galling repulse prevented all possibility of reconciliation with my daughter whom i now regarded as the cause of my disgrace and consequently i forbade her name even to be mentioned in my presence years rolled on and i had no intelligence of her until i learned by a mere chance that she had with her husband quitted her native land altogether more than twenty to me long long years have now passed since her flight and though when time brought repentance and my anger and revenge yielded to better feelings i made every effort to gain tidings of my poor child i have not yet been able to discover any further traces of her here therefore have i lived a widowed childless heart broken old man but i have at least learned to bow to the dispensations of an all wise providence which has in its justice stricken me for thus remorselessly cherishing that baneful passion which holy law so expressly forbids oh how i have yearned to see my beloved child how i have longed to clasp her to this withered blighted heart with scalding tears of the bitterest repentance have i revoked those deadly curses which in the plenitude of my unnatural wrath i dared to utter daily ceaselessly do i now weary heaven with my prayers to obliterate all memory of those fatal imprecations or to let them fall on my own head and shower down only its choicest blessings on that of my beloved child but a fear which freezes my veins with horror constantly haunts me lest the maledictions which i dared to utter in my moments of demoniac vindictiveness should in punishment for my impiety have been fulfilled often in my dreams do i behold my beloved child but her looks are always in sadness and she ever seems mildly but most sorrowfully to upbraid me for having so inhumanly cast her from me yet she must i fear have died long ere now for were she living she would not i think have ceased to endeavour to regain the affections of a father who once loved her so tenderly it is true that at first she made many efforts to obtain my forgiveness nay i have subsequently learned that she even knelt at the threshold of my door and piteously supplicated to be allowed to see me but my commands had been so peremptory and the steward who had replaced wilfred after his death was of so stern and unbending a disposition that just and righteous as was this her last request it was unfeelingly denied to her eternal heaven she whom i had loved as perhaps never father loved beforeshe whom i had fondly watched almost hourly lest the rude breeze of winter should chill her or the summers heat should scorch hershe whom i had cherished in sickness through many a livelong night with a mothers devotion and more than a mothers solicitude even she the only child of my beloved agnes and the anxious object of the last moments of her life was spurned from my door from this door whence no want goes unrelieved and where the very beggar finds rest and now when i would bless the lips that even could say to me she lives i can nowhere gather the slightest tidings of my child ah had i listened to the voice of reason had i not suffered my better feelings to be mastered by the wildest and fellest passions i might have seen herself and perhaps her children happy around me cheering the evening of my life and when my last hour shall come they would have closed my eyes in peace and in unfeigned sorrow have daily addressed to heaven their innocent prayers for my souls eternal rest you now know pilgrims the cause of my grief and i see by the tears which you have so abundantly shed that you truly pity the forlorn being before you remember him and his sorrows therefore ever in your prayers and when you kneel at the shrine to which you are bound let not those sorrows be forgotten the elder pilgrim in vain attempted to answer the excess of his feelings overpowered his utterance at length throwing himself at the feet of burkhardt and casting off his pilgrims habits he with difficulty exclaimed see here thine idas son and behold in my youthful companion thine idas daughter yes before you kneel the children of her whom you so much lament we came to sue for that pardon for that love which we had feared would have been denied us but thanks be to god who has mollified your heart we have only to implore that you will suffer us to use our poor efforts to alleviate your sorrows and render more bright and cheerful your declining years in wild and agitated surprise burkhardt gazed intently upon them it seemed to him as if a beautiful vision were before him which he feared even a breath might dispel when however he became assured that he was under the influence of no delusion the tumult of his feelings overpowered him and he sank senselessly on the neck of the elder pilgrim who with his sisters assistance quickly raised the old man and by their united efforts restored him ere long to his senses but when burkhardt beheld the younger pilgrim the very image of his lost ida bending over him with the most anxious and tender solicitude he thought that death had ended all his worldly sufferings and that heaven had already opened to his view great god at length he exclaimed i am unworthy of these thy mercies grant me to receive them as i ought i need not ask added he after a pause and pressing the pilgrims to his bosom for a confirmation of your statement or of my own sensations of joy all all tells me that you are the children of my beloved ida say therefore is your mother dead or dare i hope once more to clasp her to my heart the elder pilgrim whose name was hermann then stated to him that two years had passed since his parent had breathed her last in his arms her latest prayer was that heaven would forgive her the sorrow she had caused her father and forbear to visit her own error on her childrens heads he then added that his father had been dead many years my mother continued hermann drawing from his bosom a small sealed packet commanded me on her deathbed to deliver this into your own hands my son she said when i am dead if my father still lives cast yourself at his feet and desist not your supplications until you have obtained from him a promise that he will read this prayer it will acquaint him with a repentance that may incite him to recall his curse and thus cause the earth to lie lightly on all that will shortly remain of his once loved ida paint to him the hours of anguish which even your tender years have witnessed weary him my son with your entreaties cease them not until you have wrung from him his forgiveness as you may suppose i solemnly engaged to perform my mothers request and as soon as our grief for the loss of so dear so fond a parent would permit us my sister and myself resolved in these pilgrims habits to visit your castle and by gradual means attempt to win your affections if we found you still relentless and unwilling to listen to our mothers prayer praise be to god my son said burkhardt at whose command the waters spring from the barren rock that he has bidden the streams of love and repentance to flow once more from my once barren and flinty heart but let me not delay to open this sad memorial of your mothers griefs i wish you my children to listen to it that you may hear both her exculpation and her wrongs burkhardt hid his face in his hands and remained for some moments earnestly struggling with his feelings at length he broke the seal and with a voice which at times was almost overpowered read aloud the contents my beloved fatherif by that fond title your daughter may still address youfeeling that my sad days are now numbered i make this last effort ere my strength shall fail me to obtain at least your pity for her you once so much loved and to beseech you to recall that curse which has weighed too heavily upon her heart indeed my father i am not quite that guilty wretch you think me do not imagine that neglecting every tie of duty and gratitude i could have left the tenderest of parents to his widowed lonely home and have united myself with the son of his sworn foe had i not fondly most ardently hoped nay had cherished the idea almost to certainty that you would when you found that i was a wife have quickly pardoned a fault which the fears of your refusal to our union had alone tempted me to commit i firmly believed that my husband would then have shared with me my fathers love and have with his child the pleasing task of watching over his happiness and comfort but never did i for an instant imagine that i was permanently wounding the heart of that father my youth and the ardour of my husbands persuasions must plead some extenuation of my fault the day that i learnt the news of your having pronounced against me that fatal curse and your fixed determination never more to admit me to your presence has been marked in characters indelible on my memory at that moment it appeared as if heaven had abandoned me had marked me for its reprobation as a parricide my brain and my heart seemed on fire whilst my blood froze in my veins the chillness of death crept over every limb and my tongue refused all utterance i would have wept but the source of my tears was dried within me how long i remained in this state i know not as i became insensible and remained so for some days on returning to a full consciousness of my wretchedness i would instantly have rushed to you and cast myself at your feet to wring from you if possible your forgiveness but my limbs were incapable of all motion soon too i learned that the letters which i dictated were returned unopened and my husband at last informed me that all his efforts to see you had been utterly fruitless yet the moment i had gained sufficient strength i went to the castle but unfortunately for me even as i entered i encountered a stern wretch to whom my person was not unknown and he instantly told me that my efforts to see his master would be useless i used prayers and entreaties i even knelt upon the bare ground to him but so far from listening to me he led me to the gate and in my presence dismissed the old porter who had admitted me and who afterwards followed my fortunes until the hour of his death finding that all my attempts were fruitless and that several of the old servants had been discarded on my account with a heart completely broken i succumbed to my fate and abandoned all further attempt after the birth of my son to whose fidelity and love i trust this sad memorial my husband with the tenderest solicitude employed every means in his power to divert my melancholy and having had a valuable property in italy bequeathed to him prevailed upon me to repair to that favoured and beauteous country but neither the fond attentions of my beloved conrad nor the bright sunshine and luxurious breezes could overcome a grief so deeply rooted as mine and i soon found that italy had less charms for me than my own dear native land with its dark pine clad mountains shortly after we had arrived at rome i gave birth to a daughteran event which was only too soon followed by the death of my affectionate husband the necessity of ceaseless attention to my infant in some measure alleviated the intense anguish which i suffered from that most severe loss nevertheless in the very depth of this sorrow which almost overcharged my heart heaven only knows how often and how remorsefully while bending over my own dear children in sickness have i called to mind the anxious fondness with which the tenderest and best of fathers used to watch over me i struggled long and painfully with my feelings and often did i beseech god to spare my life that i might be enabled to instruct my children in his holy love and fear and teach them to atone for the error of their parent my prayer has in mercy been heard the boon i supplicated has been granted and i trust my beloved father that if these children should be admitted to your affections you will find that i have trained up two blessed intercessors for your forgiveness when it shall have pleased heaven to have called your daughter to her account before that dread tribunal where a sires curse will plead so awfully against her recall then oh father recall your dreadful malediction from your poor repentant ida and send your blessing as an angel of mercy to plead for her eternal rest farewell my father for ever for ever farewell by the cross whose emblem her fevered lips now press by him who in his boundless mercy hung upon that cross your daughter your once much loved ida implores you supplicates you not to let her plead in vain my child my child sobbed burkhardt as the letter dropped from his hand may the father of all forgive me as freely as i from the depths of my wrung heart forgive you would that your remorseful father could have pressed you to his heart with his own lips have assured you of his affection and wiped away the tears of sorrow from your eyes but he will cherish these beloved remembrances of you and will more jealously guard them than his own life burkhardt passed the whole of the following day in his chamber to which the good father jerome alone was admitted as the events of the preceding day rendered a long repose absolutely necessary the following morning however he entered the hall where hermann and ida were impatiently waiting for him his pale countenance still exhibited deep traces of the agitation he had experienced but having kissed his children most affectionately he smilingly flung round idas neck a massive gold chain richly wrought with a bunch of keys appended to it we must duly install our lady of the castle said he and invest her with her appropriate authoritiesbut hark from the sound of the porters horn it seems as if our hostess would have early calls upon her hospitality whom have we here continued he looking out up the avenue by st hubert a gay and gallant knight is approaching who shall be right welcomethat is if my lady approve well willibald what bring youa letter from our good friend the abbot of st anselm what says he i am sure that you will not refuse your welcome to a young knight who is returning by your castle to his home from the emperors wars he is well known to me and i can vouch for his being a guest worthy of your hospitality which will not be the less freely granted to him because he does not bask in the golden smiles of fortune no no that it shall not my good friend and if fortune frown upon him he shall be doubly welcome conduct him hither instantly good willibald the steward hastened to usher in the stranger who advanced into the hall with a modest but manly air he was apparently about twenty five years of age his person was such as might well in the dreams of a young maiden occupy no unconspicuous place sir knight said burkhardt taking him cordially by the hand you are right welcome to my castle and such poor entertainment as it can afford we must make you forget your wounds and the rough usage of a soldiers life but soft i already neglect my duty in not first introducing our hostess added the aged knight presenting ida by my faith he continued judging from my ladys blushing smile you seem not to have met for the first time am i right in my conjecture we have met sir replied ida with such confusion as pleasantly implied that the meeting was not indifferently recollected in the parlour of the abbess of the ursulines at munich where i have sometimes been to visit a much valued friend the abbess said the young knight was my cousin and my good fortune more than once gave me the happiness of seeing in her convent this lady but little did i expect that amongst these mountains the fickle goddess would again have so favoured a homeless wanderer well sir knight replied burkhardt we trust that fortune has been equally favourable to us and now we will make bold to ask your name and then without useless and tedious ceremony on the part of ourselves and our hostess bid you again a hearty welcome my name said the stranger is walter de blumfeldt though humble it has never been disgraced and with the blessing of heaven i hope to hand it down as honoured as i have received it weeks months rolled on and walter de blumfeldt was still the guest of the lord of unspunnen till by his virtues and the many excellent qualities which daily more and more developed themselves he wound himself around burkhardts heart which the chastened life of the old knight had rendered particularly susceptible of the kindlier feelings frequently would he now with tears in his eyes declare that he wished he could convince each and all with whom his former habits had caused any difference how truly he forgave them and desired their forgiveness would said he one day in allusion to this subject that i could have met my old enemy the duke of zhringen and with a truly heartfelt pleasure and joy have embraced him and numbered him amongst my friends but he is gathered to his fathers and i know not whether he has left any one to bear his honours each time that walter had offered to depart burkhardt had found some excuse to detain him for it seemed to him that in separating from his young guest he should lose a link of that chain which good fortune had so lately woven for him hermann too loved walter as a brother and ida fain would have imagined that she loved him as a sister but her heart more plainly told her what her colder reasoning sought to hide unspunnen who had for some time perceived the growing attachment between walter and ida was not displeased at the discovery as he had long ceased to covet riches and had learnt to prize the sterling worth of the young knight who fully answered the high terms in which the prior of st anselm always spoke of him walking one evening under the shade of that very avenue where he had first encountered hermann and ida he perceived the latter at some little distance in conversation with walter it was evident to burkhardt that the young knight was not addressing himself to a very unwilling ear as ida was totally regardless of the loud cough with which burkhardt chose to be seized at that moment nor did she perceive him until he exclaimed or rather vociferated do you know walter that under this very avenue two pilgrims bound to some holy shrine once accosted me but that in pity to my sins and forlorn condition they exchanged their penitential journey for an act of greater charity and have ever since remained to extend their kind cares to an aged and helpless relative one however of these affectionate beings is now about to quit my abode and to pass through the rest of this lifes pilgrimage with a helpmate in the person of the fair daughter of the baron de leichtfeldt and thus leave his poor companion with only the tedious society of an old man say sir knight will thy valour suffer that such wrong be done or wilt thou undertake to conduct this forsaken pilgrim on her way and guide her through the chequered paths of this variable life i see by the lowliness with which you bend and the colour which mantles in your cheek that i speak not to one insensible to an old mans appeal but soft soft sir knight my ida is not yet canonized and therefore cannot afford to lose a hand which inevitably must occur if you continue to press it with such very ardent devotion but what says our pilgrim does she accept of thy conduct and service sir knight ida scarcely able to support herself threw herself on burkhardts neck we will not raise the veil which covers the awful moment that renders a man as he supposes happy or miserable for ever suffice it to say that the day which made hermann the husband of the daughter of the baron de leichtfeldt saw ida the wife of walter de blumfeldt six months had passed rapidly away to the happy inhabitants of unspunnen and burkhardt seemed almost to have grown young again he was one of the most active in the preparations which were necessary in consequence of walter suggesting that they should spend idas birthday in a favourite retreat of his and hers this chosen spot was a beautiful meadow in front of which meandered a small limpid stream at the back was a gorgeous amphitheatre of trees the wide spreading branches of which cast a refreshing shade over the richly enamelled grass in this beauteous retreat were burkhardt walter and his ida passing the sultry hours of noon when walter who had been relating some of his adventures at the court of the emperor and recounting the magnificence of the tournaments turning to his bride said but what avails all that pomp my ida how happy are we in this peaceful vale we envy neither princes nor dukes their palaces or their states what say you my ida could you brook the ceremony of a court and the pride of royalty methinks even the coronet of a duchess would but ill replace the wreath of blushing roses on your head gently my good husband replied ida laughing they say you know that a woman loves these vanities too dearly in her heart ever to despise them then how can you expect so frail a mortal as your poor wife to hold them in contempt indeed i think added she assuming an air of burlesque dignity that i should make a lofty duchess and wear my coronet with most becoming grace and now by my faith walter i recollect that you have this day like a true and gallant knight promised to grant whatever boon i shall ask on my bended knee therefore i humbly sue that if you know any spell or magic wile to make a princess or a duchess for only a single day that you will forthwith exercise your art upon me just in order to enable me to ascertain with how much or how little dignity i could sustain such honours it is no very difficult matter sir knight you have only to call in the aid of number nip or some such handy workman of the woods answer most chivalrous husband for thy disconsolate wife rises not until her prayer is granted why ida you have indeed craved a rare boon replied walter and how to grant it may well puzzle my brain till it becomes crazed with the effort but let me see let me see continued he musingly i have itcome hither love here is your throne said he placing her on a gentle eminence richly covered with the fragrant wild thyme and the delicate harebell kings might now envy you the incense which is offered to you and you noble sir added he addressing burkhardt must stand beside her highness in quality of chief counsellor there are your attendants around you behold that tall oak he must be your highnesss pursuivant and yonder slender mountain ashes your trusty pages this is but a poor fulfilment of the task you have undertaken sir mummer said ida with a playful and arch affectation of disappointment have patience for a brief while fair dame replied walter laughing for now i must awaken your highnesss men at arms then taking from his side a silver horn he loudly sounded the melodious reveille as he withdrew the instrument from his lips a trumpet thrillingly answered to the call and scarcely had its last notes died away when from the midst of the woods as if the very trees were gifted with life came forth a troop of horsemen followed by a body of archers on foot they had but just entirely emerged when numerous peasants both male and female appeared in their gayest attire and together with the horsemen and the archers rapidly and picturesquely ranged themselves in front of the astonished ida who had already abdicated her throne and clung to the arm of walter they then suddenly divided and twelve pages in richly emblazoned dresses advanced after them followed six young girls whose forms and features the graces might have envied bearing two coronets placed on embroidered cushions in the rear of these supporting his steps with his abbatial staff walked the venerable abbot of st anselm who with his white beard flowing almost to his girdle and his benign looks that showed the pure commerce of the soul which gave life to an eye the brightness of which seventy years had scarcely diminished seemed to ida a being of another world the young girls then advancing and kneeling before walter and his wife presented the coronets ida who had remained almost breathless with wonder could now scarcely articulate dear dear walter what is all this pompwhat doeswhat can it mean mean my beloved replied her husband did you not bid me make you a duchess i have but obeyed your high commands and i now salute you duchess of zhringen the whole multitude then made the woods resound with the acclamation long live the duke and duchess of zhringen walter having for some moments enjoyed the unutterable amazement of the now breathless ida and the less evident but perhaps equally intense surprise of burkhardt turning to the latter said my more than father you see in me the son of your once implacable enemy the duke of zhringen he has been many years gathered to his fathers and i as his only son have succeeded to his title and his possessions my heart my liberty were entirely lost in the parlour of the abbess of the ursulines but when i learnt whose child my ida was and your sad story i resolved ere i would make her mine to win not only her love but also your favour and esteem how well i have succeeded this little magic circle on my idas finger is my witness it will add no small measure to your happiness to know that my father had for many years repented of the wrongs which he had done you and as much as possible to atone for them entrusted the education of his son to the care of this my best of friends the abbot of st anselm that he might learn to shun the errors into which his sire had unhappily fallen and now continued he advancing and leading ida towards the abbot i have only to beg your blessing and that this lady whom through heavens goodness i glory to call my wife be invested with those insignia of the rank which she is so fit to adorn walter or as we must now call him the duke of zhringen with ida then lowly knelt before the venerable abbot whilst the holy man with tears in his eyes invoked upon them the blessings of heaven his highness then rising took one of the coronets and placing it on idas head said mayst thou be as happy under this glittering coronet as thou wert under the russet hood in which i first beheld thee god and our lady aid me replied the agitated ida and may he grant that i may wear it with as much humility yet thorns they say spring up beneath a crown true my beloved said the duke and they also grow beneath the peasants homely cap but the rich alchemy of my idas virtues will ever convert all thorns into the
