the adventures of a threeguinea watch by talbot baines reed this is really a most unusual book told we must imagine by the watch we are led through the owners days at a boys boarding school to being stolen pawned auctioned taken to quite another small town given to a brilliant local boy when he left for cambridge lost in a field found and through further adventures being taken to india to fight in a battle near lucknow finally making its way into the pocket of its original owner whose life was saved by the watch having deflected a bullet its welltold too and not too long at under ten hours the copy we worked from was very browned and it was not too easy to do the transcription but we have done our best if you find anything obviously wrong dont hesitate to tell us about it nh the adventures of a threeguinea watch by talbot baines reed chapter one my infancy and educationhow i was sold and who bought me then you can guarantee it to be a good one to go you couldnt have a better sir and it will stand a little roughish wear you think im sure of it sir its an uncommon strong watch then ill take it these few sentences determined my destiny and from that moment my career may be said to have begun i am old and run down and good for nothing now but many a time do i find my thoughts wandering back to this faroff day and remembering all that has befallen me since that eventful moment i humbly hope my life has not been one to disgrace the good character with which i went out into the world i was young at the time very youngscarcely a month old watches however as every one knows are a good deal more precocious in their infancy than human beings they generally settle down to business as soon as they are born without having to spend much of their time either in the nursery or the schoolroom indeed after my face and hands had once been well cleaned and a brand new shiny coat had been put on my back it was years before i found myself again called upon to submit to that operation which is such a terror to all mortal children as to my education it lasted just a week and although i am bound to say while it lasted it was both carefully and skilfully managed i did not at all fancy the discipline i was subjected to in the process i used to be handed over to a creature who took me up and examined me as if he were a policeman and a magistrate combined and according as i answered his questions he exclaimed youre going too fast or youre going too slow and with that he set himself to regulate me as he called it i was ordered to turn round take off my coat and submit my poor shoulders to his instrument of correction but why need i describe this experience to boys they know what regulating means as well as i do well in due time i profited by the instructions received and one day my tutor after the usual examination grumpily told me youre right at last you can go and i did go and ive been going ever since the troubles of my infancy however were not all over i discovered at a very early age that the one thing a watch is never allowed to do is to go to sleep theyd as soon think of leaving an infant to starve as of letting a watch go to sleep but to my story ever since i had left schoolor in other words gone through my due course of regulationi had remained shut up under a glasscase lying comfortably upon a bed of purple velvet and decorated with a little white label bearing the mysterious inscription only three guineas from this stately repose i was only once a day disturbed in order to be kept from sleeping and had all the rest of my time to look about me and observe what went on in the world in which i found myself it was not a big world indeed but i could see i was not the only inhabitant all around me were watches like myself some of a golden complexion and someof which i was oneof a silvery some were big and made an awful noise and some were tiny and just whispered what they had to say some were very proud and showed off their jewels and chains in a way which made me blush for the vanity of my fellow creaturesdear watches the ladies called these and others were as plain as plain could be every now and then our case would be opened and one of my neighbours taken out and never put back then we knew he had been sold and we who were left spent our time in gossiping about what had become of him and speculating whose turn would come next a gold repeater near me was very confident the turn would be his and so impressed us with the sense of his striking importance and claims that when the next time our glass house was entered and a hand came groping in our direction i at once concluded it was his summons into publicity and honour imagine my astonishment then when the hand instead of reaching my gold neighbour took hold of me and cautiously drew me out of the case my heart leaped to my mouthor whatever part of a watchs anatomy corresponds with that organand i was ready to faint with excitement i had always imagined i was to lie in that case for years but now when i was barely a month old here was i going out into the world it made me quite bashful to listen to all the flattering things my master said of me i was worth twice the price he was selling me at he said in fact if trade had been good he would not have parted with me under three times that price it was a relief to think the repeater could not overhear this or he would have sneered in a way to extinguish me altogether as it was no other watch was by so that i was not very much embarrassed after turning me over and feeling my pulse and listening to the beating of my heart and taking off my coat and waistcoat to inspect my muscle my masters customer at last laid me down on the counter and pronounced the sentences with which i have begun my story then ill take it he said and pulled out his purse stop a bit though exclaimed he id better have a chain too my little chap will think more of that than the watch let me see some silver chains will you so my master went and fetched a tray containing a large number of temptinglooking chains while he was gone my new owner took me up again in his hand and turned me over and put me to his ear then as he laid me down again he smiled to himself and murmured bless his little heart how proud hell be i was quite taken aback who was this taking upon himself to bless my little heart and prophesy that i should be proud then all of a sudden it occurred to me this remark may have been intended to refer not to me but to the little chap the gentleman had just now spoken of so i recovered my composure especially when i saw what a kind gentle face my purchaser had he chose a neat strong silver chain which was forthwith in accordance with the barbarous practice of the age fixed to my poor neck i could not help sighing as i felt for the first time the burden of bondage what had i done to be thus chained like a roman captive like a dog like a parrot but it was no use being in a rage i swallowed my indignation as well as i could and consoled myself with the reflection that every watch even gold repeaters themselves are subject to the same hardship ah i was young then and my knowledge of the world was small many a time since i have blessed the chain that held me just as the ship could it speak would bless the cable that saved it from the rocks take the advice of an old ticker you young watches and instead of rebelling against your chains rather hope they may be strong and sound in every link that will be just five pounds wont it said my purchaser here is a bank note never mind about doing it up ill just slip it into my pocket goodmorning and with that i was conscious of being lowered into a dark deep pit and without time to bid my comrades goodbye or to take a last look at my old master i felt myself hurried away i knew not whither this then was my first step into the world i lay untouched and apparently forgotten for several hours gradually getting my eyes accustomed to the darkness and looking about me as far as i was able i heard a ticking going on in a pocket not very far from the one i was in which i at once concluded to proceed from the watch of my new master thinking i might be able to gain some information from him i groped about till i found a small hole in my lodgings through which i was able to peep and call tick said i as loud as i could to secure the attention of my fellowwatch whos that at once exclaimed the other im a new watch bought today humph how much three guineas chain and all no five pounds with the chain humph i cost thirty guineas never mind youre for the boy what boy the governors i heard him say he was going to get him one that boy will be spoiled as sure as i go on springs hes made such a lot of have you been regulated i should think i have exclaimed i in indignant recollection of my education all right keep your temper what time are you seven minutes to six wrong its seven and threequarters how do you know because thats what i make it how do you know you are right i asked wondering at my own impudence in thus questioning an old ticker look here young fellow said the other in an awful voice you dont seem to know you are addressing a gold watch that has neither gained nor lost a minute for five years there you may think yourself clever but youre too fast im sure i beg your thatll do said the offended veteran i want no more words i was completely shut up at this and retired back to my pocket very crestfallen presently i began to feel drowsy my nerves seemed to get unstrung and my circulation flagged it was long after the time i had generally been in the habit of being wound up and i began to be afraid i was really going to be left to go to sleep that by this time i knew would be nothing short of a calamity i therefore gave a slight tug at my chain whats the matter it said looking down ive not been wound up i cant help that said the chain cant you let him know somehow i gasped faintly how can i hes busy packing up books couldnt you catch yourself in his fingers or something im in a bad way ill see said the chain presently i felt an awful tug at my neck and i knew the chain had managed to entangle itself somehow with his fingers hullo i heard my master exclaim i mustnt smash charlies chain before i give it to him id better put it and the watch away in my drawer till the morning heigho itll be a sad day for me tomorrow as he spoke he drew me from the pocket and disengaging the chain from his buttonhole he laid us both in a drawer and shut it up i was in despair and already was nearly swooning from weakness he had shut the drawer and his hand was still on the knob when all of a sudden he exclaimed by the way i must wind it up or itll stop with what joy and relief i saw the drawer again opened and felt myself taken out and wound up instantly new life seemed to infuse itself through my frame my circulation revived my nerves were strung again and my drooping heart resumed its usual healthy throb little did my master think of the difference this winding up made to my health and comfort now youre happy said the chain as we found ourselves once more in the drawer yes im all right now im glad to say said i whats going to happen to us tomorrow i asked presently were going to be given to the boy and hes going to school so the silver chain told me nice time we shall have of it i expect after that he went to sleep and i fell to counting the seconds and wondering what sort of life i was destined to lead about an hour after i heard two voices talking in the room well said one and i recognised it at once as my masters the packings all finished at last ah charles said the other and it seemed to be a womans voice speaking amid tears i never thought it would be so hard to part with him tut tut said the first you mustnt give way mary you women are so ready to break down hell soon be back but before my master had got to the end of his sentence he too had broken down for a long time they talked about their boy their fine boy who had never before left his parents roof and was about now to step out into the treacherous world how they trembled for him yet how proudly and confidently they spoke of his prospects how lovingly they recalled all their life together from the days when he could first toddle about down to the present many tears were mingled with their talk and many a smothered sob bespoke a desperate effort to subdue their common sorrow at last they became quieter then i heard my master say i positively have never shown you the watch i got for him and with that he opened the drawer and produced me oh charles cried the mother how delighted he will be and what a capital watch it is and she looked at me affectionately for a long time for her sons sake smiling through her tears and then put me back need i say that as these two knelt together that night their only son was not forgotten in their prayers so ended the first day of my adventures chapter two how i was presented to a boy and of a certain journey we took together very early next morning when my hands scarcely pointed to five oclock the little household was astir there was a noise of hurried going and coming and of trunks being carried down stairs and for the first time i heard mingled with the sedate voices of my master and his wife another voice cheery and musical which i at once guessed to belong to my future lord and master it was not till after this bustle had been going on for a good while that i was taken out of the drawer and put back into the pocket in which i had spent so many anxious hours the day before but here i was destined not to remain long as will be seen breakfast was a sad meal to that little family even the gay high spirited boy was sobered in anticipation of the coming parting and as to his parents they dared not open their lips for fear of breaking down then there was a rumbling of wheels in the street and a banging about of boxes at the hall door then a last long embrace between mother and son she no longer resisted her grief and he for the time forgot everything but her he was leaving then father and son stepped into the cab and drove away i felt the fathers heart beating quicker and his chest heaving deeper as we proceeded presently his hand stole to the pocket where i lay hid and he said charlie boy ive said all i have to say to you you will remember our talk last night i am sure and i shall remember it too i have no greater wish than to see my boy brave and honest and true to himself remember always i am your father and never hesitate to tell me whenever you are in trouble or danger orand i hope this wont often bein disgrace see here said he drawing me forth this is a watch which your mother and i have got for you think of us when you use it and mind this charlie make the best use of time or time will become your enemy the poor man faltered out these words with a halfbroken heart as he handed me to his son the boys eyes brightened and his face became radiant at the sight of his unexpected treasure what boy does not covet a watch of his own at some time or other oh father he cried how good and kind of you what a beauty the father smiled to see his sons delight and helped to fasten the chain to his buttonhole you and mother are bricks exclaimed charlie feasting his eyes upon me and half wild with delight how did you know i was longing to have one were you inquired the father of course i was and you knew it what a swell i shall be and it will always be sure to remind me of home while this talk was going on i had leisure to examine my new owner picture to yourselves a curlyhaired brighteyed boy of thirteen with honest open face good features and winning smile he is big for his age and strongly built at present his form is arrayed in a brandnew suit of grey his collar is new and his tie is new his boots are new and his socks are new everything is new about him down to the very guard of his hat and he himself is the newest and purest of all was ever such a radiant young hero turned loose into the world and now over and above his other glories he had me to crown all the graceful curve of my chain on his waistcoat gave that garment quite a distinguished appearance and the consciousness of a silver watch in his pocket made him hold his head even higher than usual he is a beauty again he broke out exactly the kind i like most ill take ever such a lot of care of him and so saying he began to swing me at the end of the chain till i suddenly came sharply into collision with the door of the cab hullo exclaimed my young master that wont do ill put him away now it was good of you father with that we reached the railway station and in the bustle that ensued i was for the time forgotten charlies trunks were duly labelled for randlebury and then came the hardest moment of all when father and son must part i wonder if youll be altered charlie when i see you again not for the worse i hope anyhow replied the boy laughing tickets please demanded the guard there goes the bell said charlie pulling me out of his pocket theyre very punctual hullo were off goodbye father goodbye boy and god bless you and there was a close grasp of the hand a last smile a hasty wave from the window and then we were off how many grownup men are there who cannot recall at some time or other this crisis in their lives this first goodbye from the home of their childhood this stepping forth into the world with all that is familiar and dear at their backs and all that is strange and unknown and wonderful stretching away like a vast landscape before them how many are there who would not give much to be back once more at that threshold of their career and to have the chance of living over again the life they began there with such bright hopes and such careless confidence ah if some of them could have seen whither that flowerstrewn path was to lead them would they not rather have chosen even to die on the threshold than take so much as the first step forth from the innocent home of childhood but i am wandering from my story for half an hour after that last goodbye charlie leaned back in the corner of his carriage and gave himself up to his loneliness and i could feel his chest heaving to keep down the tears that would every now and then rise unbidden to his eyes but what boy of thirteen can be in the dumps for long especially if he has a new watch in his pocket charlie was himself again before we had well got clear of london and his reviving spirits gradually recalled to his memory his fathers parting gift which had for a while been half forgotten amid other cares now again i was produced i was turned over and over was listened to was peeped into was flourished about was taken off my chain and put on again with the supremest satisfaction at every station we came to out i came from his pocket to be compared with the railway time by the clock at batfield i was a minute slowa discrepancy which was no sooner discovered than i felt my glass face opened and a fat finger and thumb putting forward my hand to the required time at norbely i was two minutes fast by the clock and then oh horrors i found myself put back in the same roughandready way at maltby i was full half a minute behind the great clock and on i went again at the next station the clock and i both gave the same time to a second and then what must he do but begin to regulate me after a minute calculation he made the astounding discovery that i had lost a minute and a quarter in four hours and that in order to compensate for this shortcoming it would be necessary for him to move my regulator forward the two hundred and fortieth part of an inch this feat he set himself to accomplish with the point of his scarfpin while the train was jolting forward at the rate of thirty miles an hour i began to grow nervous if this was a sample of what i was to expect i had indeed need be the healthy hardy watch i was represented to be by my maker and yet i could not be angry with my brave honest little tormentor it was a sight to see him during that long journey in all the glory of a new suit with a high hat on his head for the first time and a watch in his pocket in his pocket did i say i was hardly ever so lucky every five minutes he whipped me out to see how the time was going if he polished me up once with his handkerchief he did it twenty times and each time with such vigour that i was nearly redhot under the operation and no sooner was he tired of polishing me than he took to paying his hat the same attention till that wretched article of decoration must have trembled for its nap then he would take to whistling and singing what boy can help doing one or the other in a train and as i heard all his little artless songs and gay chirping i thought it the pleasantest music one could possibly listen to and not to let his hands be less busy than his throat he would bring out the wonderful sixbladed knife his uncle had given him and exploring all its wonders and opening all its blades at the same time together with the corkscrew the gimlet the pincers and the buttonhook at different angles would terrify the lives out of his fellowpassengers by twirling the awful bristling weapon in his fingers within a foot or so of their faces mind dear said an old lady on the seat opposite youll cut your fingers off im certain oh no i wont exclaimed he taking out his handkerchief and beginning to polish the blades one after another the old lady trembled as she watched him and sighed with relief when the operation was over presently having nothing particular to do he stared at her would you like to know the time maam he inquired if you please replied the good old soul well its just seventeen minutes and nineteen seconds past three by my watch would you like to see for yourself maam and pleased to have a confidant of his possessions he loosed my chain and flourished me bodily before the eyes of his new friend she took me kindly and said what a fine watch youve got dear yes replied he with lofty condescension like to see his works you should be careful you know she said watches so easily get out of order oh i wont hurt it said he proceeding to take off my coat and waistcoat there there are his works dont breathe hard or youll damp them so the old lady held her breath and peeped in much to my young masters gratification and so youre going to school my man said she presently yes who told you did my father tell you no i guessed did you though can you guess what the name of the school is no i cant do that have a try well then i guess randlebury because my boy is there and its the only one i can think of the boy stared at her how ever did you know that what she exclaimed you dont mean to tell me you are going to randlebury i am though well i never cried the good old soul who would have believed it think of your going to the same school as my tom is tom your boys name yes is he a nice boy such a question to ask any ones mother the old lady burst into tears instead of answeringa proceeding which greatly alarmed and disconcerted my master dont cry he said excitedly look here i didnt meanoh dont look here shall i tell you the time itsits sixteen minutes to fouri didnt mean you know of course hes a nice boyoh dont cry and he got into such a state that the old lady dried her eyes at once never mind me dear said she it wasnt you made me cry it was thinking of my tom youll be a good friend to him wont you dear perhaps he wont like me now im sure he will exclaimed the lady warmly so warmly that i quite loved her for my little masters sake both were silent for some time and then charlie asked i say has he got a watch no oh never mind said he in a tone of evident relief i can tell him the time you know whenever he wants to know to be sure you can then charlie took to polishing me and the chain up again an occupation which lasted until we arrived at gunborough junction where passengers changed for randlebury goodbye dear said the old lady as charlie proceeded to get together his things goodbye said he would you like to know the time before i go its eight past five goodbye may i give you a kiss said she charlie blushed but offered his cheek hurriedly and you promise to be a good friend to tom said she kissing him wont you all right said the boy jumping out on to the platform and running to see after his luggage in a moment however he returned to the window and put his head in i say said he whats his nametom what drift said the old lady tom drift oh replied my master all right goodbye and next minute the train went on and he was left standing surrounded by his luggage in the middle of the platform like a lighthouse in the middle of an island chapter three how my master and i reach randlebury in state and of a great calamity my master and i had nearly an hour to wait on the platform at gunborough before the randlebury train came up part of this interval charlie for fear he might forget to do it at night devoted to winding me up an experiment which nearly closed my career for ever for he first began to turn the key the wrong way then when he had discovered his mistake he started in the other direction with a sudden dash and finally overwound me to such an extent that i expected every second to hear my heart break with the strain then he sat on his boxes whistling to himself and drumming his heels on the platform the train came up at last and in he jumped finding himself and a grave elderly gentleman in joint possession of the carriage charlie was too busy staring out of the window whistling and brushing the dust off his new hat to take much notice of his companion until the train was fairly started then observing the gentleman look at his watch the boy at once recognised a bond of sympathy and pulled out me i wonder if im the same as you he said eagerly i hope you are not said the gentleman for im a quarter of an hour fast are you though said the boy in astonishment why dont you put it right i would its a bad thing to put a watch back my boy besides i rather like keeping mine a little fast do you i say do you think my watch is a good one said charlie thrusting me into the hands of his astonished travelling companion i cant say my boy i know nothing about watches it looks a nice one yes father gave it me i say are you going to randlebury yes do you know the school im going there oh yes i know the school and you are going there are you inquired the gentleman with interest yes im a new boy you know and how do you like going to school oh all right only i dont know what itll be like eat i say i dont suppose theres many of the boys my age have got watches do you the gentleman laughed i dare say not he said charlie was silent for a time and then asked i say what sort of fellows the head master do you know ive seen him now and then said the gentleman is he awfully stuckup and strict asked the boy anxiously i really dont know said the gentleman biting his lips i hope not so do i i wish my father was the head master said charlie the tears for a moment starting to his eyes at the bare thought of such happiness the gentleman looked at him very kindly and said cheer up my little man perhaps it wont be so bad after all charlie smiled again as he said oh yes ive got to be brave you know because i promised father but i say if you ever come to the school ask for memy names charlie newcomewill you because i dont know any of the fellows and besides added he brightening at the idea we can see if our watches are going the same you know the gentleman promised and soon after this the train arrived at randlebury the boy bid his companion farewell and went off as before to look after his belongings as he was standing surrounded by his baggage a man in the dress of a coachman came up to him and said are you the young party from london for the school yes replied the boy its all right said the man give us hold of these things and jump inside my trap how far is it he asked of the man better of three miles is it though i say cant you put the things inside and then i can ride on the box all square said the man hop up my young bantam the young bantam did hop up and they were soon on their way to the school i need hardly say it was not long before charlie and the driver were on confidential terms the boy duly produced first me and then his six bladed knife to the admiring eyes of his new companion insisting on his taking both into his hands and demanding his candid opinion on their merits presently a wholly new idea seemed to strike him i say driver whats your name jim if you want to know replied that public servant well jim i wish youd just get inside and look after the luggage and let me drive will you the man opened his eyes and his mouth at the proposition and then bursting out laughing hark at him he exclaimed did you ever hear the like me get inside and let a young shaver like him drive meho ho come along jim i know the way and it would be a lark come on dear jim and the boy got quite affectionate in his eagerness dear jim who was one of those easygoing men who dont take much persuading when theyre approached the right way at length consented to hand over the reins to charlie and after waiting some time to see for himself that the boy could really manage after a fashion to drive the horse he further gratified him by descending from the box and leaving him in sole possession of the coveted position get inside jim cried the boy with beaming face jim his face all one grin obeyed saying as he did so well if you aint a queer one thats the house there on the top of that hill mind how you go now all right you get inside and i say jim added the boy leaning down from his perch make yourself comfortable you know and dont bother about me i want to drive all by myself and you arent to help me a bit mind so the driver got inside and seating himself among the luggage proceeded to make himself comfortable as instructed meanwhile my master as proud as an emperor lashed his steed into a canter and rattled off in the direction of the school thatll astonish some of them caps and gowns i reckon i heard cabby say to himself you see if he dont drive us right up to the front door as comfortable as if we was the sheriff of the county you may imagine what was the astonishment of the grave and reverend authorities at randlebury school when they perceived coming up the carriage drive a cab with a boy of thirteen perched on the box tugging at the reins hallooing to the horse and making his whip crack like so many fireworks while inside comfortably lounging amid a pile of luggage reclined cabby at his ease grinning from ear to ear the young jehu perfectly innocent of the sensation he was making pursued his triumphant career at full speed up to the very hall door pulling up his steed with such a sudden jerk as almost to bring him into a sitting position while the piledup luggage inside fell all about the cab with the shock to the imminent risk of cabbys life well if that aint one way of doing it i dont know what is exclaimed that astonished charioteer emerging from his precarious quarters down you jump young un charlie descended all jubilant with triumph and pulling out me exclaimed we did that three miles in half an hournot bad was it in his excitement he had not observed that the door of the house had opened and that these words instead of being addressed to the cabby had been spoken to a stately female who stood in the portal before him now however he caught sight of her and not knowing exactly what was the proper thing to do under the circumstances stared at her what do you say young man inquired she in a solemn voice oh said the boy i didnt know it was you i was telling jim we had come from the station in half an hour you know we started at by my watch and its just now would you like to see for yourself marm added he preparing to unfasten the chain i know what the time is young man replied she sternly and pray who is jim she asked looking down in solemn perplexity at this queer boy oh hes the driver is jim and he got inside you know and ive driven nearly all the way up by myself havent i jim come inside sir said the matron hurriedly and dont stand talking to vulgar cabmen and calling them by their christian names your name is charles newcome i suppose come this way charlie followed her in his enthusiasm rather damped at this somewhat frigid greeting and sorry in his heart he had not been allowed an opportunity of bidding farewell to his friend the driver and now i could hear the little fellows heart begin to beat quicker as he found himself at length for the first time in his life inside a public school the rows of caps in the corridors the distant hum of voices through halfopened doors the occasional shout from the playground and the fleeting vision of a master in cap and gown all had for him the deepest and most mysterious interest as he sat waiting in the matrons room while that worthy lady went to superintend the bringing in of his luggage his mind became full of wonderings and misgivings i who lay so near the seat of his emotions could tell what was going on in his breast he wondered if the pair of socks lying on the table with a hole in each heel which appeared to be waiting their turn for mending belonged to the son of the old lady he had met in the train he wondered if the footsteps in the passage belonged to the head master and whether that awful being was being fetched to punish him for his crime of driving the cab he wondered who the boy was who put his head in at the door and drew it back again with what reverential eyes he followed that heros retreating form and how he hung on his whistling when would he he wondered be sufficiently hardy to whistle within those awful walls then he wondered if he was the only new boy and if so whether every one would stare at him and laugh at his new coat he wished hed got his old one on then he wouldnt have felt so brandnew and thenand then but here tiredout with his long journey and the excitement of the day a drowsy fit came over him and without another thought he dropped off to sleep where he sat in this attitude the housekeeper found him when she returned she could not help feeling rather more than a common interest in this curlyhaired tiredout little fellow as he sat there in his new clothes huddled up with his little hat slipping from his head and his hand clasping his precious sixbladed knife accustomed as she was to boys and their rude ways this matron had a good deal of softness left in her heart and i dare say she thought as she watched charlie that afternoon that if she had ever had a son of her own she would have liked a boy something like the little fellow before her she went softly up to him took his hat from its perilous situation and lifting him in her strong arms so gently as not to wake him laid him on her own sofa and left him there to enjoy his wellmerited sleep while she busied herself about making tea it was at this moment that a calamity befell me which in my inexperience of the ways and natures of watches i imagined to be nothing short of fatal the excitement through which i had passed and the roughandready usage to which i had been subjected during the day seemed all of a sudden to overpower me in some unaccountable way i found my hands caught together in a manner i had never known them to be before no effort of mine could disengage them and the exertion thus required added to the fatigues of the day produced a sort of paralysis of my whole system without quite losing consciousness i could feel my circulation become slower and finally stop my nerves and energies became suspended and my hands grew numb and powerless even my heart ceased to beat and the little cry of alarm which i gave just before my powers left me failed to bring me any help i was ill very ill indeed to me it seemed as if my last moment had come and i could not bear the thought of thus early being taken from my young master whom already i had learned to love as my best though my roughest friend how long i lay thus speechless and helpless i cannot say once i was just conscious of a slight jerk from my chain as he peeped in and whispered what are you so quiet about down there of course i could not answer do you hear what are you so quiet about it only added to my misery to know that there was a fellowbeing so close at hand and yet that i was powerless to make him aware of my condition my silence offended him for he turned away muttering to himself sulky humbug i declare some people havent so much as the manners of a kitchen clock after that i was left to myself in agony and suspense to wait the moment of my dissolution a long time passed before my master stirred and when he did the housekeepers tea was cold she bustled about to make him some more and was so kind in buttering his toast and hunting for some jam that the drooping spirits of the tiredout boy revived wonderfully indeed as the meal proceeded he became on friendly and confidential terms even with so awful a personage as mrs packer would you like to see my knife maam he asked bless me what a knife it is cried the lady youll go doing yourself some harm with it thats what the other old lady in the train said replied charlie unconscious of wounding the feelings of his hostess who fondly imagined she was not more than middleaged but then you know she thought it was a fine knife and i think so too dont you i say marm do you know tom drift the change of subject was so sudden that mrs packer stared at the boy half wondering whether he was not talking in his sleep what about him she inquired oh only the old lady was his mother and i promised herat least she saiddo you know tom drift maam to be sure hes one of the boys here yesi say maam might i see tom drift do you think ive got something to say to him mrs packer wholly at a loss to understand her youthful guest but at the same time disposed to be indulgent to his little whims said tom would be at lessons now and she didnt think he would be able to come wouldnt it do in the morning oh no said charlie with the gravest face i must see him tonight please if you dont mind the housekeeper concluded that charlie had some important message from the mother to her son and therefore rang for a servant whom she despatched with a message to master drift that some one wanted to see him in a very little time that hero made his appearance and as he was the first randlebury boy charlie had set eyes on he appeared for a moment a very awful and a very sublime personage in that little new boys eyes but charlie was too intent on his mission to allow himself to be quite overawed heres a new boy master drift wants to speak to you what do you want young uneh oh its all right tom drift only i saw your mother you know in the train and she said you were a nice boy and she sent her love and i told her id let you know the time whenever you wanted because you aint got a watch you know and i have i say would you like to know the time now tom drift all this was rattled out with such eager volubility that tom drift hero as he was was fairly taken aback and looked quite sheepish as the beaming boy proceeded to pull me out of his pocket well its justhullo he saw in an instant something was wrong why it says only halfpast sixthat must be wrong its eight oclock by the hall clock said mrs packer its just now struck charlie looked at me opened me held me to his ear and then exclaimed oh my watch has stopped my watch has stopped what shall i do and the poor boy overwhelmed with his misfortune held me out appealingly and scarcely restrained the tears which started to his eyes chapter four how i was cured of my ailments and how my master began life at randlebury all this while tom drift had said nothing but had stood regarding first my master and then me with mingled amusement pity and astonishment at last when poor charlie fairly thrust me into his hands that he might see with his own eyes the calamity which had befallen the watch that had been destined to minister such consolation to his time inquiring mind he took me gingerly and stared at me as if i had been a toad or a dead rat cant you make it go tom drift please do how can i make him go i dont know whats the row do you think it would be a good thing to wind it up asked charlie dont know you might try charlie did wind me up but that was not what i wanted already i had had that done while waiting at gunborough junction what do you say to shaking him asked tom drift presently most people spoke of me as it but tom drift always called me him i hardly like said charlie you try tom took me and solemnly shook me it was no use i still remained speechless and helpless suppose we shove his wheels on next suggested that sage philosopher charlie demurred a little at this it seemed almost too bold a remedy even for him however he yielded to toms superior judgment the heir of the house of drift accordingly took a pin from the lining of his jacket and taking off my coat and waistcoat proceeded first to prod one of my wheels and then another but in vain they just moved for an instant but then halted again as stiff end lifeless as ever for a moment the profound tom seemed baffled and then at last a brilliant idea occurred to him i tell you what i expect hes got damp or cold or something wed better warm him and the two boys knelt before the fire with me between them turning me at the end of my chain so as to get the warmth on all sides like a leg of mutton on a spit of course that had no effect what was to be done no winding up no shaking no irritation of my wheels with a pin no warming of me at the fire could avail anything they were ready to give me up suddenly however tom who had been examining my face minutely burst into a loud laugh what a young donkey you are he cried dont you see his hands are caught thats whats the matter the minutehands got bent and cant get over the hour hand youre a nice chap to have a watch it might have occurred to charlie as it did to me that whatever sort of watchowner the former might be a boy who successively shook tickled and roasted me to get me to go was hardly the one to lecture him on his failings but my master was too delighted at the prospect of having his treasure cured to be very critical of the physician and this time at last tom drift had found the real cause of my indisposition in endeavouring to pass one another at halfpast six my two hands had become entangled and refusing to proceed in company had stopped where they were stopping my circulation and indeed my animation at the same time once more the astute tom produced his pin and sticking it under the end of my minutehand disengaged it from its fellow and bent it back into its proper position instantly as if by magic the life rushed back into my body my circulation started afresh and my heart beat its old beat charlie set up a shout of jubilation and almost hugged tom in his gratitude the latter looked very wise and very condescendingas had he not a rightand handing me back to my master said with the air of a physician prescribing a course of treatment for a convalescent patient youd better shove him on to the right time and then keep him quiet young un this charlie did and it would be hard to say which of us two was the happier at that moment i had scarcely been deposited once more into my accustomed pocket when a loud bell sounded down the corridors and made tom drift jump as if he had been shot i say thats the prayerbell come on unless you want to get into a jolly row and without further words he seized the astonished charlie by the arm and ran with him at full speed along one or two empty passages dashing at last in through a big door which was in the very act of closing as the two reached it charlie was so confused and so out of breath with this astonishing and frantic race that for a minute he did not know whether he was standing on his head or his heels there was however no time for solving the problem just then for tom drift still retaining his grasp on his arm dragged him forward whispering this way wasnt that a close shave get in here and dont make a noise charlie obeyed and found himself in a pew one of a congregation of some two hundred boys assembled in the school chapel for evening prayers at the far end of the chapel he could hear a mans voice reading but what it said it was impossible for him to make out owing to the talking that was going on around him he looked eagerly and curiously down the long rows of his new schoolfellows feeling half afraid at the sight of so many new faces and half proud of being a randlebury boy with a right to a seat in the chapel and as he looked he saw some faces he thought he should like and some that he thought he would dislike there were merry brighteyed boys like himself and there were illtempered sullenlooking boys there were boys haggard with hardreading and boys who looked as if their heads were altogether empty but what puzzled and troubled charlie not a little was to notice that though the school was supposed to be at prayers and though most of them must have been within hearing of the readers voice a considerable proportion of the boys before him were neither listening nor evincing in their behaviour the slightest sign of reverence for the service in which they were engaged he was sorry to see that tom drift was laughing and whispering with his companions entertaining them with an account of the way in which he had set the new young uns watch to rights and what a shave they had from being shut out from prayers charlie wondered as he noticed all this whether after all he would have lost much good if that misfortune had happened and one or two boys were chewing toffee at least charlie thought it must be toffee their mouths were so brown and they made such a noise over the process of mastication some with their hands in their pockets were listlessly staring up at the roof and some were reading books anything but prayerbooks under the desk charlie did his best to attend to what the invisible and inarticulate voice was saying and tried to recall what his father had told him about not letting new scenes and new companions tempt him to forget of neglect the lessons of duty and religion which he had learned at his parents home but it was not easy work and to him it was a relief when all was over and the boys proceeded to file out of the chapel where are they all going he inquired turning round to where tom drift had been standing that young man however was no longer there he had gone off to enjoy the questionable luxury of roast potatoes in a friends study entirely forgetting his young and forlorn charge charlie was puzzled he was sure he could never find his way back to mrs packers through such a maze of passages and he knew not where else to go as he stood watching in despair the last remnant of his fellow worshippers passing out and wondering what was to become of him he became aware of two big boys stopping in front of him and looking at him thats him said one whose grammar was perhaps not his strongest point at this moment why hes only a kid said the other who being sixteen felt fully justified in so designating my young master i cant help that i know its him said the first i say you fellow added he addressing charlie wasnt it you drove up to the front door in a cab this afternoon charlie trembled in his shoes more than once had his heart misgiven him he had committed an unpardonable offence in the mode of his advent to randlebury and now with these two awful accusers before him he felt as if his doom was come im very sorry he began yes it wasi didnt mean im sure what did you do it for if you didnt mean you young muffwhy dont you go off to bed because i dont know where to go and tom drift do you know tom drift yesthat is i met his mother stammered charlie becoming more and more embarrassed both the big boys burst out laughing what a treat for his mother said one i suppose she told you tom was a real nice boy yes i thought so so he is isnt he joe and both boys laughed again and she gave you a kiss to take to him no said charlie blushing scarlet she did give me a kiss but not for him it was a hard effort for the poor boy to come out with this admission but candour compelled it oh she gave you one for yourself did she and again they laughed what a dear old noodle she must be she was very kind to me said charlie not liking to hear his friend made fun of just then a master came by what are you three boys doing here he asked please sir this is a new boy replied he who had been called joe and he doesnt know where to go hum said the master i thought mrs packer would have seen after that let me see you had better take him to your dormitory tonight halliday theres a vacant bed there bring him to the doctors room after breakfast tomorrow and he passed on heres a treat exclaimed joe with a not illnatured grin this comes of stopping and talking to young scarecrows come along youngster think yourself lucky youve been handed over to me i wear patent leather boots and they dont need as much blacking as some of the fellows charlie was at a loss to understand what the material of master hallidays boots had to do with his own alleged good fortune in falling into the hands of such a guardian but he said nothing and reassured by the goodhumoured face of his conductor followed him cheerfully from the chapel hullo joe got a donkey at last cried some one as the two wended their way up the stairs leading to the dormitories looks like it was joes reply it was not very long before charlie learned that the fourfooted beast thus vaguely referred to was a polite term which the big boys at randlebury used to designate their fags come in here said his conductor turning in at a small door charlie found himself inside a small apartment measuring about ten feet square lighted by a small window warmed by a small fire decorated with a small bookcase and furnished with a small table two small chairs and a small cupboard this is my den and mind when you clean the window you dont crack that pane more than it is and when you brush my things you know see the shelf isnt dirty because i sometimes keep my worms theredo you hear and now come along to bed they put out lights at halfpast nine the mention of the time recalled me instinctively to charlies thoughts he could not resist the temptation suggested half by anxiety and half by vanity of taking me out and looking at me hullo what have you got a watch yes said charlie meekly not exactly knowing whether his companion would be admiring or indignant with him more than i have was all joes rejoinder charlies generosity was at once touched oh never mind we can go shares sometimes if you like you know said he not without an effort i dont want your watch was master hallidays somewhat ungracious reply lets have a look at it will you he took me and examined me and evidently would not have objected to be the possessor of a watch himself though he tried to make it appear it was a matter of indifference to him why dont you get your father to give you one asked charlie innocently because i havent got a father not got a father oh i am sorry and the starting tears in the little fellows eyes testified only too truly to his sincerity look here he added do take the watch please perhaps you would like it and my father would give me another joe halliday gazed at his young fag in amazement why you are a queer chap he said i wouldnt take your watch for anything but i tell you what ill ask you the time whenever i want to know will you really cried the delighted charlie how jolly and look here continued halliday take my advice and dont go offering your watch to everybody who hasnt got a father or some of them might take you at your word and then youd look foolish come along now and he led the boy into the dormitory where there were about twenty beds most of them already occupied by boys and the rest waiting for occupants who were rapidly undressing in different parts of the room look sharp and tumble in said joe pointing out the bed charlie was to have theres only five minutes more charlie with all the naturalness of innocence knelt as he was always used to do and said his prayers adding a special petition for his dear absent parents and another for the poor boy who hadnt got a father he was wholly unaware of the curiosity he had excited by his entrance into the dormitory still less did he imagine the sensation which his simple act of devotion was creating twenty pairs of eyes stared at the unwonted spectacle of a boy saying his prayers and many were the whispered comments which passed from lip to lip no one however had any been so inclined stirred either to disturb or molest himan immunity secured to him as much perhaps by the fact of his being under the protection of so redoubtable a champion as halliday as by any special feeling of sympathy for his act the good example was not however wholly lost for that same night after the lights were out and when silence reigned in the room more than one boy covered his head with his sheet and tried to recall one of the early prayers of his childhood as for charlie with me and the knife under his pillow he slept the sleep of the just and dreamt of home and i can answer for it his weary head never turned once the livelong night chapter five how my master entered and quitted the head masters study twice in one morning charlies first care in the morning was as i need hardly say to pull me out from under his pillow and consult me as to the time none of his companions were astir so that not having anything particular to do he lay still and abandoned himself to the luxury of an idle half hour in bed his spirits were so greatly revived by his nights rest that he forgot both the novelty and the loneliness of his position and fell to polishing first his knife and then me as merrily as if he were at home what a difference a sound sleep often makes in the aspect of our affairs twelve hours ago he had felt as if he could never be sufficiently bold as to whistle within the walls of randlebury and now the first sight and sound which greeted hallidays returning senses as he sat up and rubbed his eyes was his young protege whistling to himself like a lark and brightening me up with all his might with the corner of his blanket till i glowed again at nearly a red heat whos that kicking up that row whistling growled a voice from the far end of the room because id like to shy a boot at his head at this charlie subsided not desiring to gratify his unknown auditor in his benevolent desire and very soon after jumped up and dressed himself look here youngster said joe youd better do my study now as you maynt have time after breakfast today you know which room it isthe sixth on your right when you get downstairs cut along look sharp youve a good halfhour charlie made his way down to the lions den meeting on his way several other discontented fags bound on similar errands he set himself to clean the window tidy the cupboard and generally put things square and had succeeded fairly well in this endeavour by the time his patron made his appearance whats the time inquired that lord of creation running his eye rapidly round the room at the same time to notice how his fag had done his duty its five minutes to eight replied charlie after consulting me and highly delighted to be thus appealed to come along to breakfast then youll have to sit at a different table from me but mind and wait for me afterwards for ive got to take you to the doctor so charlie was conducted down to the hall to breakfast and provided with a humble seat at the foot of the lowest table while joe halliday made his way with all the dignity that became his years to a distinguished place at the highest my master found himself among a set of noisy little boys who amused themselves during the greater part of the meal by interchanging volleys of bread pellets which much oftener missed their marks than reached them in consequence of which he himself came in for the brunt of the cannonade once he ventured to return one of the random shots which had found its way to his fingers fortune favoured his aim and his shaft hit the boy it was intended for full in the eye who did that cried the wounded hero sharply i did replied charlie quite proud of his achievement all right ill punch your head for it when we get outside this was by no means what charlie had expected he had imagined the wound would be received in the same spirit of jest in which it was aimed it was only in fun he explained did it hurt you of course it did exclaimed the injured youth who till charlies arrival had been the junior pupil of the school and was now delighted to find some one below himself in the scale of seniority of course it did and youll catch it all the other boys laughed and charlie who could not find it in him to be overawed by even so majestic a hero as little master johnny walker made the best of his position look here he said ill give you three shots at my mouth and if you theres too much talking at table six exclaimed an awful voice and instantly every voice was hushed including charlies who blushed to the roots of his hair and felt as if he had been singled out before the whole school as a rioter he gulped down his breakfast without further argument with master walker and was relieved when the meal was over to find that that doughty warrior appeared to have altered his mind about punching his youthful head after some time he saw halliday beckoning to him from the other side of the room now youve got to go to the doctor said he come along this was the first time my master had fully realised the solemn nature of the approaching interview and i felt his heart flutter as he inquired i say what will he say to me oh all sorts of things youd better mind what youre up to i can tell you was the reassuring reply do you think i shall get in a row for driving the cab yesterday faltered charlie shouldnt wonder was the reply oh dear and do you think he saw me hit johnny walker in the eye at breakfast what were you the boy who was kicking up all that row my eye youre in for it here you are ill knock for you and giving the poor trembling boy not so much as an instant in which to collect his flurried ideas joe gave a rap at the door which was answered at once by a sharp come in from within now then said halliday in you go charlies knees shook under him and he hung back from that awful door in mute terror come in again cried the voice do you hear you young muff exclaimed halliday wont you catch it go in will you and opening the door himself he fairly pushed my poor master into the head masters study fancy the agony of the poor boy fully believing himself a doomed miscreant entering for the first time the awful presence of the head master of randlebury school he stood there with downcast eyes not daring to speak and rooted to the spot why whats the matter my boy at the words charlie started like one electrified he had surely heard that voice before somewhere he looked up and what was his astonishment to find in his dreaded principal no other than the gentleman with whom he had yesterday spent such a friendly hour in the train between gunborough and randlebury and his face was as kind as ever and his voice encouraging as he repeated whats the matter my man has the watch stopped oh sir said charlie running up to him i am glad its you and im so sorry i drove the cab and hit walker in the eye ill never do it again tut tut said the head master if you never do any worse than that you wont go far wrong i didnt tell you who i was yesterday because i wanted you to manage for yourself and fight your own battle on first arriving now tell me how you have got on and charlie faithfully recounted to him everything including my sudden indisposition and my cure by tom drift dr weldon for that was his name listened to his story and then said well youve made a pretty good beginning now try to remember this your father has sent you here for two reasons one is that your head may be furnished and the other is that your character may be trained i and your teachers can undertake the first but it depends chiefly on you how the second succeeds you will constantly be having to choose for yourself between what is right and what is wrong and between what is true and what is false take the advice of one who has passed through all the temptations you are likely to meet hererely always on a wisdom that is better than your own and when once you see which way duty calls follow that way as if your life depended on it do this and youll turn out a far better man than the man who is talking to you whenever you are in trouble come to me i shall always be glad to see you i promised you you know i would ask for you occasionally didnt i and now lets see what youve got in your head and then followed a brief examination conducted in a way which put charlie quite at his ease and so enabled him to acquit himself with a fair amount of credit and win from his master a commendation which he prized not a little for it was that his fathers efforts had not been wasted on him you will be put in the secondform said the doctor and if you work hard i see no reason why you should not get up into the third next midsummer now goodbye i hope you wont find the head master of randlebury is as stiff and stuckup a fellow as you dreaded and i trust i shall find you as honest and brave a fellow as i hoped you would turn out the first time i saw you goodbye charlie rose to leave with overflowing heart he even forgot in the midst of his pleasant emotion to inquire as he had fully intended to do after the doctors watch and if it was still a quarter of an hour fast as he left the room he could not help contrasting with thankfulness his present state of mind with that in which he had entered it an hour ago he laughed at himself for all his foolish fears then and as for the future that seemed now ever so much easier and brighter outside the door he found tom drift passing along the corridor in a state of great excitement the very chap i declare cried he i say lend us your watch young un will you what for asked charlie only a time race tom shadbolt says he can run a mile in i say he cant do it under and weve got a bet of halfacrown a side upon it so lend us your watch to time him by charlie hesitated and a pang passed through his breast he knew that one of the things which he had promised his father was that he would have nothing to do with betting or gambling in any form and how could he obey in this respect if he now lent me for the purpose for which i was required and yet he owed tom drift no common gratitude for the good service he had done in setting me right yesterday and surely if any one had a right to borrow me it was he the struggle was a sore one but soon decided i cant lend it you tom drift why ever not asked tom sharply im very sorry if it had been anything elsebut i promised father i would not gamble young ass who wants you to gamble i only want you to lend us your watch you are gambling though said charlie timidly and whats that got to do with you you young idiot exclaimed drift fairly losing his temper if i am im very sorry said charlie especially as you put it all right if it was anything else but i cant for this look here said drift in a fury weve had fooling enough hand me the watch this moment or ill take it and smash it and you into the bargain oh tom drift dont do that i would so gladly for anything else but i promised father once more will you or will you not i cant then take that and next moment charlie received a blow full on the chest which sent him staggering back against the wall oh how he wished that moment he had never owned me tom came upon him with an angry oath and seized him by the throat will you give it up no replied charlie he was fairly roused now no boycertainly no boy of his sortcan stand quietly by and receive undeserved blows tom tightened his grip on the boys throat and strove to snatch me from his pocket quick as thought charlie threw his arms round him and though the smaller boy of the two extricated himself from the clutch of the bully and sent him in turn staggering back livid with rage tom rushed at him but charlie eluded him and left him to overbalance himself and fall sprawling on the paved floor at this instant the doctors door opened and the head master stood gazing on the scene poor charlie five minutes ago so full of bright hopes and brave resolutions and now under the eyes of the very man who had inspired in him those hopes and resolutions engaged in a common fight with a schoolfellow what is all this asked the doctor sternly come in here you two charlie with sinking heart entered again that solemn room and drift followed sulky and with a black bruise on his forehead charlie left his antagonist to tell his story after his own fashion and was too dispirited either to contradict him or seek to justify himself he felt ashamed of himself and in his selfhumiliation saw neither defence nor extenuation for his conduct drift was dismissed with a few sharp words of reproof and warning charlie remained longer what the doctor said to him and what he said to the doctor i need not here repeat suffice it to say the former was able to form a fairer estimate of my masters conduct than he himself was he did not blame him he even told him that no boy could expect to get through his school days without some blows and advised him to see they were always on the right side he talked to him long and seriously about home and so comforted him in prospect of future difficulties and temptations that when he left that study the second time it was as a wiser though perhaps a sadder boy than before chapter six how my master had both his friends and his enemies at randlebury the events of charlies first day at randlebury had at least taught him one salutary lesson and that was to moderate his enthusiasm with regard to me and consequently for the next few weeks i had a quiet time of it true enough my master would occasionally produce me in confidence to a select and admiring audience and would ever and again proffer the use of me to his protector joe halliday but he gave up flourishing me in the face of every passerby and took to buttoning his jacket over the chain i found my health all the better for this gentler usage and showed my gratitude by keeping perfect time from one weeks end to the other it is hardly necessary for me to say that charlie was not long in making friends at randlebury indeed some of his acquaintance looked upon this exceeding friendliness in the boys disposition as one of his weak points i do believe said walcot who was only four from the head of the school to his friend joe halliday one day about a month after my masters arrival at randleburyi do believe that young fag of yours would chum up to the poker and tongs if there were no fellows here shouldnt wonder said joe hes a sociable young beggar and keeps my den uncommon tidy why only the other day when i was in no end of a vicious temper about being rowed about my greek accents you know and when i should have been really grateful to the young scamp if hed given me an excuse for kicking him what should he do but lay wait for me in my den with a letter from his father which he insisted on reading aloud to me what do you think it was about i couldnt guess said walcot well you must know hes lately chummed up very thick with my young brother jim in the second andwould you believe ithe took it into his head to sit down and write to his governor to ask him if he would give jim and me each a watch like the one hes got himself what do you think of that did he though exclaimed walcot laughing i say old boy youll make your fortune out of that youngster and what did his father say oh he was most polite of course his boys friends were his friends and all that and he finished up by saying he hoped we should both come and spend christmas there ha ha and did he send the watches no i suppose he wants to spy out the land first well said walcot the boys all right with you but hell go making a fool of himself some day if he makes up to everybody he meets my master in fact was already a popular boy with his fellows he had a select band of admirers among the youth of the secondform who cackled round him like hens round a bantam together they groaned over their latin exercises and wrestled with their decimals together they heard the dreaded summons to the masters desk and side by side i am sorry to say they held out their open palms to receive his cane if a slate bearing on its surface an outline effigy of the gentleman who presided over the lessons of the class was brought to light and the names of its perpetrators demanded charlies hand would be seen among a forest of other upraised inkstained hands and he would confess with contrition to having contributed the left eye of the unlucky portrait and if amid the solemn silence which attended a moral discourse from the master on the evils of gluttony a sudden cataract of nuts apples turnips and jam sandwiches on to the floor should drown the good mans voice charlie would be one of the illstarred wights who owned to a partnership in the bag of good things which had thus miserably burst and would proceed with shame first to crawl and grope on the dusty floor to collect his contraband possessions and then solemnly to deposit the same jam turnips and all on the desk of the offended dominie as a confiscated forfeit by these and many other like experiences charlie identified himself with his comrades and established many and memorable bonds of sympathy he took the allegiance of his followers and the penalties of his masters in equal good part he was not the boy to glory in his scrapes but he was the boy to get into them and once in no fear of punishment could make a telltale a cheat or a coward of him with the elder boys he was also a favourite for what big boy does not take pride in patronising a plucky frank youngster patronising with charlie did not mean humiliation it is true he would quake at times in the majestic company of the heroes of the sixth form but without hanging his head or toadying it is one thing to reverence a fellow being and another to kneel and lick his boots altogether charlie had what is called fallen on his feet at randlebury by the end of two months he was as much at home there as if he had strutted its halls for two years his whistle was as shrill as any in the lobbies and mrs packer stuck her fingers in her ears when he burst into her parlour to demand a clean collar he had already signalised himself too on the cricket field having scored one run by a legbye in the nevertobeforgotten match of first form first eleven against secondform second eleven and he had annihilated the redoubtable alfred redhead in the hundred yards hopping match accomplishing that distance in the wonderfully short time of fortyfive seconds but the dearest of all his friends was jim halliday his lord and masters young brother to jim charlie opened his own soul and me and the knife with jim he laid his schemes for the future and arranged when he was governorgeneral of india and jim was prime minister he would swop a couple of elephants for one of ash and tackles best twentyfoot fishingrods with a book of flies complete with jim charlie talked about home and his father and the coming holidays till his face shone with the brightness of the prospect nor was the faithful jim less communicative he told charlie all about his sisters down at dullfield where his father had once been clergyman and gave it as his opinion that jenny was the one charlie had better marry and to charlie he imparted as an awful secret not to be so much as whispered to any one that he jim was going to array his imposing figure for the first time in a tailcoat at christmas with two friends on such a footing of confidence is it a wonder they clave one to the other in mute admiration and affection many a sumptuous supper provided at the imminent peril of embargo by the authorities on the one hand and capture by hungry pirates on the other did they smuggle into port and enjoy in company on many a halfholiday did they fish for hours in the same pool or climb the same tree for the same nest what book of jims was there schoolbooks excepted that charlie had not dogseared and was not charlies little library annotated in every page by jims elegant thumbs in short these two were as one david and jonathan were nothing to them but in the midst of all his comfort and happiness one continually recurring thought troubled charlie that was about tom drift he had promised the mother to be a friend to her son and although he owned to himself he neither liked nor admired tom he could not be easy with this broken promise on his mind one day about a month after the quarrel outside the head masters study my master after a hard inward struggle conceived the desperate resolve of going himself to the lion in his den and seeking a reconciliation he walked quickly to toms study for fear his resolution might fail him and knocked as boldly as he could at the door come in cried tom inside charlie entered and found his late antagonist sprawling on two chairs reading a yellowbacked novel at the sight of charlie he scowled and looked anything but conciliatory what do you want he said angrily oh tom drift cried charlie plunging at once into his subject i do wish youd be friends i am so sorry i hurt you this last was an illjudged reference tom was vicious enough about that bruise on his forehead not to need any reminder of the injuries he had sustained in that memorable scuffle get off with you you little beast he cried what do you mean by coming here i know ive no business tom drift but i do so want to be friends becausebecause i promised your mother you know what do i care what you promised my mother i dont want you come off you go or ill show you the way charlie turned to go yet still lingered a desperate struggle was taking place i could feel within him and then he stammered out i say tom drift if youll only be friends ill give you my watch poor boy who knows what that offer cost him it was indeed the dearest bribe he had to give tom laughed sneeringly who wants your watch young assa miserable secondhand tin ticker id be ashamed to be seen with it come once more get out of here or ill kick you out charlie obeyed miserable and disappointed he could stand being spoken roughly to he could bear his disappointment but to hear his fathers precious gift spoken of as a miserable secondhand tin ticker was more than he could endure and he made his way back to his room conscious of having lost more than he had gained by this thankless effort at reconciliation what are you in the sulks about inquired halliday that evening as charlie was putting away his lord and masters jam in the cupboard i dont want to be sulky charlie said but i wish i could make it up with tom drift with who exclaimed joe who as we have before observed was subject to occasional lapses of grammar tom drift you know we had a row the first day i know replied joe about that everlasting watch of yours wasnt it yes said charlie i didnt like to lend it him because i know all about that said halliday you were squeamish about something or other he wanted it for well the watch belonged to you i suppose and you arent obliged to lend it to anybody what on earth do you want to go worrying about the thing any more for im not only i wanted to be friends with tom drift what for demanded joe oh becausebecause i promised his mother i would be pleaded charlie all i can say is you had no business to promise any one to be friends with a fellow you never saw but she said he was a nice fellow and besides he made my watch go when it had stopped added charlie as a great argument why charlie you are a greater little noodle than i took you for every one who calls that precious watch a good name is your master and youre his slave not so bad as that joe said charlie but i say isnt tom drift a nice boy then isnt he thats all replied the other im not going to abuse him behind his back but take my advice young un you are better off as toms enemy than his friend and dont you try to make up to him any more why not asked charlie in bewilderment never you mind was all joes reply and now hand me down my liddell and scott and make yourself scarce charlie sorely puzzled did as he was bid he certainly was not in love with tom drift but it was not easy for him to give up without an effort his promise to be his friend tom however was by no means in need of friends not many weeks after the day when charlie had left his study disappointed and miserable he might have been seen entertaining company of quite a different sort my readers let me here observe must not be too curious to understand how it is i am able to speak of so many things which must have taken place beyond the range of my observation they will find the reason all in good time the supper party over which tom presided consisted of four boys including himself one was shadbolt on whose account it will be remembered tom had desired to borrow charlies watch shadbolt was an unwholesomelooking fellow of fifteen with coarse features and eyes that could not look you straight in the face if they had tried he was accompanied by his chum margetson who certainly had the advantage of his friend in looks as well as in intellect the quartet was completed by gus burke one of the smallest and most vicious boys at randlebury he was the son of a country squire who had the unenviable reputation of being one of the hardest drinkers and fastest riders in his county and the boy had already shown himself only too apt a pupil in the lessons in the midst of which his childhood had been passed he had at his tongues tip all the slang of the stables and all the blackguardisms of the bettingring and boyalmost childas he was he affected the swagger and habits of a fast man like a true son of his father at randlebury he had wrought incredible mischief tom drift was not the only softminded vain boy whom he had infected by his pernicious example like all reckless swaggerers he had his band of admirers who marked every action and drank in every word that fell from their heros lips it was just with such boys as drift that his influence was most telling for tom was a boy not without aptitude to note and emulate a powerful example whether it were good or bad while his vanity rendered him as pliant as wax to the hand of the flatterer such was the party which assembled surreptitiously in toms study that evening and partook of the smuggled supper tom had had hard work to provide for his guests and had succeeded only at the risk of grave penalties if detected i say tom old horse this is a prime spread said gus where did you get it oh said tom i had a new hat coming from tilers so i got old tripes the butcher to make a neat brownpaper parcel of the kidneys and got them up in my gossamer the old donkey might have done the thing better though for the juice squeezed through and the inside of my hat looks as if i had lately been scalped hard lines but never mind perhaps theyll put it down to the crack you got on your forehead tom flushed scarlet any reference to his inglorious scuffle with charlie newcome was odious to him as gus and the others knew well enough he said nothing however only scowled angrily what said gus does it hurt you still then never mind it was a good shot and i wouldnt be ashamed of having floored you myself he didnt floor me i fell cried tom indignantly did you rather a way fellows have when they get knocked down i was not knocked down gus i tell you and youd better shut up all right old horse you mustnt mind a bit of chaff im sure youve taken it all very well yes said margetson everybody thinks you must take after your mother youre such a sweettempered chap what do you know about my mother snarled tom only what your young friend tells everybody about her what business has he to go talking all over the school about my affairs exclaimed tom furiously whats my mother to do with him a great deal it seems replied margetson for he promised her on the strength of her assertion that you were a nice boy to be your friend and now hes awfully hurt you wont let him i thought it was tom who was awfully hurt put in gus by way of parenthesis i tell you what it is you fellows said tom it may be all very funny for you but ive had quite enough of it ever since that young canting humbug came here ive led the life of a dog if instead of making a fool of me youd tell me how i can pay him out i should be better pleased all very fine said margetson why dont you pay your own bills if you want some one to punch his head said shadbolt the ugly i dont mind trying my life is insured suppose we make him stupid suggested gus with milk punch and shove him inside the doctors study couldnt you get hold of his watch and boil it said margetson who had heard of the experiments practised on me in mrs packers parlour if i got hold of it id smash it into fifty pieces growled tom between his teeth look here you fellows ive got a glorious plan exclaimed gus suddenly what is it they all cried but guss plan requires a new chapter chapter seven how a pleasant treat in store was prepared for my master gus proceeded then to divulge his plan for giving tom drift his revenge on my master lets take him to gurley races on saturday said he you know its a holiday and if we can only get him with us well astonish his sanctimonious young soul what do you say youll never get him to come said margetson wont we well see about that replied gus he neednt know where hes going but even so said drift you wont get him hes not in love with me and i dont fancy any of you are much in his line oh youll have to manage that part tom you know how the young idiots pining to make it up with you for your dear old mothers sake now you neednt start that nonsense again put in tom sulkily all right but dont you see if you were to take a forgiving fit and make up to him and talk about the old lady and his watch and all that hed be out of his wits with joy and then if you asked him to come for a days fishing on saturday we could meet you somewhere on the road and then hed have to come whether he liked or not and wont we astonish him tom mused a little its not a bad idea said he presently if it would only work but i cant make up to the young puppy as you think ten to one i should stop short in the middle and kick him that would spoil all the fun try it on any way itll be a nice little excitement to have young innocent with us and now tom where are blacks and reds im just in the humour for a rubber arent you the host produced from a locked desk a dirty and muchworn pack of cards and the party sat down to play they played for penny points and as gus and margetson were partners it is hardly necessary to say that drift and his illlooking friend lost every game before this amiable and congenial quartet separated gus had referred again to the scheme of getting charlie to gurley races and got drift to promise he would secure his victim next day next day accordingly as charlie was in the midst of a desperate game of fives with his friend jim a small boy came to him and said that tom drift wanted him what for demanded charlie who since his talk with the elder halliday had felt somewhat shy about tom i dont know said the boy your turn charlie called out jim from the end of the court charlie took his turn while he was revolving on his answer to this mysterious summons what does that child want inquired jim with all the loftiness of a secondform boy speaking of a first he says tom drift wants me whew whistled jim who of course knew the whole mystery of the affair between his chum and tom tell him to go to jericho look out for yourself and so saying he took his turn with the ball that wouldnt do said charlie i dont want to rile him id like to have a chance retorted the implacable jim well then tell him you cant come here young un tell tom drift charlie cant come do you hear cut your sticks but charlie called the messenger back i could go if i wanted jim better tell him id rather not come say that youngsterid rather not so off the youngster ran and charlie and jim finished their game of coarse the youthful messenger gave tom a full true and particular account of this conversation in all its details which rendered that young gentleman rather less eager than ever for his enterprise however he had the fear of gus before his eyes and strolled out into the playground on the chance of coming across charlie and he did come across him arminarm with the faithful jim tom worked his face into the ghastly similitude of a friendly smile as he approached and said in as genial a voice as he could pretend im glad i met you newcome because i want to speak to you if you dont mind taking a turn round the playground charlie of course was astonished he had expected at the very least to be kicked over the wall when he saw tom approach and he was utterly at a loss to understand this not unfriendly greeting innocent boy it never occurred to him the demonstration could be anything but real jim would have been a tougher subject to deal with indeed as he let go charlies arm and saw him walk off with tom he muttered to himself not caring particularly whether the latter heard him or not gammon thats what it is charlie had not long to wait before his companion began the conversation i suppose you wonder why i want you newcome said he the fact is ive been thinking i wasnt altogether right in being down on you the other day about lending me that watch especially as you were a new boy and im sorry if i hurt you charlie sprung towards him and caught his arm oh tom drift dont say that please it was my faultall my fault and i have been so sorry ever since and you will be friends now wont you i do so want to be because i promised your mother tom gave a quick gesture of impatience which if charlie had understood he would have known how near receiving a kick he was at that moment tom however restrained himself and said oh yes for her sake id like to be friends of course and i hope youll forget all about that wretched quarrel indeed i will cried charlie and dont let us say any more about it i am ever so much happier now and it was so good of you to come to me and make it up well said tom loftily you know its no use for two fellows to be at loggerheads when it can be helped and i dare say we shall get on all the better now how are you going on in the second whereupon charlie launched into a lengthy and animated account of his experiences to which tom pretended to listen but scarcely heard a word so you are fond of fishing he said casually after the boy had mentioned something on that subject aint i though cried charlie now quite happy and his old self again i say tom drift would you like to see the new lancewood top ive got to my rod its a stunner i can tell you ill lend it you you know any time you like have you caught much since you were here asked tom anxious to get this hateful business over no you know the brook here isnt a good one for fish and i dont know anywhere else near well ill tell you what said tom as if the idea had then for the first time occurred to him suppose we go off for a regular good day on saturday its a holiday you know and we could go and try up the sharle near gurley theres lots of trout there and we are certain to have a good day how jolly exclaimed charlie it would be grand but i say tom drift are you sure you wouldnt mind coming it wouldnt be a bother to you would it not a bit i like a good days fishing but i say young un youd better not say anything about it to any one or we shall have a swarm of fellows come too and that will spoil all the sport all right said charlie i say what a day we shall have ill bring my watch and knife you know and some grub and we can picnic there eh thatll be splendid well i must go in now so goodbye newcome and shake hands what a grip was that on one side all trust and fervour and on the other all fraud and malice tom drift was not yet utterly bad would that he had allowed his conscience to speak and his better self prevail half a dozen times in the course of his walk from the playground to the school he repented of the wicked part he was playing in the scheme to injure charlie but half a dozen times the thought of gus and his taunts and the recollection of his own bruised forehead came to drive out all passing sentiments of pity or remorse charlie rejoined his chum with a beaming face well asked jim what has he been saying to humbug you this time nothing very particular and i wont let you call him a humbug i say jim old boy hes made it up at last and were friends tom drift and i hurrah i was never so glad isnt it jolly jim by no means shared his friends enthusiasm like his elder brother he instinctively disliked tom drift without exactly being able to give a reason his reserve however had no effect on charlies high spirits at last the wish of his heart had been gained no longer did he walk with the burden of a broken promise weighting his neck no longer did the consciousness of having an enemy oppress him simpleton many of my readers will exclaim perhaps he was but even if you laugh at him i think you will hardly despise him for his simple mindedness for who would not rather be such a one than the tempter tom drift all that week he was jubilant boys looked round in astonishment at the shrillness of his whistle and the ring of his laughter his corner of the class room was a simple babel and the number of apples he bestowed in charity was prodigious something every one could see had happened to make him happier than ever few knew what that something was and fewer still knew what it meant what are you up to tomorrow asked the elder halliday of his fag on the friday evening fishing briskly replied the boy youre for ever fishing said joe i suppose that young brother of mine is going with you no jims going to play in the match against the badgers the badgers let me explain was the name of a scratch cricket eleven made up of boys in the first second and third forms are you going alone then charlie felt uncomfortable as he answered no whom are you going with pursued the inquiring joe a fellow in the fifth who asked me to come whats his name charlie had no help for it now tom drift he faltered tom drift i thought you and he were at loggerheads oh dont you know weve made it up he was awfully kind about it and said he was sorry when it was really my fault and we shook hands and tomorrow we are going to fish in a place he knows where theres no end of trout wheres that he didnt want me to tell for fear everybody should come and spoil the sport but i suppose i can tell you though its up the sharle near gurley humph ive fished there before now not such a wonderful lot of fish either i suppose you wont be there tomorrow asked charlie nervously afraid of losing the confidence of tom drift by attracting strangers to his waters not if i know it replied joe i say youngster i thought you had given up the notion of making up to that fellow i didnt make up to him only i cant be sorry to be friends with him well i hope you wont be sorry now youve done it take care what youre about thats all charlie was again perplexed to understand why halliday seemed to have such a dislike to poor tom just as he was going off to bed joe stopped him and asked by the way shall you be using your watch tomorrow well i promised id take it to see how the time went but i dare say we could do without it and i would like to lend it to you halliday not a bit of it replied the other i can do without it as well as you i am going to walk over to whitstone woods and back hullo thats a long trot said charlie it must be nearly thirty miles something like that said joe walcot and i are going to make a day of it which way do you go through gurley and then over rushton common and past slingcomb never i wish i could do thirty miles at a stretch so you will some day goodnight and charlie went to bed to dream of the lancewood top of his rod and the trout in the sharle in the meanwhile the conspirators had had another meeting in drifts den well have you hooked him asked gus yes its all right he took it all in like a lamb and all the school said margetson is talking of the great reconciliation and the gratification which that event will undoubtedly afford to your venerable mother shut up will you margetson ive had quite enough of that chaff but i do assure you tom thatll do said tom snappishly and margetson did not go the length of saying what it was he was so ready to assure him of well said gus well meet you and the young cub at the cross roads by sharle bridge the races dont begin till twelve so we shall have lots of time i mean to see if we cant get a trap at gurley and do the thing in style what do you say we could get one for about ten bob all serene said margetson ill fork out my share youll pay for me tom said shadbolt wont you ill see said tom all right thats settled and you are seeing about grub tom arent you dont forget the etceteras what time have you told young mooney face nine hes sure to be in time well well start a little before you know and meet you quite by accident and the young beggar wont smell a rat till we are safe in gurley and if he turns cantankerous then we can put shaddy to look after him whos going to win the gulley plate gus and then the party fell to canvassing the entries for the morrows races and making their bets in which of course tom stood almost bound to lose whichever horse won long ere they had parted company charlie was sound asleep and dreaming with me under his pillow chapter eight how my master did not catch the fish he expected about ten years before the time of my story it had happened that in a famous battle fought between her majestys troops and those of a hostile and savage king the colours of the th regiment were noticed to be in imminent peril of capture the ensign who carried them was wounded and already a score of the enemy were rushing forward to seize the prize and carry it off in triumph to their king suddenly however there dashed up to the spot a young cornet of dragoons who seeing the peril of his fellowofficer and the colours he carried dragged him flag and all up nearly into his own saddle and started off with his precious burden towards a place of shelter from the fire and spears of the savages before however he had gone twenty yards the poor ensign tumbled to the ground shot through the heart yielding with his dying hands his colours to the dragoon that plucky young soldier wrapping the torn and stained flag round his body set his teeth stooped forward in his saddle and digging his spurs into his horse galloped for his life he had a terrific gauntlet to run and grandly he ran it the friendly trench was in sight the cheers of his comrades fell like music on his ears a vision of glory and honour flashed through his mind and then suddenly he reeled forward in his seata malignant shot had found him out at last and with the colours round him he dropped from his horse into his comrades arms a dead man this hero was an old randlebury boy and ever since that day on every anniversary of his glorious death randlebury kept and still keeps holiday all this charlie was informed of by his faithful chum jim halliday as the former was dressing himself on the morning of the eventful holiday in question what possessed him to get up at six when he was not to start till nine i cannot say he even routed me from under his pillow at five so fidgety was he and as soon as ever i pointed to six he bounced out of bed as if he was shot what are you up to getting up at this time growled jim who much to the mutual delight of the boys slept in the same room with charlie oh you know i dont want to be behindhand replied charlie behindhand why do you know its only just six i know that and i mean to make the most of my holiday i say jim what do they want to give us a holiday for do you know they dont want to at all theyve got to got to what do you mean inquired charlie dragging on his boots and then jim with many yawns and growls told him the story and without waiting for his comments thereon rolled over and went off to sleep again charlie spent his early hour in polishing up things generally when he had polished up his rod with the lancewood top he polished up his green can and his hooks then he warmed me up with a piece of wash leather and then his manyfanged knife by the time these little jobs were accomplished and joes study put in order the breakfast bell sounded and he went down with a mouth sore with whistling he caught sight of tom drift at another table and nodded and waved his green can to him he informed every boy within hearing distance that it was certain to be a fine day whatever it looked like now and he made the wildest and most indiscriminate promises to entertain his whole acquaintance at no end of a trout supper on the spoils of that days sport twenty times during breakfast did he pull me out and look impatiently at my minutehand slowly making its way from eight to nine and as soon as ever the meal was over he rushed upstairs like mad for his rod and bag and then tore down again four steps at a time nearly knocking the head master over at the bottom gently my man said that gentleman recognising in this cannonball of a young fellow his little travelling companion why whats the matter i beg your pardon doctor said charlie did i hurt you not a bit so you are going to fish today yes sir said the beaming charlie i say sir do you think itll be a fine day i hope sogoodbye i suppose this can will be full when you come back goodbye sir said charlie secretly resolving that if fortune favoured him he would present the two finest of his trout to the doctor he found drift ready for him when he reached that young gentlemans study besides his rod tom had a somewhat cumbersome bag which as it carried most of the provisions for the whole party he was not a little surly about being burdened with charlie of course thought it was his and toms dinner is that the grub he cried why tom drift you have been laying in a spread what a brick you are look here id carry itisnt it a weight though if we get all this inside us two we shant starve and so they started charlie lugging along the bag and whistling like a lark looks cloudy said tom who felt he must say something or other never mind all the better for the trout you know i say i wish i had my fly on the water this minute as tom was silent charlie kept up the conversation by himself i say tom drift said he if your mother could only see us two chaps going off for a days fishing she look here draw it mild about my mother young un she can take care of herself well enough charlie blushed to the roots of his hair at this rebuke and for some time the flow of his conversation was arrested it was a good four miles from randlebury to sharle bridge and long ere they reached it charlies arm ached with the ponderous bag he was carrying he did not however like to say anything still less to ask tom to take a turn at carrying it so he plodded on changing hands every few minutes and buoying himself up with the prospect of the river and the trout presently they came within sight of the signpost which marks the junction of the gurley and sharle bridge roads here we are at last cried charlie panting and puffing i say tom drift i dont believe i could have carried this bag any farther if id tried itll be lighter when we go home hullo who are these three for at this moment gus margetson and shadbolt made their appearance they look like randlebury fellows by their caps oh i know who one of them is added charlie margetson in the fourth dont you know him rather replied tom and the other two are shaddy and gus whod have thought of meeting them and he gave a whistle which succeeded in attracting the attention of the worthy trio of course their surprise at meeting tom and his companion was no less greatin fact they had to inquire who the youngster was where are you off to demanded gus were going to try our luck up the sharle said tom youll be sold if you do said gus we were down looking at it and a pretty state its in old skinner at the tannery took it into his head to leave his gates up last night and his muck has got into the river and poisoned every fish in ithasnt it shad rather replied shad i was glad enough to get my nose away from the place heres a go charlie said tom turning to his young companion during this short conversation charlie had passed through all the anguish of a bitter disappointment it is no light thing to have the hope of days snuffed out all in a moment and he was ready to cry with vexation however it couldnt be helped and he had learned before now how to take a disappointment like a man so when tom appealed to him he put a good face on it and said awful hard lines never mind lets go back and see the match with the badgers tom why dont you come with us asked gus we are going to gurley have you ever been to gurley young un no said charlie come along then well show it you its a prime town isnt it margetson dont ask me said margetson id sooner see about gurley than catch a sevenpounder any day and besides said tom isnt there some good fishing above the lock come along charlie we shall not be baulked of our days sport after all charlie joined the party although he did not conceive any great admiration for toms three friends his anxiety not to offend his now reconciled enemy and the possibility of fishing after all overruled him and still dragging the bag he trudged along with the others towards gurley as they approached the town he could not help noticing the number of holidaymakers and vehicles that passed them there were drags full of gailydressed ladies and gentlemen who wore veils and there were light jaunty dogcarts with spruce young whitehatted gentlemen perched in them there were vans in which corks were popping like musketry fires and parties on foot like themselves hurrying forward with loud laughter and coarse music surely thought he theres something on at gurley presently a waggonette driven by a very loud youth in a check suit and with an enormous cigar in his mouth pulled up in passing and its driver addressed gus so youve found your way here have you my young bantam catch you being out of a good thing are you going on the grand stand dont know said gus grandly we may pick up a trap in the town ho ho going to do it flash are you well theres one of you could do with a little spice added he glancing at charlie i suppose my traps not grand enough for you can you give us a lift then bill asked gus charmed at the idea yes to be sure ive no company today theres just room hop in i may as well turn an honest penny as not here you young sinner jump up beside me on the box and before charlie knew where he was or whither he was going he found himself on the box of the waggonette beside the flash youth and his four friends behind him inside whos your friend gus he heard margetson ask son of belsham who keeps the green tiger at randlebury were in luck i can tell you you fellows as charlie gradually recovered from his bewilderment he felt himself extremely uncomfortable and ill at ease from what had been said he had gathered that the object of the boys in going to gurley was something more than to see the town and he by no means liked guss new friend or approved of his easy familiarity with a low publicans son it was not long before his dawning suspicions were fully confirmed so youre going to see the races asked mr belsham no im not replied charlie as curtly as he could for he had no desire to encourage the conversation of this objectionable person aint you and what are you going to do then my young lamb and in the course of this brief sentence mr belsham succeeded in interjecting at least three oaths i shant speak to you if you swear said charlie its wrong to swear no is it who says that my father says so blurted out charlie fully satisfied that no better reason could be demanded belsham laughed and turning to the four inside said i say young gentlemen this young pippin tells me hes got a father who says its wrong to swear what do you think of that his father must be an amusing man replied gus wait till we get on to the course said margetson hell hear something to astonish him there young prig im not going to the races cried my master starting from his seat and now fully alive to the fraud of which he had been made the victim how could you do this tom drift let me down will you and he struggled so desperately with belsham that that gentleman was obliged to let go the reins in order to hold him of course it was no use his resisting amid the shouts and jeers of his schoolfellows he was held on to the box in vain he pleaded besought struggled threatened there he was compelled to stay all through gurley and out to the racecourse here he found himself in the midst of a yelling blaspheming drunken multitude from the sight of whose faces and the sound of whose words his soul revolted so vehemently that it lent new vigour to his exhausted frame and urged him to one last desperate struggle to free himself and escape from his tormentors look here said belsham to gus if you suppose im going to have all my fun spoiled by looking after this cub of yours while youre enjoying yourselves there inside youre mistaken here look after him yourselves so saying he dragged charlie from his seat and swung him down into the waggonette with such force that he lay there half stunned and incapable of further resistance and so for the time being saved his persecutors a good deal of trouble and indeed had it been otherwise it is hardly likely they would have just then been able to pay him much attention for at that moment the horses were all drawn up at the startingpost waiting for the signal to go that was a feverish moment for tom drift he had bet all his money on one horse and if that horse did not win he would lose every penny of it as usual he had repented a hundred times of that days business and the last brutal outrage on poor charlie had called up even in his seared breast a fleeting feeling of indescribable shame it was alas only fleeting next moment he forgot all but the horses there they stood in a long restless line a shout and they were off in the first wild scramble he could catch a sight of the colours on which his hopes depended near the front on they came like the wind a man near shouted the name of toms horseits winning and toms head swam at the sound on still nearer and now they have passed in the retreating straggling crowd he can see his horse still but it seems to be going back instead of forward like a torrent the others overhaul and pass it then a louder shout than usual proclaims the race over and the favourite beaten and tom staggers down to his seat sick and half stupid never mind old man he heard gus say lucks against you this time youll have your turn some day take some of this man and never say die and tom reckless in his misery took the proffered bottle and drank deeply it was late in the afternoon before belsham thought of turning his horses head homeward and by that time charlie on the floor of the waggonette was slowly beginning to recover consciousness chapter nine how my master and i had quite as much excitement in one afternoon as was good for us just as they were turning to go a sudden shout and rush of people arrested them the crowd on the course had been immense and of the roughest and lowest description sharpers thieves and roughs were there by the hundred attracted from the neighbouring villages by the opportunity of plunder and riot which gurley races always afforded as soon as the serious business of the racing was over this low mob naturally sought excitement of their own making and increasing in disorder and intemperance as the day wore on had become beyond control just about the time when mr belsham junior took it into his muddled head to make a start in the direction of home the shout which kept him where he was was occasioned by that spectacle dear to the eyes of all blackguards a fight round the two blood and duststained combatants the mob surged and yelled every moment it grew denser and wilder and every moment it swayed nearer and nearer to the spot where the randlebury boys stood in their waggonette and before they could move or get clear they found themselves in the very centre of the mob shouts shrieks and wild laughter rose on every side of them some of the crowd scrambled up onto their wheels to get a glimpse of the pugilists some abused and swore at them for getting in the way some tried to invade their waggonette and struck at them when they resisted in the midst of all belshams horse took fright there was a wild plunge a shriek from the crowd in front and next moment the five boys were thrown down among the crowd while the horse with the shattered and overturned vehicle behind him forced for himself a ghastly lane through the mob of gus and his three friends charlie whom the shock roused to sudden consciousness could see nothing he tried to rise but the crowd pressed too wildly to give him the chance for some moments he lay among a host of crowding struggling feet expecting every moment to be stunned if not killed but by a wonderful providence he escaped the peril the crowd gave a sudden swing in a new direction and he was left unhurt though stupefied and almost unable to stir presently he was conscious of a man standing in front of him oh help me gasped my poor master the man seized him roughly by the arm and raised him to his feet thats worth a tip he growled come hand over charlie put his hand in his pocket and drew out a shilling the man scowled do you suppose ill take a dirty shilling come young swell empty out them pockets look sharp ive no time to waste on the like of you tremblingly charlie obeyed and gave the man all the little stock of money he possessed but he was not yet to escape from under his jacket the greedy eye of the thief had caught a glimpse of a chain with a rough hand he tore open the coat what a ticker heres luck out with it come oh cried charlie take anything but that take my chain and my knife but not my watch hardly and brutally laughed the man as he snatched me out of the poor boys hand and administering a parting cuff on the head of his victim turned to walk off with me in the recesses of one of his filthy pockets scarcely however had he turned when three men appeared in front of him coming in the direction of charlie the boy saw them and imagine his joy when in one of the party he recognised his old acquaintance the cabman jim with a sudden bound and cry of delight he rushed towards him shouting and pointing to the robber oh jim hes taken my watch get my watch back jim jim took in the state of affairs in an instant and calling on his two companions to follow him rushed upon and secured the thief before the latter was even aware of their intention it was vain for one man to resist three he was forced to disgorge first me then the knife and then the money charlie indeed pleaded that they should leave him the money or some of it but this proposal jim scouted and in his zeal relieved the robber of a good deal more than he had stolen from charlie then with kicks and blows they drove the wretch away as fast as his legs could carry him this done jim the cabman had an opportunity of renewing his acquaintance with my master well said he whod have thought of seeing you here and what a nice mess youre in you look as if oh dont cried charlie holding him by the arm its bad enough as it is without you thinking ill of me and then he told him as well as he could how he had been decoyed to these vile races how he had been kept there by main force how he had been made senseless by their rough treatment and how but for jims timely help he would now have been robbed and helpless jim listened in astonishment not unmingled with many an ejaculation of indignation at the poor boys persecutors and where are they now he asked when charlie had done i dont know we were all thrown out you know among the crowd i only hope theyve not been killed well if i was you said the downright cabman i wouldnt break my heart over them i know id like to have a chance of a quiet talk with the young swells id give them something to take home with them i would charlie said nothing but gratefully put himself under the protection of his deliverer who making a considerable round to avoid the crush led him safely to gurley theres no trap to be got for love or money so youll just have to walk if you want to get back to randlebury tonight anything to get away from that odious crowd if the distance had been twice as far charlie would have undertaken it it was long enough however before they got away from the crowd the road from gurley to sharle bridge was alive for a mile and more with vehicles drunken men and women beggars and pickpockets on either side of the road were jugglers and thimbleriggers and cardsharpers who each attracted their crowd of simpletons many were the fights and riots that attended these eager assemblages as they passed one booth the headquarters of a blustering cardsharper a sudden disturbance arose which threatened to block the entire road the man had offered a sovereign to any one of his audience who could tell which of three cards he held uppermost in his hand one voice called out a number the man shuffled his cards and by some slip on his part the guess of the speculator turned out correct instantly that youth demanded his sovereign which the man refused vowing and calling others to witness that another number had been guessed ill bring the police cried the voice and instantly there was a movement in the group as of some one endeavouring to force his way out knock him over some one cried hes only one of them donkey schoolboys what business have they here at all and at the signal two or three of the jugglers accomplices made a dash at the retreating youth and seized him souse him in the river cried somebody else sit on him shouted a third in the midst of these contradictory advices the roughs lifted their struggling victim from his feet and proceeded to carry him in the direction of the bridge in the momentary glimpse which charlie got of the wretched object of this persecution he recognised to his horror and astonishment tom drift livid with terror frantic with rage and yelling with pain jim cried charlie thats tom drift oh cant we help him will you try jim poor tom is he one of them four as brought you here asked jim not offering to move yes but never mind that they will drown him see how furious they are will you help him jim not a bit of me replied the stubborn jim who was well content to see the tables turned on one who had so brutally illtreated his young companion then i must try myself and so saying the boy of thirteen rushed in among the crowd and wildly tried to make his way to where his schoolfellow was being dragged by his persecutors of course jim had nothing for it but to back him up and in a moment he was beside my young master let the boy be he shouted to those who carried drift in a voice so loud that for a moment the rabble stood quiet to hear in the midst of this silence charlie shouted hold on tom drift well help you if we can instantly the crowd took up the name tom drift yah souse tom drift roll tom drift in the mud yah tom drift and sure enough tom drift would have suffered the penalty prepared for him despite charlies attempt at rescue had not help come at that moment from a most unexpected quarter it will be remembered that joe halliday and his friend walcot had planned a long walk on this holiday to whitstone woods some ten miles beyond gurley this plan they had duly carried out and were now making the best of their way back to randlebury along the crowded highway when the sudden cry of a schoolfellows name startled them tom drift yah beggarly schoolboy i say joe thats one of our fellows whats happening joe accosted a passerby whats going on he inquired theyre only going to souse a young chap in the river what for i dont know cause he dont think the same as old shuffle the three card chap we must do something joe said walcot i wish it were any other chap but come on were in for it now said joe and with that these two broadshouldered tall fellows dashed into the thick of the fray toms bearers were now at the bridge which was a low one and were turning down towards the waters edge when a new cry arrested them now randlebury put it on randlebury who backs up randlebury it was the old familiar cry of the football field and at the sound of the wellknown voices charlies heart leapt for joy i do he shouted with all his might here you are randlebury and jims gruff voice took up the cry too a panic set in among the blackguards to them it seemed that the school was come in force to rescue their comrade for on either side the cry rose and fighting towards them they could see at any rate two stalwart figures who they concluded were but the leaders of following force one of the men was hardy enough to turn at bay at the moment walcot had cleared his way at last up to the front big bully though he was he was no match for the wellconditioned active athlete who faced him and walcot punished him in a manner that made him glad enough to take to his heels as fast as he could this exploit turned the day dropping tomhow and where they did not stay to considerthey followed their retreating companion with all the speed they were capable of and left the enemy without another blow masters of the situation but if as a victory this charge of the randlebury boys had been successful as a rescue it had failed for tom drift being literally dropped from the shoulders of his executioners had fallen first on to the parapet of the bridge and then with a heavy shock into the stony stream beneath when walcot joe charlie and jim among them went to pull him out he was senseless at first they thought him merely stunned by the fall the stream was only a few inches deep but presently when they began to lift him they found that his right arm on which he had fallen was broken bandaging the limb as well as they could and bathing his forehead with water they succeeded in restoring tom to consciousness and then between them carried him as gently as possible to the nearest house when they managed with some difficulty to get a vehicle to convey them the rest of their journey it was a sad silent journey to tom the pain caused by every jolt was excruciating they did their best to ease him holding him lying across their knees while jim drove along the level footpath but by the time the school was reached the sufferer was again insensible and so he remained till the surgeon had set his arm thus ended the eventful holiday before charlie went to bed the doctor sent for him to his study and there required to know the true history of that days doings and charlie told him all i need hardly say that according to his version the case against the four culprits was far lighter than had their impeachment been in other hands he took to himself whatever blame he could and dwelt as little as possible on the plot that had been laid to get him to gurley and on the means which had been used to keep him when once there he finished up with a very warm and pathetic appeal for tom drift dont please expel tom drift he said in all the boldness of generosity he was led on by the others sir and hes punished badly enough as it is oh sir if youd seen his mother cry when she only spoke of him you couldnt do it you must leave that to me said the doctor sternly i hope i shall do nothing that is unjust or unkind and now go to bed and thank god for the care he has taken of you today and charlie went tom drift was not expelled for weeks he lay ill and during that time no nurse was more devoted and no companion more constant than charlie newcome a friendship sprang up between the two strangely in contrast with the old footing on which they had stood no longer was tom the vain hectoring patron but the docile penitent over whose spirit charlies character began from that time to exercise an influence which if in the time to come it could always have worked as it did now would have gone far to save tom drift from many a bitter fall and experience when tom a week before the christmas holidays left the sickroom and took his place once more in his class gus margetson and shadbolt were no longer inmates of randlebury school chapter ten how i changed hands and quitted randlebury and now dear reader we must take a leap together of three years for remember i am not setting myself to record the life of any one person or the events which happened at any one place i am writing my own lifeor those parts of it which are most memorableand therefore it behoves me not to dwell unduly on times and scenes in which i was not personally interested i had a very close connection with the events that rendered charlies first term at school so exciting but after that for three years i pursued the even tenor of my way performing some twentysix thousand two hundred and eighty revolutions unmarked by any incident either in my own life or that of my master worthy of notice by the end of those three years however things were greatly changed at randlebury charlie not far from his sixteenth birthday was now a tall broadshouldered fellow lording it in the upper fifth and the hero of the cricket field of which he himself had once been a cadet in face he was not greatly altered still the old curly head and bright eyes he was noticed occasionally to stroke his chin abstractedly and some envious detractors went so far as to rumour that in the lowest recesses of his trunk he had a razor wherewith on divers occasions in dread secret he operated with slashing effect be this as it might charlie was growing up he had a fag of his own who alternately quaked and rejoiced beneath his eye he wore a fearful and wonderful stickup collar on sundays and above all he treated me with a careless indifference which contrasted wonderfully with his former enthusiasm and betokened only too significantly the advance of years on his young head true he wound me up regularly but he often left me half the day under his pillow and though once in a fit of artistic zeal he set himself to hew out a cn in startling characters on my back with the point of a bodkin he never polished me now as he was once wont to do all this was painful to me especially the operation with the bodkin but i still rejoiced to call him master and to know that though years had changed his looks and sobered his childish exuberance the same true heart still beat close to mine and remained still as warm and guileless as when little charlie newcome with me in his pocket first put his foot forth into the world there were two besides myself who could bear witness at the end of these three years that time had not changed the boys heart these two i need hardly say were tom drift and jim halliday to tom charlie had become increasingly a friend of the true kind ever since the day at gurley races the influence of the younger boy had grown and overshadowed the elder confirming his unstable resolutions animating his sluggish mind with worthy ambitions and giving to his pliant character a tone coloured by his own honesty and uprightness just as a pilot will safely steer the ship amid shoals and rocks out into the deeper waters so charlie by his quiet influence had given toms life a new direction towards honour and usefulness once and once only during those three years had he shown a disposition to hark back on his old discreditable ways and that was the result of a casual meeting with gus one summer during the holidays with whom he afterwards confessed to charlie he was induced to forget for a time his better resolutions in the snares of a billiardroom but the backsliding was repented of almost as soon as committed and to charlies anxious eyes appeared to leave behind no bad result jim was the same downright outspoken boy as ever he had yielded surlily at first to the admission of tom drift into the confidence and friendship of himself and his chum but by degrees moved by charlies example he had become more hearty and now these three boys were the firmest friends in randlebury one day as charlie was sitting in his study attempting with many groans to make sense out of a very obscure passage in cicero his fag entered and said newcome theres a parcel for you down at trotters why didnt you bring it up you young muff inquired his lord because its got to be signed for and he wouldnt let me do that for you like your cheek to think of such a thing whats it like oh its in a little box i say newcome shall we go and get it i cant go at present itll wait i suppose said charlie with the air of a man who was daily in the habit of receiving little boxes by the carrier but for all that he could not wholly conceal his curiosity what size box he asked presently about the size of a good big pillbox all that i dare say i can fetch that up by myself said charlie size of a large pillbox it could not be anything so very important after all so he turned again to his cicero and sent the fag about his business presently however that youth returned with a letter for charlie it ran thus dear young scamp people always say bachelor uncles are fools and i think they are right ive sent you a proof of my folly in a little box which ought to reach you about the same time as this letter youve done nothing to deserve a present from me and a box on the ears would be much better bestowed never mind take care of this little gift for me in memory of the jolly christmas you and i last spent together and when you are not kicking up a row with your cronies at randlebury or have nothing better to do think of your affectionate uncle ralph much to the fags astonishment charlie having perused this letter slammed up cicero and seizing the cap from off his the fags head as being most ready to hand dashed out of school in the direction of the village trot he exclaimed as he reached the establishment of that familiar merchant hand up that little box you old villain do you hear the longsuffering trotter to whom this address was comparatively polite in its phraseology was not long in producing the parcel in acknowledgment of which charlie gave his sign manual in lordly characters upon the receipt and then burning with impatience yet trying hard to appear unconcerned walked swiftly back to the school the fag was hanging about his study scarcely less curious than himself hook it cried his master putting the parcel down on the table and taking out his penknife to cut the string still the inquisitive fag lingered whereupon charlie taking him kindly yet firmly by the collar of his coat conveyed him to the open window whence he gently dropped him a distance of six feet to the earth privacy being thus secured he turned again to his parcel and opened it imagine his delight and my agony when there came to light a splendid gold watch and chain i turned faint with jealousy and when a second glance showed me that the interloper was no other than the identical gold repeater whom i had known and dreaded in my infancy i was ready to break my mainspring with vexation to me the surprise had brought nothing but foreboding and despair and already i felt myself discarded for my rival but to charlie it brought a rapture of delight which expressed itself in a whoop which could be heard half over the school what on earths the row said a head looking in at the door caught cold or what come here jim this moment look at this and jim came and looked and as he looked his eyes sparkled with admiration my eye charlie what a beauty said he taking up the treasure in his hand his thumb happened to touch the spring on the handle and instantly there came a low melodious note from inside the repeaterone two three and then a double tinkle twice repeated thats striking observed jim who was occasionally guilty of a pun why its a repeater so it is did you ever know such a brick as that uncle of mine its a pity your people cant think of anything else but watches for presents why what a donkey you made of yourself about that silver turnip when you first had it dont you remember whats to become of it by the by how do i know i say jim this one wasnt got for nothing and then the boys together investigated the wonders of the new watch peeping at its works and making it strike till i was quite sick of hearing it but then i was jealous there was no more cicero for charlie that day he was almost as ridiculous though not so rough with his new treasure as he had been with me he turned me out of my pocket to make room for it and then half a dozen times a minute pulled it out and gloated over it at night he put us both under his pillow little dreaming of the sorrow and disappointment that filled my breast where were all the old days now who would admire or value me a poor commonplace silver drudge now that this grand showy rival had come and taken my place in my anger and excitement my heart beat fast and loud so loud that presently i heard a voice beside me saying gently there if you please no one can hear himself speak with that noise ive more right to be here than you i growled that is as our mutual master decides but surely i have heard your voice before let me look at you and he edged himself up so as to get a peep at my shabby face to be suremy young friend the threeguinea silver watch how do you do my little man this patronage was intolerable and i had no words to reply ah you find it difficult to converse you must indeed be almost worn out after the work you have had i am indeed astonished to see you alive at all i am sure in my masters name i may be allowed to thank you for your praiseworthy exertions in his service we are both much obliged to you and hope we shall show ourselves not unmindful of your brute was all i could shriek so mad was i whether my rival would have pursued his discourse i cannot say but at that instant a hand came fumbling under the pillow it passed me by and sought the repeater and next moment the tinkling chimes sounded halfpast eleven it was as much as i could endure to be thus slighted and triumphed over contemptible creature i exclaimed you may think youve a fine voice but like a simpering schoolgirl you cant sing till youre pressed i had him there surely better that than having no voice at all like some people or using it when no one wants to hear it like others i suppose he thought he had me there the puppy he went on chiming at intervals during the night and of course my master had very little rest in consequence the next day charlie and jim had a solemn confabulation as to the disposal of me its no use wasting it you know said jim pity you havent got a young brother to pass it on to suppose you take it said the generous charlie no old man i dont want it im not so mad about tickers as you but i tell you what charlie you might like tom to have it hes leaving you know and it would be a nice reminder of randlebury just what i thought directly the new one came exclaimed charlie only then i remembered we had a row about this very watch three years ago and im afraid he wouldnt like it try old tom would be quite set up with a watch charlie proceeded that same day in quest of tom whom he found packing up his books and chemicals in a large trunk to him my master exhibited his new treasure greatly to drifts delight why charlie he said i dont know much about watches but im certain thats worth twenty pounds no exclaimed charlie you dont mean that yes i do but for all that ill back your old turnip to keep as good time as it its always gone well the old one im glad you like it tom i always liked it you know why well ive known it as long as ive known you and if it hadnt been for it things might have been different yes said charlie it was the cause of all the row three years ago and if it hadnt been for that row i should have gone to the bad long ago that was a lucky row for me charlie thanks to you dont say that old man because its a cram i say tom added charlie nervously coming to his point will you do me a favour anything in the world what is it take my old watch tom its not worth much you know but it may be useful and it will help to remind you of old days will you tom toms lips quivered as he took me from charlies outstretched hand old boy said he id sooner have this than anything else in the world somehow i feel i cant go wrong as long as i have it charlie was beyond measure delighted to find his present accepted with so little difficulty oh tom he said i am glad to think youll have it and i know youll think of me when you use it wont i said tom i say charlie i wish you were coming to london with me so do i never mind well often write and youll promise to let me know how you are getting on wont you yes and youll call and see my father pretty often wont you yes and youll keep yourself free for a weeks jaunt at easter yes they had much more talk that evening which lasted till late what they talked about it is not for me to repeat and if it were it would probably not interest my reader he would perhaps be disappointed to find that a considerable part of it related to a new suit of toms just arrived from the tailors and that another part had reference to toms intention to prevail on his landlady in london to allow him to support a bulldog puppy on her premises these subjects deeply interesting to the two friends would not improve with repetition and neither would the rest of their talk which was chiefly a going over of old times and a laying of many a wondrous scheme for the future suffice it to say on this last evening the two boys unbosomed themselves to one another and if tom drift went off to bed in a sober and serious frame of mind it was because he and charlie both had thought and felt a great deal more than they had spoken during the interview the packing went on at the same time as the talk and then the two friends separated only to meet once more on the morrow for a hurried farewell lets have a last look at him said charlie as tom was getting into the cab to go tom took me out and handed me to him long and tenderly my dear young master looked at me then patting me gently with his hand as if i were a child he said goodbye and be good to tom drift do you hear if a tick could express anything my reply at that moment must have satisfied him his parting wish would not be forgotten then returning me to my new master he said goodbye old boy joy go with you well hear of you at the head of your profession before jim and i have left school not quite so soon replied tom laughing then came a last goodbye and the cab drove off as it turned the corner of the drive tom leaned out of the window and held me out in his hand long shall i remember that parting glimpse he was standing on the steps with jim waving his hands the sun shone full on him lighting up his bright face and curly head i thought as i looked where could one find his equalsans peur et sans reprochematchless for gentleness honesty and courage and felt as the vision faded from me that i should never see another like him and i never did little however did i dream in what strange way i was next to meet charlie newcome chapter eleven how tom drift made one start in london and prepared to make another the two months that followed my departure from randlebury were melancholy and tedious it was hard for me after the boisterous surroundings of a public school to settle down to the heavy monotony of a dull lodging in a back street of london and it was harder still after being the pride and favourite of a boy like charlie newcome to find myself the property of tom drift not that tom used me badly at first he wound me up regularly and for the sake of his absent friend honoured me with a considerable share of his affection indeed for the first week or so he was quite gushing scarcely letting me out of his sight and sometimes even dropping a tear over me and i remembering charlies last words be good to tom drift felt glad to be able to remind my new master of old times and keep fresh the hopes and resolutions with which charlie had done so much to inspire him but tom drift i could not help feeling was not a safe man there was something lacking in him and that something was ballast no one perhaps ever had a greater theoretical desire to be all that was right and good but that was not in itself enough in quiet easy times and with a guiding friend to help him tom drift did well enough but left to himself amid currents and storms he could hardly fail to come to grief as we shall presently see for the first two months he stuck hard to his work he was regular at lectures and attentive when there he spent his spare time well in study bearing upon the profession for which he was preparing he wrote and heard once a week from charlie he kept clear of the more rackety of his fellowstudents he spent his sundays at mr newcomes house and he took plenty of healthy exercise both for body and mind with many examples about him of industry and success he determined to make the most of his time as a student and spoke of the life and sphere of a country doctor for which he was training with the enthusiasm of one whose heart is in his work the more i think of it he once wrote to his mother who was residing abroad for her health the more i take to it a good doctor is the bestliked man in his parish everybody comes to him in their trouble he gets into the best society and yet makes himself loved by the poorest in four or five years at least i ought to get through my course here and then there is nothing to prevent my settling down at once by that time i hope youll be well enough to come and keep house for me for all country doctors you know are bachelors and so on all this was very well and as one of toms friends i rejoiced to see him thus setting himself in earnest to the duties of his calling but i rejoiced with trembling although he kept clear for the most part of his fellowstudents choosing his friends charily and shyly i could yet see that he had no objection to contemplate from a distance the humours and festivities of his more highspirited companions he was not one of those impulsive fellows who shut their eyes and take a header into the midst of a new goodfellowship only to discover too late their error and repent their rashness at leisure no tom had his eyes open he saw the evil as well as the good and alas for him having seen it he looked still the students of saint elizabeths hospital were not on the whole a bad set on toms arrival in london however he had the firm impression in his mind that all medical students were bad characters and this foolish notion did him much harm if two or three of them were to go off for a spree his imagination would at once picture them in scenes and places such as no respectable man would like to frequent whereas if the truth were known these misjudged young men had committed no greater crime than that of taking a boat up the river or a drive in a dogcart if a group of them should be seen by him laughing and talking he instinctively concluded their topic must be ribaldry whereas they would perhaps be only joking at the expense of some eccentric professor or else chaffing one of their own number and so it happened that tom failed in time to distinguish between the really bad and such as he only imagined to be bad and from his habit of looking on at them and their doings from a studied distance their presence began gradually and insensibly to exercise a very considerable influence over his mind after all he would sometimes say to himself these fellows get on they pass their exams they pay their bills they gain the confidence of their professors and at the same time they manage to enjoy themselves perhaps i am a fool to take so much pains about the first three of these things and to deny myself the fourth perhaps after all these fellows are not so bad as i have fancied or perhaps i am prudish and then the silly fellow having once inclined to admit there was something to be said for medical students and having before considered all bad alike became tolerant all round more particularly of the really bad set who appeared to him to enjoy themselves the most as his companions became more attractive to him his work became less interesting why should i grind and plod here he said while every one else is enjoying himself if young charlie were here im pretty sure hed be in for some of their sprees and laugh at me for wearing my eyes out as im doing and then he leaned back in his chair and took to wondering what the six fellows who started that afternoon for richmond were doing smashing the windows of the star and garter perhaps or fighting the bargees on the river or capturing a fourinhand drag or disporting themselves in some such genial and truly english manner and as tom conjured up the picture he half envied them their sport so he gradually became restless and discontented the days were weary and the evenings intolerably dull the visits to mr newcome were of course pleasant enough but it was slow being cooped up an entire sunday with two old people on the whole life in london was becoming stupid one of the first symptoms of his altered frame of mind was the occasional neglect of his regular letter to charlie that everfaithful young man wrote as punctually as clockwork every thursday morning a letter lay on toms plate at breakfasttime addressed in the wellknown hand and bearing the randlebury postmark and jolly lively letters they were i remembered one of them well it came after two weeks omission on toms part and ran thus dear tom a pretty fellow you are to correspond with here am i piping to you with all my might but i cant get you to dance i know what youll tell me you old humbugawfully hard grindexam coming onlectures day and night and rubbish like that all very well but look here thomas dont fancy that your diligence in cutting off legs and arms can be an excuse for cutting yours truly in this heartless manner not having a letter of yours to answer i dont know how i shall scrape up material enough for a yarn there was a big footballmatch on saturday and jim and i were in it you should have seen me turning somersaults and butting my head into the fellows stomachs jim and i got shoulder to shoulder once in the game you know old howe well he was running with the ball to wards our goal and jim and i were in front of him i was nearest and charged and over i went like a ninepin then jim was on him and over he went too however i was up again in time to jump on howes back but he shook me off on to the ground on my nose then jim having recovered took his fling and a rare fling it was for howe dodged him just as he was at the top of a kangaroo leap and left him looking very foolish in a sitting posture on the ground however in dodging howe had allowed me time to extricate my nose from the earth and make my third attempt this time was more successful for i got my hands round the ball but i shouldnt have kept them there if jim hadnt taken the opportunity of executing another astounding buckjump which landed him safe on his mans shoulders where he stuck like a scared cat on the back of a somnambulist so between us we brought our quarry to earth and gained no end of applause wasnt it prime thats about all the news here except that willoughby is going to trinity at midsummer and that salter is laid up from the effects of an explosion of crackers in his trousers pockets ive taken a turn at reading hard which may astonish you the doctor told me if i really thought of some day arraying my manly form in a scarlet jacket and wearing a sword i ought to put it on with my mathematics which are not my forte you know so now im drawing circles and triangles at every available moment and my logarithm tables are thumbed almost to death dont imagine youre the only burner of midnight oil i had a letter from home today they were saying they hadnt seen you lately i hope youll go up when you can it would be a charity to the dear old folk besides they are very fond of youqueer taste hows the ticker give it a cuff from me for not reminding you to write the last two weeks the repeater goes on all serene it has already gained some notoriety as i was publicly requested before the whole fifth the other day to abstain from evoking its musical talents in the course of the latin prose lesson now i must shut up seriously old man dont overwork yourself and dont bother to write unless youve time but you know how welcome your letters are to your affectionate chum cn of course tom sat down and answered this letter at once much reproaching himself for his past neglect with the vision of charlie before his eyes and with the sound of his voice again in his ears all his old resolutions and impulses returned that morning he worked hard and flung the trashy novel over which he had been wasting his time the day before into the fire he went off to lectures with something like his old eagerness and discharged his duties in the wards with interest and thoroughness he refused to allow his mind to be distracted by the proceedings of his fellowstudents and he resolved to spend that very evening at mr newcomes tom drift would probably have laughed at the idea that this sudden change was due entirely to charlies letter to him it seemed like a spontaneous reassertion of its natural self by his mind and a matter for such selfcongratulation and satisfaction that it at once covered the multitude of past omissions indeed tom felt very virtuous as he returned that afternoon to his lodgings and so felt no need to look away from self to him who alone can keep us from falling he read charlies letter over again and smiled at the idea of his getting up mathematics in his spare time hes not the sort of fellow to stick to work of that sort said tom to himself secretly comparing his own remarkable powers of application with those of his randlebury friend then he sat down and more than ever admiring and wondering at his own greediness for hard work read till it was time to start for mr newcomes it was a good long way but being a fine evening tom determined to walk he felt that after his work the fresh air would do him good and besides as he was in plenty of time he could indulge himself in that very cheap and harmless luxury an inspection of the shop windows as he went along he therefore selected a longer and more crowded route than perhaps he need have done and certainly as far as the shops went was rewarded for his pains however tom seemed to me to have as much interest in watching the people who passed to and fro as in the shops he amused himself by wondering where this one was going and what that one was doing with his usual tendency he chose to imagine they were all bent on mischief or folly and because they happened to be in a certain street and because in that street he had frequently heard some of his fellow students speak of a low theatre he jumped to the conclusion that every one he saw was bound for this place something impelled him to go himself and take an exterior survey of this mysterious and muchspoken of building he found it and as he expected he found people thronging in though not in the numbers he had anticipated he stood and watched them for some time and wondered what they were going to see he went up and read the playbill he read the name of the play the titles of its acts and the names of its actors he wondered if the man who just then drove up in a hansom was one of the heroes of the piece or whether he was one of the performers in the farce announced to follow the play still the people streamed in there was no one he knew and no one knew him strange thought he there are so many places in london where one could go and no one ever know it he wished he could see what the place was like inside it must surely be crowded by this time thus he dawdled for some time then with a sigh and an effort he tore himself away and walked quickly on to the newcomes house their welcome was most cordial we were afraid said mr newcome you had quite deserted us come in it is pleasant to see you we had a letter from charlie only to day telling us to see you did not overwork yourself and to make you come up here whether you would or not of course we could hardly follow such instructions literally tom spent a pleasant evening with the two good people he always had found mr newcome a clever and very entertaining mana man whom one feels all the better for talking to and who naturally sets every guest in his house at ease they talked much about charlie and his prospects they even consulted tom as to the wisdom of yielding to the boys desire for a military career and tom strongly supported the idea then toms own prospects were canvassed and highly approved of by both mr and mrs newcome tom already pictured himself settled down in his country practice enjoying himself doing good to others and laying by a comfortable competency for future years on the whole he felt as he quitted the hospitable roof of his genial friends that he had rarely spent a more pleasant or profitable evening people were thronging out of the theatre as he returned and he could not resist the desire to stand and watch them for a little he wondered what they had seen and whether those he saw had waited for the farce or was that still going onand he wondered if any people ever went into a theatre at so late an hour as eleven ah tom he did not go in that night or the next but he was getting himself ready for the first step reader do not mistake toms weakness and folly he was not trying to persuade himself this place was a good one for him to enter he was not thoughtlessly going in to discover too late that he had better have stayed out no tomrightly or wronglyhad made up his own mind that this theatre was a bad place and yet he had a desire to enter in chapter twelve how tom drift begins to go downhill time went on and tom drift advanced inch by inch nearer the brink he slipped not without many an effort to recover himself many a pang of selfreproach many a vague hope of deliverance be good to tom drift was ever ringing in my ears but what could i do he often neglected me for days all i could do was to watch and tremble for what was coming you who are so ready to call tom a fool and hug yourselves that you have more strength of character and resolution than he had try to realise what were his perils and what were his temptations at that time before you pass judgment the dulness of those lodgings in grime street was often almost unbearable when his work was done and tom looked out of the window and saw nothing but carts and cabs and tradesmen and the dismal houses opposite what wonder if he sometimes felt miserable when he heard nothing but pattering footsteps down the pavement the rumble of wheels and the street cries under his window what wonder if he felt lonely and friendless no footsteps stopped at his door no friendly face lightened his dull study no cheery laughter brought music to his life what wonder i say if he moped and felt discontented what wonder if his thoughts wandered to scenes and places that contrasted forcibly with his deadalive occupation what wonder if he hankered after a little excitement to break the monotony of lectures hard reading and stupid evenings ah i hear you say there are plenty of things he might have done it was his own fault if he was dull in london i would have gone to the museums the libraries the concerts the parks the river the picture galleries and other harmless and delightful places of amusement why i could not be dull in london if i tried tom drift was an idiot my dear friend what a pity tom drift had not the advantage of your acquaintance when he was in london but he had not he had no friends as i have said except the newcomes whom he only visited occasionally and as a matter chiefly of duty and his anxiety to keep right at first had led him to reject and fight shy of friendships with his fellow students doubtless it was his own fault to a large extent that he allowed himself to get into this dull dissatisfied condition if he had had a healthy mind like you friend it would not have happened but instead of utterly scouting him as an idiot rather thank god you have been spared all his weaknesses and all his temptations was tom never to learn that there was a waythe way the truth and the lifebetter than any he had yet tried which would lead him straight through the tangled mazes of his london life was he never to discover that friend truer than all earthly friends at whose side he might brave each trial and overcome each temptation poor tom he walked in a way of his own and trusted in no one better than himself and that was why he fell as i have said he did not fall without an effort i have known him one day buy a bad trashy book and the same evening in a fit of repentancefor gods spirit wonderfully strives with mentake and burn it to ashes in his grate but i have also known him to buy the same book again the next day i have known him to walk a mile out of his way to avoid a place of temptation and yet before his walk was done find himself after all under the glare of its lamps the moth hovers in wide circles round the candle before it ventures its wings in the flame and so it was with tom but the catastrophe came at last one evening about three weeks before the time fixed for the easter trip with charlie tom felt in tolerably dull he had been neglecting his work during several days for novels of the lowest and most sensational type over these he had dawdled till his brain had become muddled with their unreal incidents and impure suggestions and now that they were done he felt fit for nothing he could not settle down to work he had no friends to turn to and so he put his hat on his head and sallied out into the streets to seek there the variety he could not find indoors as usual his steps led him to the low theatre about which he was so curious and of which he heard so much from his fellowstudents it was halfpast seven and people were beginning to crowd round the door waiting for it to open tom standing on the other side of the pavement watched them with a painful fascination shall i go for once he asked himself then he strolled up to the playbill and read it as he was doing so some one slapped him on the shoulder and turning quickly round he found himself face to face with his old acquaintance gus burke and another youth gus who was still small of stature though fully nineteen years of age was arrayed in the height of the fashion as tom regarded him he felt his own coat become more shabby and his hat older and he wished he had brought his dogskin gloves and cane gus was smoking too a cigarette and very distinguished and gentlemanly tom thought it looked he felt as he regarded his brilliant and unexpected acquaintance that he was rather glad those people who were standing at the theatre door should see him accosted in so familiar a way by such a hero and guss friend was no less imposingmore so indeed for he wore an eyeglass tom was so astonished at this unexpected meeting that he had noticed all this long before he found words to return his old schoolfellows salutation gus however relieved him of his embarrassment tom drift upon my honour how are you old horse and hows your mother whod have thought of running up against you like this tom tried to look as much at his ease as he could as he replied why gus old man where did you spring from i didnt know you were in london aint i though replied gus tapping the end of his cigarette on his cane but what are you up to tomyoure not going in here are you pointing over his shoulder to the theatre well no said tom that is added he with as much of a swagger as he could assume on the spur of the moment i had been half thinking of just seeing what it was like some of our fellows you know fancy the place how suddenly and easily he was under the eyes of these two swells casting off the few slender cords that still held him moored to the shore oh dont go in there said gus with a look of disgust its the slowest place in londonnothing on but that old fool shakespeares plays or somebodys equally stupid you come along with us tom well take you to a place where youll get your moneys worth and no mistake wont we jack the youth appealed to as jack answered with a most affected drawl and with an effort which appeared to cause him no little fatigue wathah come along said gus lighting a fresh cigarette tom was uncomfortable he would not for worlds seem unwilling to go and yet he wished he could get out of it somehow very kind of you he said id like it awfully but i must get back to do some work you know ive an exam coming on its an awful nuisance why i thought you were going in here in any case said gus ahwellyes so i was just for a little to see what sort of affair it was but i meant to be home by nine well just have a squint in at our place and if you must go you must come along old man cut work for one evening cant you youve become an awfully reformed character all of a sudden you usent to be so hot on your books tom had no ambition before these two to figure in the light of a reformed character and he therefore abandoned further protest and proceeded to accompany gus and his friend down the street have a weed asked gus thanks i hardly ever smoke said tom theyre very mild said gus with a sneer tom took the proffered cigar without another word and did his best first to light and then to smoke it as if he were an experienced smoker whos your fwend inquired guss languid acquaintance by the way said that young man ive never introduced you two mortimer allow me to introduce you to my friend tom drift mr mortimer gave a nod which tom felt he would like greatly to have at his command there was something so very knowing and familiar about it it was tom got up that little race party i was telling you of jack you know hes a regular sporting card by the way whats become of that little mooneyface prig we took with us that day eh tom tom was out in midstream now floating fast out to sea whooh young newcome said he hes still at randlebury young puppy you never knew such a spree as that was jack said gus and then he launched forth into a highlyspiced account of the eventful expedition to gurley races contriving to represent tom as the hero of the day greatly to that youths discomfort and confusion and no less to the amusement of mr mortimer here we are at last said gus as the trio arrived at a gorgeously illuminated and decorated restaurant toms heart sunk within him more than ever did he wish himself back in his dull lodgings never again to set foot abroad if only he could have got out of this fix but there was no drawing back shall we go in yet or knock the balls about for a bit said gus this fellow toms a regular swell at billiards do you remember thrashing me last time we met tomthe summer after id left randlebury tom could not deny he had beaten gus on the occasion referred to and felt it was useless for him to protestwhat was the casethat he was only a very indifferent player he agreed to the idea of a game however as he hoped he might at its close be able to make his escape without accompanying his two companions to the musichall attached to the restaurant and which he already knew by reputation as one of the lowest entertainments in london you two play said gus and ill mark youll have to give jack points tom you know youre such a dab it was vain for tom to disclaim the distinction and the game began hold hard said gus after the first stroke what are you playing for weally i dont know thillingth i thuppothe lisped mr mortimer all serene go on and they went on and mr mortimer made no end of misses so that in spite of the points he had received tom beat him easily in the two games which followed the same success attended him and he won all the stakes didnt i tell you he was a swell said gus upon my word tom i dont know how you do it its just the sort of table i like to play on said tom elated with his success and unwilling to own that half his lucky shots had been flukes i tell you what said gus you owe me my revenge you know from last time ill play you tomorrow for halfcrowns if youll give me the same points as you did to jack tom was fast nearing the breakers now he had nothing for it but to accept the challenge and the table was consequently engaged for the next evening i must be off now you fellows he said nonsense why you havent yet seen the fun below you must stay for that i wish i could faltered tom but i really must do some reading to night so you can the thing only lasts an hour and youre not obliged to go to bed at eleven are you still tom hesitated you dont mean to say you are squeamish about it said gus in astonishment i could fancy that young friend of your mothers turning up his eyes at it but a fellow like you wouldnt be so particular i reckon eh jack and mr john mortimer thus appealed to laughed an amused laugh at the bare notion that laugh and the term a fellow like you destroyed the last of toms wavering objections and he yielded chapter thirteen how tom drift still going downhill met my old master when tom reached his lodgings that night he found a jubilant letter from charlie awaiting him just fancy he said its only three weeks more old man and then to jericho with books and testtubes and anatomy ill drag you out of your study by the scruff of your neck see if i dont ill clap a knapsack on your back and haul you by sheer force down into kent there you shall snuff the ozone and hold your hat on your head with both hands on the cliff top ill hound you through old castles and worry you up hills if i catch so much as a leaflet on chemistry in your hands ill tear it up and send it flying after the seagulls in short i shouldnt like to say what i wont do im so wild at the prospect of a week with you of course the dear old people growl at me for leaving them in the lurch but they are glad for us to get the blow indeed my pater insists on paying the piper which is handsome of him i expect i shall get a day in london on my way either going or returning and if you can put me up at your diggings for the night well have a jolly evening and you can show me all your haunts tom gasped as he got so far and well he might ill tell you all the news when i come i suppose by your not writing you are saving yours up for me ta ta old boy and au revoir in twentyone days hurrah yours evercn tom in his misery crushed the letter up in his fingers and flung it from him if a passing pang shot through his breast it was followed almost instantly by other feelings of vexation and shame one moment he was ready to sink to the floor in a passion of penitence and remorse the next he was ready to resent charlies influence over him even at a distance and to sneer as gus and his friend had done at the boys expense his brain was too muddled with the excitement and the strange emotions of that evening to reason with himself his head ached and his mind was poisoned what right has the fellow always to be following me up in this way he asked im a fool to stand it why cant i do as i choose without his pulling a long face thus tom questioned and thus he proved that it was charlies influence more than his letter that worried him for what had the latter said either in the way of exhortation or reproof then he threw himself on the bed and lay with the wild memory of the evening crowding on his feverish mind he rose and lighting a candle endeavoured to read but even his novel was flat and stupid and in the midst of it he fell asleep to dream of gus and his friend all night long long ere he awoke my senses had left me for he had neglected to wind me up next morning he went to lectures as usual to his fellow students he appeared the same shy quiet youth he had always seemed to mr newcome whom he met in the street he appeared still as charlies chosen and dear friend ready for his holiday and rejoicing in the prospect of the coming meeting to his professors he appeared still the same steady hardworking student bent on making his way in his profession but to himself alas how altered how degraded he appeared in the midst of his duties his thoughts ran continuallynow back to the strange experience of last evening now forward to the doubtful events of this the recollection of the past had lost a good deal of its repulsiveness after twelve hours interval and although he still felt it to be low and harmful he yet secretly encouraged his curiosity to revisit the place of his temptation after all it did me no harm said he to himself its not interfered with my work or made me feel worse than before what harm in going again tonight when charlie comes and we get away from town i shall easily be able to break it off and besides charlies sure to help to put me square he always does yes i think ill just go and see whats on there tonight it cant be worse than it was besides thought he glad to seize on any straw of excuse im bound in honour to play gus a return match it would be ungentlemanly to back out of that but why sicken you dear reader and myself with recapitulating the sad workings of this poor fellows mind the more he tried to convince himself he was doing only a slight wrong the more his conscience cried out he was running to his ruin but he stopped his ears and shut his eyes and blindly dared his fate he went that evening to the music hall he met gus and mortimer and two other friends he had taken care to get himself up in a nearer approach to his companions style he bought some cigars of his own on the way and offered them with a less awkward swagger than he had been able to assume the night before he found himself able to nod familiarly to the barmaid and fancied that even mortimer must have approved of the way in which he ordered about the billiardmarker in the match with gus for halfcrowns he lost though only narrowlyso narrowly that he was not content without a further trial of skill to own himself beaten and therefore challenged his adversary to a second meeting the next evening then he watched the others play and betted with mortimer on the resultand alas for him he won it was tom himself who said at nine oclock and now suppose we see whats going on below it was the same stupid disgusting spectacle but to tom it seemed less repulsive than he had found it the night before true he at times felt a return of the old feeling of shame the blush would occasionally suffuse his face but such fits were rare and he was able to carry them off more easily with joke and laughter jack said gus in a whisper to mortimer as tom after accepting a very broad hint to treat the party to spirits was turning to go that fellow will be a credit to you and me did you see how he smacked his lips over the play and yet all the while wanted to make us think he saw that sort of thing every day of his life eh hes a promising chap eh jack wathah replied jack laughing meanwhile tom glad enough to get out into the pure air though in not so desperate a case as the night before shouldered his way among the loitering company towards the door he was just emerging into the street when the sound of voices arrested him thats one of our men isnt it said one why so it is i fancied he was anything but a festive blade yes and upon my word hes half seas over tom had no difficulty in discovering that these hurried words had reference to him and turning instinctively towards the voices he found himself face to face with two reputedly of the wildest of his fellow students gladly would he have avoided them gladly would he have shrunk back and lost himself in the crowd but it was too late now he stood discovered how are you cried one of the two as he passed isnt your name drift tom stared as if he would have denied his name but the next moment he put on his lately acquired swagger and said yes ah i thought so one of the saint elizabeth men hullo hes in a hurry though added he as tom made a dive forward and strode rapidly down the street it was but a step deeper well he knew that by tomorrow every one of his fellowstudents would know of him as a frequenter of that wretched place well he knew that as far as they were concerned the mask of shyness and reticence under which he had sheltered in their midst was for ever pulled away one of us indeed so truly the very worst of them might now speak and think of him oh if he had but considered in time if he had but stemmed this flood at its source but it was too late now and he strode home reckless and hardened the next day as he expected every one seemed to know of his visits to the musichall the two who had seen him accosted him with every show of friendship and intelligence he was appealed to in the presence of nearly a dozen of his fellowstudents as to the name of one of the low songs there given he was asked if he was going to be there tonight and he was invited to join this party and that in similar expeditions to similar places and to all these questions and greetings he was constrained to reply in keeping with his assumed character of a gay spark how sick how vile he felt yet in that one day how hardened and desperate he became it was not in tom drift to cry i have sinned i will return no once loose from his moorings he let himself float down the stream watching the receding banks in mute despair raising no shout for succour venturing no plunge for safety you who by this time have given him up disgusted at his weakness his vanity his low instincts his cowardlinesswho say let him wallow in the mire he has prepared for himself who know so glibly what you would have done what you would have said what you would have felt remember once more that tom drift was not such as you and unfortunately did not know you he was not gifted with your heroic resolution or your all penetrating wisdom he was an ordinary sinful being of flesh and blood relying only on his own poor strength and therefore reader try to realise all he went through before you fling your stone the toils were closing round him fast his will had been the first to suffer his conscience next then with a rush had gone honour temperance and purity and now finally the flimsy rag his good name had been torn from him and he stood revealed a prodigaland a hypocrite even yet however help might have been forthcoming i say you fellow said one of his fellowstudents this same day ive never spoken to you before and perhaps shall never do so again but dont be a fool what do you mean said tom sharply only this and i cant help it if you are angry keep clear of these new friends of yours and still more keep clear of the places they visit if youve been led in once rather cut off your right hand than be led in again thats all what spirit of infatuation possessed tom drift that he did not spring for very life at the proffered help that he did not besiege this friend however blunt and outspoken and compel his timely aid alas for his blindness and folly scowling round at the speaker he muttered an oath and said what on earth concern is it of yours who my friends are and where i go mind your own business and so thrusting rudely away the hand that might by gods grace have saved him he swept farther and farther out towards the dark waters one final and great hope was still reserved for him and that was charlies visit but to tom that prospect was becoming day by day mere distasteful as the days wore on and tom sunk deeper and deeper into the snare prepared for him the thought of a week in the society of one so upright and pure as charlie became positively odious the effort to conceal his new condition would be almost impossible and yet to admit it to him would be he felt to shatter for ever the only friendship he really prized he racked his brain for expedients and excuses to avert the visit but without avail if he pleaded illness charlie would be the first to rush to his bedside if he pleaded hard work charlie would insist on sharing it or improving its few intervals of rest if he pleaded disinclination charlie would devise a hundred other plans to please him in short charlies visit was inevitable and as he looked forward to it he writhed in misgiving and anxiety his visits to the musichall were meanwhile continuing and his circle of acquaintance at that evil haunt enlarging he was duly installed as one of the fast set at saint elizabeths and under its auspices had already made his debut at other scenes and places than that of his first transgression he was known by sight to a score of billiard markers potmen blacklegs and lower characters still and was on nodding terms with fully half of them he had lost considerably more than he had gained at billiards and was still further emptying his purse at cards quick work for a few weeks so quickly and fatally alas will the infection once admitted spread especially in a patient whose moral constitution has undergone so long a course of slow preparation as toms had the day came at last tom had carefully hidden away his worst books and his spirits he had bathed his face half a dozen times to remove the traces of last nights intemperance he had gathered together from the corners where they had for so long lain neglected the books and relics of his randlebury days and restored them to their old places he had brightened me up and he had taken pains to purify his room from the smell of rank tobacco and then he sauntered down to the station how my heart beat as the train came into the platform his head was out of the window and his hand was waving to us a hundred yards off and the next minute he had burst from the carriage and seized tom by the hands how are you old tom i thought wed never get here how glad i am to set eyes on you isnt this a spree and not waiting for toms answer he hauled his traps out of the carriage in a transport of delight still the same jovial honest finehearted boy hi here some of you he shouted to a porter look after these things will you and get us a cab i tell you what tom youve got to come up home with me first and we can have dinner there then ill come on to your den and we can pack our knapsacks and sleep and then start by the five train tomorrow morning thus he bustled and thus he brought back the old times on poor tom drift without the heart to speak he helped his friend to collect his luggage and when they were fairly started in the cab he even smiled feebly in reply to the boys sallies tom you rascal didnt i tell you you werent to knock yourself up eh why cant you do what youre told why i declare youre as thin as a hurdle and as black under the eyes as if you had been fighting with a collier you ought to be ashamed of yourself look at me do all i can i cant get up an interesting pallor like you and ive fretted enough over those conic sections comic sections jim always calls them never mind wait till i get you down to the sea and so he rattled on while tom leaned back in his seat and winced at every word when they reached mr newcomes of course there was a scene of eager welcome on one side and boisterous glee on the other tom as he looked on sighed as well he might and wished he could have been spared the torture of this day charlie tore himself away from his mother to drag his friend into the house look at this object he cried did you ever see such a caution to students if we do nothing else in kent we shall scare the crows eh tom charlie exclaimed his mother you have come home quite rude i hope youll excuse him mr drift mr drift said nothing and looked and felt extremely miserable he looks really ill poor fellow said mrs newcome to her husband i wonder they allow the students to overwork themselves in that way and then they sat down to dinnera meal as distasteful to tom as it was joyful to charlie and his parents chapter fourteen how tom drift parted with his best friend charlie could not fail to discover before long that there was something wrong with my master never before had he known him so silent so spiritless so mysterious no effort could rouse him into cheerfulness or conversation and for the first time for three years charlie felt that tom was sorry to see him naturally he put it all down to the results of overwork tom in his letters had always represented himself as engrossed in study even the few hurried scrawls of the past few weeks he had excused on the same ground it never once occurred to the simpleminded schoolboy that a chum of his could possibly be struggling in the agonies of shame and temptation and he know nothing of it he who knew so little of evil himself was not the one to think or imagine evil where any other explanation was possible and yet toms manner was so strange and altered that he determined as soon as they should find themselves alone to make an effort to ascertain its cause the opportunity came when the two youths having bid farewell to mr and mrs newcome found themselves at last in toms lodgings in grime street well said charlie with all the show of cheerfulness he could muster for his spirits had been strangely damped by the irresponsive gloom of his old schoolfellowwell heres the den at last upon my word old man ive seen livelier holes why dont you explore and find some place a trifle less deadalive but i dare say its convenient to be near the hospital and when a fellows working it doesnt much matter what sort of a place hes in as long as theres not a row going on under his windowand i dont suppose theres much chance of that here said charlie looking out into the black street with a kind of shudder tom said nothing he wished his friend would not everlastingly be talking of hard work and study in the way he did however charlie intended it it was neither more nor less than a talking at him and that he could not stand charlie took no notice of his silence but continued his inspection of the dismal apartment lighting up with pleasure at the sight of the old randlebury relics my old rod exclaimed he taking down the very rod with the lancewood top which had figured so conspicuously in a certain adventure three years ago how jolly to see it again im afraid you dont get much use for it here and our fencingsticks too see tom heres the very place where you got under my guard and snipped a bit out of the basket ha ha what a crack that was and heres the picture of old randlebury with you at your window and me lying on the grass and looking uncommonly like a recently felled tree look here tom this window here is where jim and i hang out now it used to be callaghans by the way do you ever see call hes in london articled to a solicitor a pretty lawyer hell make have you seen him yet tom tom during this rattle had been looking listlessly out of the window he now turned round with a start and said eh what did you say the look which accompanied the words was so haggard and miserable that charlies pity was instantly touched he stepped across the room and put his arm in toms as he stood and said tom old boy whats wrong tom said nothing but walked away and leaned against the mantelpiece what is it tom are you ill or in trouble youll tell me wont you tom still remained silent but his flushing face and restless lips showed that the appeal had at least been heard old boy continued charlie venturing again nearer we never used to have secrets im sure somethings the matter maynt i know what it is very likely i cant help you but i could try toms lips quivered the old influence was fast coming back already in his mind he was picturing himself telling charlie all and with his help extricating himself from the slough into which he had sunk how could he stand unmoved with that voice familiar by many a memory of simple courageous goodness again falling on his ear and that appealing face one so loved and delighted in again turned to his im afraid its something more than ill health old boy youve something on your mind oh why wont you at least tell me what it is tom could stand it no longer he must speak whatever the confession cost him whatever its effect would be on his old schoolfellows friendship charlie must know all to him at least he could not play the hypocrite or the deceiver he had turned from the mantelpiece his hand was held out to take that of his friends he was just about to speak when the door of his room opened and there entered gus mortimer and two companions here he is cried gus not noticing that tom had company tommy old man youre in luck old owl has got a supper on tonight no end of punch my boy and hes expecting you and afterwards were going for a regular night of it to the hullo whos your friend he caught sight of charlie at this moment and for an instant failed to recognise in toms companion the boy whom he had treated so shamefully at gurley races but he remembered him in a moment what surelyyet upon my honour so it is our young sporting friend how are you charlie my boy heres a game youll come too of course mortimer this fellow is drifts specialup to all the wrinkles no end of a knowing blade during this brief and rapid salutation tom and charlie i need hardly say were speechless one in utter despair the other in utter rage and astonishment in both the revulsion of feeling caused by the interruption was almost stupefying and they stood for a moment staring at the intruders in simple bewilderment tom was the first to find words his cheeks were white and his voice almost choked as he said to gus i wish youd go im engaged so you are said gus with a sneer but i say tom old man i wish youd come its too good a thing to miss go away almost gasped tom oh of course an englishmans house is his castle said gus offended at this unusual rebuff youre a fool though thats all we were going to have a spree tonight that would make all sprees of the past month look foolish come along dont be an ass and bring young mooneyface i dare say by this time he knows whats what as well as you or me tom eh jack lookth tho replied the amused jack by this time charlie had found words the truth of course had all flashed in upon him he knew the secret now of toms strange manner of the neglected letters of the haggard looks of the reluctant welcome and he knew too that but for this untimely incursion he would have heard it all from tom himself penitent and humble instead of as now hardened and desperate and he recognised in the miserable little swaggering dandy before him the author and the promoter of his friends ruin on him therefore his sudden rage expended itself you little cowardly wretch he exclaimed addressing gus havent you done mischief enough to tom already go out of his room poor charlie nothing could have been more fatal to his hopes than this rash outbreak the words had scarcely escaped his lips before he saw the mischief he had done toms manner suddenly altered all signs of shame and penitence disappeared as he stepped with a swagger up to charlie and exclaimed what business have you to attack my friends get out yourself bravo tom old man cried the delighted gus do you hear young prig walk off youre not wanted here charlie stood for one moment stunned and irresolute had there been in toms face the faintest glimmer of regret or the faintest trace of the old affection he would have stayed and braved all consequences but there was neither the spell that bound tom drift his fear of being thought a milksop had changed him utterly and as charlies eyes turned with pleading look to his they met only with menace and confusion go repeated tom driven nearly wild by the mocking laugh in which mortimer and his two companions joined this then was the end of their friendshipso full of hope on one side so full of promise on the other it was a strange moment in the lives of those two to one it was the wilful throwing away of the last and best chance of deliverance to the other it was the cruel extinction of a love and trust that had till now bid fair to stand the wear of years to come get out i say said tom drift once more goaded to madness by the pitying sneers of mortimer charlie stayed no longer half stunned and scarcely knowing what he did with one wild mute prayer at his heart he turned without a word and left the room toms friends followed his departure with mocking laughter and watched his slowly retreating figure down the street with many a foul jest and then returned to congratulate tom drift on his deliverance well said gus you are well rid of him at any rate what a lucky thing we turned up just when we did hed have snivelled you into a shocking condition why what a weakminded fellow tom is aint he jack wathah replied jack with a laugh meanwhile tom had abandoned even himself he hated his friends he hated himself he hated charlie and cursed himself for having ever allowed him within his doors he took no notice of guss gibes for a long time at last ugh said he never mind if im weakminded or not im sick of all this suppose we go off to the supper and ill stand treat afterwards at the musichall and crushing his hat on his head he dashed out of the house utterly reckless and desperate need i say my thoughts were with the poor injured boy who stung with ingratitude robbed of his friend and ill with mingled pity dread and sorrow walked slowly down the street away from toms lodgings ah when should i see his face or hear his voice again now at the supper that evening tom drank often and deeply and of all the party his shout rose highest and his laugh drowned all the others they led him staggering away among them and brought him to their vile resort even his companions wondered at his reckless demeanour and expostulated with him on his extravagant wildness he laughed them to scorn and called for more drink after a while they rose to depart leaving him where he was noisy and helpless how long he remained so i cannot say for suddenly and most unexpectedly i found myself called upon to enter upon a new stage in my career as my master leaned back hopelessly tipsy in his seat a hand quietly and swiftly slipped under his coat and drew me from my pocket as swiftly the chain was detached from its buttonhole and the next thing i was conscious of was being thrust into a strange pocket belonging to some one who was quitting the hall as fast as his legs would carry him chapter fifteen how i found myself in very low company my capturer was a boy and as remarkable a specimen of a boy as it has ever been my lot to meet during the whole of my career his age was say fourteen he stood four feet one in his slipshod boots the hat which adorned his head was an old white billycock which in its palmy days might have adorned noble brows so fashionable were its pretensions now alas it had one side caved in and the other was green with wear and weather the coat which arrayed his manly form was evidently one not made recently or to wearers measure for besides showing cracks and rents in various parts its tails were so extravagantly long for its small occupant that they literally almost touched the ground his nether garments on the other hand although they resembled the coat in their conveniences for ventilation being all in rags and tatters appeared to have been borrowed from a smaller pair of legs even than those owned by my present possessor for theyat least one legbarely reached half way below the knee while the other stopped short very little lower altogether the boy was as nondescript and scarecrowy an object as one could well expect to meet with as he left the hall he gave a quick look round to assure himself no one was following him then he darted across the road and proceeded to shuffle forward in so extremely leisurely and casual a way that very few of the people who met him would have imagined he carried a stolen watch in his pocket such a hole as it was as soon as i had sufficiently recovered from my astonishment to look about me i became aware that i was by no means the sole occupant of the receptacle he was pleased to designate by the title of a pocket but which other people would have called a slit in the lining of his one sound coattail there was a stump of a clay pipe with tobacco still hot in it there was a greasy piece of string a crust of bread a halfpenny a few brass buttons and a very greasy and very crumpled and very filthy copy of a penny awful paper i need hardly say that this scrutiny did not afford me absolute pleasure in the first place my temporary lodging was most unsavoury and unclean and in the second place there was not one among my many fellowlodgers who could be said to be in my position in life or to whom i felt in any way tempted to address any inquiry this difficulty however was settled for me a voice close beside me said in a hoarse whisper what cheer turnip how do you like it i looked round and perceived that the speaker was the clay pipe who happened to be close beside me as i lay i held my noseso to speak for watches are not supposed to be gifted with that organthe tobacco which was smouldering in him must have been a month old while the pipe itself looked remarkably grimy and dirty however thought i there would be no use in being uncivil to my new comrades unpleasant though they were and i might as well make use of this pipe to assist me to certain information i was curious to get so i answered i dont like it at all can you tell me where i am where are you turnip why youre in young cadgers pocket to be sure but you wont stay there long no error i secretly wished this objectionable pipe would not insist on addressing me as turnip but on the whole the present did not seem exactly the time to stand on my dignity so i replied why whats going to become of me whats going to become of you turnip why youll go to cadgers uncle wont he mate the mate addressed was the piece of string who i should say was by no means the latest addition to the cadgers collection of valuables he now grinned and wriggled in reply to the pipes appeal and snuffled thats right mate thats where hell go do you hear turnip thats where youll goto cadgers uncle it occurred to me that cadgers uncle would have to be vastly more respectable and fragrant than his nephew to make the change at all advantageous to me is young cadger a thief i next inquired the pipe laughed why what a funny chap you are turnip it said does it look like it cadger a thiefoh my eye not at all eh mate the greasy string took up the laugh and snivelled in chorus ho ho aint he a funny chap do you hear turnip aint you a funny chap oh my eye not at all it was disgusting not only was i cooped up in an abominably filthy tailcoat pocket with a motley rabble of disreputable associates but every time i opened my lips here i was insulted and laughed at for every word i spoke however i gathered that the purport of the reply to my last inquiry was that the young cadger was a thief and i made one more attempt to gain information where are we going to now i asked going cried the pipe with his insulting jeer what dont you know where youre agoing old turnip youre agoing wherever he takes yer aint he mate it was positively painful to see how that vile piece of string wriggled as he replied do you hear turnip youre agoing wherever young cadger takes yer now what do you think of that it was impossible to continue a conversation with such low illmannered creatures and i therefore abandoned the attempt having at least ascertained that i was at present located in a thiefs pocket that my immediate destination was vague and that ultimately i might expect to become the property of a near relative of my present possessor noticing that i became silent the pipe and the string between them began to question me but i was neither in the mood nor the desire to gratify their curiosity they therefore contented themselves with cracking jokes at my expense and thus we journeyed together a mile or two towards our unknown destination presently a dirty little hand came groping down into our place of retreat it first fumbled me and my chain with a view i suppose to ascertain if we were all safe and then proceeded among the other occupants of the pocket to secure and draw forth the half penny which i have before mentioned i was relieved to have even one of my unpleasant companions removed and could not refrain from expressing my feelings by a sigh what are you snivelling at turnip asked the pipe i did not deign to reply suppose yer think that there sou fancy the stump of a clay pipe speaking french is gone for good and good riddance do yer you wait a bit thats all boh boh chimed in the string do you hear turnip wait till you see the soldier then see how youll laugh what soldier i inquired my curiosity for a moment getting the better of my reserve i could not imagine what possible connexion there could be between the military and the disreputable copper i had so lately seen depart i was not long in suspense however for before my two vulgar companions could answer my question the soldier made his appearance the dirty little hand again entered our quarters and let fall in our midst a red herring at the sight and smell of him i turned sick with disgust fancy a silver watch sat upon squeezed and besmeared by a reeking red herring he came sprawling right on the top of me the brute his ugly mouth wide open and his loathsome fins scraping along my back ugh that theres the soldier turnip aint it mate called out the pipe do you hear turnip this heres the soldier how do you like him snuffled the string it was enough i felt my nerves collapse and my circulation fail and for the remainder of that dreadful night i was speechless i was not however blind or so far gone as to be unable to notice in a vague sort of way what happened the young gentleman rejoicing in the name of cadger but whose real cognomen i subsequently ascertained to be stumpy walker proceeded on his walk whistling shrilly to himself exchanging a passing recognition with one and another loafer and going out of his way to kick every boy he saw smaller than himself which last exertion by the way at twelve oclock at night he did not find very often necessary i observed that he did not go out of his way to avoid the police on the contrary he made a point of touching his hat to every guardian of the peace he happened to meet and actually went so far as to inform one that hed want his muckintogs before morninga poetical way of prophesying rain he proceeded down a succession of back streets which it would have puzzled a stranger to remember till he came into a large deserted thoroughfare which was undergoing a complete renovation of its drainage arrangements all along the side of the road extended an array of huge new pipes some three feet in diameter awaiting their turn underground into one of these master walker dived and as it was just tall enough to allow of his sitting upright in its interior and just long enough to allow his small person to lie at full length without either extremity protruding and further as the rain was just beginning to come down i could not forbear even in the midst of my misery admiring his selection of a lodging greatly to my relief the soldier the crust and the pipe were all three presently summoned from the pocket and with the help of the first two and the consolation of the last master walker contrived to make an evening meal which at least afforded him satisfaction before making himself snug for the night he pulled me out and by the aid of the feeble light of a neighbouring lamppost made a hasty examination of my exterior and interior having apparently satisfied himself as to my value he put me and the pipe back into his dreadful pocket from which even yet the fumes of the soldier had not faded and then curled himself up like a dormouse and composed himself to slumber he had not however settled himself many moments before another ragged figure came crawling down the inside of the pipes towards him stumpy started up at the first sound in a scared sort of way but instantly resumed his composure on seeing who the intruder was what cheer stumpy said the latter what cheer tuppeny replied my master whereve yer been to lunnon bridge replied mr tuppeny an what ave yer got asked stumpy only a rag said the other in evident disgusts producing a white handkerchief that aint much ive boned a turnip jus your luck lets ave a look at him stumpy complied and his comrade lighting a match surveyed me with evident complacency jus your luck said he again where did yer git im at the gaff off a young cove as was reglar screwed up i could ave took is nose off if id a wanted it and he wouldnt have knowed then this ere rag might a been some use replied the disconsolate tuppeny taint worth threeapence any marks inquired my master yees there is so cn it is hup in one corner he was sticking out of the pocket of a young chap as was going along with a face as long as a fooneral and as miserablelookin as if ed swallowed a cat cn could this handkerchief possibly have belonged to poor charlie newcome his way home from grime street i knew would lead by london bridge and with the trouble of that afternoon upon him would he not indeed have looked as miserable as the thief described and these two boys having thus briefly compared notes and exhibited to one another their illgotten gains curled themselves up and fell fast asleep dear reader does it ever occur to your mind that there are hundreds of such vagrants in this great city night after night they crowd under railway arches and sheds on doorsteps and in cellars they have neither home nor friend to many of them the thieves life is their natural calling they live as animals live and hope only as animals hope and when they die die as animals die ignorant of god ignorant of good ignorant of their own souls yet even for such as they christ died and the spirit strives the pipe and his friend the string that night had a long conversation as their master lay asleep they evidently thought i was asleep too for they made no effort to conceal their voices and i consequently heard every word it chiefly had reference to me and was in the main satirical some coves is uncommon proud o themselves mate aint they particular them as aint much account after all youre right mate do you hear turnip you aint much account youre ony silverplate yer know so you dont ought to be proud you dont what i say continued the pipe is that coves as gives emselves hairs above their stations is a miserable lot what do you think what dont i snuffled the string do you hear turnip youre a miserable cove you are why cant you be appy like me and my mate we dont give ourselves hairs thats why were appy and arter all pursued the pipe thats the sort of coves as go secondhand in the end people ud think better on em if they didnt think such a lot of theirselves wouldnt they now mate wouldnt they just what do you think of that turnip youre ony a secondhand turnip now and thats all along of being stuckup and thinking such a lot of yourself you wont go off for thirty bob you wont see mate exclaimed the pipe presently after i had had leisure to meditate on the foregoing philosophical dialogue mate ill give you a riddle go it said the mate why asked the pipe in a solemn voice is a secondhand pewter plate stuckup turnip like a weskit that aint paid for do you hear turnip why are you like a weskit that aint paid for do yer give it up i do cos its on tick pronounced the pipe i could have howled to find myself the victim of such a low villainous joke that had not even the pretence of wit and i could have cried to see how that greasy string wriggled and snuffled at my expense my eye mate thats a good un do you hear turnip youre on tick you know like the weskit oh my eye thatll do mate another o them will kill me oh turn it up do you hear on tick hoo hoo hoo do you hear turnip tick need i say i spent a sad and sleepless night when my disgust admitted of thought i could not help reflecting how very happy some vulgar people can be with a very little sense and how very unhappy other people who flatter themselves they are very clever and superior can at times find themselves by the time i had satisfied myself of this my master uncurled himself and got up chapter sixteen how i changed masters twice in two days and after all found myself in pawn it was scarcely four oclock when my lord and master arose from his brief repose and sallied through the rain and darkness back in the direction of the city he was far less anxious to salute the police now than he had been a few hours ago he slunk down the back streets and now and then darted up a court at the sound of approaching foot steps or retreated for some distance by the way he had come in order to strike a less guarded street in this manner he pursued his way for about an hour till he reached a very narrow street of tumbledown houses not far from holborn down this he wended his way till he stood before a door belonging to one of the oldest dingiest and most decayed houses in all the street here he gave a peculiar scrape with his foot along the bottom of the door and then sat down on the doorstep presently a voice came through the keyhole in a whisper that you stumpy it said yas replied my master all clear stumpy looked up and down the street and then hurriedly whispered no instantly the voice within was silent and stumpy was to all appearance sleeping soundly and heavily as if tired nature in him had fairly reached its last strait the distant footsteps came nearer and still he slept on snoring gently and regularly the policeman advanced leisurely turning his lantern first on this doorway then on that window trying now a shutterbar then a lock at last he stood opposite the doorstep where stumpy lay it was a critical moment he turned his lamp full on the boys sleeping face he took hold of his arm and gently shook him he tried the bolt of the door against which he leaned the sleeper only grunted drowsily and settled down to still heavier slumber and the policeman evidently satisfied walked on is he gone asked the voice within the moment the retreating footsteps showed this yas but hell be back whispered the boy and so he was three times he paced the street and every time found the boy in the same position and wrapped in the same profound slumber then at last he strode slowly onward to the end of his beat and his footsteps died gradually away now inquired the voice yas replied stumpy whereat the door halfopened and stumpy entered it was a dirty halfruinous house in which the rats had grown tame and the spiders fat the stairs creaked dismally as stumpy followed his entertainer up them while the odours rising from every nook and cranny in the place were almost suffocating the man led the way into a small room foul and pestilential in its closeness in it lay on the floor no less than nine or ten sleeping figures mostly juveniles huddled together irrespective of decency health or comfort stumpy surveyed the scene composedly got lodgers then he observed yes two on emony penny ones though just then a sound of moaning came from one corner of the room which arrested stumpys attention whos that he asked old sal shes bad and i reckon she wont last much longer the way shes agoing on i shall pack her off today stumpy whistled softly but it was evident by the frequent glances he stole every now and then towards the corner where the sufferer lay that he possessed a certain amount of interest in the woman described as old sal the man who appeared to be the proprietor of this one wellfilled lodgingroom was middleaged and had a harelip he had an expression half careworn and half villainous of which he gave stumpy the full benefit as he inquired what ave yer got got pal replied stumpy a ticker hand it up said the man hurriedly stumpy produced me and the man taking me to the candle examined me greedily and minutely then he said i shall get fifteen bob for him come now none of your larks replied stumpy who had produced the pipe and was endeavouring to rekindle its few remaining embers at the candle try agin well i dont see as hell fetch seventeenandsix but ill do it for you try agin coolly replied stumpy the man did try again and named a sovereign which my master also declined in this manner he advanced to twentyfour shillings wont do said stumpy then you can take im off said the man with an oath he aint worth the money yas e is an a tanner more put in stumpy the man uttered a few more oaths and again examined me then he dropped me in his pocket and slowly counted out the purchasemoney from a drawer at his side stumpy watched the process eagerly doubtless calculating with professional interest how the entire hoard of this thieves broker could at some convenient opportunity be abstracted however for the present he made sure of the sum given him and dropped the coins one by one into his tail pocket now lay down said the man and make yourself comfortable i fancy stumpy was a good deal more comfortable in his drainpipe an hour or two ago than in this foul choking lodgingroom however he curled himself up on the floor near the dying woman and did his share in exhausting the air of the apartment i should offend all rules of good taste and decency if i described the loathsome room i wish i could forget it but that i shall never do suffice it to say daylight broke in at last on the squalid scene and then one by one the sleepers rose and departedall but stumpy and she whose groaning had risen ceaselessly and hopelessly the livelong night old sals very bad said stumpy to his host yas shell have to clear out of here shes nigh dying i reckon said the boy cant help that she aint paid a copper this three weeks and i aint agoing to have her lumbering up my place no longer wheres she agoing to asked stumpy how do i knowout of ere anyways and pretty soon too i can tell yer pal said the boy after a long pause i charged yer a tanner too much for that there ticker here you are lay hold and he tossed back the sixpence the man understood quite well the meaning of the act and old sal lay undisturbed all that day stumpy took his departure early i have never seen him since what has become of him i know not where he is now i know still less but to return to myself i spent that entire day in the mans pocket too ill to care what became of me and too weak to notice much of what passed around me i was conscious of others like stumpy coming up the creaking stairs and offering their illgotten gains as he had done and i was conscious towards evening when the last rays of the setting sun were struggling feebly through the dingy window of a groan in that dismal corner deeper than all that had gone before then i knew old sal was dead in an hour the body was laid in its rude coffin and had made its last journey down those stairs and that night another outcast slept in her corner the night was like the one which had preceded it foul and sickening i was thankful that my illness had sufficiently deadened my senses to render me unable to hear and see all that went on during those hours morning came at length and one by one the youthful lodgers took their departure when the last had left my possessor produced a bag into which he thrust me with a score or more of other articles acquired as i had been acquired then locking the door behind him he descended the stairs and stepped out oh the delight of that breath of fresh morning air even as it struggled in through the crevices and cracks of that old bag it was like a breath of paradise after the vile pestilential atmosphere of that room as we went on i had leisure to observe the company of which i formed one what a motley crew we were there were watches snuffboxes and pencils bracelets and brooches handkerchiefs and gloves studs pins and ringsall huddled together higgledypiggledy we none of us spoke to one another nor inquired whither we were going we were a sad spiritless assembly and to some of us it mattered little what became of us still i could not help wondering if the man in whose possession i and my fellowprisoners found ourselves was stumpys uncle referred to by that miserable clay pipe if he was i felt i could not candidly congratulate that youth on his relative what he could want with us all i could not imagine if i had been the only watch and if there hadnt been half a dozen scarfpins snuffboxes and pencils it would not have been so extraordinary it would have been easy enough to imagine the person of stumpys aunt decorated with one brooch two bracelets and three or four rings but when instead of that modest allowance these articles were present by the halfdozen it was hardly possible to believe that any one lady could accommodate so much splendour how ever i could only suppose the superfluous treasures were destined for stumpys cousins masculine and feminine and occupied the rest of the journey in the harmless amusement of wondering to whose lot i was likely to fall the man walked some considerable distance and strangely enough bent his steps in a direction not far removed from saint elizabeths hospital surely he was not going to restore me to tom drift no we passed the end of grime street there were milkmens carts rattling up and down servants were scrubbing doorsteps and a few sleepylooking men with their breakfasts in their hands were scurrying off to work it was all the same as usual yet how interesting all of a sudden the dull street had become to me it was here i had last seen poor charlie outraged and struck by the friend he strove to save creeping slowly home it was here tom drift still dwelt daily sinking in folly and sin with no friend now left to help him poor tom drift how gladly would i have returned to him even to be neglected and illused if only i might have the opportunity once again of fulfilling that charge put upon me by my first master and which yet ever rang in my ears be good to tom drift but it was not to be yet the man walked rapidly on down a street parallel with grime street at the farthest corner of which stood a small private house here he knocked the occupant of the house evidently knew and expected him for he at once admitted him and led the way upstairs into a private parlour here the thieves broker emptied the contents of his bag laying the articles one by one on the table the man of the house looked on in an unconcerned way while this was taking place picking up now one now another of the objects and examining them superficially when the bag was empty and the whole of the illgotten booty displayed he remarked not so much this time bill no trades bad sir replied he who owned the bag well ill send the most of em down to the country today resumed the master of the house when shall i call sir inquired stumpys friend monday but look here bill said the other taking me up its no use leaving this i shall be able to manage the gold ones but this is no good i had long lost the pride which in former days would have made me resent such a remark and patiently waited for the result stumpys friend took me back well he said if you cant you cant ill see to him myself well goodday and ill call on monday and he turned to depart with me in his hand in a minute however he came back would yer mind lending me some togs sir for a few minutes said he i dont want no questions asked at the pawnshop and he certainly did not look in his present getup as the likeliest sort of owner of a silver watch the man of the house however lent him some clothes in which he arrayed himself and which so transformed him that any one would have taken him not for the disreputable thieves broker he was but for the unfortunate decayed gentleman he professed to be in this guise he had no difficulty in disposing of me at the nearest pawnbrokers shop which happened to be at the corner of grime street the pawnbroker asked no questions and i am sure never suspected anything wrong he advanced thirty shillings on me and the chain gave the man his ticket and put a corresponding one on me then stumpys friend departed and my new master went back to his breakfast chapter seventeen how tom drift gets lower still two years passed they were without exception the dullest two years i or i venture to say any watch made ever spent there i lay run down tarnished and neglected on the pawnbrokers shelf never moved never used never thought of week followed week and month month and still no claimant for me came other articles on the shelves beside me came and went some remaining only a day some a week but i survived them all even my friend the chain took his departure and left me without a soul to speak to none of the hundreds of tickets handed in bore the magic number which would have released me from my ignoble custody and in time i gave up expecting it and settled down to the oldfogeydom of my position and exacted all the homage due to the father of the shop from my restless companions my place was at the end of a long shelf next to the screen dividing the shop from the office and my sole amusement during those two dreary years was peeping through a crack and watching my masters customers they were of all sorts and all conditions and many of them became familiar there was the little girl for instance the top of whose bonnet just reached as high as the counter who regularly every monday morning staggered in under the weight of a bundle containing her fathers sunday clothes and as regularly every saturday evening returned to redeem them it was evident her respectable parent did not attend many evening parties between those two days for i never remember his sending for them except at the regular times then there was the wretched drunkard who crept in stealthily with now a childs coat now a picture now a teapot and with the money thus raised walked straight across the road to the publichouse and there was his haggard worn wife who always came next day with the ticket and indignantly took back her household goods there was the young sailors wife too with her baby in her arms who came rarely at first but afterwards more often to pawn her few poor treasures until at length a glad day came when the brawny tar himself with his pockets full of cash came with her and redeemed them every one i could tell of scores of others if i wished but i have my own life to record and not the transactions of my master the pawnbroker one day towards the end of the first year the door opened softly and quickly and there entered into the office a youth haggard and recklesslooking whom i thought surely i had seen before i looked again was it possible yes this was none other than tom drift but oh how changed a year ago erring and wayward as he had been he was yet respectable his dress was the dress of a gentleman his bearing was that of a gentleman too his face had been naturally intelligent and pleasant and his voice clear and cheerful but now there was a wild restless roll about his eyes a bright flush on his hollow cheeks a dulness about his mouth a hoarseness in his voice which seemed to belong to another being he was dissipated and seedy in appearance and hung his head as though ashamed to meet a fellowbeings look and instead of one looked at least ten years older than he had such a wreck will evil ways make of a youth he looked eagerly round to see that no one but he was in the office and then produced from his pocket a scarfpin what will you give me for this he whispered the pawnbroker took it up and turned it over it was a handsome pin with a pearl in the front ten shillings said the pawnbroker what exclaimed tom do you know what its worth ten shillings is all i can give you curtly replied the pawnbroker tom gulped down a groan give me the money then for goodness sake he said the pawnbroker coolly and deliberately made out the ticket while tom stood chafing impatiently be quick please he said as though fearful of some one detecting him in a crime dont you be in a hurry said the pawnbroker heres the ticket and the ten shillings broke in tom you shall have it said my master going to his drawer to tom it seemed ages while the silver was being counted and when he had got it he darted from the shop as swiftly as he had entered it that fellows going wrong muttered the pawnbroker to himself as he laid the pin on the shelf beside me i recognised it at once as having often been my companion on toms dressingtable at nights but i myself was so discoloured and ill that it did not at first know me i was too anxious however to hear some thing about tom to allow myself to remain disguised dont you know me scarfpin i asked he looked hard at me not a bit he said im tom drifts old watch you dont say so so you are how ever did you come here did he pawn you no i was stolen from him one night at the musichall and pawned here by the thief ah that musichall groaned the pin that place has ruined tom drift when i left him i said he was just going to the bad as hard as he could he had broken with his best friend and seemed completely hold hard what friend interposed the pin charlie newcome my first master they had a quarrel the day i was stolen that must be nearly two years ago said the pin just said i do tell me what has happened since then its a long story said the pin never mind weve nothing else to do here i said encouragingly well said the pin the night you were lost tom never turned up at home at all he was utterly drunk i said by way of explanation dont you interrupt said the pin or i wont tell you anything i was silenced tom never turned up at all until the next morning and he sat all that day in his chair and did nothing but look at the wall in front of him poor fellow i could not help saying there you go said the pin be good enough to remember what i said and if you cant endure to hear of anybody sitting and looking at a wail its no use my going on with my story i only meant that i could imagine how miserable he was that day said i but go on please two or three days after charlie newcome called tom was alone but he refused to see him he cursed to himself when he heard the name charlie went back disappointed but tom made a great boast to his friends that same night of his cold shoulder to the prig as he called it and they highly applauded him for his sense again a week later charlie called once more but with the same result he wrote letters but tom put them in the fire unread he sent books but they were all flung into a corner in a thousand different ways he contrived to show tom that though illused and in suited he was still his friend and ready to serve him whenever opportunity should offer all this while tom was sinking lower and lower in selfrespect he was contracting a habit of drinking and in a month or two after you had left he rarely came home sober and what about his bad friends asked i there you are why cant you let me tell my story in peace his bad friends visited him daily at first made a lot of him and praised him loudly for his resolution in dismissing charlie and for his growing a man at last they lent him money they lost to him at cards and billiards and they made his downward path as easy for him as possible at last about six months ago tom was found tipsy in the dissecting room at the hospital and cautioned by the board a fortnight later he was found in a similar state in one of the wards and then he was summarily expelled from the place and his name was struck off the roll of students has it come to that i groaned come to that of course it has i shouldnt have said so if it hadnt replied the testy pin who seemed unable to brook the slightest interruption he took a fit of blues after that he went to the board and begged to be allowed to return to his studies representing that all his prospects in life depended on his finishing his course there they gave him one more chance in his gratitude he resolved to discard his companions and actually sat down and wrote a letter to charlie begging him to come and see him did he really i exclaimed trembling with eagerness all right i shall not tell you of it again stop me once more and youll have to find the rest of my story out for yourself im very sorry said i so you ought to be when it came to the time however toms resolutions failed him gus and his friends called as usual that evening and laughed him to scorn he dare not quarrel with them dare not resist them he crumpled up the letter in his pocket and never posted it and that night returned to his evil ways without a struggle for a week or two however he kept up appearances at the hospital but it could not last a misdemeanour more serious than the former one caused his second expulsion and this time with an intimation that under no circumstances would he be readmitted that was three months ago he became desperate and at the same time the behaviour of gus altered instead of flattering and humouring him he became imperious and spiteful and still further he demanded to be repaid the money he had advanced to tom tom paid what little he could and borrowed the rest from mortimer he got behindhand with his rent and his landlady has given him notice as usual everybody to whom he owes money has found out his altered circumstances and is down on him the keeper of the musichall the tailor the cigar merchant are among the most urgent and your being here is a result of all this i see said i knowing the story was at an end and considering my tongue to be released find out angrily retorted the pin relapsing into illtempered silence i had little enough inclination to revert to the sad topic and for the rest of that day gave myself up to sorrow and pity for tom drift one thing i felt pretty sure ofit would not be long before he came again and i was right in two days he entered the office wild and haggard as before but with less care to conceal his visit this time he laid on the counter the famous lancewood fishingrod which charlie had given him months ago and which surely ought to have been a reminder to him of better times he flung it down and taking the few shillings the pawnbroker advanced on it hurried from the shop the next time he came some one else was in the shop a passing flush came over toms face on discovering a witness to his humiliation but he transacted his business with an assumed swagger which ill accorded with his inward misery for even yet tom drift had this much of hope left in himthat he knew he was fallen and was miserable at the thought his selfrespect and sensitiveness had been growing less day by day and he himself growing proportionately hardened but still he knew what remorse was and by the very agony of his shame was still held out of the lowest of all depthsthe depths of ruthless sin the stranger in the shop eyed him keenly and when he had gone said to the pawnbroker hes a nice article he is not much good im thinking observed the pawnbroker dryly so you may say i know the beauty he banged me on the ed with a chair once when he was screwed never mind i know of two or three as is after him and so saying the disreputable man departed after that tom came daily now it was an article of clothing now some books now some furniture that he brought it was soon evident that not only was he miserable and destitute but ill too and when presently for a fortnight he never passed the now wellknown door i knew that the fever had laid him low poor tom drift i wondered who was there now to nurse him in his weakness and comfort him in his wretchedness he must be untended and unheeded well i knew his friends oh sad perversion of the sacred title would keep their distance or return only in time to quench the first sparks of repentance if only charlie could have seen him at this time with his spirit cowed and his weary heart beating about in vain for peace and hope how would he not have flown to his bedside and from those ruins have striven to help him to rise again to purity and honesty but no charlie was there since the last appealing letter so scornfully rejected tom had heard not a word of him or from him what wonder indeed if after so many disappointments and insults the boy should at length leave his old schoolfellow to his fate with returning health there came to tom no returning resolutions or efforts the friends who had deserted his sickbed were ready as soon as ever he rose from it with their temptations and baneful influence one of his first visits after his recovery was to my master with a pair of boots he looked so pale and feeble that the pawnbroker inquired after his healtha most unusual departure from business on the part of that merchant hope youre feeling better he said yes so much the better for you replied tom with a ghastly smile what can you give me for these they are nearly new five shillings oh anything you like ive to pay two pounds tomorrow what you give me is all i shall have to do it withi dont care the pawnbroker counted out the five shillings and handed them across the counter goodbye said tom with another attempt at a smile i shall have to change my address tomorrow and with that he turned on his heel i watched him through the window as he left the shop he walked straight across the road and went in at the publichouse opposite and that glimpse was the last sight i had of tom drift for many many months chapter eighteen how i was knocked down by an auctioneer and picked up by a countryman one day about two years after my arrival at the pawnbrokers shop an unusual circumstance happened to break the monotony of my unruffled existence this was nothing more nor less than a clearance sale i must tell you how it happened for a week every night i saw my master poring over a big accountbook in his parlour comparing the entries in it with those of his pawn tickets and marking off on one list what articles had been pawned and redeemed and on another what had been pawned and still remained unredeemed so lengthy and complicated a process was this that it consumed the entire week the next week further indications of a coming change manifested themselves a printer came to the office with a bill for approval worded as follows great clearance sale the entire valuable and miscellaneous unredeemed stock of a pawnbroker will be sold by auction at the central mart on monday next by mr hammer sale to commence at twelve oclock precisely catalogues will be ready on saturday and may be had on application thus i and one or two of my neighbours on the shelf read as we peeped through the crack at the printers proofsheet entire valuable and miscellaneous unredeemed stock thats a good bit of writing observed a pair of silver sugartongs near me that means you and me and the rest ticker whod have thought of us getting such a grand name well it strikes me we at least i have been lying here idle long enough said i its two years since i came here bless you thats no time said the tongs i knew a saltspoon lay once ten years before he was put upbut then you know we silver things are worth our money any time yes said i we are the tongs laughed you dont suppose i meant you when i talked of silver things do you of course i am a silver watch youre a bigger muff than i took you for replied the aristocratic tongs turning his hallmark towards me it was humiliating of course i ought to have known i was not solid silver and had no claim to class myself of the same metal as a genuine silver pair of tongs it was but one of many painful lessons i have had during my life not to give myself airs beyond my station these solid silver goods certainly constituted the upper ten thousand of our valuable and miscellaneous community when the time came for cataloguing us all they separated themselves from the rest of us and formed a distinct society having their several names recorded in full at the head of the list what a scene it was the day the catalogue came to our department i suffered a further humiliation then by being almost entirely overlooked a great tray of silver watches lay on the bench brought together from all parts of the shop and to my horror i found i was not among them thats the lot said the pawnbroker very good said the auctioneer who was making the catalogue shall we take leather bags next as you please said my master hold hard said the auctioneer hastily counting the watches on the tray and comparing the number with a list he held in his hand theres one short is there i dont know how that can be youve got twentytwo down here and theres only twentyone on the tray the pawnbroker looked puzzled better call over the number said the auctioneer so my master called out the number attached to each watch and the auctioneer ticked it off on his list when the last had been called he said wheres number ah to be sure thats the one said the pawnbroker reaching up to where i lay and taking me down this one id forgotten all about him flattering certainly and still more so when the auctioneer surveying my tarnished and dingy appearance said well hes not much of a show after all youd better rub him up a bit or we shant get him off hand at all very good said the pawnbroker and i was handed over forthwith to an assistant to be cleaned and much i needed it my skin was nearly as black as a negros and my joints and muscles were perfectly clogged with dust i had a regular watchs turkish bath i was scrubbed and powdered my works were taken out and cleaned my joints were oiled my face was washed and my hands were polished altogether i was overhauled and when i took my place on the tray with my twentyone companions i was altogether a new being and by no means the least presentable of the company how we quarrelled and wrangled and shouldered one another on that tray there was such a babel of voices for each of us had been set going that scarcely any one could hear himself speak nothing but recriminations and vituperations rose on every hand get out of the way ugly lever snarled one monstrous hunter watch near me big enough for an ordinary clock who do you suppose wants you get out of the way do you hear where to i inquired not altogether liking to be so summarily ordered about and yet finding the excitement of a little quarrel pleasant after two years monotony anywhere as long as you get out of my way do you know im a hundred years old are you though said i people must have had bigger pockets in those days than they have now this i considered a very fair retort for his arrogance and left him snorting and croaking to himself and bullying some other little watches whom i suppose he imagined would be more deferential to his grey hairs than i was i was not destined however to be left in peace who are you i heard a sharp voice say looking round i saw a creature with a great eye in the middle of his face and a long lanky hand spinning round and round over his visage who are you rather i replied it was evidently what he wanted for he began at once im all the latest improvementscompensation balance and jewelled in four holes perfect for time beauty and workmanship sound strong and accurate with keyless action and large fulldial second hand airtight damp tight and dusttight seven guineas net and five per cent to teetotalers there what do you think of that i think said i with a laugh in which a good many others joined that if youre so tight as all that teetotalers had better do without you it will be observed the scenes and company i had been in of late years had tended to improve neither my temper nor my manners in this way we spent most of the day before the auction and it was quite a relief early next morning to find ourselves being removed to the central mart it was impossible however to resist the temptation of another quarrel in our tray while we were waiting for the sale to begin the culprit in this instance was a certain queen annes shilling attached to the chain of an insignificantlooking watch what business has that ugly bit of tin here asked a burly hunter who calls me an ugly bit of tin squeaked out the coin i do there said the hunter now what have you got to say only that youre a falsehood why you miserable machinemade wheezing old makebelieve of a turnip draw it mild young fellow said the hunter do you know that i was current coin of the realm before the tin mine that supplied your carcass was so much as discovered im a queen annes shilling are you though and what good are you now my ancient bob the shilling grew so to speak black in the face i wont be called a bob im not a bob who dares call me a bob i do bob there bob what do you think of that bob whats the use of you bob eh can you tell the time bob eh bob bob bob and we all took up the cry and from that moment until the time of our sale every sound for us was drowned in a ceaseless cry of bob in the midst of which the unlucky queen annes shilling crawled under his watch and devoutly wished he were as undoubtedly dead as the illustrious royal lady whose image and superscription he had the misfortune to bear in due time the sale began among the earliest lots i recognised my acquaintance the solid silver sugartongs which went for very nearly his full value thus confirming me in my belief that after all theres nothing like the genuine thing all the world over after the disposal of the silver goodsfor which comparatively few people bid and that with little or no competitionthe real excitement of the auction began i have here ladies and gentlemen said the auctioneer a remarkably fine and superior lot of silver watches all of which have been carefully cleaned and kept in order and which i can safely say are equal to if not better than new in many cases the watches are accompanied by chains of a very elegant and chaste description which appendages considerably enhance their value when i inform you that we value the contents of this tray at the very lowest at l being an average of l per watch you will see i am not presenting to you any ordinary lot of goods i will put up the watches singly in the order in which they are described in the catalogue some of the company looked as if they were not sure whether they ought not to say hear hear after this very elegant and polished speech but they restrained their admiration and reserved their energies for the bidding as i was last on the list i had full opportunity of noticing how my fellows fared and was specially curious to see how the three or four watches whose acquaintance i had chanced to make went off the commonlooking watch with the unlucky bob attached to its chain was knocked down for l shillings which on the whole was a triumph to the mortified coin for it is certain without him the lot would not have fetched nearly so much and his triumph was further enhanced by the fact that the hunter with whom he had had his altercation fetched only l shillings pence however there was no time for jeers and recriminations at present we were all too deeply absorbed in watching the fate of our fellows and speculating on our own the compensation balance keyless airtight sevenguinea grandee was the next to be put up and the first bid for him was l s that i should have lived to hear that i heard the poor creature gasp and if hes a teetotaler i murmured by way of encouragement that only means l shillings pence scoffer be silent and leave me to my misery said the keyless one in a solemn tone the bidding improved considerably he was run up to l l shillings l l shillings and finally to l nothing more for this very magnificent watch said the auctioneer i positively cannot let him go for a song no answer i wish gentlemen would take the trouble to look at it continued the persevering official they could not fail to see it was worth twice the money bid still no answer did i understand you to bid four five sir said the auctioneer to an innocentlooking stripling near the door thank you the stripling however disclaimed the soft impeachment and looked very guilty as he did so well there seems no help for it i wish i were down among you gentlemen id take good care not to lose this chance no answer then i must knock it down going going gone sir its yours and dirt cheap too all this was encouraging for me if a sevenguinea watch goes for four pounds for how much will a threeguinea one go this was a problem which i feebly endeavoured to solve as i lay waiting my turn it came at last i felt myself lifted on high and heard my merits pronounced in the words of the catalogue lot london made lever openface watch capped and jewelled in very fine order look for yourselves gentlemen the gentlemen did look for themselves and complimented me by a preliminary bid of shillings the auctioneer laughed a pleasant laugh as much as to say that is a capital joke and waited for the next bid it was not long in coming and i advanced rapidly by halfcrowns to thirty shillings here i made sure i should stop for this was the figure at which the pawnbroker himself had valued me but no such are the vagaries of an auction i went on still up to l and from that to l shillings surely there was some mistake i looked out to see who they were who were thus bidding for me and fancied i detected in that scrutiny the secret of my unexpected value it was a countryman biddingendeavouring in his downright way to become my possessor and wholly unconscious of the array of jews against him who bid him up from halfcrown to halfcrown until i had nearly reached my original value three pounds at last said one of the jews the countryman had evidently come to the end of his tether and did not answer the challenge three pounds said the auctioneer youre not going to stop sir the countryman said nothing try once more said the auctioneer but the rustic was silent three pounds no more going going guineas roared the countryman at the last moment thank you sir i thought you were not going to be beaten three guineas gentlemen who says more nobody going then to you sir going going gone and so once more i changed masters chapter nineteen how after much ceremony i found myself in the pocket of a genius muggerbridge is a straggling picturesque little midland village with one principal street an old church a marketplace and a pound its population all told does not number a thousand the majority of whom are engaged in agriculture its houses are for the most part old fashioned and poor though clean and altogether its general character and appearance combine to proclaim the village an unpretending english hamlet with nothing whatever but its name to distinguish it from a hundred others like it it was here i found myself duly installed in the window of the village jewellersheld out as a bait to the purses of muggerbridge the countryman who had purchased me was a big enough man in his own place though very little had been made of him in the central mart he was jeweller silversmith church warden postmaster and special muggerbridge correspondent to the london thunderbolt all in one here and appeared to be aware of his accumulated dignities it was his custom twice a year to visit london for the purpose of replenishing his stock it was the common talk of the place that he always returned from such expeditions with prodigies of bargains which went far to encourage the popular tradition as to the prodigal wealth of the metropolis people who knew him in town on the other hand always laughed at him and were unkind enough to hint that he never by any chance bought an article at less than its full price and often paid an extremely fanciful ransom for his purchases the churchwarden and postmaster of muggerbridge would have been very indignant had such an insinuation ever reached his ears it never did happily and the worthy man was consequently always well satisfied with his purchases whichwhatever he gave for themhe always contrived to sell at a very respectable profit it was with a view to this profit that i found myself looking out of mr argents window in the high street of muggerbridge with a ticket round my neck conveying the to me very gratifying information that this superb watch was to be disposed of for the moderate amount of l shillings only and a parenthesis below further indulged my vanity by volunteering the information that i was worth l it did occur to me to wonder why if i was worth l mr argent should be such a donkey as to sell me for only threequarters of that sum either he was a very benevolent man or he was in immediate want of l shillings or he had his doubts as to my alleged value i somehow fancied the last was the true reason and was half afraid he was right too well i looked out of mr argents windows for two months and by that time became acquainted with nearly all the inhabitants of muggerbridge on my first arrival i was an object of a good deal of curiosity and admiration for any change in a country shop window is an excitement and when that change takes the form of a l superb watch offered for l shillings it was no wonder the honest muggerbridgians gaped in at me and read my label but in a very little time familiarity had bred contempt and i lay almost unheeded by the outside world the grocer opposite with his triumphal arch of jampots monopolised all the wonder and most of the admiration and i had the mortification of seeing passers turn their backs on me and step over the way to contemplate that vulgar structure i had however one or two constant admirers one of these was a youth scarcely more than a boy with a very pale thoughtful face he was poorly dressed but respectable a book was generally tucked under his arm and very often i could see his lips moving as if repeating something to himself he paid me more attention than anybody every time he passed the shop he halted and looked at me as i thought wistfully and usually appeared relieved to find me still in my place george readers took a fancy to the new watch i can see i heard mr argent say one day to his wife he spoke let me observe in a very broad country dialect which i do not feel equal to reproducing here poor lad said mrs argent i dare say hed like to have it in his pocket when he goes to college he is going then yes for certain the clergyman says it would be a sin for a boy of his cleverness not to go and so i think well learnings a great thing and when a gamekeepers son does take a fit of it i suppose its all right to humour it but you and i wife can get on very well without it speak for yourself retorted mrs argent i wish you had half as much in your head as that boy has got thats all and i suppose you wish youd got the other half eh stuff and after this little tiff the worthy couple were silent for a while presently mrs argent again spoke i wonder what theyll do about the church organ when georges gone ah you may say so said the husband with a touch of importance in his voice which became a churchwarden when speaking of church matters itll be hard to fill his place there so it will did you stay after the service on sunday no you know i had to go round to the curates why just because if youd heard him play youd have been glued to your chair as i was it was beautiful i couldnt have got up from that chair if id tried good job you didnt try if you were glued down especially in your sunday gown i shouldnt care to have to buy many of them a month now john you know ive not had a new gown for nearly a year and then the talk took a departure over a range of topics to which i need not drag my unoffending reader this short conversation sufficed to satisfy my curiosity in part as to the boy who was paying me such constant attention and another event which shortly happened served to bring me into still closer acquaintance with george reader one day there entered the shop a party consisting of half a dozen persons one of them was a young man in the dress of a clergyman and the others i knew well by sight as respectable and respected villagers goodmorning mr argent said the curate for the clerical gentleman was none other weve come to see you on a little matter of business hope theres nothing wrong with the heating stoves in the church sir said mr argent with an anxious face i was always against them being used at all the stoves are quite well i believe said the curate smiling our business is of quite a different kind weve come to make a purchase in fact mr argents face brightened considerably partly at the assurance as to the salubrity of the gasstoves and partly at the prospect of business what can i do for you sir he said no longer with his churchwardens voice but as the muggerbridge silversmith well we have been asked to select a small present to be given by the choir and congregation of our church to george reader who i suppose you know is going next week to college i have heard tell of it sir said mr argent and my wife and i were only wondering the other day what was to become of the music at the church when hes gone we dont like to think of it said one of the party it would want a good one to take his place said another we shall all miss him said the curate and we are anxious before he leaves us to present him with some little token of our regard we have kept the thing from you mr argent as of course we should have to come to you to procure whatever we decided on getting so your contribution to the gift will have to be some good advice on the matter we are still undecided aboutwhat to get i shall be very glad to helphave you decidederi meanhas anything been saidthat isabout what about how much well we have nearly four poundsin fact we might call it four what have you about that price that would be suitable oh how my heart fluttered for i could guess by this time what was coming mr argent looked profound for a minute and then said theres one thing i think would do what asked the deputation he pulled me out of the window and laid me on the counter a watch dear me we thought of all sorts of things but not once of that it would be a suitable present said one of the party but this one is l that neednt matter said mr argent if you like it my wife and i will settle about the difference thats very kind of you mr argent does any one know if george has a watch i know he hasnt said one of the party and whats more ive heard him say he wishes he had one and i can answer for it hes been looking in at my window at this very one every day for the last month said the silversmith well what do you say to getting this then we neednt ask you if its a good one mr argent no you neednt sir replied the smiling mr argent who as i had remained run down since the day he bought me could not well have answered the question more definitely youll clean it up will you and set it going and send it to me this afternoon said the curateand perhaps you would like to come with us to readers cottage this evening when we are going to present it mr argent promised to form one of the party and the deputation then left i was swiftly subjected to all the cleaning and polishing which brushes washleather and whiting could give me i was wound up and set to the right time and a neat piece of black watered ribbon was attached to my neck and then i waited patiently till the time came for my presentation to my new master the gamekeepers cottage to which i was conducted in state that evening was not an imposing habitation it boasted of only three rooms and just as many occupants george the hero of the occasion was the son of its humble owner and his wife and as will have been gathered had turned out a prodigy from his earliest days he had displayed a remarkable aptitude for study having once learned to read at the village school he became insatiable after books and devoured all that came within his reach happily he fell into the hands of a wise and able guide the clergyman of the parish who early recognising the cleverness of the boy strove to turn his thirst for learning into profitable channels lent him books explained to him what he failed to understand incited him to thoroughness and generally constituted himself his kind and helpful adviser the consequence of this timely tuition had been that george had grown up not a boisterous over bearing prig showing off his learning at every available chance and making himself detestable and everybody else miserable by his conceited air but a modest quiet scholar with plenty of hidden fire and ambition and not presuming on his talents to scorn his humble origin or be ashamed of his home and parentson the contrary connecting them with all his dearest hopes of success and advancement in the world they good souls were quite bewildered by the sudden blaze of their sons celebrity they hardly seemed to understand what it all meant but had a vague sort of idea that they were implicated in garges achievements they would sit and listen to him as he read to them as if they were at an exhibition at which they had paid for admission and it is not too much to say garge was in their eyes almost as dreadful a personage as the lord of the manor himself among his fellowvillagers george was as the reader will have gathered somewhat of a hero and not a little of a favourite this distinction he owed to a talent for music which had at a very early age displayed itself and had been heartily encouraged by the rector in this pursuit which he followed as his only recreation he had made such progress that while yet a boy he became voluntary organist at the church and as such had won the hearts of the neighbours they didnt know much about music but they knew the organ sounded beautiful on sundays and that garge played it and so it was a real trouble to them now that he was about to leave muggerbridge you may imagine the state of excitement into which this unexpected visit threw simple mr and mrs reader the good lady was too much taken aback even to offer her customary welcome and as for the gamekeeper he sat stock still in his chair with his eyes on his son like a hound that waits the signal for action we are rather an invasion im afraid said the curate squeezing himself into the little kitchen between a clotheshorse and a dresser not at all said george looking very bewildered perhaps youll wonder why weve come added the curate turning to the gamekeeper maybe youve missed something and thinks one of us has got it was the cheerful suggestion the curate laughed and the deputation laughed and george laughed and georges mother laughed which made things much easier for all parties no we havent missed anything mr reader replied the curate but we expect to miss somebodygeorge and that is the reason of our visit and then the curate explained what the business was and one of the churchwardens made a speech the composition of which had kept him awake all the previous night and then i was produced and handed over and george blushed and stammered out something which nobody could understand and georges mother began to cry and georges father unable otherwise to express his sense of the occasion began to whistle and so the little business was satisfactorily concluded and the deputation withdrew leaving me in the pocket of a new master three days afterwards both of us took our departure for cambridge chapter twenty how my new master made trial of a pursuit of knowledge under difficulties but now let us follow reader my masters rooms at saint georges college were of the poorest and meanest description in fact it would not be too much to describe themthe bedroom and studyas being like a pair of big cupboards under a great staircase they looked out on nothing more picturesque than a blank wall they were carpeted with nothing better than an old drugget and as for paper the place would have looked better simply whitewashed they were suffocating in summer and draughty in winter and at nights afforded rendezvous to a whole colony of rats every step on the staircase above thundered down into the study the looselyhung windows rattled even in a light breeze and the flavours of the college dustbins hard by appeared to have selected these chambers above all others for their favourite haunt i am told saint georges college has recently undergone renovation it so it is probable the mousetrapfor this was the designation by which george readers classical domain was familiarly styledhas disappeared let us hope so for a more miserable uncomfortable and uninviting couple of rooms i never saw but they had one merit and that a great one they were cheap which to george reader meant everything he had gained a small entrance scholarship by the help of which he hoped with the most rigid economy to support himself during his college career most other young fellows would have shrunk from the prospect but such was my masters ambition that i believe he would have endured life in a stable if only he could have there enjoyed the advantages and encouragements of a college course it was at any rate a fine sight to see him settle down in his new dispiriting quarters determined to make the best of everything and suffer nothing to damp his ardour for work he unpacked his few precious books and laid them on the shelf he hung up the likenesses of his father and mother over the chimneypiece he produced the cheese which the latter had insisted on his bringing with him and as a crowningeffect set me up on the mantelshelf with as much pride as if i had been a marble clock that looks something like he said to himself now for a little tea and thengrind the little tea however was sooner said than done it involved a prolonged hunt for the gyp or attendant and a still more prolonged conference on the subject of hot water tea and bread the suggestions thrown out by the college official too were so very lordly and extravagantsuch for instance as ham and eggs chicken marmalade and chocolatethat poor georges heart fluttered as much as his mouth watered while he listened chicken and chocolate for a poor student who had barely enough money to afford so much as the luxury of living in the mousetrap of saint georges well he might be scared at the idea he politely declined the grand offer of his scout and asking him to light a small fire and procure him a loaf sallied out himself into the town and purchased a small and very cheap quantity of groceries with these he returned in triumph to his rooms and with the utmost satisfaction partook of his first college meal with a euclid open on the table beside him then pouring out a final cup of tea to enjoy cold later on he cleared the decks for action as he called it which meant putting away the tea butter sugar and bread in a cupboard and folding up the table cloth poor george he had no false pride to forbid such menial offices he had not the brag about him which would have led another to stand on the staircase and howl gyp till every one far and near should be made aware that he had had a meal which required clearing away no he was only a gamekeepers son in a hurry to get at his books and to him it was far more natural to wait on his own frugal table than sit in state till a servant should come and clear it now said he to himself i shall get a good quiet time for work after all its not bad to be ones own master where reading is concerned and without more ado he set himself down to his books with me on the table at his elbow and his cup of tea within reach when such refreshment should be desirable it was a fine thing to see this young fellow plunging straight into his work assuredly he had not come to college to fritter away his timeto row play cricket give wineparties or drive dogcarts he had not even come because it was the thing or afforded a good introduction into the world no he was here for one purpose and one alone that was work to him the days were as precious mines and every minute a nugget it mattered nothing to him who won the cricketmatch this year who occupied the rooms next his how many bumps the saint georges boat made on the river far more important was the thought that perhaps the oil in his lamp would run short before the night was out or whether the edition of plato his friend the muggerbridge clergyman had given him was the best and contained the fullest notes in short george reader was in earnest but like the tea the good quiet time he hoped for was not so easy to secure scarcely had he settled down when the voices of two men in loud conversation rose immediately under his window now when one is in the agony of trying to understand how it comes that a certain number of angles in one figure are equal to a certain number of angles in another it is to say the least of it confusing to have to listen to a spirited account of a boxingmatch between jack straight and the hon wilfred dodge and when that account manages to get interwoven inextricably with the problem in hand the effect is likely to be distracting for instance since the solid angle at b is contained by three plane angles baf fac and cab then jack let out and got in sweetly under his mans guard and so on therefore persevered george the angles abc and abf rounded on him grandly and the angles abc and abf are together greater than the angle cbf and similarly here the conversation was continued in language far more worthy of the disgraceful prizering than a college until george could bear it no longer he leapt from his seat and sprang to the window which he opened leaning out he surveyed the two disturbers of his peace with very little affection but controlled himself sufficiently to say politely would you mind not talking just here im reading one of the two scowled up at him and replied what business is it of yours where we talk come on fisher said the other taking his arm let the man read if he wants i suppose thats the poor beggar whos come to the trap hes got a cool cheek of his own whoever he is retorted the indignant fisher george was too relieved to be rid of their clatter under his window to trouble himself as to their sentiments towards himself and he therefore once again settled down to work but now a new interruption occurred there arose a sudden rush of feet outside his door a laughing and a cheering in the midst of which he caught the following confused utterances georges has bumped corpus cried a voice see note hurrah yelled half a dozen voices it was the finest bit of rowing ever you saw continued the first speaker bailey put it on from the very first stroke and was on the top of them before the point and then the three cheers and yells rose again you can fancy how black and blue corpus lookedits the biggest sell theyve had for a long time once more the shouts and what do you think resumed the first speaker old bailey vows he wont come to the supper tonight did ever you hear of such an old bear hell have to come cried the rest lets waylay him here and carry him off all serene said the leader hes sure to come herelets hang about on the stairs oh horrors here were six noisy men going to establish themselves on the stairs over poor georges head and remain there until their victim arrived when unless college traditions were utterly false there would certainly be a battle royal it was impossible with the cheering and stamping and shouting and laughing and scuffling overhead to do a stroke of work and yet george did his best he pulled his table into the corner of the room farthest away from the noise and burying his head in his hands struggled desperately to abstract himself from the disturbance but as sure as he succeeded for a minute a clamour louder than ever would drive every idea out of his head it was vain to attempt expostulationwhat would these jubilant revellers care for a poor new man like himand he had nowhere else to go to escape them there was nothing for it but to be patient in due time the victorious and unsuspecting bailey accompanied by four of his friends appeared on the scene and their approach was the immediate signal for action with a cheer and a howl the ambush sprang upon their victims and with equal vehemence these having rapidly taken in the state of affairs prepared to defend themselves poor george might as well have been sitting under niagara step by step the newcomers strove to force a passage up to baileys rooms and step by step the opposing force strove to repulse them the balustrades creaked the ceiling of georges room quaked and the walls thundered with the weight of conflicting bodies the occupants of every room on the staircase turned out to see the fun and on hearing of baileys contumacy joined with his persecutors in refusing him the shelter of his own sanctuary baileys party on the other hand was joined by reinforcements from without who stormed up the stairs with the noise of an earthquake the opposing forces soon became so great that the press of battle raged even to the door of georges study which creaked and rattled as if every moment it were about to yield and admit the whole tide of conflict for half an hour the tumult roared and the battle swayed and neither party gained nor yielded a foot then suddenly from the confines of the battle rose and spread a cry of cave canem on which as if by magic the action was suspended and retreating footsteps betokened a panic a rally was sounded by baileys foes but too late the hero of the day had taken advantage of the momentary pause to dash past his persecutors and gain his study and once there no force could dislodge him the vanquished ones stormed and raged outside his door for another ten minutes threatening all sorts of vengeance then with three mighty cheers they struck camp and retired leaving the staircase in peace thus ended the famous battle of baileys staircase at the end of which george with sunken spirits but indomitable resolution sat down again to work for half an hour he made good progress without let or hindrance when ah cruel fatea wretch calling himself a man in a neighbouring apartment began to practise on the ophicleide at the first note george bounded from his seat as if he had been shot and literally tore his hair this was worse than all that had gone before to one of his musical inspiration the human voice divine in conversation was endurable and the roar of battle might even be tolerable but to hear a creature attempt to play one of the songs without words on an instrument he knew as little of as the music he was parodying was beyond all bearing then if ever did my wretched master dig his fingers into his ears and writhe and shiver and groan at each discord produced by that inhuman performer he retreated into the innermost recess of his bedroom he even hid his unhappy head beneath the clothes if haply he might escape the agony of this torture but it was hopeless the shrieks and groans of that brutal ophicleide would have penetrated the walls of the tower of london it lasted i should not like to say how long and when it was over the recollection of its horrors was almost as bad as their endurance when george set himself again to work it was with nerves unstrung and unutterable forebodings yet still unconquered at any rate said he to himself with a sigh there cant be anything worse than thatunless indeed he invites a friend like himself to practise duets with him happily this climax was not reached and for one evening the worst of george readers persecutions had been sufferedbut not the last by the time the last wail of the ophicleide had wriggled away into silence it was getting late and the college was meditating retirement to rest this operation was not got through as may be imagined without a good deal of clamour and a good deal of scuffling on the staircase and a good deal of dialogue outside the window but in due time silence reigned and george congratulated himself that he had a quiet time at last before him unlucky boast not an hour had passed the lights in the windows round the courtyard had vanished the distant shouts had ceased and the footsteps on the pavement without had died away when george was startled by a sound that seemed like the boring of a hole under his fireplace the noise grew and other similar noises rose in different parts what was it surely the gay students of saint georges were not about to effect an amateur burglary on the friendless owner of the mousetrap nearer and nearer came the sounds and georges heart beat loud he closed his book and pushed his chair back from the table ready to defend himself on an emergency to the bitter end then under the hearth there was a sound of scraping and grating then a rushing noise and then george sawtwo enormous rats loud and long laughed my master to himself at the discovery what cared he for rats he pulled his chair back to the table and buried himself in his book for the next three hours until his lamp began to burn low and the letters on the pages grew blurred and dim and the rats had scuffled back by the way they came and my flagging hands pointed to four oclock then george reader after kneeling in silent prayer went to bed note at the college races at cambridge the boats start one behind the other at fixed distances and any boat overtaking and bumping the one in front of it moves up a place nearer to the head of the river chapter twenty one how my master fared at saint georges college and met an old acquaintance of the readers there it is not my intention in these pages to give a full and particular account of george readers college life it would neither be on the whole interesting nor would it be found to have much bearing on my own career which is the ostensible theme of the present veracious history stories of college life have furnished amusing material for many a book before now to which the reader must turn should his curiosity in that direction require to be satisfied the life of a harda too hard working student in his cell under the college staircase is neither amusing nor sensational and it is quite enough to say that after his first eventful evening george reader pursued his studies with unflagging ardour though with greater precaution than ever he soon discovered which hours of the day and night were most favourable for uninterrupted work he made a point of taking his constitutional during the hour made hideous by the illstarred aspirant on the ophicleide he invested in a trap for the rats which with the aid of his mothers cheese yielded him a nightly harvest of victims and he arranged with benson the gyp not to interrupt him preferring rather to wait on himselfnay even to dust out his own roomthan have to sacrifice precious time while the same offices were being performed by another especially by such an overpowering and aweinspiring person as benson so he set himself to work attending lectures by day reading every night into the small hours spending scarcely anything shrinking from all acquaintanceships taking only a minimum of recreation and living almost the life of a hermit until i could see his cheeks grow pale and his eyes dark round the rims and feared for his health he treated me uniformly well of course as the gift of his fellow villagers he prized me highly but by no means consigned me to the stately repose of a purely ornamental treasure i lay nightly beside his elbow on the table and counted for him the hours as they sped from night to morning i lay beneath his pillow at night and helped him to rise betimes i insured his punctual attendance at lectures and drove him home from his scanty walks in the fresh air more quickly than i myself would have cared to do if i could have helped it in short i found myself in the satisfactory position of one thoroughly useful in his sphere of life and on the whole though my first young master returned constantly to my thoughts i contrived to be very happy in my new capacity two events however both of a pleasant nature served to vary the monotony of georges second term at college the first of these was a visit from his friend and patron dr wilkins the rector of muggerbridge george was sitting at his modest breakfast one morning when his door suddenly opened and the wellknown and beloved face of his old tutor lit up the apartment my master sprang to his feet and with unaffected joy rushed forward to welcome his guest before it had do much as occurred to him into what uninviting quarters he was receiving him how good of you to come sir he cried i never expected such happiness you dont suppose i should go through cambridge and never beat up your quarters my boy but dear me how ill you are looking am i i dont feel ill humph youre overdoing it but arent you going to offer me some breakfast george coloured and his spirits sank as his eyes fell on the scanty fare of which he himself had been partaking its only breadandbutter he said and what better said dr wilkins sitting down and i warrant the butters good if its your mothers making so it is said george beginning to recover his spirits and how did you leave them at home sir firstrate my boylooking much better than you are and so this is your den well its nothing very grand put in george exactly nothing very grand but i dare say you find it as good a place to read in as a drawingroom eh now tell me all about yourself my boy while i drink this good tea of yours and george with light heart and beaming face told his good friend of all his doings his hardships his difficulties his triumphs and his ambitions and dr wilkins sat and listened with pride and thankfulness at heart to find his young protege the same earnest unaffected boy he had parted with from muggerbridge six months before they talked for a long time that morning the tutor and boy passed in review all the work hitherto accomplished and discussed the programme of future study many were the wholesome counsels the elder gave to the younger and many were the new hopes and resolutions which filled the lads heart as he opened all his soul to his good friend and now said dr wilkins i want you to take me to see your college and chapel george looked perplexed who was he to conduct a doctor of divinity over his college such a hermits life had he led that he hardly knew the ins and outs of the place himself and there was not a single man in the college to whom he was not a stranger im afraid youve chosen a bad guide faltered he i dont know any of the men and very little of the place oh never mind that said the doctor it will be all the more interesting to make a tour of discovery so come along george put on his cap and gown and obeyed for a moment he wished the gown had been long enough to conceal the patch on the knee of his trousers but the next he laughed at himself for his vanity theres nothing to be ashamed of thought he and if it is patchedwell it is and thus consoling himself he accompanied the doctor across the quadrangle men certainly did stare at him as he passed and some of them deemed him a queer specimen and others wondered what saint georges was coming to but my master if he noticed their looks disregarded them and as for dr wilkins he smiled to himself to think how prone mankind is to judge by appearances unless i mistake mused he to himself these young sparks of saint georges will some day think fit to be proud of their poor fellow collegian the two made the tour of the college and finished up with the grand old gothic chapel it was easy to guess why georges face lit up as he approached the place the deep notes of an organ were sounding across the quadrangle and as they entered the door a flood of harmony swept towards them down the long aisles dr wilkins could feel the boys arm tremble and heard the sigh of delight which escaped his lips without a word they sat in the nearest stalls and listened while the music went on how it rose and fell how it trembled in the oak arches of the roof and swept through the choir down to where they sat it was only an ordinary organists practice but to george after his hard work and with the memories of home revived by the presence of his dear tutor it came as a breath from heaven daily nearly had he heard that organ since his coming to cambridge but never had it delighted him as it did now can we see the organ he said when the last chord had died away let us try said the doctor the gallery door was open and ascending the stairs to the organ loft they found the organist preparing to depart we have been a clandestine audience said the doctor and couldnt help coming to thank you for the treat you have given us my young friend here is music mad the organist smiled you took me at a disadvantage he said i was only amusing myself whatever you were doing for yourself you delighted us said the doctor would you like to try the organ presently said the organist to george oh what a bound of delight i could feel in my masters breast at the invitation may i he exclaimed certainly if you likeand if you can added the other hesitatingly as if not sure whether the lads skill would be equal to his enthusiasm george sat down on the bench and laid his fingers lovingly on the keys but he withdrew them before he had sounded a note i would rather you did not watch me too closely he said nervously for i am only a beginner let us go and sit down stairs suggested the doctor the organist looked still more doubtful than before and began to repent his offer however he retired with the doctor and made up his mind to be excruciated they sat down in two of the stalls and waited and then george began to play what he played i cannot tell it began first in a faint whisper of music which swelled onward into a pure choral melody then suddenly the grand old roof trembled with the clash of a martial movement strong and steady which carried the listener onward till he was with the sound lost in the far distance then in wailing minor numbers the music returned slowly working itself up into the tumult and fury of a pentup agony and finally sweeping all before it in a wild hurricane of bitterness then a pause and then sweetly and in the far distance once more rose the quiet hymn and after that all was silence after the first few notes the organist had uttered a startled ejaculation and drawn the doctor to another seat farther down the nave where till all was over he sat motionless as a statue but the moment the music had ceased he ran up the stairs with a face full of pleasure and admiration and actually seized george by the hand youre a genius sir that was not at all bad i can tell you a happy smile was all the answer george could give not at all bad repeated the organist i was telling your friend added he to dr wilkins who had returned more slowly to the organ that was not at all bad he must come here often nothing i am sure would delight him more said the doctor eh my boy nothing indeed said george but but your reading i suppose never mind your reading sir exclaimed the organist whats that to music take my advice and go in for music poor george for a moment he felt tempted to abandon all his ambitions and resolutions at the prospect of a career so delightful and congenial but he was made of firmer stuff than tom drift and replied i cannot do that sir but if i may come now and then come whenever you like said the organist and so saying he shook george and his friend by the hand and hurried from the chapel this was the event which of all others brightened george readers first year at college instead of aimless walks he now stole at every spare moment without cutting into his ordinary work to the organ and there revelled in music his acquaintance with the college organist increased and developed into a friendship of which mutual admiration formed a large element and one happy sunday a year after his arrival at cambridge he received for the first time the much coveted permission to preside at the organ during a college service a task of which he acquitted himself so well nay so remarkably wellthat not only did he frequently find himself again in the same position but his playing came to be a matter of remark among the musical set of saint georges who is the fellow who played today a man inquired one day of the organist is he a pupil of yours no i might be a pupil of his in some things hes a boy and mark my words if he goes on as hes begun hell be heard of some day whats his name do you know inquired the youth i dont even know that i never here he comes introduce me will you with pleasure allow me to introduce mr halliday said the organist to george halliday wasnt that a familiar name to me was it possible this fine fellow then was no other than jim halliday whom i had last seen as a boy on the steps of randlebury with his chum charlie newcome waving farewell to tom drift ah how my heart beat at being thus once more brought back into the light of those happy days by this unexpected meeting my master by no means shared my delight at the incident he had always shrunk from acquaintanceships among his fellowcollegians with none hitherto but the organist had he become familiar and that only by virtue of an irresistible common interest his poverty and humble station forbade him to intrude his fellowship on the clannish gentry of saint georges and certainly his cravings for hard study led him so far from considering the exclusion as a hardship to look upon it as a mercy and few things he desired more devoutly than that this satisfactory state of affairs might continue i do not say george was right in this sociability is to a certain extent a duty and one that ought not without the soundest reason to be shirked george may have carried his reserve rather too far but at any rate you will allow he erred on the right side if he erred at all and carried his purpose through with more honesty and success than poor tom drift had displayed in a very similar situation now however his hermitage was in peril of a siege and he quailed as he acknowledged the introduction offered him how are you said halliday with all his own downrightness i and a lot of fellows have liked your playing and i dont see why i shouldnt tell you so how are you im quite well thank you faltered george youre a freshman i suppose asked jim no im in my second year are you i thought i knew all the men in the college but perhaps you live in the town no i live in college where are your rooms asked the astonished jim in or rather under h staircase replied george perhaps you would know the place best as the mousetrap jim could not resist a whistle of surprise and a rapid scrutiny of his new acquaintance the mousetrap thats an awful hole isnt it yes said george his candour coming to his rescue to deliver him from this crossexamination but its cheap jim looked as afflicted as if he had been seized with a sudden toothache what a blundering jackass i am please excuse my rudeness i never meant to annoy you you have not done so you are not the sort of man i should mind knowing i was poor of course not so am i poor but dont lets talk of that will you come to my rooms george hesitated and then answered id rather not please im reading hard and besides besides what ive no right to expect you to associate with me why ever not i may as well tell you straight out my father is a gamekeeper and i am a gamekeepers son jim laughed pleasantly well really your logic is perfect but i cant say as much for your sense bless you man arent we all of us lineal descendants of a gardener come along please excuse me again faltered george you are very kind but your friends may not thank you for my friendsoh yes blurted out jim what on earth business have they to put their noses into my affairs like their impudence all of them jim you will see was still a boy though he had whiskers dont blame them till they have offended anyhow mr halliday please excuse me i want to read and have made a rule never to go out look herewhats your name began jim reader replied my master reader are you the fellow whos in for the wigram scholarship cried jim in astonishment yes replied george how did you know only that some of the fellows are backing you for winner george laughed theyll be disappointed he said i hope not said jim for if you get it youll be free of the college and get into rather better quarters than the mousetrap but look here reader do come to my rooms theres a good fellow if you dont want any friends dont prevent my having one this was irresistible and george had nothing for it but to yield and with many misgivings to accompany his new friend chapter twenty two how my master and i went out to breakfast and whom we met jim hallidaynow a strapping youth of nineteenwas a good representative of the steady set at saint georges college indeed as he was intending to become a clergyman in due time it would have been a deplorable thing if this had not been the case he worked hard and though not a clever fellow had already taken a good position in the examination lists of his college he was also an ardent superintendent at a certain raggedschool in the town conducted by university men and was further becoming a wellknown figure in the debates at the unionon all which accounts his friends were not a little satisfied but on one point jim and his friends did not hit it ever since his randlebury days he had kept up his passion for athletic sports and if he had now been famous for nothing else at his college he would at least have been noted as a good bat a famous boxer a desperate man in a football scrimmage and a splendid oar it was on this subject that jim and his relations were at variance when i speak of relations i refer by the way to a certain oldfashioned uncle and aunt in cornwall who since jims fathers death had assumed the guardianship of that youth and his brothers and sisters this good uncle and aunt were horribly shocked that one destined for so solemn a sphere in life as the ministry should profane himself with athletic sports the matter formed the theme for many serious remonstrances and long letters addressed to the depraved jim who on his part maintained his side of the argument with characteristic vehemence he actually spent a whole day in the college library making out a list of all the athletic divines in history since the creation of the world the which he hurled triumphantly at his good relations heads as an unanswerable challenge but however satisfactory it may have been to jim it failed to convince them and neither party being disposed to give in the feud in this particular had become chronic all this jim contrived to impart to george for lack of better conversation in the course of a short walk previous to the breakfast in his rooms to which he was leading his new acquaintance a captive i suppose we shall have it all opened again now he remarked for you may have seen that my name is down to play in the footballmatch against sandhurst i never read the athletic intelligence in the papers said george well my uncle and aunt do the names were actually printed in the times and i shall be greatly surprised if i dont find a letter or telegram when i get back to my rooms we may as well beat to quarters though or the fellows will be waiting you didnt tell me anyone else was to be there said george reproachfully suddenly stopping short i cant come stuff and nonsense said jim they wont eat you halliday said george hurriedly im much obliged to you for asking me but i have made a rule as i tell you never to go out and ive told you the reason an utterly rubbishing reason put in jim i promised to come with you because i thought there would be only us two but i really cant come if there are more my dear fellow said jim goodhumouredly anyone else would be offended with you why youre a regular bear i know its very rude of me said george feeling and looking very uncomfortable and i dont want to be that of course you dont so come along why my dear fellow one would think my friends were all as abandoned wretches as i am by the manner in which you shrink from the notion of meeting them but they arent do let me off put in george in despair not a bit of it but i tell you what if you dont like them or me its not that you know but ive no right to associ associate with your grandmother come this once and ill never ask you again unless you like there who are the fellows asked george two of them are college menvery nice men in my humble opinion and now i come to think of it one of them clarke is in against you for the wigram but everyone says youre safe and the third is an old particular school chum who is playing in sandhurst team against us and whom it is therefore my interest to incapacitate by a howling breakfast george laughed i wish youd let him eat my share as well i dare say he would be equal to the occasion newcome was always a good trencherman at the name i bounded nearly out of my masters pocket newcome an old school chum of jim hallidays it must be my old master andyesnow i remembered he had spoken in one of his letters to tom drift of going to sandhurst military college it must be he how i longed for my master to make up his mind and go to the breakfast but i wouldnt have you miss seeing him said jim for im no end proud of him and when youve once seen him youll have seen the best fellow going that is added he present company of course excepted im sure hes a nice man nice of course and therefore fit company for you and me so come along old man i never had such hard work inviting a man to breakfast in all my life im certain im illmannered said george but i wont hold out any more you will hurrah thats settled and here we are too with that he led the way up a staircase on the second floor of which he opened a door and ushered george into his rooms no one was there yet and there was consequently time to look about jims rooms were nothing very grand but they were palatial compared with the mousetrap cheerful and welllighted with a pleasant lookout into the old quadrangle comfortably furnished further enlivened with all those adornments in the shape of swords fencingsticks dumbbells etcetera without which no model undergraduates rooms would be complete george could hardly help sighing as his thoughts flew back to his own dingy cell under h staircase lay another plate smith said jim addressing his gyp and now old man make yourself comfortable and then the host in a businesslike way devoted himself to the mysteries of coffeemaking and eggboiling in the midst of which occupation clarke and the other saint georges man arrived george felt very miserable on being introduced and devoutly hoped the fellows would have sufficient to converse about among themselves without it being needful for him to come under observation this reserve however he was not destined to maintain for very long halliday said clarke were you in chapel this morning yes well did you ever hear the organ so grandly played george blushed deeply half with pleasure at this genuine compliment and half with nervousness at the turn the talk was taking and it wasnt the regular organist said clarkes friend for i saw him downstairs no its some fellowploughboy or stableboy or somebody hes got hold of so i heard whoever he is he knows how to play at this point jim was as red in the face as george and equally embarrassed is the fellow at college do you know asked clarkes friend i believe so in fact in fact broke out jim in fear of further awkwardness in fact the gentleman you are speaking of is my friend here if clarke and his friend had suddenly been confronted by a tribe of wild indians they could not have been more taken aback than they were at this announcement in fact it was an awkward moment for everybody nobody knew exactly what to say or which way to look but a welcome interruption arrived my heart beat suddenly as i heard at the bottom of the stairs a sound some one was coming up two steps at a time nearer and nearer the light feet came and my agitation told me whom they brought there was a rap at the door a click on the latch and then after all these years i saw once more my dear first master charlie newcome little he guessed i was so near him he had spent the previous day with jim and was therefore no stranger in his rooms indeed from the moment he entered them he appeared as much at home there as their own master he greeted the visitors pleasantly and then in the old randlebury style demanded if breakfast was anywhere near ready as he was starving he had the beginnings of a fierce moustache he stood six feet high in his boots and there was a look of power about him which exceeded even the promise of his randlebury days otherwise he was the same he had the same clear honest eyes the same frank smile the same merry laugh for which everyone had loved him then and as i looked at him and rejoiced i felt i would give the world to be back in my old place in his pocket jim as he himself had said was proud enough of his friend and no wonder his arrival too at the instant when it occurred was most opportune and made him a specially welcome addition to our party which including my master was very soon on the best of terms round the hospitable jims table its not often said that worthy one gets two pairs of deadly enemies eating out of the same dish whats the fellow talking about asked charlie passing up his plate for more steak well said jim you and i are or shall be deadly enemies today old man rather responded charlie so much the worse for you but wheres the other pair why clarke and reader i exclaimed clarke in an alarmed tone i hope mr reader and i are not at enmity oh yes you are dont you know readers the fellow in against you for the wigram said jim clarke was astonished he had been told there was another candidate for the scholarship who in some quarters was considered a formidable opponent but he had never fairly realised the fact till now im very glad to meet you said he courteously to george though i can hardly wish you as much success in your exam as i dare say you wish yourself i hope i shall not break my heart if i lose replied george are we the only two in for it and then they fell to talking about their approaching struggle during which i gave heed to a hurried talk between charlie and jim do you remember tom drift asked jim charlies face at once became serious as he replied how could i forget him what about him why said jim i had a letter from my brother joe the other day and he says tom has altogether gone to the bad he met him drunk coming out of some slum in holborn and followed him for a long time in hopes of being able to speak to him but the fellow couldnt or wouldnt recognise him and only swore he is living at some disreputable lodginghouse where exclaimed charlie excitedly i dont know why whats the matter can you find out his address asked charlie i dare say why do you want it because i must go and see him could you find out today by telegram ill try presently he added i could never make out why you stuck to the fellow as you did old man especially when he turned against you youre a better man than ever i shall be nonsense i promised once to be his friend thats all do send the telegram soon and now tell me whos the pale man talking to clarke a fellow called readerone of the cleverest men weve got he looks halfstarved yes im afraid hesi mean i dont think he takes proper care of himself pity said charlie i say old man this is rare steak give us a bit more what time does the match begin at two you old beggar see if i dont pay off some old scores before the days over i thought you told me once your people didnt fancy your going in for athletics no more they do i expect a stinger by this post but i shall not open it till after the match what matches we used to have at randlebury didnt we and do you remember what an ass you used to make of yourself over that precious silver watch of yours it did one good to hear the laugh with which charlie greeted this reminder id give my repeater and a tenpound note besides to get back that old watch said he if he had but known but theres no knowing where it is now poor tom drift must have parted with it years ago with such talk the meal proceeded and presently the conversation grew more general and branched out on to all sorts of topics george having got over the first strangeness of finding himself in society found it not so bad after all and indeed he very soon amazed himself by the amount he talked it was a new world to him the hermit of the mousetrap to find himself exchanging ideas with men of his own intellectual standing and he certainly forgave jim his persistency in compelling his company this morning he forgot the patches in his clothes among such gentlemen as clarke and charlie and for the first time in his life felt himself superior to his natural diffidence and reserve who could help being at his ease where charlie was he kept up a running fire of chaff at his old schoolfellow for which occasionally the others came in and if it be true that laughter is a good digestive jim hallidays breakfast that morning must have agreed with the five who partook of it whos this coming suddenly exclaimed the latter as there came a sound of footsteps slowly ascending the stairs two of them said charlie perhaps its your tailor and your hatter with their little bills whoever it is theyre blowing hard said clarke they dont enjoy my gradus at parnassum said jim come in all of you he shouted the door opened slowly and there appeared to the astonished eyes of jim and his party a grave middleaged gentleman and still more grave and middleaged lady oh my prophetic soul my uncle and aunt groaned jim chapter twenty three how jims uncle and aunt spent a different sort of day from that which they had expected the apparition was indeed none other than jim hallidays dreaded uncle and aunt and the object of their visit was easy to guess they had in fact taken the long journey from cornwall as fast as express trains could bring them in order to remonstrate personally with their depraved nephew on the error of his ways they were evidently as astonished to find jims room full of visitors as jim on his part was to see them and they looked so taken aback and disconcerted that the party at once rose and offered to take their leave clarke and his friend actually did depart but jim still had presence of mind enough left to groan out an entreaty to charlie and my master that they would remainan appeal so pathetic that there was no resisting it charlie politely handed the good people to chairs while jim under cover of preparing a second edition of breakfast hastily arranged his plan of defence reader he whispered to my master whatever you do keep the talk going old man or its all u p then turning to his relatives he broke out this is a surprise how are you both upon my word youre looking grandly how kind to come and see me up here will you allow me to introduce my two friends ensign newcome and mr reader my uncle and aunt gentlemen the uncle and aunt bowed gravely and in a frightened sort of way in acknowledgment of the courteous greeting of the two young men it was clear they had expected to find jim alone and over a quiet cup of cocoa to reduce him to a sense of his wickedness it put them out of their reckoning quite to find that if they were to open fire at once it would have to be in the presence of these two gentlemanly and rather imposing strangers however they were too full of their mission to delay and so the uncle began it will be as well james that i should state to you not a word now till youve had some breakfast interrupted the wary jim my poor dear aunt must be simply fagged to death do take your bonnet off and come and sit here in the easychair let me make you some cocoa i know the way you take it exactly try those chops in front of you sir they are prime as charlie will tell you reader old man draw in and keep us company well i declare this is a jolly family party and whats the news down in your part of the world have you had a good harvest my uncle comes from cornwall charlie and he gave his friend a lugubrious wink as much as to say keep it up do you live near the sea thereupon began charlie pretty near that is about twenty miles off said the uncle looking at charlie under his spectacles my love the gentleman will laugh at you said his good lady i call twenty miles a long way i perfectly agree with you maam said charlie twenty miles is a good distance in this little island of ours but its curious how little they make of such a distance in a big country like india for instance where i am going there i am told it is quite a common thing for a man to be twenty miles from his nextdoor neighbour and yet be on constant visiting terms dear me said the uncle you dont know india i suppose sir inquired charlie no that is hes only read about it in books again put in the aunt and so my love youd better say at once you dont know anything about it well said charlie it depends a good deal on the books some books of travel are so vivid one almost seems to be in the country they describe erwhat did you say reader reader was quick enough to take this broad hint and keep up the talk to my mind the most interesting books are those which describe not so much places as people and their manners there are a great many books of this kind about india one i lately read was specially interesting and then to jims unbounded delight and gratitude george began calmly to give a review a quarter of an hour long of the work in question for the benefit of the two old people who as they listened became more and more impressed with the importance of their nephews friend and of the impossibility of obtruding their special grievance on the party at the present time indeed the aunt had almost forgotten the speech with which she had come prepared in her pleasure at hearing the young men talk and she even joined in the conversation in a manner which showed how she enjoyed it the uncle was still gloomy and appeared to be waiting the first favourable opportunity for coming to the point the opportunity however never occurred after a long and lively talk on all sorts of matters jim adroitly turned the conversation on to the subject of athletics by appealing to his uncle to add his voice to that of readers other friends in rebuking him for never taking any exercise look at his pale face he exclaimed isnt it a disgrace george bore this attack goodnaturedly and began to excuse himself but the uncle who had not before noticed his looks interrupted him by saying pardon me sir but i quite agree with james if is very wrong to cultivate the brain at the expense of the body this observation brought down charlies hearty approval who forthwith launched into a rhapsody on athletic sportsparticularly football appealing in every sentence to the uncle who now found himself fairly in the toils if it were for nothing more than the moral training it gives a man said charliefor the pluck manliness and endurance it puts into himwe couldnt overestimate the value of athletics could we sir noerthat is to say why look at jim here upon my word sir if youll excuse me saying it it does you the greatest credit the way he has been brought up to value healthy exercise why there are some parents and guardians who instead of encouraging that sort of thing would positively so far wrong their sons as to forbid it i cant make out that sort of training can you eh well possibly not faltered the uncle turning very red of course not and youll have your reward in seeing jim turn out a far better clergyman than your mollycoddles who dont know the way to look their fellowmen straight in the face jim old man youve had my cup up there ten minutes hand it up jim filled it to overflowing as a token perhaps of the gratitude of his heart towards his champion and forthwith handed it up and a propos of that pursued charlie having gulped down his coffee you are just come up here in the nick of time for theres a glorious footballmatch on today the uncle groaned and the aunt fidgeted in which jim is playing and no one deserves the honour better you must come and see it by all means eh jim rather said jim it would never do to miss it especially as newcome is playing against us the worst of it is as we are both engaged there will be no one to pilot you about i shall be very glad said readerthough if truth must be told his politeness cost him an effortif your uncle and aunt will let me im almost as great a stranger though in the town as they are you are very kind sir said jims aunt who had been long since gained over by the enemy we shall be most pleased to have your escort eh my love besides we shall help to keep you out in the fresh air for once but james she said i cant get over you and mr newcome being opponents in this match and yet such friends every one laughed at this and charlie confided to the good lady his fixed determination of breaking her nephews legs before the day was outa purpose which from the speakers point of view she could not help admitting was a laudable one thus the breakfast ended very satisfactorily for everyone except the uncle who had at last discovered the trap into which he had let himself fall from which however he could not with grace free himself three hours later the two worthies having seen many of the sights of cambridge with the advantage of readers escort found themselves with some hundreds of other spectators on the field in which the notable footballmatch of cambridge versus sandhurst was immediately about to begin jim hallidays uncle and aunt could hardly have denied that the thirty young men half of them in blue jerseys and half in red who were now strolling out onto the ground were as fine a body of youths as one could easily encounter in the course of a long days march the picture of health and physique they seemed almost like some of those heroes of old beside whom poor everyday man was wont to shrink into insignificance among the blues towered jim among the reds charlie two by no means the least noblelooking of the company how well james looks in that dress my love said the aunt my love could hardly dispute the fact so he said nothing but in his secret heart he began to doubt whether he had not taken an exaggerated view of the demoralising nature of athletic sports play was soon ordered and then amidst breathless silence the ball shot upward propelled by the vigorous kick of the sandhurst captain it is not my purpose to follow in all its details the famous match of which i was that day spectator my muse has other things to sing of besides rallies and charges scrimmages and drop kicks touchdowns and passings to me the game was chiefly interesting as it was interesting to jim halliday and charlie newcome but as during the first part of the match both these worthies were what they would call out of itthat is on outpost dutyi found the company i was in better worth studying than the ups and downs of the football when the game first began the two good people gazed in silent astonishment it always takes some time to understand the humour of a footballmatch from outside and jims uncle and aunt consequently for a time could make nothing out of the constant succession of charges and scrimmages of which they were witnesses presently however with the aid of their own observation and the remarks of people around them they came to appreciate the sport better and grew proportionately interested after a time the interest grew to excitement and excitement found relief in speech theres that little redhaired fellow got it again exclaimed the aunt see how he runs wait a bit cried the uncle that fellow there will catch himno he hasntjust look at him theres smartness for you ah hes down but another of the blues has got the ball cried the aunt starting on tiptoe well to be sure five onto one what a shame and so they kept up a running commentary on the fortunes of the game much to georges amusement and that of those near us now and then the uncle appeared suddenly to recollect himself and would come out with a grunt of disapproval once for instance when by a sort of common impulse the whole of the players engaged in one of the scrimmages fell to the ground he was hardy enough to ejaculate disgraceful hold your tongue my love broke in his wife you know very well youd like to be in it yourself if you were a boy i would after that the uncle whatever he thought said nothing the sides appeared to be very evenly matched so much so that when halftime was called neither had gained the least advantage just as the sides were changing over preparing to renew the contest a man came running up to where our party stood and called out will anyone lend me a watch mine has stopped this man was the timekeeper for cambridge and indeed was no other than clarkes friend one of the breakfastparty that morning here is one cried george recognising him and unfastening me from his ribbonchain the next moment i was hurrying towards the goals in my borrowers hands i had now nothing for it but to attend closely to the game for the old gentleman and lady were too far away for me to be able to observe them any further the ball was started again and i had the satisfaction of seeing that both jim and charlie were in new posts which promised a better chance of sport and so it happened hardly had the first scrimmage been formed when jim was seen slipping out of it with the ball under his arm making straight for the sandhurst goal he was quickly stopped however and after a desperate encounter the ball got free and rolled out of the crush towards where charlie stood he not waiting to pick it up went at it with a flying kick up flew the ball amid cheers and shouts right over the heads of the players and had it not been for the promptitude of the cambridge backs it might have got behind their goal and now as if every one knew the time was getting short the play became harder than ever many a time did i catch sight of my two randlebury friends in the thick of the fight sometimes hand to hand sometimes separated by a living wall of humanity but always doing their work and straining for the one object the time went on the man who held me looked at me now oftener than he had done hitherto and presently when i pointed to five minutes to four he cried out to a player near him five minutes more that player was charlie newcome and i saw his face flush as of old and knew he at any rate intended to make the most of the brief time remaining but two of the minutes were gone before his chance came then there was a cry and all eyes turned towards him for there came the ball flying straight to where he stood in a moment he had it and started to run it was a desperate chance but charlie was ready for desperate deeds shout rose on shout and cheer on cheer as first one then another of the enemy was overturned or dodged the more he achieved the less his enemies ventured against him and he dashed through their forwards and between their quarterbacks next moment with a mighty swoop their halfback fell to the earth and now there are but two men to pass and one of these is jim halliday the avenging host follows in hot haste behind but the issue of the fight lies with these two see the grin of joy on jims face as he throws away his cap and watches his dear enemy advance it was as if a trumpetcall had suddenly sounded in the ears of two old chargers and to them that moment the world was all contained in the space which severed them straight as an arrow rushed charlie firm as a rock waited jim nor had he long to wait with a bound and a howl his enemy leapt at him and next moment the two were locked in an embrace the shock of which even i could distinctly hear oh shades of randlebury i did your school every turn out two finer men than this pair of struggling straining rival friends the collision occurred close to the goalline and a moment afterwards a cry of maul proclaimed that they had in their struggle crossed the line and that consequently in accordance with the law of the game the contest for the ball must be decided by these two alone without aid or hindrance from the breathless friends and foes who stood round a fair field and no favour a ring was formed and as my heart beat rapidly on towards the critical moment these two strained every nerve to get the advantage for his side before time should be called bravo our man cried one stick to it newcome shouted others now you have it halliday called out a third never was duel before the walls of troy more desperate the crowd burst in onto the field and thronged round foremost among whom jims aunts voice was heard crying out shrilly well i never its james and mr newcome my love how hot they are it was evident the contest in which the two youths were engaged was one not destined to end before time was up i pointed to within half a minute of the fated hourand it would take far longer than that for even so powerful a champion as jim to wrest the ball from charlies defiant grasp the timekeeper turned away from the rivals and held me up on went my hand and on went the struggle now newcome one tug more bravo our man youll do it yet times up no side then rose those two from the earth and immediately the astonished jim felt himself embraced before the whole multitude by his aunt well james and how do you feel after it all hungry replied jim so ended the famous match after that jim had no more trouble from his uncle and aunt on the subject of athletics which they were fain to admit were a branch of science beyond their comprehension charlie started that same night for london with the intention of making one more effort to help tom drift at all hazards i meanwhile was restored to the possession of my lawful owner who returned to his studies in the mousetrap sitting up all night i am sorry to say to make up for the loss of the day chapter twenty four how george reader went up for his final examination and left me behind him old man youre overdoing it these words were uttered by jim halliday one evening two years after the events related in our last chapter to his friend george reader as the two sat together in jims rooms at saint georges time had wrought changes with both my master had secured the scholarship for which he had worked so hard during his first years residence and no longer inhabited the mousetrap his present quarters were the rooms immediately above those in which he was at this moment sitting and it is hardly necessary to say that the two friends were constantly in one anothers society george though still retaining much of his shyness had made many acquaintances at his college but jim was his only friend the two had their meals together attended lectures together worked together and though a greater contrast in all respects could hardly have been possible were fairly inseparable at the present moment they were both working hard for the grand tripos examination which was to close their college career every one said george would stand high in this and jim since he had taken to hard reading was expected to pass too though how none of his friends cared to prophesy they were working hard on the evening in question when jim suddenly shutting up his books and pushing back his chair exclaimed old man youre overdoing it george looked up from his work surprised at the interruption alas his pale face and sunken eyes testified only too forcibly to his friends protest i who knew him best and saw him at all times had watched with grief the steady and persistent undermining of his health at no times robust and dreaded to think what might be the result of this protracted strain on his constitution i tell you youre overdoing it old man and you must pull up suppose we talk of that afterwards said george not at all retorted the dogged jim just shut up your books reader and listen to me ill listen to you jim but dont make me shut up my books what have you got to say just this youre doing too much i can see it everybody can see it do you think i cant see your eyes and your cheeks do you think i cant hear you blowing like really began george listen to me went on jimblowing like an old brokenwinded horse yes you may laugh but i mean it do you think i dont know youve never been out of doors ten minutes that you could help for six months and that you have even given up the organ thats true groaned george leaning back in his chair of course its true and its equally true that youll smash up altogether if this goes on much longer then what will be the use of all your achievements what will be the good of them to your father and mother for instance when you are knocked up i must work up to the tripos now pleaded george its only a fortnight my dear fellow how you talk as if you werent certain of a first class even if you were not to look at another book between now and then im not at all certain said george anxiously yes you are and if you hadnt worked yourself into an unhealthy morbid state you would know it no old fellow weve never quarrelled yet and dont let us begin certainly not why should we we shall if i dont get my way now tell me what time did you go to bed last night three i believe no it wasnt it was four for i heard you over head and the night before it was three and the night before that if i mistake not you didnt go to bed at all eh george smiled but said nothing well said jim putting down his foot this must be stopped you may work till ten every night but then you must go to bed or you and i will fall out jim looked so grave as he said this that george was bound to take it in the earnest way in which it was meant a long argument ensued george pleaded jim bullied and at last my master was obliged to promise to give over work at twelve every night for the next fortnight but more he would not promise no persuasions could tempt him out of doors for more than a hurried five minutes walk or induce him to yield to the fascinations of the organ as the days went on too he grew more and more despondent about his own chances and implored more than once to be released from his promise but jim was inflexible and held him grimly to his engagement youre certain to be among the first three he said over and over again and if youll only give yourself two days rest you may be first yes of the third class mournfully replied my master i tell you what jim it isnt fair to bind me down to a promise i made almost under compulsion and for fear of making you angry its quite fair and you would make me angry if you didnt stick to it why my dear fellow has it ever occurred to you im in for the same tripos as you and im not behaving as ridiculously as you you are safe to be in the second class said george i wish i were as safe of a second as you are of a first but i wouldnt kill myself to be senior classic you forget how important it is for me to take a good place it is far more important to retain your health think what a difference it would make at home if i got a fellowship what a difference it would make if you had to go to a hospital what a pity when i have the chance not to use it what a pity when you have the chance to throw it away by knocking yourself up surely four days cant make any difference then why not stop work now and take a rest it was plain to see these two would never agree and so the time went on until the date of the examination arrived the night before the two friends met in georges room george was in low spirits nervous and fretful it was plain to see his friends protest had come too late to be of much use for he had grown more and more worn every day and the additional hours spent in bed had only been a source of worry and vexation jim on the other hand was doing his best to keep up not his own spirits only but those of his friend his chances of a second class were as momentous to him though he would not admit it as his friends of a first and he too was experiencing though in a less degree that heartsinking which so often characterises the eve of an examination you are not going to work tonight said he to my master i think i must said george wearily and putting his hand to his forehead it cant be any earthly good now said jim so lets forget all about it for a bit and talk of something else forget all about it george smiled in a melancholy way at the words but nevertheless he was not well enough to contest the point and by the way added jim cheerily ive got a letter from newcome you remember newcome george the man who played for sandhurst against us two years ago i think youll like to hear there was one in the room whether george liked it or not who was dying to hear it hes just gone out to india you know to join his regiment heres his letter he said producing it and nervously glancing at george to see if he appeared interested shall i read it yes please said george slowly its not a long one dear jim he says i wish you were out here with all my heart i should at least have one fellow to talk to among all these strangers i had a decent enough passage father ocean was on his good behaviour and the vessel was a snug one we came in for rough weather in the persian gulf but it didnt afflict me much and i landed here two days ago safe and sound i reported myself to our colonel yesterday and was introduced to my fellowofficers some of them are decent fellows though perhaps hardly in your and my line i had been told the officers of our regiment were a rackety lot but i dont see much sign of that yet its awfully dull here and i would give a lot to be up in your rooms at georges sprawling in your easy chair and talking over randlebury days i suppose you will soon be in for your final good luck be with you my boy remember me in your will if you get made a fellow i suppose the man i met in your rooms onceread i believe his name waswill be first talking of that day have you heard lately of tom drift i shall always be glad i went up to town that night and found him out though i lost him again so soon i inquired everywhere when i was last in town but nothing was known of him except that he was supposed to have been engaged in some but thats all about an old schoolfellow and wont interest you we expect to be ordered upcountry pretty soon now and meanwhile have liberty to amuse ourselves pretty much as we like but as far as i can see cards unfortunately seem the only recreation in which the officers indulge however i shall be kept busy with drill and being junior officer expect i shall be for some time fag of the regiment mind you write as soon as ever you get this and a regular yarn i have had to write this in a hurry and in a room where a noise is going on by next mail you shall get a full true and particular account of all the doings sayings and adventures of yours as ever cn im afraid said jim as he folded up the letter it will be rather dull out there forhullo this ejaculation was caused by seeing that george was sitting motionless with his elbows on the table and his face buried in his hands whats the matter he said getting up and laying his hand on his friends arm george looked up suddenly with a scared face which frightened jim old man arent you well said the latter anxiously ehoh yes im all right whywhy do you ask but i say jim this room is close lets go out and take a turn in the big court jim in sore perplexity complied and for an hour those two paced the flags round the great quadrangle george was himself again much to jims relief and suffered himself to be sent uncomplainingly to bed at ten to bed but not to sleep all night long i heard him toss to and fro vainly endeavouring to recall greek and latin lines or some other fragment of his studies at about six he dozed fitfully for an hour and then came the knock at the door which summoned him from his bed to the first day of his ordeal i would rather not dwell on those examination days for i could tell if no one else could that my master was really ill and was only prevented by sheer excitement from succumbing at any moment as day by day passed i could see the effort becoming more and more difficult the nights were worse than the dayssleepless feverish distracted it was evident this could not go on for long the last day of the examination arrived and my master was in his usual place in the senate house his pen flew swiftly all the morning along the paper and one by one a triumphant tick was set against the printed questions before him i could see no one as well employed as he jim at a distant desk was biting the end of his pen and looking up at the ceiling other men sat back in their seats and stared with knitted brows at the paper before them others buried their fingers in their hair and looked the picture of despair but still my master wrote on it wanted half an hour to the time of closing when he reached the last question on the paper i saw his lips curl into a smile as he dashed his pen into the ink and began to write then suddenly it dropped from his fingers and his hands were clasped to his forehead he made no motion and uttered no cry men went on with their work on each side of him and professors at their desks never turned his way i looked wildly towards jim he sat there biting the end of his pen and scowling at the question before him but for a long time never looked our way at last his head turned and in an instant he was at his friends side others came round too and offered help among them my poor master was borne from the hall and carried to his rooms and that evening it was known all over the university that reader of georges had been taken ill during the tripos examination and now lay delirious in his rooms in college every one believed the attack was but a slight one but i feared the worst i knew how systematically and fatally my masters constitution had been undermined by the work of the last three years and felt sure it could never rally from the fierce fever which had laid him low and it never did the fever left him in due time and his mind ceased to wander but every hour his strength failed him his parents and jim and sometimes his old friend the rector would constantly be about his bed and to all of them it soon became evident what little hope there was of his recovery indeed he must have guessed it too one day as jim sat with him a faint shout was heard below in the quadrangle whats that inquired george ill see said jim and he went lightly from the room presently he returned with a face almost beaming its good news he said they were reading the result of the tripos and where are you asked george you are first said jim proudly where are you repeated george i am twelfth in the first class yes that is good news old fellow that shout was in your honour you know our college is as proud as anything to have the first man george smiled feebly and for a long time both were silent then george said you were right jim after all if i had listened to you i should have been wiser never mind old man youll know better another time i shall never have the chance jim dont say that george every one hopes youll get better george smiled again then said jim you will look after my father and mother wont you you know ive got a little money now and they will be comfortably off but youll go and see them now and then jim laid his hand on the wasted hand of his friend and jim i want you to take my watch when im gone i always valued it as much as anything and id like you to have it poor jim could say nothing he only gave another pressure of his friends hand then presently mrs reader returned to the room and he slipped away the end was not long in coming one afternoon as the four friends he loved most stood round his bed george opened his eyes and said listen what is it lad whispered the father an organsomewhereopen the window they opened the window but the only music out there was the chirping of birds in the trees and the distant footfalls of passersby listen there it is he said again what is it playing asked the clergyman a new tune and almost as he spoke the words he closed his eyes for the last time on earth chapter twenty five how i fall into the hands of an old friend boys may imagine with what astonishment jim halliday discovered on receiving the legacy bequeathed him by his dead friend that i was the very watch which years before he had known so familiarly as the property of charlie newcome at first he could not believe it and marvelled how any two watches could be so much alike then he discovered the cn scratched long ago inside which he well remembered and further inquiries enabling him to trace me back to the muggerbridge silversmith and from him to the pawnbrokers sale in london he had no doubt left that i was actually the watch of which nothing had been heard since tom drift owned me my new master did not long remain in cambridge after the death of his friend he left the university in many respects a more thoughtful and earnest man than he had entered it and in leaving it set himself honestly and faithfully to the work for which he had prepared and on which his heart was fixed i shall not follow him through all the labours of his first village curacy which lasted a year during which time many people learned to love the manly openhearted young clergyman and to bless the day when he had been sent among them at the end of a year he was removed to the charge of a church in a distant large seaport where everything was in strangest contrast with the scenes he had just left instead of simple villagers and rustics his work now lay amongst labourers and artisans of the poorest and lowest class instead of fresh country air he had now to breathe the vitiated air of close courts and illkept streets and instead of an atmosphere of repose and innocence he had now to move in an atmosphere of vice and disorder from which very often his soul turned with a deep disgust still he worked manfully at his post with a bold heart ready to face any hardship in the service of his master and never weary of striving by the spirits help to bring into the hard lives around him the elevating joys which they alone know who can call christ the saviour theirs one day an adventure befell him which had a strange bearing on my own fortunes and the fortunes of more than one of my several masters the gaol chaplain at seatown had recently died and during the interval necessary for appointing a successor jim was asked and undertook to add to his other labours that of visiting the prisoners confined there it was melancholy and on the whole monotonous work for the persons whom he thus attended were mostly stupid ignorant beings on whose hardened souls it was difficult indeed to make the slightest impression they listened sulkily to what the chaplain had to say but to all appearance neither understood nor cared about a single word and he had the disappointment of noticing week after week and month after month scarcely a sign of good rising out of his labours in the case of any one of them one day the governor met him as he was about to pay his customary visits oh goodmorning sir youll find a new customer today the gaol governor you will observe spoke about his prisoners in a very commercial sort of way yes and a queer one too he added he doesnt look like one of our regular customers what is he imprisoned for he was drunk and quarrelled with a sailor on the quay and pushed him into the water i believe was the sailor drowned no they fished him out but this gentleman has got six months for it he seems very down about it so id like you to see him all right i will make a point of visiting his cell goodmorning and jim went on his round thinking very little about the governors communication presently he came to the gallery in which the new prisoners cell was and asked the turnkey to show him the door no use you agoing in there muttered that functionary why asked jim he do swear so as i never hear a cove swear afore ah said jim and i suppose youve heard a good deal too in your time so you may say but this here young fellow comes out with it as if hed skin you alive well i must see him let me in please when the door was opened the prisoners back was turned nor did he alter his position as jim entered the cell there was undoubtedly something unusual about the man his figure was not that of a labourer or a rough nor was his attitude one of stolid brutishness such as the chaplain had grown only too familiar with jim stood a moment irresolute and then said may i speak to you friend the man turned himself and without raising his eyes from the stone floor poured out a volley of curses which fully justified the turnkeys description jim started and uttered a quick exclamation but it was not at the curses terrible as they were no his amazement was of another kind altogether for in the face and voice of this unhappy speaker he was forcibly reminded of one he once knew in very different scenes as the man went on he watched him keenly and earnestly he heeded not the oaths or the taunts or the threats which flowed from his lips but as word followed word and gesture gesture and look look he became gradually convinced that the resemblance was more than imaginarythat indeed this blaspheming convict was one whom he had once known and still remembered walking up to him and laying his hand on his shoulder jim said quietly tom drift do you remember me the man started as for an instant he raised his eyes then letting them drop once more he growled thats not my name i dont know you let me alone jim more convinced than ever now did the wisest thing he could in leaving the cell without another word well said the turnkey with a halftriumphant grin as they turned to leave the gallery wasnt i right didnt he give you half a dozen as pretty bits of language as you ever heard do not speak to me about it please replied jim more tartly than he had been ever known to speak to any one he did not return to the gaol for a week and then the first visit he paid was to the new prisoners cell he entered it anxiously and not without misgivings tom drift was sitting on his little bench with his head in his hands may i come in said jim nervously tom neither spoke nor raised his head and jim quietly stepped in it was evident the interview of a week ago had had its effect on tom drift he seemed as he sat there like a man who would fain lose himself if he only knew how he never once raised his head from his hands or uttered a syllable while jim sat and talked to him the latter knew better than to return to the topic which had so startled the prisoner a week ago and contented himself with mere kindly talk and the reading of a short passage of scripture all this tom suffered without interruption stirring neither head nor foot all the time now goodbye said jim rising dont get to think you have no friends the man fidgeted impatiently and next moment jim was out in the gallery whats that mans name he inquired of the turnkey dykes and i tell you what mr halliday he open this door please my man interrupted jim by way of cutting him short during the week which followed jim was restless and out of spirits he seemed unable to settle down to anything and it was evident his heart was ill at easewhy it was easy to guess he had found tom drift and there was a chance of rescuing him but how to do it how to approach one who was ashamed of his own name and who repelled with an oath every offer of help long and earnestly did my master think over the matter he also wrote a long letter to charlie telling him all and promising to do all that could be done for the poor prodigal during the days that intervened before his next visit too he made as careful and full inquiries about tom as it was possible to do the poor fellow had come to seatown a month before and very shortly became a familiar loafer on the quays no one knew where he came from or why he was in seatown unless indeed he expected to be able to conceal himself on some vessel going abroad jim found out the lodging house where he he had lived but was unable to hear anything there to throw light on what he had been doing or whence he had come one man said he had found him once down by the waters edge looking as though he intended to throw himself inand the man who gave him drink at the publichouse remembered himand the man whom he had assaultedbut that was all wretched enough was the picture it presented of a hopeless friendless vagabond weary of life yet not daring to die and finding his only solace in deeper degradation tom was walking to and fro in his cell the next time jim called it was almost the first time i had been able to get a view of his face and oh how changed it was not merely that it looked pale and worn with bloodshot eyes and hectic cheeks but there was a scared despairing look there which fairly shocked me dissipation and shame and want had all set their mark there alas how soon may the likeness of god be degraded and defaced he continued to walk to and fro as jim sat down and began to read but i could see he more than once darted a quick glance from under his clouded eyebrows at my master i could tell by the beating of the latters heart that he had made up his mind not to leave this morning without an effort to speak to tom of old times and i trembled for the result of his venture it seemed impossible to say a word while tom continued to walk up and down his cell like a caged beast in his den and jim saw that every moment his opportunity was becoming less likely will you stand still and listen to me a moment he said at last tom growled out an oath and halted in front of him be quick said he im not going to preach said jim i want you to look at something i want to look at nothing muttered tom beginning to walk again but you must you shall look at it exclaimed jim starting at once to his feet tom stopped short suddenly and turned upon him like a hunted animal but jim neither faltered nor quailed he walked resolutely up to the poor fellow and suddenly drawing me from his pocket held me out towards him saying look at this tom drift tom knew me at once and i never saw a man change as he did that moment the savage scowl vanished from his face and a sudden pallor came to his hollow cheeks a trembling seized him as he held out his hand to take me and but for jims support he would hardly have remained standing my master led him gently to the bench and putting me into his hand said ill leave it with you till tomorrow old fellow goodbye i heard the key turn in the door behind him and counted his retreating footsteps down the gallery and then became fully conscious where and in whose charge i was and now an old familiar sound rang in my ears once more be good to tom drift long long had i ceased to believe it possible that the chance of obeying my dear first masters request would ever again come to me but here it was i lay in the prodigals trembling hands and looked up into his troubled face and heard his deepdrawn sigh and felt that there was still something left for me to do no one disturbed tom drift and me that night jim had explained enough to the governor to gain permission for me to remain in the poor fellows company till next day and i need hardly say i never left his hand memories of better days of noble friends of broken vows crowded in upon him as he sat bending over me that night daylight faded but still he never stirred the governor made his nightly round but he never took his eyes off me and when it was too dark to see me he held me clasped between his hands as tenderly as if i had been a child i cannot and would not if i could describe all that passed through tom drifts soul that night what struggles what remorse what penitence once he murmured charlie newcomes name and once he whispered to himself in the words of the parable he had so lately heard no more worthy no more worthy save for this he neither spoke nor moved till an early streak of dawn shot through the grated window and fell upon us then he turned and knelt with me still clasped in his hands and so that night and with it the crisis of tom drifts life was passed there was no more difficulty now for jim halliday tom even gave me up when he heard how i had come into my masters possession then he asked about charlie and jim told him all he knew and so the weeks went on and hope once more lit up tom drifts face how could i help rejoicing in the share i had had in this blessed work of restoration alas how fleeting is this worlds satisfaction a short time afterwards only a week or so before the termination of tom drifts imprisonment my master was returning home from the gaol tired out after his days work his way lay over a place half brickfield half common across which a narrow footpath went we had got half way over when suddenly a dreadful sensation seized me i was slipping through the bottom of my pocket though i had a watered ribbon attached to me my master always carried me loose in his waistcoat pocket with never a suspicion of the hole that was there but now that hole seemed suddenly to expand in order to let me through lower and lower i slipped i tried to scream i endeavoured to attract my masters attention but all in vain he strode unconsciously on never giving a thought to me or my peril i held on as long as i could then i dropped if only i could have fallen on his foot or struck his knee as i descended but no i slid quietly down scarcely grazing his trousers and just out of the reach of his boot for a moment i hoped wildly he would see me as i lay at his feet alas he walked heedlessly on leaving me on my back on the footpath powerless to cry after him and not daring to guess what would become of me in fact reader i was lost chapter twenty six how i was unexpectedly enlisted in a new service in company with an irishman the first thing i was conscious of after partially recovering from the agony mental and bodily of my late accident was a sharp tugging at my handle watch i say watch i heard a voice whisper whats to be done it was the watered ribbon how should i know i growled if you had done your duty we should never have been here one is always ready to blame somebody for everything that happens amiss oh yes i dare say it replied if you hadnt poked your nose into that hole we should never have been here i did not like being thus talked to by a disreputable piece of watered ribbon and so kept a dignified silence whats to be done presently repeated my companion giving me another rude tug at the collar hold your tongues if weve nothing to say was my curt reply oh but ive a lot to say went on this irrepressible chatterbox in the first place will you be silent said i angrily isnt it bad enough to be down here all through your carelessness but its not through my carelessness it was through the hole in the pocket you got down here if you had half the sense of a of a nickel watch let us say said the watered ribbon losing his temper and that would be precious little well if you had half the sense of a blade of grass you would have been able to prevent it but you see i hadnt half the sense of a blade of grass or a quarter or an eighth or a sixteenth if i had i should have known better than to lend my moral support to a goodfornothing tarnished ill regulated mendacious piece of britannia metal that chooses to call itself a silver watch ha ha what do you think of that what i thought of that this impudent ribbon was not destined then to hear for there came at that moment a sound of approaching footsteps across the field which made us both hold our breaths unless the comer whoever he was could get sight of us he was sure to tread right on the top of us luckily the moon was out and with her aid i made myself as bright as possible the footsteps belonged to a youth not certainly oppressed by melancholy to judge by the tune he was whistling or very infirm to judge by the pace at which he advanced he came nearer and nearer and in another step would have been upon me when suddenly both he and the whistling halted he stooped and with an exclamation of surprise picked me up man alive an its a watch hout boys theres luck for yez so saying he thrust me and the ribbon into a pocket crowded with all sorts of oddments and walked on more rapidly than ever i was too bewildered at first by my narrow escape and the sudden change in my fortunes to pay much heed to my new quarters but presently that everlasting ribbon jerked my neck roughly and called out in a loud whisper i say watch hes an irishman oh said i as briefly as i could yes and theres a lucifer here tells me hes no better than he ought to be what do you think of that i think you and he ought to understand one another if thats the case growled i unable to resist the temptation of a sarcastic reply ho ho thats pretty good for you watch however there are some folk who are not as good as they ought to be let alone better after a brief pause he began once more hes young only eighteen im told as no answer was necessary here i vouchsafed none and hes trying to get a job on some ship theres a nice lookout what a poor figure youd cut if you went to sea i could not stand this probably because i knew it was true so i turned my back and in selfdefence bade good evening to an old pocketcomb which lay near me whew good evening whew replied he he had a curious way this comb of giving a sort of halfwhistle halfsigh between every few words he spoke i suppose you are an older resident here than i am i suggested by way of making myself agreeable no im not whew i belong to the other pocket whew i dont know why im here whew but make yourself at home whew i hear your master is going to sea said i not at all whew who told you that whew but i tell you what whew what i inquired at this moment our master stopped still in the middle of the road i looked out and saw that he was standing face to face with a fine soldierlylooking fellow in uniform who wore a cockade of ribbons on his shako good evening my lad said the soldier good evening capn said the youth not capn just yet said the other laughing call it sergeant well sargint good evening to ye sargint ive been looking for you all day that i have said the sergeant what me said my new master in astonishment well i was told to look out for the finest young fellow in the place and thats about the same thing the lad chuckled at this vastly and then said and what might ye be wanting me for gineral at all at all faith patrick said the sergeant adopting the irish brogue as if he had been a native to give yez a message from the quane just the quane shouted the irishman sure no other she wants your help my lad and she shall have it bless her what can i do at all arrah she wants yez to foight a blackguard or two thats guv her impidence they have im yer boy for a shindy where are they colonel not far off and by the way she sent ye this bran new shillin with her best respex to ye pat and sez im to axe ye what youll take to drink her health in so come along my lad patrick did come along and of course was duly and willingly enlisted by his new friend who promised him honour and glory and riches enough to make a commanderinchiefs mouth water my new master perhaps was fond of making himself out a greater simpleton than he really was at any rate he appeared to believe every word the recruiting officer told him and having no friends to say goodbye to and no luggage to pack up and no money unless he pawned me to spend he was ready for marching orders immediately to my surprise he showed no desire now to dispose of me what ud i want to give him up he said to himself as he held me in his hand shure hell be handy to tell the toime by on the faylde of battle and with this satisfactory assurance he put me back in his pocket which greatly to my relief was not the one which contained that asthmatic pocketcomb patrick had not to leave for his depot till next day and took a long stroll through the streets of seatown along with the recruiting officer this evening he was in high spirits and very proud of being a soldier so the sergeant had very little difficulty in keeping him in good humour indeed he stood that officer in good stead once for encountering a compatriot acquaintance a likely sort of fellow too he helped her majestys army to a fine recruit here larry ye blackguard called he heres a gentman axing for yez larry a hulking sheepish young irishman did not look particularly happy at this information and replied and whats to prevent him axing man dear and is that the way ye address one of the quanes foighting men spake to him meejor dear the dear meejor at this point took up the discourse faith he said till i saw patrick here i thought there wasnt a single boy in the place smart enough to wear a red coat but i see theres two of ye anyhow and the sergeant laughed loud and clapped larry on the back and told him it was a shame for him to be walking about in boots full of holes when he might be strutting up and down as fine as any gentleman in the place to say nothing of regular pay and quarters and all the chance of glory and patrick added his persuasions and quoted his own example as a great argument and between them larry let the shilling drop into his hand and the three went off to drink her majestys health and then continued their pilgrimage through the streets at one street corner there was a rush of people reading a newlyposted bill fancy my astonishment as i readl reward lost yesterday february th near seatown gaol an old silver watch of very little value to any one but the owner a piece of black ribbon was attached any one bringing the above to the reverend james halliday at quay street will receive l reward how my heart beat as our party halted in front of this announcement alas my new master was not a scholar and on satisfying himself the object of the peoples assembling was not a fight he took no further interest in the matter but shouldered his way past with no more thought of me just at that moment than of the north pole that night as i lay in the dark in my new quarters i had leisure to think over the strange turn which my fortune had taken here i was in a town where three of those whom at some time or other i had called master were living one was a common prisoner one a hardworking curate and one a raw recruit of my other masters one was a london thief one lay in his grave and the other and best loved of all was far away in scenes and perils which i could not so much as picture to myself what would become of me i knew not but i could not help feeling the best part of my life was spent for who could be to me again what some of those whom i now remembered had been i had arrived thus far in my meditations when i all of a sudden turned faint i knew what the matter was at once and what did this lump of an irishman understand about watchkeys and winding up i called faintly to the watered ribbon im running down down where ejaculated he in wellfeigned alarm wretch gasped i somebody ought to wind me up up where again asked my unsympathetic tormentor brute was all i could say thats just the way with you clever people began the ribbon as long as you are all right no names bad enough for poor people like us but as soon as ever you get into trouble here with a groan i ran down and was spared the end of his speech i only had a vague dim idea of what took place for the next few months i was conscious of long railway journeys and arriving at a big drearylooking sort of prison where there was nothing but soldiers all day long the place rang with bugle notes and words of command and all night my master slept in a great room with a lot of noisy men of whom i have an impression he was not the most silent in due time he put a coat over the waistcoat in which i lived and was mightily proud the first time he walked abroad in his new dress and so things went on for nearly a year but one day it was evident some great excitement had come to vary the monotony of our barrack life officers talked in clusters instead of drilling their men and the men instead of doing their ordinary work crowded into the long shed to talk over the news and it soon came out what the news was the regiment had been ordered to hold itself in readiness for immediate service at the seat of war in india what excitement there was what cheers and exultation what spirits the men were in and what friends every one became all of a sudden with everybody else among the rest my young masters blood rose within him at the thought of fighting he had grown sick of the dull routine of barrack life and more than once half repented his easy acceptance of the queens shilling but now he thought of nothing but the wars and his spirits rose so high that the sergeant on duty had to promise him an arrest before he could be reduced to order at night the room where we slept was a perfect babel men talked of nothing but the voyage and the campaign that was to follow and wished the marching orders had been for tomorrow instead of next week suddenly and i dont exactly know why my master remembered my existence and i heard him call out does any of you boys know anything about a watch at all duck downie does replied one or two voices duck downie me jewil will ye step this way just called out my master and cast your eye on my watch the gentleman rejoicing in the name of duck downie was a ferocious looking little fellow who had before he decided to devote his energies to the extermination of her majestys foes been a watchmakers apprentice he came forward at the invitation and cast his eye in the direction indicated it was evidently the first time he had known that paddy so much as owned a watch for he stared hard at me and then said with a knowing wink did he struggle much faith and he did a wee bit duck but so did i too ye see said paddy entering into the joke lets have a look at him said duck taking me and stripping the coat off my back give us the key the kay said paddy whose notions of a watchs interior were delightfully vague sure theres no kay here edward i will ye lend mister downie a kay the youth addressed as edward fumbled in his pocket and pulled out the key of his locker which he handed to my master thats the boy heres a kay duck darlint since ye want one duck was rude enough to laugh immoderately at thisso much so that my master who was unconscious of a joke grew quite angry ef thats all ye can dogape like an ould moneyboxi can do that as well myself so hand up the watch duck downie laughed again at this and then said i want the key of the watch puddinhead not this thing arrah its got no kay i tell ye what ud it want a kay for duck laughed again at this paddy said he next time you borrow a gentlemans watch be sure you ask im for the key do you hear you want the key to wind the thing upthats why he dont go paddy who had sense enough to see that mr downie knew more about a watch than he did held his peace and took no trouble to refute the imputation on the way in which he had come by me duck downie having with some difficulty borrowed a watchkey wound me up greatly to my delight and that of my master it was delicious to feel the blood tingling through my veins once more and to have my heart beat again with renewed animation my masters glee was only equalled by his astonishment he looked at first as if he suspected duck downie of being in league with supernatural powers but when that eminent mechanic took the trouble to explain to him the value of the operation he had just performed on me paddy without a word rushed out at the risk of all sorts of penalties into the town and knew no peace till he had possessed himself of a kay which henceforth became the inseparable companion of me and the watered ribbon chapter twenty seven how i made a long journey and reached the happiest moment of my life one morning in the autumn of the same year a small cluster of men standing on the deck of the troopship lizard as she tumbled lazily forward over the waves descried in the far horizon before them a dim low line of blue my master was one of this cluster and having recovered from the depression which had afflicted both his spirits and his stomach during the early part of the voyage now celebrated the discovery of india with a cry so outlandish and other manifestations of joy so extravagant one of which was pitching one of the sergeants caps overboard that he was instantly summoned before the officer in command and ordered to remain below for the next twelve hours this was i need hardly say a disappointment to both of us all day long we heard overhead the crowding of footsteps the clanking of chains and the banging about of baggage the men were paraded on deck and one or two servants down where we were were very busy polishing the officers swords altogether it looked as if we were not intended to remain an hour longer in bombay than was necessary before marching to the front indeed the arrival of a newspaper on board along with the pilot created such a ferment among the officers and men that it was evident something unusual had happened since we last heard the news when towards evening my master was allowed once more to come on deck we were not long in discovering the cause of all this the indian mutiny which had just broken out when we left england had suddenly assumed enormous and hideous dimensions the rebels taking advantage of their first success seemed to have gone mad with a most cruel madness helpless englishwomen and children had been massacred and outraged gallant englishmen overpowered by numbers had been put to shameful deaths one by one our strongholds had been surprised and captured and carrying all before them the traitors bade fair to leave england not so much as a foothold in india this was enough to make the blood of the tamest among us boil with indignation and as the dreadful truth bit by bit dawned on our gallant fellows their impatience became almost beyond control my master was in sad peril of another arrest by reason of his excitement show me the spalpeens show me em roared he almost beside himself let me at em duck ye blackguard let me at em and so saying he seized mr downie who happened to be standing near him and nearly shook the bones out of that unoffending heros body do ye hear roared paddy quite out of his senses i hear said downie coolly proceeding to take off his coat and tuck up his shirtsleeves as if he were going to wash his hands whats the gossoon about at all cried my master taken aback by this unexpected reply to his question ony going to smash you calmly replied the imperturbable duck beginning to sparso come on my lad that patrick would have joyfully accepted the invitation i have no doubt had not an accident at that moment befallen him a trolly coming up behind took him off his feet to recover himself he took a spring forward and landed full on the top of the junior ensign of the regiment a mild youth with a very little voice and for the next minute the two were rolling one on the top of the other over and over along the wet deck amid the laughter of everybody by the time paddy had picked himself up and helped the poor young ensign to his feet his ardour was sufficiently damped he apologised with as good grace as he could to his late victim and made very humble excuses to the sergeant in charge who fortunately for him had witnessed that the affair was an accident duck downie however with his coat off and his sleeves tucked up still awaited his man as if nothing had happened and seemed surprised that paddy was not as eager as before for the fray the latter however quite sobered by this time merely cried out in the hearing of everybody arrah downie darlint ye may put on your coat because i forgive you this onst but man dear dont do it again and was thereby considered by everybody to have had the best of the whole adventure under such dignified circumstances did we set foot on indian soil the reader will be surprised that i have never yet remembered that when i last heard of him charlie my first master was in india i did remember it often and oftenduring the voyage and after landing and yet i quite despised myself for imagining as i did that the next white face i saw would surely be his india is a big placea dreadfully big placeand the chances of finding any one particular person there are about as great as of discovering a needle in a haystack he might have left india long ago he might have fallen in the massacres of the past few months he might be somewhere right across the continent and so though i could not get rid of a vague sort of expectation during the first few days of my being in india i always laughed at myself for a simpleton for thinking such a chance possible however we had no time for thinking just then from the moment we landed in bombay and for a week or two afterwards we were continually on the move long forced marches under a broiling sun it was enough to wear out any ordinary troops but our men and the column to which they were now attached formed no ordinary body of men they were englishmen hastening to the rescue and nothing on earth could stop them it was strange how slowly the news of those stirring times came to our ears one day we heard with a horror that i can never describe of that foul massacre at cawnpore where in cold blood gentle english ladies and innocent children had been brutally massacred and their bodies flung into a well then the news came of the achievements of that wonderful army of relief led by havelock day after day came the news of his march on lucknow where our besieged fellowcountrymen lay every one knows of that heroic march inch by inch almost that handful of men fought their way fighting a battle a day and never yielding a step one day a horseman galloped into our camp in a great state of excitement as he flung himself from his horse he shouted something but we only caught the two words havelock lucknow it was enough lucknow was saved there rose cheer upon cheer at the news and shout upon shout men and officers alike waved their hats and shook hands paddy as usual let his feelings get the better of him and nearly broke larrys spine with the joyful thump he gave it indeed it is safe to say our men were almost as proud as if they had themselves achieved the relief presently however there spread a rumour that though lucknow was saved it was not yet relieved havelock had fought his way in but until help arrived he too would be a prisoner within its walls and almost in the same breath came the grand news our column was the one destined for this glorious work how our hearts beat what mattered it now how long the marches were and how grilling the sun lucknow was the cry and that magic word sustained us in every hardship and peril we reached cawnpore at last and there joined sir colin campbells force the sight of this house of murder was simply maddening to the men they left the place next morning with a sort of shudder and set their faces towards lucknow it was not till we were well on the march that i had leisure to look about me and notice how our force was increased several now regiments were with us and the commanderinchief and his staff and heavy guns and siege trains accompanied the march with the exception of a few skirmishes my master had yet to learn what a battle was we crept on halting sometimes and sometimes pushing on until one jubilant afternoon the distant walls of lucknow appeared in sight then indeed our brave fellows began to breathe again tomorrow would bring them to the city walls andwhat was equally after their heartsface to face with the enemy we bivouacked here for the night now it happened on this particular night that my master was on sentinel duty for the first time in his life and mightily proud of his charge there he stood as stiff as a poker with his rifle at his side and i verily believe would have thought nothing of running his bayonet through the body of the commanderinchief if he had presented himself without the password patrick was not a dreamer and as he looked across in the direction of lucknow i dont suppose his meditations were of the loftiest kind he knew there would be a fight tomorrow and so he was happy he knew duty might call him to action even tonight and so he kept a very sharp lookout at his post but otherwise his mind was profoundly untroubled it was not so with me on the eve of the battle i could not but feel that in a few hours i might be ownerless and in a dead mans pocket and as i looked back upon my strangely eventful life i sighed and half hoped if he were slain they would in mercy bury me with him and so end my cares once and for all little i knew it was scarcely ten oclock when paddy was startled by approaching footsteps they belonged to an officer of our force who was returning at this hour from an outpost paddy eyed him suspiciously and even when he gave the word looked disappointed at not having the privilege of using his bayonet upon him just as he was going on his way the officer turned and said in a voice which startled me is it ten yet my man why did the voice startle me i could not see the speakers face but as he spoke i fancied myself back in the randlebury schoolroom and my memory saw a brighteyed boy i had known once whom i could almost have believed to be the speaker of these few words strange what fancies take possession of one patrick as he had a watch and had by this time learned the mysterious art of telling the time was not the man to answer such a question as this at random hould my gun capn he said till i sthrike a light fancy a sentinel asking an officer to hold his gun i knew enough of military discipline to make me tremble at the thought of what would become of my unceremonious master but the officer instead of flying into a rage took the rifle and laughed that laugh reminded me more than ever of randlebury youre a pretty fellow he said is that the manners they teach you at home i axe yer pardon colonel but here the officer laughed againand oh how my heart beat as i heard him if i stay here much longer i shall get promoted to general i suppose said he look sharp and tell me the time patrick without another word produced a light the officers face was half turned as he did so and i could not catch his features but as he turned impatiently towards the sentinel the light fell full upon it and with a bound of astonishment i recognised in the swarthy soldierly officer before me no other than my oldest and dearest master charlie newcome of randlebury the strange presentiment then was truei had found him after so long a time but what if he should not see me what torment to be so near and yet so far and how was it likely he would take notice of a common privates watch and if he did how was it likely at this distance of time he would remember poor me jim i know had told him of the strange way in which i had come into his hands and would certainly have also told him about losing me he must therefore long ago have given up all thoughts about me or if he ever remembered me it would be as one dead my master took me out and held me up to the light itll be about five minutes past ten your honour by my watch thank you goodhullo he had seen me his eyes were suddenly riveted upon me and he seemed glued to the spot where he stood did your honour plaze to spake asked paddy proceeding to put me back into his pocket my old watch cried charlie springing forward and catching hold of my masters hand give it to me paddys surprise was unbounded at first he deemed the man mad then drunk then gradually it dawned upon him this was not an officer at all but a highwayman in disguise seeking to take advantage of his solitude to rob him in an instant he sprang back and seizing his rifle levelled the bayonet to within an inch of charlies heart now ye thievin blackguard said he move an inch and ill stick ye like a pig arrah but ye came to the wrong boy when ye thought to play your tricks on me stan still now or as sure as youre alive youre a dead man and he gave charlie a suggestive touch with the point of his weapon which showed plainly he had every intention of being as good as his word here was a predicament and i could do nothing to help charlie fairly penned in a corner was at a loss what to say or do he began in an angry strain dont be a fool sir do you howld yer tongue roared paddy giving another poke with his bayonet then charlie attempted to laugh which enraged the sentry all the more is it mock me ye would as well as rob me ye foulmouthed spalpeen you he cried i dont want to rob you put in charlie faith and ill see ye dont retorted the irishman listen to me an instant besought charlie the sorra a word ye shall say it all before the gineral the morrow for there ill take ye for some moments charlie stood in this awkward fix not daring to stir or even to speak and with every prospect of spending the night with a bayonet point within an inch of his body suddenly however a brilliant idea occurred to him if i really was his old watch as he fancied this man had possibly found me where halliday had lost me it was a bare chance every way but he determined to try it so you are from seatown he suddenly exclaimed the rifle literally dropped from the astonished sentrys hand who told ye that he almost shrieked never mind said charlie following up the advantage and softly stepping out of his corner its two years since you left isnt it patrick was dumfoundered this man must be in league surely with the powers of darkness now do you know why i want that watch said charlie sternly at the same time quietly picking up the dropped rifle the tables were fairly turned now the wretched patrick whose conscience had more than once smitten him about the way in which he had become possessed of me looked the picture of terrornot at the bayonet but at the man who held it he drew me from his pocket with trembling hands and holding me out at arms length cried arrah arrah take him gineral take him how was i to know you was the gentleman dropped him there whod have by this time charlie had seized me and taken me to the light in an instant he stripped me of my coat and there with bounding heart read his own initials scratched years ago with his own boyish hand in the dormitory of randlebury it is it he shouted my old watch who would have thought it possible then turning to the trembling paddy he said in a voice almost unsteady in its eagerness my man what will you sell me this watch for paddy looked more astonished than ever sure its your honours own it was once but its yours now but ill give you a tenpound note for him and a gold watch besides if youll let me have him back imagine paddys astonishment sure duck downie says its not worth thirty shillings who cares for duck downie shouted charlie pulling out his purse heres the money and if you come to lieutenant newcomes tent when you are off duty you shall have the watch and so saying and not waiting for another word he darted off with me still in his hands leaving paddy fairly stupefied with amazement and with only presence of mind enough left to pick up his rifle and make a royal salute to the retreating form of my first and last and dearest master chapter twenty eight how i saved my masters life and retired from active service i may with truth say i reached that night the happiest moment in my life indeed as the young officer walked on with me held tight in his hand it would be hard to say which of us two was the happier charlies soldier life had not turned out as happily as long ago he had pictured it to himself away from home and with comparatively few friends he had felt himself losing somewhat of his freshness and boyish enthusiasm and settling down rather to habits of a humdrum commonplace official books he had very few and congenial society still less quartered as he had been during the first two years in dull country stations he had grown weary of the routine of everyday life and longed for the sight of fresh faces fresh scenes fresh occupation after a while this desire was gratified in his removal to calcutta but if he had suffered from dulness and weariness before he was now in danger of going to another extreme in his first joy at getting back into lively society he rushed with ardour into all the attractions and gaieties of the capital not that charlie was a fellow ever to make the same mistakes as tom drift he never associated with companions he knew to be bad or allowed himself to be led into scenes which were in the slightest degree discreditable but he did enter rather too readily into the frivolities of his new quarters at the expense of his peace of mind his popularity was his greatest snare everywhere he went he became a favourite people were eager to get him to join their parties and he was often enough too goodnatured to refuse and thus charlie wasted much of his time and in the end found himself far more dissatisfied with himself than in the quiet monotony of his upcountry duties do not let me do him injustice reader in my account of him during those few weeks at calcutta he was gay but not fast frivolous though not dissipated his errors were errors of unprofitableness but never of viciousness even in his most frivolous moments he had never been anything but a gentleman and a good fellow still it had been unsatisfactory and he knew it to be so in his inmost soul in the midst of this life came the mutiny and like hundreds of others charlie leapt at the call of duty and flung to the winds all those attractions which had held him captive during the weeks of his idleness like hundreds of others his blood boiled at the tragedies of that awful time and now of all the rescuing host there was not one who loved his own life less or his countrys glory more than charlie newcome and thus it was with him when i found him but tonight whatever may have been the memories and hopes and regrets which secretly animated his breast in finding himself again possessed of his boyish treasure and the companion of so many of his happiest days charlie newcome had no leisure to sit down and spend his time in passive contemplation he had a report to make to his colonel and an important despatch to carry to the commanderinchief then there was the ammunition to be served out among his men and he had to superintend the process and there were the plans for next days assault to be talked over with his brother officers and the various detachments for that duty to be selected so that charlie was a busy man that night but with what a light heart he laboured among his occupations he did not forget the gold watch but had the satisfaction of making paddy the happiest man but one in the camp thus first with one thing then another the night wore on and when towards morning he lay down on his camp bed for a hurried rest he fell asleep like a child whistling one of the old randlebury songs and with me as of old under his pillow at the first note of the bugle he sprang from his couch and putting me in my old abode next his heart sallied out to see the preparations for the advance it was generally known we were to make a dash for the approaches to lucknow this day and at the prospect of the attack the troops hailed the signal to get under arms with enthusiasm it was plain to see by the alacrity with which the men worked that my master was a prime favourite in his own company indeed such was their promptitude that we stood ready and waiting long before the order to march arrived during this interval if charlie was seized with a desire to know the time once he was seized twenty times and each time a mere glance was not enough to satisfy him how natural it all seemed and how like old times then came the longedfor signal and with a cheer the men set their faces towards lucknow now the reader must not expect i am going to describe military operations for his edification i know nothing about columns and countermarches and echelons and skirmishing how could a watch hid under a scarlet jacket be expected to do so true i had eyes that could penetrate any number of scarlet jackets but what good was that when i knew about as much of the art of war as i did of candlemaking but there are some things in the events of that memorable day which i shall remember as long as i live after about an hours march we were suddenly halted and almost at the same moment there came the sullen boom of a gun ahead i could feel charlies heart leap at the sound it was the enemy at last and now the fate of lucknow was to be decided a horseman dashed up to the head of our column and called out to our colonel in a voice loud enough for us all to hear bring up your battalion next moment we were advancing in double quick time through a lane of troops to the front there two other regiments stood waiting and almost the instant we arrived the whole body moved forward at a run it was an exciting moment the enemys guns sounded louder and more frequent ahead and dropping shot at either side announced that our danger was not all in front the pace was kept up for a hundred yards or so until we reached a cluster of trees in whose shelter the column was halted to get breath the fire in front still kept up and through the smoke i thought i could discern the dim outline of a low building not five hundred yards distant at this moment charlie and the other officers were summoned to the front for orders they were brief and to the point straight for the fort there said the commanding officer the shortest way you can take your men it was an order that meant certain death to scores of those brave fellows yet when they had heard it they cheered as schoolboys cheer for a holiday again we stood waiting the officers with their swords drawn stepped in front the men quickly loaded and fixed bayonets and then came the shout forward as we cleared the trees we burst full in the face of the enemys fire for a moment the balls whizzed harmlessly over our heads then there was a crash on the ground before us and as we rushed on the men parted on either side to avoid stepping over a dying man it was awful and every step we took grew more and more fatal under that withering fire men went down by the dozen yet still the column rushed on the front rank broke into gaps which the rear rank men dashed forward to fill till they themselves fell and still on we rushed officers too everywhere to the front dropped one by one but still we never checked our pace the sullen walls of the fort stood clear before us and poured upon us an unceasing shower of bullet and ball in a minute our foremost men would be at the walls forward now follow me i heard charlie cry and looking round noticed for the first time that the captain of his company was missing the men cheered by way of answer and their run broke into a rush as they followed him under the guns others were at the fort before us and the storm had already begun heedless of wounds heedless of peril the men swept towards the breach and called on those behind to come on charlie was one of the earliest of our battalion there and already his feet were in the place and he was waving to his men to come up when i felt a dull crushing sensation my nerves collapsed my senses left me speech sight hearing all failed me in an instant a strange darkness came over me and then i was conscious of nothing when my senses slowly and wearily recovered i was still lying in my masters pocket in the place where he had fallen at the storming of the breach firing was still going on all around but the shouts of our men rose now from inside the fort instead of outside and what shouting it was the enemys guns ceased as if by magic and the distant sounds of firing showed plainly enough that the main body now that we had silenced the fort was resuming its march on lucknow all this flashed through me as my senses gradually returned and before even i had time to contemplate my own condition what a wreck i was a helpless cripple past all healing of no use to any one and utterly incapable of resuming the ordinary duties of life but almost before i could realise this another care flashed through my mind and drove out every other my master what of him there he lay motionless and pale with his blue eyes closed and a little stream of blood trickling down his chest could he be dead anxiously i listened if his heart still beat at first all seemed silent as death then there seemed a slight quiver and as i listened still a faint throb he lived still how i longed for help to come and before long it came two soldiers of charlies regiment came out of the fort and walked straight towards us it was close to the breach he dropped said one come on then said the other and we may be in time they were not long in finding the object of their search and leant eagerly over him hes dead poor fellow said the first shot right through the heart so he is said the other it must havewait a bit cried he in sudden excitement feel here tom quick hes alive yet oh if we could only get hold of a doctor is there one about at all not that i know of unless the major knows what to do just then there came up a gaunt man in an undress uniform who seeing that they knelt over a wounded man said is he alive its all he is sir replied one of the men and were wondering how to get a doctor to him let me see said the stranger approaching the body he knelt beside it and gently removed the coat from the wound it looks as if he must be shot through the heart stay a bit though heres a watch and he pulled me softly out of the pocket as he did so i looked up at him surely i knew his face surely somewhere i had seen that troubled frightened face before then i remembered seatown gaol could this be tom drift here in india and kneeling beside his old schoolfellows body it was indeed tom drift but he neither recognised me nor the wounded man before him indeed he was too busy examining the latters wound to look very closely at his face as he removed the waistcoat he uttered an exclamation of astonishment a most wonderful thing he said the bullet which must have been a spent one has struck his watch and turned aside a most wonderful escape and then he produced a box of instruments with one of which he probed the wound and after some trouble extracted the bullet then bandaging up the place he said he may do now but he has lost a lot of blood let him lie here a bit and presently if he seems better move him into the fort i will see him again this evening and so saying he passed on to the next prostrate figure towards evening the two men tenderly lifted their officer in their arms and carried him inside the fort where a rude hospital had been fitted up here charlie who after the extraction of the bullet and staunching of blood had shown symptoms of recovery opened his eyes and found himself able to say a few words to those round him and when they told him how i had probably saved his life his face lit up with a most triumphant smile and he asked that i might be put into his hand as he lay there scarcely strong enough to speak and fondling me in his fingers the doctor entered the hospital he came straight to charlies bed my masters eyes were closed when tom first reached his side and i could see by the face of the latter that he was still as far from recognising his old schoolfellow as ever but directly tom softly lifted the clothes in order to examine his wound the patient woke and opened his eyes they rested for a moment on the doctors face and then with a sudden flush and start he half raised himself in his bed and exclaimed tom drift is it you the doctor thus unexpectedly hearing his own name pronounced turned pale and started back as if he had been shot the scared terrified look returned to his face and for an instant he seemed as if he would rush from the place but only for an instant as he looked again on the face of his patient a strange expression came over his own wonder doubt joy succeeded each other in rapid succession and then all of a sudden it flashed upon him who this was charlie he exclaimed trembling with astonishment and next moment the poor prodigal was on his knees beside his friends bed sobbing with his head buried in his hands dont laugh at him reader for thus forgetting himself tom drift had been through many trials you know nothing about and out of those trials he had come broken in spirit and as humble as a child you might have had more regard for appearances perhaps and controlled your emotion genteelly but as i have said before tom drift was not anything like so strongminded as you so he knelt there and sobbed and charlie as he lay took his hand into his own and held it presently he said softly tom tom looked up and rose to his feet what old fellow look here tom said charlie showing me at the sight of me bruised and battered as i was toms feelings overcame him again he seized me eagerly and looked long and tenderly into my face then his tears came again and once more he sunk on his knees at charlies side and buried his face in his hands the place was getting dark the noise of voices outside and the distant roar of guns slowly died away the guards for the night were called out and one by one soldier and invalid fell asleep after their hard days toil but tom drift never moved from charlies bedside nor did charlie by word or movement disturb him in the silence of that night i seemed to be back in the pastwhen years ago i first knew these two the dreary hospital changed in my imagination into the old randlebury dormitory these beds all round were occupied not by wounded soldiers but by soundlysleeping boys worn out with sports or study and the two between whom i lay were no longer suffering men but the lighthearted lads of long ago i could almost fancy myself ticking through the silent watches and when now and then the fingers that held me closed over me or fondled me tenderly i could almost have believed i heard the low sweet whistling of an innocent boy as he furtively turned in his waking moments to his fathers precious gift it all seemed so strangely natural that as i woke from my dream it required an effort to remember where i really was all was silent around me i peered first at my master then at tom drift they were both asleepsleeping perhaps as simply as ever they did in those bygone daystom kneeling still by the bedside with his head upon his arms and charlie turned towards him with one hand upon his friends and ii lay between them thus the sultry indian night passed and then at the little window opposite there came a faint gleam of light charlie woke first and laying his hand gently on toms arm said tom drift old fellow with a start and a bound tom was awake and on his feet staring in a bewildered way round him at last his eyes fell on charlie and he remembered where he was i was asleep and dreaming he said so was i said charlieand i could almost guess what their dreams had been now tom said charlie you must look to my wound my poor boy exclaimed tom to think i have forgotten it all this time its not worth bothering about after all said my master but see tom the day is breaking ay said tom looking down with a new light in his weary eyes the day is breaking chapter twenty nine which brings my adventures to a close reader be my companion in one scene more and my story is done a month or two ago there was a grand merrymaking at the house of one charles newcome esquire late captain in her majestys army to celebrate the tenth birthday of his son master thomas james newcome the company was mostly juvenile and included of course the gallant captains two little girls and his younger son that most terrible of all turks charlie the younger then there were all the little boys and girls living in the square and many others from a distance and one or two big boys and girls and one or two young gentlemen who stroked their chins as if something was to be felt there and one or two young ladies who would not take twice of spongecake for fear of looking as if they were hungry but besides these there were a few grownup people present whom i must not forget to name naturally the gallant captain was one and the gallant captains lady was another and then there were the lastnamed ladys two brothers there one a clergyman called the reverend james halliday and the other and elder mr joseph halliday a civil engineer with a ferocious pair of whiskers and to complete the party there was present a grave anxiouslooking gentleman by the name of mr drift a surgeon these all sat apart and looked on while the young folk enjoyed themselves and how the young folk did enjoy themselves that night what shouting and laughter there was what a jingling of the piano what hiding in corners what romping on the stair case and the round games and the charades and the family posts oh dear me im an old watch and ive gone through a good many noisy scenes but i never remember such a racket as this and how the young folk besieged the elder and compelled them to join in the fun there was papa down on his hands and knees with halfadozen youngsters on his back and there was uncle joseph performing tricks of conjuring before a select audience and mr drift telling stories to another and as for the reverend uncle jim he was made blind man and had his long coattails pulled and strange to say he never caught anybody all the time and then the supper who shall describe that the clattering of dishes the rattle of knives and forks the banging of crackers the peals of laughter and the crossfire of chaff alas all good things must come to an end and so did this party one by one the little guests said goodbye and after they had gone the little family of children and elders was left alone though it was past eleven the little urchin charlie insisted on clambering on to mr drifts knee to hear one last story and the little girls besieged their uncles and put their arms round their necks and besought their intercession with mamma to gain them another halfhours respite down stairs charlie said tom drift this little fellow is worrying me for a story suppose you tell one oh yes shouted that small chorus oh yes papa please tell us a story hear hear said uncle joe fire away said uncle jim remember it must be quite a short one charles said mamma charlie newcome the elder looked puzzled for a minute and fidgeted uncomfortably in his seat then he turned to his eldest boy and said tom open that cabinet there and bring me the watch that is under the glasscase the old ugly watch papa asked the boy running off on his errand yes the old ugly watch said papa with a queer sort of smile the boy brought me i was taken out of my case and lay there in his open hand once upon a time began papaand what a hush fell on that little companyonce upon a time there was a little boywhy was it everyone but the children looked so grave and why did mr drift push his chair back into the shadow why even did papas voice tremble now and then as he went on and caught the eye first of one and then another of his listeners that night he told my storynot as i have told it to you there was not much about mr drift in the story he told and a great deal less about himself than there might have been but as he went on these children crowded round me and looked with awe upon my battered body and read with reverence those quaintlyscratched initials and as they followed me in imagination from one master to another and from one peril to the next ending up with the famous battle before lucknow they forgot i was old and ugly and i gradually appeared to their little eyes one of the greatest treasures which their fathers house contained and here he lies in my hand children concluded papa and if you love him as much as i do you must be very fond of him and now good night all of you the end
