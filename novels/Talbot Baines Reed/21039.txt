boycotted and other stories by talbot baines reed here are fifteen of the most eccentric short stories you can imagine to make the job more difficult the hard copy of the book from which i worked was in very poor condition with the pages extensively browned that said in the way of my poor workmanship making me blame my tools i do not think i have made too much of a mess of it and you should be able to gain much enjoyment from reading the book the whole ensemble is not really very long about two thirds of the length of a typical book by this author so go ahead and see how you get on nh boycotted and other stories by talbot baines reed chapter one sub chapter i the school cuts me i hardly know yet what it was all about and at the time i had not an idea i don't think i was more of a fool than most fellows of my age at draven's and i rather hope i wasn't an out and out cad but when it all happened i had my doubts on both points and could explain the affair in no other way than by supposing i must be like the lunatic in the asylum who when asked how he came to be there said i said the world was mad the world said i was mad the world was bigger than i was so it shut me up here it had been a dismal enough term as it was quite apart from my troubles that affair of browne had upset us all and taken the spirit out of draven's we missed him at every turn what was the good of getting up the football fifteen when our only place kick was gone where was the fun in the saturday nights when our only comic singer our only reciter our only orator wasn't there who cared about giving study suppers or any other sociable entertainment when there was no browne to invite browne had left us suddenly one day he had been the life and soul of draven's next morning he had been summoned to draven's study and that same evening we saw him drive off to the station in a cab with his portmanteau on the top very few of the fellows knew why he had been expelled i scarcely knew myself though i was his greatest chum on the morning of the day he left he met me on his way back from draven's study i'm expelled smither he said with a dismal face go on replied i taking his arm and scrutinising his face to see where the joke was hidden but it was no joke i am said he hopelessly i am to go this evening it's my own fault i've been a cad i was led into it it's bad enough but i'm not such a blackleg as draven makes out and here for the first time in my life i saw browne look like breaking down he wasn't going to let me see it and hurried away before i could find anything to say if he hadn't told me himself i should have called any one who told me browne had been a cad well i'd better not say what i should have called him i knew my chum had been a rollicking sort of fellow who found it hard to say no to anybody who asked anything of him but that he was a blackleg i for one would not believe for all the dravens in the world hardly knowing what i did i walked up to the master's study door and knocked come in i could tell by the voice that came through the door i should do no good i went in mr draven was pacing up and down the room and stopped short in front of me as i entered well i wished i was on the other side of the door but i wasn't and must say something however desperate please sir browne browne leaves here to day said mr draven coldly what do you want please sir i hope you will i forgot where i was and what i was saying my mind wandered aimlessly and i ended my sentence i don't know how draven saw i was confused and wasn't unkind you have been a friend of browne i know he said and you are sorry so am i terribly sorry and his voice quite quavered as he spoke there was a pause and i made a frantic effort to recall my scattered thoughts won't you let him off this time sir i gasped that smither is out of the question said the head master so steadily and incisively that i gave it up and left the room without another word the fellows were trooping down the passage to breakfast little guessing the secret of my miserable looks or the reason why browne was not in his usual place but the secret came out and the school staggered under the shock mr draven announced our comrade's departure kindly enough in the afternoon adding that he had confessed the offence for which he was expelled and was penitent two hours later we saw his cab drive off and as we watched it disappear it all seemed to us like a hideous dream we said little about it to one another we did not even care to inquire particularly into the offence for which he had suffered but we moped and missed him at every turn and wished the miserable term were ending instead of beginning this however is a long digression i sat down to write the story of my own trouble not browne's but the reader will understand now why i said that as it was apart from my own misfortunes the term which had still a month more to run when my story begins had been a dismal one i was wandering about the playground one frosty november morning beginning to hope that if a frost should come we might after all get a little fun at draven's before the holidays came when odger junior whistling shrilly crossed my path odger junior was not exactly my fag for we had no fags at draven's and if we had had i had not yet reached that pitch of dignity at which one fellow has the right to demand the services of another still odger junior had for a consideration done a good many odd jobs for me and i had got into the way of regarding him as a quasi fag hullo youngster said i as we met there's going to be a stunning frost can't you smell it in the air i wish you'd cut down to bangle's and get me a pair of straps for my skates to my astonishment not wholly unmixed with amusement odger junior regarded me majestically for a moment and then ejaculating the oracular phrase oh ah walked off his four foot one drawn to its full height his hands behind his back and his mouth still drawn up for whistling but apparently too overcome with dignity to emit the music which an observer would naturally be led to expect i was not on the whole a short tempered youth my laziness saved me from that it certainly did occur to me on this bright frosty morning that it would be exhilarating both for young odger and me if i were to go after him and kick him but what was the use he would enjoy it as much as i should there would be plenty of ways in which to pay him out less fatiguing than an undignified chase round the playground so i let him go and grinned to think how much nicer monkeys are when they behave like monkeys and not like men i had a lot of work to do in my study that morning before afternoon school and so had very little time to think of odger junior or any one else as it was i was only just in time to take my usual place in the greek class when mr draven sailed into the room and the lesson began i had been so flurried by my hasty arrival that i did not at first observe that the desk on my right usually occupied by a boy called potter was vacant where's potter i asked of my neighbour on the left is he why there he is at browne's old desk i added catching sight of the deserter across the room browne's desk had always been left empty since its late owner went none of us had cared to appropriate it and the sight of it day after day had fed our sorrow over his loss it seemed to me therefore an act almost of disloyalty on potter's part towards the memory of my old chum to install himself coolly at his desk without saying a word to anybody what's he gone there for i inquired of sadgrove on my left he's got no don't talk to me said sadgrove sadgrove was in a temper and i wasn't surprised so was i lazy as i was we had all stuck to browne through the term and it was a little too much now to find a fellow like potter who professed to be browne's friend too stepping in this cold blooded way into his place sadgrove was put up to construe so there was no opportunity for further conversation had we desired it i wasn't surprised that potter avoided me in the playground after school he guessed i supposed what i had to say to him and had the decency to be ashamed of himself however i was determined to have it out and that evening after preparation went up to his study he was there and looked guilty enough when he saw me look here potter i began trying to be friendly in spite of all i got no further for potter without a word walked out of the door leaving me standing alone in the middle of his study i had seen the working of a guilty conscience once or twice before at draven's but never knew it to work in quite so strange a manner as it did with potter that evening there was nothing for it but to give him up as a bad job and go to bed which i did and awoke next morning in a forgiving mood it was always a scramble at breakfast on saturdays at draven's to see who could get nearest to the ham for we sickened of the cold mutton they gave us on other days this morning to my gratification i was well up that is there were only two fellows before me so that at any rate i was good for a fair straight slice from the middle huzza said i crowding up to williams who was next above me i've never had anything but knuckle all this williams faced round as he heard my voice and then without waiting to hear the end of my sentence got up and took a seat at the lower end of the table poor beggar's out of sorts said i to myself another of his bilious attacks i suppose i added moving up to his seat and addressing the proud occupant of the carver's chair this fellow was harrison whom next to browne we counted the oiliest fellow at draven's he could sing and make puns and though a long way behind browne was a popular jovial companion he appeared not to hear my remark but hitching his chair a little away began deliberately to carve a slice of ham he took a long time about it and i watched him patiently till he was done it was a prime ham i could see and ashamed as i am to confess it it made me feel amiable to all the world to find it was so if they were all like this i began there's room here harrison old man williams called up the table whereupon harrison plate in hand went down to keep williams company leaving me for the first time in my life top hammer somehow i did not enjoy the dignity quite as much as i should have expected i was sorry harrison had gone for i wanted to speak to him about potter and i could not help fancying from his unusual manner that he was put out about something and i thought he might have told me about it instead of chumming up to williams however i was hungry and took my slice of ham and passed the dish along to the fellow next me who sat below the two empty chairs up which i had risen it was rather a solitary meal and i was glad when it was over and the bell rang for first school there at least i should have the society of the sympathetic sadgrove who as i knew felt as sore as i did about potters behaviour but to my mortification as well as perplexity sadgrove i found had cleared out his desk and removed his goods and chattels to a seat on the row behind mine where he appeared to have met with a cordial welcome from his new neighbours i could not make it out he always told me he liked his desk better than any and would not change it even for browne's and here he was for no apparent reason on a lower form at a smaller desk and in well less select society as i sat in my place that morning with an empty desk on each side of me it began slowly to dawn on my mind that something was wrong somewhere the proceedings of odger junior potter sadgrove williams and harrison taken singly were not of much importance but taken as a whole i did not like them i might be wrong there might be no intention to cut me and i could not think of anything i had done or said which would account for it i would try at any rate to get to the bottom of it before i was many hours older so i went in search of my cousin who was a few months my senior and a particular chum of williams i say arthur what did williams cut me dead for this morning arthur looked uncomfortable and said how should i know you do know said i and i want to know why he coloured up and made as though he would leave room but my blood was up and i stepped across door tell me this i said have these fellows cut on purpose or no however should you do know are they cutting me or no he flushed up again and then said hurriedly yes we are sub chapter ii i am beaten yes we are the reader may think it strange when i tell him that my first sensation on receiving this momentous announcement was one of almost amusement i knew it was a mistake and that i had done nothing to merit the sentence which had been passed upon me draven's had put itself in the wrong and i had pride enough to determine that i of all people was not going out of my way to put it right so i took my cousin's announcement coolly and refrained from demanding any further explanations oh i said with something like a sneer and walked off leaving him so i flattered myself rather snubbed i was boycotted there was something a trifle flattering in the situation brave men before my time had been boycotted i had read their stories and sympathised with them and hated as i hate still the miscreants who in the name of patriotism had acted the sneak's and coward's part to ruin them now i was going to taste something of their hardships at the hands of my patriotic schoolfellows and my spirit rose as i resolved to hold up my head with the bravest of them forewarned is forearmed and when i went into school that afternoon i gave no one a chance of avoiding me i spread myself out as comfortably as possible at my place and shifted some of the papers and books which crowded my own desk into the vacant desks on either side of me first ejecting rather ostentatiously a few papers and notebooks which had been left in them by their late owners i was conscious of one or two glances directed my way across the room but these only added to my pleasure as i emptied sadgrove's inkpot into my own and proceeded cheerfully to cut my initials on williams's desk when i was put up to construe i managed to get through my passage without any sign of trepidation and when at last the class was dismissed i took the wind out of the sails of my boycotters by remaining some minutes later than any one else completing the decoration of my new quarters it was easy enough in the playground that afternoon to keep clear of my fellow human beings and i had as i persuaded myself a jolly hour in the gymnasium all by myself fellows looked in at the door now and then but did not disturb my peace and it was rather gratifying than otherwise to feel that as long as i chose to occupy the place every one else would have to wait outside after all thought i as i went to bed that night boycotting isn't as bad as people make it out i've had all i wanted to day no one has annoyed me or injured me i can do pretty much as i like in fact i do more than i ever used to be able to do if any one is loser by it all it's the other fellows and not me i rather enjoy it still i could not help reflecting as i turned over and went to sleep i think harrison might have stuck by me when i woke next morning it was with a sense of something on my mind i tried hard to persuade myself it was amusement and went down to breakfast wondering how draven's would keep it up i found myself top hammer again or i should say top muttoner for ham was a luxury reserved only for one day in the week and the two chairs below me were again vacant i helped myself to a slice from the uninviting joint and then artlessly pushed the dish along one place opposite the first of the empty chairs and proceeded to regale myself it was interesting to see the perplexity which my simple manoeuvre caused the next fellow below me out of reach three chairs away had nothing for it but either to speak to me which i calculated his vows would not allow him to do or else ignominiously to walk up to the seat next mine and possess himself of the dish he did the latter and i scored one the only one i scored for some time to come for draven's seeing i was defiant felt hurt in its pride and drew the blockade closer around me it had expected at least that i should make some effort to win my way back into popularity and it did not at all like when it chose to boycott me that i should boycott it so gradually we forgot what the quarrel was about and set ourselves to see who could hold out longest a manly sensible christian occupation for fifty fellow creatures during a dull winter month i never got the gymnasium to myself now for whenever i went it was always full and remained full till i was tired of waiting for a vacant bar or swing as for football hockey paper chasing and the other school sports i was of course excluded both by my own pride and the action of the school in fact draven's never pulled together so well at anything as they did at boycotting me during those few weeks their discipline was splendid they all seemed to know exactly what to do and what not to do when i appeared on the scene and any hopes i had of winning over a few stragglers to my side vanished before the blockade had lasted a week at first i didn't mind it my mettle was up i was excited and the consciousness that i was unjustly treated carried me through but in a few days the novelty began to wear off and i began to get tired of my own company i still made the most of my elbow room in class and at meals but it ceased to be amusing i tried to work hard in my study every evening and to persuade myself i was glad of the opportunity of making up for lost time but somehow or other the distant sounds of revelry and laughter made livy and euclid more dull and uninteresting than ever i tried to hug myself with the notion of how independent i was in school and out how free i was from bores how jolly the long afternoon walks were with no one hanging on at my heels how dignified it was to hold up my head when all the world was against me but spite of it all i moped greatly to my disgust draven's did not mope as i sat down in my study or wandered still more solitary in the crowded playground it seemed as if all the school except myself had never been in better spirits fellows seemed to have shaken off the cloud which browne's expulsion had left behind the football team was better than it had been for a year or two and i overheard fellows saying that the saturday nights were jollier even than last winter in fact it seemed as if like jonah the throwing of me overboard had brought fine weather all round still i was not going to give in draven's should be ashamed of itself before i met it half way so i watched with satisfaction my face growing pale day by day and i aided this new departure in my favour by eating less than usual giving up outdoor exercise and staying up late over my lessons i calculated that at the rate i was going i should be reduced to skin and bones by the end of my term and perhaps at my funeral draven's would own they had wronged me at present however my pallor seemed to escape their observation and as for my late hours all the good they did me was an imposition from mr draven for breaking rules as the days went on i seemed to have dropped altogether out of life i might have been invisible for anything any one seemed to see of me even the masters appeared to have joined in the conspiracy to ignore me and for a whole week i sat at my solitary desk without hearing the sound of my own voice my readers may scoff when i tell them that at the end of a fortnight i felt like running away the silence and isolation which had amused me at first became a slow torture at last and poor spirited wretch that i was my only comfort was in now and then crying in bed in the dark i made up for this secret weakness by putting on a swagger in public and rendered myself ridiculous in consequence draven's could hardly help being amused by a fellow who one day slunk in and out among them self consciously pale black under the eyes with a hacking cough and a funereal countenance and the next blustered about defiantly and glared at every one he met the fact was having despaired of making a friend my one longing now was to make an enemy i would have paid all my pocket money twice over for a quarrel or a fight with somebody but that was a luxury harder to get even than a friendly word i tried one day i was mooning disconsolately round the playground when i met young wigram the most artless youngster in all draven's you played up well in the second fifteen on saturday i said as if i had spoken to him not five minutes ago whereas as a matter of fact the sound of my own voice gave me quite a shock yes began he falling into the snare i was lucky with that run up from er i beg pardon good bye and he bolted precipitately it was a mild victory as far as it went but it did not end there for that afternoon i came upon a group in the playground the central figure of which was the wretched wigram on his knees in the act of apologising humbly all round for having been cad enough to speak to me it seemed a good chance for the long wished for quarrel and i jumped at it let him go shouted i breaking into the group and addressing the company generally if any one touches him he will have to fight me alas they stared a little and then laughed a little and then strolled away with wigram among them leaving me alone after that i knew i was beaten and might as well own it for a disappointed enemy is a far worse failure than a disappointed friend still i clung on to my pride broken down as i was and unnerved and damaged in my self respect there was but a week more of the term to run and i would try to hold out till the end if i could only do that i was safe for i would get my father to take me away at christmas for good no would i that would be the biggest surrender of all i could not think what i would do so i sat down and wrote to browne for lack of any better occupation and told him how i envied him his expulsion and wished any such luck could happen to me then i grimly set myself to endure the remaining days of my slow torture oh the silence of those days the noise and laughter of the fellows was nothing to it i could endure the one and in my extremity was even glad of it but the sealed lips of everyone that met me were like so many daggers at last i was really ill or at any rate i was so reduced that unless relief came soon i must either capitulate or run away even yet i found it hard to contemplate the former alternative i met harrison one morning in the passage i suppose i must have looked specially miserable for contrary to his usual practice now instead of looking away he slackened speed as he came up and looked at me now was my time surely i was famished for want of a friendly word or look and my pride was at its last gasp i believe i had actually begun to speak when a sound in the passage startled us both and we passed by as of old strangers i rushed off to my study ashamed and disappointed and paced round it like a caged animal what could i do should i write to some of the fellows should i tell draven or should i escape then it occurred to me had not i a right to know why i was being treated like this what had i done was i a sneak or a leper or a murderer that i should thus be excommunicated and tortured what a fool i had been not to think of this before alas it was too late now my pride had made it impossible for me to speak the first word without surrendering all along the line and even yet at the eleventh hour i could not face that so i shut myself up for another day miserable nervous and ill and counted the minutes to bedtime the evening post brought a letter from browne and thankful for any diversion and the silent company even of a friendly piece of paper i crawled off early to my study to make the most of my little comfort i started before i had read two lines and uttered an exclamation of amazement dear smither there's been a most frightful mistake by the same post as brought your letter i got enclosed from williams what a set of cads they've been and all my fault i've written to williams that if it's not all put right in twenty four hours i'll come down disgraced as i am and tell draven i'm in too great a rage to write more unless i get a telegram all right' by ten to morrow morning i'll come yours ever p browne williams's letter enclosed or rather part of it for browne had kept one sheet was as follows though my head was swimming so much at the time that i could scarcely take it all in the fellows here haven't forgotten you and they're showing it in a pretty decided way at present about three weeks ago we discovered that smither who called himself your friend was the sneak who went to draven the morning you were expelled and let out about you he was seen coming from d's study early and young wright who happened to be in the next room heard him speaking about you well we've boycotted him not a fellow is allowed to speak to him or notice him or go near him everybody's been bound over and unless some one plays traitor the place will get too hot for him before the term's up and serve him right too harrison and i here the letter broke off i felt stunned and strange to say the sudden discovery left me as miserable as it found me i suppose i was ill but for a short time my passion got the upper hand and made it worse for me than if i had never known the truth but it didn't last long there came a knock at the door and without waiting for an invitation harrison came into the room looking so miserable and scared that i scarcely recognised him for a moment he was evidently prepared for any sort of rebuff and i despised myself far more than him as i heard the half frightened voice in which he began smither old man he got no farther or at least i did not hear any more it seemed like a dream after that i was dimly conscious of his hand on my arm and then round me the next thing i was aware of was that i was lying in bed with him sitting beside me sponging my forehead has the bed bell rung i asked my dear fellow you've been in bed a fortnight said he bending over me but you mustn't talk now after awhile i asked again why are you here then for the term had had only three days to run when i had been taken ill we couldn't go old man the fellows begged draven to let them stay till you were out of danger and he did they're all here this is christmas day and they will be glad to hear you are better but really you mustn't talk please tell the fellows to go home then i said and wish them a merry christmas and say really old man pleaded harrison looking quite frightened don't talk that was the quietest but not the least hopeful christmas day i ever spent and when draven's met again next term i fancy most of us had got by heart the good christmas motto goodwill to men and were mutually agreed that whatever manly and noble sports we should engage in during the year boycotting should not be one of them chapter two a true story in two chapters sub chapter i the story ferriby had broken up the rats and mice were having their innings in the schoolrooms and the big bell was getting rusty for want of exercise the door of the lower third had not had a panel kicked out of it for a whole week and dr allsuch's pictures and sofas and piano were all stacked up in the detention room while their proper quarters underwent a doing up there was no mistake about the school having broken up and yet if it was so how came we all to be there this christmas week instead of sitting at our own firesides in the bosoms of our own families anywhere but at ferriby when i say all i mean all in jolliffe's house the others had cleared out bull's was empty and wragg's across the quadrangle had not a ghost of a fellow left nor had the doctor's every other house was shut up but jolliffe's was as full up as the night before a county match and no sign of an exodus of course the reader guesses the reason at once i know says one virtuous youth they'd all been detained for bad conduct and stopped their holidays wrong my exemplary one jolliffe's was the best behaved house in ferriby though i say so who should not but any one could tell you so for every thousand lines of imposition the other houses had to turn out jolliffe's only had a hundred and for every half dozen canes worn out on the horny palms of bull's and wragg's one was quite enough for us no the fact was one of our fellows had had scarlet fever a fortnight before the holidays and as he was in and out with us for some days before it was discovered sleeping in our dormitory and sitting next to us in class it was a settled thing we were all in for it so the school was suddenly broken up the other houses all packed off the sickly ones among us there were only one or two removed to the infirmary and the rest of us under the charge of jolliffe himself invited to make the best of a bad job and enjoy ourselves as well as we could with the promise that if in three weeks no one else showed signs of knocking up we should be allowed to go home of course we were awfully sold at first and by no means in an amiable frame of mind it is no joke to be done out of christmas at home what a dolt that gilks was to get scarlet fever why could he not have waited till he got home but after a day or two we shook down as british boys will to our lot after all it was only a case of putting off our holiday and meanwhile we were allowed to do anything we liked short of setting the place on fire or kicking up a row near the infirmary there were enough of us to turn out two good teams at football or to run a big paper chase across country or get up a grand concert of an evening and not too many of us to crowd into the long dormitory where for all we were interfered with we might have prolonged our bolster matches from eve to dewy morn in time we came to look upon our confinement as rather a spree than otherwise and this feeling was considerably heightened by the arrival of several hampers at the beginning of christmas week including a magnificent one from dr allsuch himself along with a message bidding us be sure and have a merry christmas we voted the doctor a brick and drank his health in ginger beer with great enthusiasm to the toast of dr allsuch and all such bricks it was on christmas eve after a specially grand banquet off the contents of one of these hampers that we crowded round the big common hall fire in a very complacent frame of mind uncommonly well satisfied and comfortable within and without i don't know said lamb meditatively cracking a walnut between his finger and thumb and slowly skinning it i don't know gilks might have done us a worse turn after all i rather wish he'd make a yearly thing of it said ellis they say he's pulled through all right oh yes he's all right and so are the other three in fact french and addley never had scarlet fever at all it was a false alarm well said lamb i'm jolly glad of it i wouldn't have cared for any of them to die you know lamb said this in a tone as if we should all be rather surprised to hear him say so nobody ever did die at ferriby did they said jim sparrow the youngest and tenderest specimen we had at jolliffe's it was rather cheek of a kid like jim to interpose at all in a conversation of his seniors and it seemed as if he was going to get snubbed by receiving no reply when fergus suddenly took the thing up eh young jim sparrow what's that you're saying fergus was the wag of our house indeed he was the only irishman we could boast of and the fact of his being an irishman always made us inclined to laugh whenever he spoke we could see now by the twinkle in his eye that he was going to let off the steam at jim sparrow's expense i said replied jim blushing rather to find every body listening to him nobody's ever died at ferriby have they fergus gazed at him in astonishment what exclaimed he you mean to say you never heard of poor bubbles bubbles no replied jim looking rather scared just fancy that said fergus turning round to us never heard of bubbles of course we who saw what the wag was driving at looked rather surprised and a little mysterious what was it inquired jim sparrow looking half ashamed of himself eh well if you never heard it i'd better not tell you it's not a nice story is it you fellows horrible said lamb starting at another walnut oh do tell me cried jim eagerly i'm so fond of stories and he settled himself back in his chair rather uneasily and tried to look as if it was all good fun well if you do want it i'll tell you but don't blame me if it upsets you that's all replied the irrepressible fergus jim looked as heroic as he could and wished he had never asked to be enlightened on the subject of bubbles fergus refreshed himself with an orange stuck his feet into the fender and began in a solemn voice i suppose jim sparrow if you have never heard about bubbles you really don't know the history of the school at all you don't even know how it came to be called ferriby no responded jim keeping his eyes on the fire ferriby is derived from two anglo saxon words proceeded fergus which you may have heard fire' and boy' now i'll tell you about bubbles there was something very mysterious about the manner in which fergus uttered these words and we listened for what was to come almost as breathlessly as jim sparrow it was early in this century he said that a boy came to this school called bubbles no one knew where he came from he had no parents and never went home for the holidays he was about your age sparrow and just your build and he was in the lower fourth i'm going to be moved up this christmas interposed jim hurriedly are you so was bubbles going to be moved up when what i'm going to tell you happened it was getting dark and for the last few minutes all the light in the room had been caused by a jet of gas in the coals that jet now went out suddenly leaving us in nearly total darkness it was a christmas eve everybody else had gone home for the holidays and bubbles was the only boy left in the school bubbles and a master whose name i won't mention he was the detention master wasn't he inquired lamb's voice ah yes there's no harm in telling you that bubbles and the detention master were left all alone at ferriby sparrow ye es said sparrow softly and making two syllables of the word they'd had no hampers sent them and as they sat round the fire that evening they knew both of them there was no christmas dinner in the house they had neither of them tasted food for some days and had no money to buy any and if they had had the snow was too deep to get anywhere they had tried making soup out of copybook covers but it wasn't nourishing and the soles of their boots which they tried to eat didn't sit well on their stomachs some one choked at this point greatly to the speaker's wrath all right some one seems to think it a laughing matter so i'll stop oh no cried one or two voices eagerly do go on he only got a piece of apple the wrong way was it you laughed jim sparrow demanded fergus oh no replied jim who was holding on rather tight to the sides of his chair i don't like any one making fun of a serious thing like this said fergus i was saying the soles of their boots didn't sit well on their stomachs they sat round the fire the whole evening brooding and ravenous and saying nothing for a long time they both stared into the fire then presently the master took his eyes off the fire and stared at bubbles bubbles used to be fat like you sparrow but the last day or two he had got rather reduced still he was fairly plump at least so thought the master as he looked first at him then at the fire and then thought of the empty larder downstairs it was too dark to see jim sparrow but i could almost hear him turn pale so profound was the silence the fire was a big one a roaring one and howled up the chimney as if it was hungry too bubbles where he sat was close to it in fact his feet almost touched the bars the master sat a little behind bubbles and his arm rested on the back of bubbles's chair to morrow' thought the master he will be thinner and next day only skin and bone' then he thought of the saying in the copy books never put off till to morrow what you can do to day' he sprang to his feet seized bubbles by the head and feet there was a shriek and a yell and next moment the master was alone in the room and the chimney was on fire at this last sentence the speaker suiting the action to the word had risen from his seat and suddenly pounced upon the unhappy sparrow who already paralysed with terror now fairly yelled and howled for mercy fergus dropped him back gently into his chair and resuming his own seat continued there is very little to add under the ruins were found the remains of the master grasping in each hand a large sized drumstick bubbles was never seen more it was supposed he escaped without his legs on to the roof and they do say that every christmas eve he revisits ferriby and tries to get down the chimney in search of his lost legs at the conclusion of this tragic story every one drew a long breath jim sparrow it was clear had swallowed it from beginning to end and one or two others of the juniors looked as if they would have been more pleased had the event not been made to happen on christmas eve of all nights but with these exceptions the whole thing seemed a very good joke and greatly to the credit of fergus's imagination oh and i should say added that doughty historian as he poked up the fire into a blaze though it's not of much consequence that this took place in this very house they say in this very room funny story isn't it sparrow sparrow had not yet sufficiently recovered from his fright to reply but it was evident by his looks he considered it anything but funny however the talk soon veered round to other and more ordinary topics in the midst of which aided by the remnants of our feast the spirits even of jim sparrow revived so much so that by bedtime he was as cheerful as if he had never even heard the name of bubbles sub chapter ii the ghost mr jolliffe appeared on the scene as usual at ten o'clock and read prayers after which advising us all to get a good night and announcing that to morrow being christmas day we should not breakfast till nine he trotted off to his quarters and left us we were all pretty ready to take his advice for what with a sixteen mile run across country in the afternoon and our big dinner in the evening the thought of bed seemed rather a comfortable prospect one or two of the fellows however fellows whom no exertion ever seemed to weary protested against going to bed at ten o'clock and took good care that those who did shouldn't sleep we were used to that and had to put up with it and it must have been close upon the stroke of christmas day before they finally condescended to turn in and leave us in peace one by one the candles went out the talk and the laughter gradually subsided and even the grunts and twitches of the doughty heroes as they first gave themselves over to slumber died away in the darkness for the first time since we rose that morning a dead silence reigned in jolliffe's in fact as i lay awake and tried to get to sleep the silence seemed unnaturally profound the tick of the big clock down in the hall struck on the ear with almost a thud and the light breeze outside moaned among the ventilators and played chromatic scales through the keyhole in a fashion quite disturbing i wished that wind would shut up and that the clock would run down how was a fellow to get to sleep with such a row going on and yet next moment the utter silence of the place disturbed me even more than the wind and the clock why i actually seemed to hear the winking of my own eyes as i lay there i wished some one would snore or breathe hard or roll over in his bed but no in all those thirty beds there was neither sound nor motion nothing is so unpleasant as listening for sounds in a dead silence i half wished hullo what was that rain on the window why can't rain drop straight instead of tapping at a fellow's window it sounded like some one wanting to come in i knew it was only rain but supposing it had been somebody a thief for instance or or bubbles come to look after his legs i do not know what evil genius put the thought of bubbles into my head but once in i could not get it out downstairs before the big fire i had laughed as loud as any one and been as sure as sure could be that fergus's story was all an invention of his fertile imagination but somehow now that the lights were out and the fellows all asleep and the wind was moaning outside and i lay sleepless on my bed it did not seem so utterly preposterous not that i believed in ghosts oh dear no i hoped i was not such a fool as that but supposing that rain again at the window why couldn't it stop startling a fellow in that way yes supposing fergus's story had been founded on fact what a dreadful end to a boy bubbles's end must have been and they do say the words seemed to echo in my ears that every christmas eve he re visits ferriby and tries to get down the chimney in search of his lost legs ugh why did not some of the fellows wake up how unnaturally still they all were i would have given all my pocket money to two of them to start another steeplechase that moment over the beds in fact i had half a mind to as i reached this point a sudden noise made my blood run cold and froze me to my bed it did not seem to be in the dormitory or on the stairs outside or in the quadrangle below none of my companions appeared to have heard it for they all slept on quietly and the silence which followed was doubly as intense as that which had gone before what could it be i do not fancy i was a particularly cowardly boy but somehow that sound terrified me i could neither move nor call out all i could do was to lie and listen there it was again this time not so sudden but far more distinct there was no mistaking it now as sure as i lay there it was something on the roof it sounded like something crawling slowly and by fits and starts along the gutter just above the dormitory sometimes it seemed to spring upwards as though attempting to reach a higher position and then sullenly slip down and proceed on its crawling way yes without doubt fergus had told the truth suddenly a voice in a loud whisper at the other end of the dormitory exclaimed listen i say listen it was lamb's voice there was at least some comfort in knowing that i was not the only one awake with a desperate effort i sat up in my bed and replied oh lamb what is it his only reply was a gasp as the noises recommenced the body whatever it was seemed to have dragged itself forward so as to be now just over our heads the ceiling above us went right up into the roof and i could distinctly hear a rustling sound against the tiles followed by an occasional upward leap sometimes almost wild in its eagerness how could i mistake these sounds the chimney was immediately above us and it was towards this goal as i well knew that the hapless and legless bubbles was destined fruitlessly to aspire at last one bound more frantic than the rest followed by a sudden clatter of displaced tiles unloosed my tongue and i fairly cried out oh half a dozen fellows were on the alert in an instant who's that called out cried one i'd like to scrag him what's the row whoever it is demanded fergus hush listen was all i could reply there must have been something in my voice which bespoke my horror for a dead silence ensued but not for long once more the dull dragging sound interrupted by the spasmodic and fruitless leaps a shudder went round the dormitory at the sound they knew as well as i did what it meant it's the ghost faltered sparrow's trembling voice and no one contradicted him fergus himself like one suddenly confronted with a spirit of his own raising seemed the most terrified of the lot and i could hear him gasping as he sat petrified in his bed can't some one strike a light lamb said presently all very well but the matches were on the table and to secure them one would have to get out of bed no one seemed quite inclined for that as we lay endeavouring to screw up our courage to the necessary pitch the sound once more recommenced with a violent motion towards the edge of the roof the moon at the same moment broke out from behind the clouds and shot its pale light in at the big windows there was a momentary pause above us and then casting a sudden shadow across the dormitory floor a dim white figure as of a body without limbs floated down outside the window the moon once more was obscured and we were left motionless and horrified in utter silence and darkness what would come next how long we might have remained in suspense i can't say had not lamb and another fellow by a combined effort of heroism dashed arm in arm from bed and secured the matches they were in the act of striking a light one match had broken and another had had no head they were in the act of striking a light when lamb who was close to the window suddenly exclaimed look there was such terror in his tone that we knew only too well what he had seen but where where i managed to gasp there down in the quad he replied pointing out of the window but looking another way curiosity is sometimes greater than fear and for all my terror i could not resist the impulse to steal up to the window and look out and others did the same it was as lamb had said there in the quadrangle below moving restlessly to and fro and swaying itself upward as if in supplication was the white form erect but helpless for a long time we gazed without a word at last one more hardy than the rest said what can it be what a question what could it be but bubbles still when the question was once asked it did occur to one or two of us that possibly we might have jumped to a conclusion too hastily it's wonderful how hardy a fellow will get when he's got twenty fellows clustering round him he's alive anyhow said one call out to him some one suggested another you're nearest the window fraser said another fraser was vice captain of the second fifteen and always touchy whenever his pluck was called in question i'm not afraid he said in a voice which was hardly quite steady and as he spoke he threw up the window and called out hurriedly and in rather deferential tones who are you down there i don't suppose fraser ever did a pluckier thing than ask that question we listened all ears for the reply but none came only a faint moan as the apparition swayed uneasily towards us and even seemed to try to raise itself in our direction but never a word we heard and we closed the window again as much in the dark as to its identity as ever what could we do we couldn't go to bed with bubbles's or anybody's ghost wandering about in the quadrangle below us that was evident but how were we to solve the mystery unless indeed it was a terrible alternative but the only one we thought of it a good bit before any one proposed it at last fraser himself said who's game to come down into the quad fraser was on his mettle or he would never have been so mad at first a dead silence was the only answer to his challenge then lamb said i don't mind if he didn't mind why should he nearly choke saying so however he broke the ice and others followed i considered myself as good a man as lamb any day it was only my own opinion and i wasn't going to be outdone by him now so i volunteered and one or two others who considered themselves as good as i volunteered too until the forlorn hope numbered a dozen come along said fraser who had armed himself with a lighted candle and led the way i think those who stayed behind felt a little dismayed when the last of us glided from the door and left them behind still as far as happiness of mind was concerned they would not have gained much had they been of our party for we descended the staircase in rather depressed spirits starting at every creak and some of us wishing twenty times we were safe back in the dormitory but there was no drawing back now what a noise the bars of the big door made as we unfastened them and what an ominous shriek the lock gave as we turned the key our one hope was that the ghost would have taken fright and vanished before we reached the quadrangle but no as we stepped out into the damp breezy night the first thing that met our eyes was the distant restless figure of bubbles by one consent we halted and as we did so a gust of wind extinguished our leader's candle what was to be done i glanced up and saw the lights twinkling at the far distant dormitory window oh whatever possessed me to come on this wild errand now then you fellows it was fraser's voice and more like himself too now then stick all together and better get a light first suggested some one will you run back to the dormitory and get the matches asked our leader nothing more was said about the light we advanced a few yards and then halted again better speak to him i think said lamb all right said fraser now then who are you what's your name there his voice sounded loud and startling in the night air but it was wasted breath never a word spoke bubbles but moaned as he struggled restlessly on the ground where he lay fraser's spirits were rising every moment oh hang it he exclaimed i don't believe it's a ghost at all so saying he made a further advance to within a few yards of the apparition if it wasn't a ghost it was the most unearthly thing in the dark i ever saw as it lay there we were still too far off to see it clearly but it looked like some bloated creature without legs trying its hardest to rise on the feet that were not there do you hear shouted fraser once more why can't you speak and tell us who you are the creature gave a long sigh by way of answer but no more fraser advanced another step and we were preparing to follow when the ghost slowly rose on end and made a sudden bound towards him in an instant we were back in the house rushing pellmell up the stairs and looking neither this way nor that till we were safe back in the dormitory with our companions we passed the remainder of that night dressed and with candles burning and it was not till morning broke that we dared once more look out of the window and then we discovered the mystery of bubbles's ghost a small half exhausted balloon about five feet high lay on the grass below with enough gas in it still to toss about restlessly in the breeze and now and then even to rise on end and drag its little car a few inches where it came from and who it belonged to we never discovered probably some toy balloon let up by christmas eve revellers who little thought it would alight on the roof of jolliffe's and after flopping about there for some minutes would finally tumble into the court below and there act the part of bubbles to a handful of scared schoolboys however all's well that ends well and among the many amusements which made that day a merry christmas to us all there was none over which we laughed more than bubbles's ghost chapter three sub chapter i the poetry club during one of my terms at g and in speaking of that famous old school it is quite unnecessary to mention more than the first letter of its name a serious epidemic broke out it affected chiefly the lower half of the upper school and during the brief period of its duration it assumed so malignant a type that it is still a marvel to me how any one of its victims ever survived it the medical and other authorities were utterly incompetent to deal with it in fact incredible as it may seem they deliberately ignored its existence and left the sufferers to pull through as and how they could had it been an ordinary outbreak as for instance scarlatina or diphtheria or even measles they would have cleared the school between two call overs and had us all either in the infirmary or in four wheelers at our parents' doors but just because they had not got this the most destructive kind of all epidemics down on their list of infectious disorders they chose to disregard it utterly and leave us all to sink or swim without even calling in the doctor to see us or giving our people at home the option of withdrawing us from our infected surroundings i love the old place too well to dwell further on this gross case of neglect the present authorities no doubt would not repeat the error of their predecessors should they be tempted to do so i trust the present harrowing revelation may be in time to avert the repetition of the calamity of which i was not only a witness but a victim the fact is in the term to which i allude we fellows in the upper fifth and lower sixth took to writing poetry i don't know how the distemper broke out or who brought it to g certain it is we all took it some worse than others and had not the christmas holidays happily intervened to scatter us and so reduce the perils of the contagion the results might have been worse even than they were now one poet in a school is bad enough and two usually make a place very uncomfortable for any ordinarily constituted person but at g it was not a case of one poet or even two there were twenty of us if there was one and we each of us considered our claim to the laurel wreath paramount indeed like the bards of old we fell to the most unseemly contentions and hated one another as only poets can hate it was my tragic lot to act as hon secretary to the poetry club which constituted the hospital so to speak in which our disease worked out its course during that melancholy term why they selected me it is not for me to inquire some of my friends assured me afterwards that it was because having no pretensions or even capacity to be a poet myself i was looked upon as the only impartial member of our afflicted fraternity no doubt they thought it a good reason had i known it at the time i should have repudiated the base insinuation with scorn for i humbly conceived that i was a poet of the first water and had indeed corrected a great many mistakes in wordsworth and other writers and written fifty six or fifty seven sonnets before ever the club was thought of and stray himself who was accounted our laureate had only written thirty four and they averaged quite a line less than mine be that as it may i was secretary of the club and to that circumstance the reader is indebted for the treat to which i am about to admit him for in my official capacity i became custodian of not a few of the poetical aspirations of our members and as after the abatement of the disease they none of them demanded back their handiwork if poetry can ever be called handiwork these effusions have remained in my charge ever since some of them are far too sacred and tender for publication and of others at this distance of time i confess i can make nothing at all but there lies a batch before me which will serve as a specimen of our talents and can hardly hurt the feelings of any one responsible for their production our club as i have said was highly competitive in its operations it by no means contented us each to follow his own course and woo his own muse no we all set our caps at the same muse and tried to cut one another out if i happened to write an ode to a blackbird and i wrote four or five every one else must write an ode to a blackbird too until the luckless songster must have hated the sound of its own name it was no easy work finding fit subjects for these poetic competitions but the papers lying here before me remind me at least of one which excited great interest and keen rivalry complaints had been made that the club had hitherto devoted itself almost altogether to abstract rhapsodies and had omitted the cultivation of itself in the epic or heroic side of its genius on the other hand the abstract rhapsodists protested that any one could write ballads and that the subject to be chosen should at least be such as would admit of any treatment one member suggested we should try the fifth proposition of the first book of euclid as being both abstract and historical but he was deemed to be a scoffer eventually stray said why not take a simple nursery rhyme and work upon it just as musicians take some simple melody as the theme of their great compositions it was a good idea and after some consideration for we had most of us forgotten our nursery rhymes we fixed upon the tragical history of jack and jill and decided to deal with it the understanding was that we might treat it any way we liked except notable exception in prose and so we went off to our studies and gave ourselves up to our inspirations the result the reader shall judge of for himself only he shall never know the real names of the poets nor will anything induce me to disclose which particular production was the performance of the humble author of this veritable narrative i will select the specimens haphazard and distinguish them only by their numbers number was a follower of the classic models and rendered the story in homeric fashion attend ye nine and aid me while i sing the cruel fate of two whom heaven's dread king hurled headlong to their doom scarce had the sun his blazing course for one brief hour run when jack arose and radiant climbed the mount to where beneath the summit sprang the fount nor went he single jill the beauteous maid danced at his side and took his proffered aid together went they pail in hand and sang their love songs till the leafy valleys rang alas the fount scarce reached the heedless swain turned on his foot and slipped and turned again then fell he headlong and the woe struck maid jealous of his fell doom a moment stayed and watched him then to the depths she rushed and shared his fate behold them mangled crushed weep oh my muse for jack for jill your tears outpour for hand in hand they'll climb the hill no more after this somewhat severe version of the story it is a relief to turn to the lighter rendering of the same affecting theme by number number was evidently an admirer of that species of poetry which begins everything at the wrong end and seems to expect the reader to assist the poet in understanding what it is the latter is driving at what's the matter jack lost your head poor wight i always told you the block wasn't screwed on too tight tumbled is that it it's a mercy you lit on your head nothing brittle in that if you'd come on your feet instead broke it no never you have i knew it was slightly cracked never mind that there was nought to come out that's a comforting fact what two of you who is the other not jill i declare is her head cracked too on my word you're a pair have i seen a pail lying about why no i have not pails don't grow wild on this hill that is that i wot oh you dropped it you did oh i see 'twas your pail and it tumbled you both o'er the rock that's your tale it may turn up somewhere perhaps so you fell off the edge of the path that leads up to the well well all's well that ends well at least so 'tis said but next time you'd better stay down and try to fall uphill instead some of us at the time thought highly of this performance i remember one fellow saying that number seemed to have caught the spirit of mr browning without his vagueness which was a very great compliment number 's poetry ran chiefly in dramatic lines he therefore boldly threw the narrative into dialogue form shepherdess alas my jack is dead shepherd i mourn for lovely jill both a common fate o'ertook them on the hill shepherdess i watched them go him and the hateful minx shepherd i smiled to mark his footsteps on the brinks both cruel deceiver heshe shameless intriguer shehe shepherdess 'twas she who lured him o'er the cruel ledge shepherd 'twas he who basely dragged her to the edge both oh faithless heshe oh monstrous traitor shehe shepherdess her fate no tongue shall mourn no eye shall weep shepherd his doom was all deserved upon the steep both oh hapless heshe oh wicked wicked shehe shepherdess take warning shepherd trust no faithless jill shepherd nor you fair nymph with jack e'er climb a hill both oh woe is me and woe oh woe is thee shepherdess with thee poor youth i fain would shed a tear shepherd maiden with thee i'd sit and weep a year both wouldst thou but smile i too would dry mine eye nay let's do both and laugh here till we cry number was a specimen of the simple ditty style which leaves nothing unexplained and never goes out of its course for the sake of a well turned phrase when jack was twelve and jill was ten their mother said my dear children i want you both to take the pail we bought last week from mr gale and fill it full of water clear and don't be long away do you hear then master jack and sister jill raced gaily up the primrose hill and filled the pail up to the top and tried not spill a single drop but sad to tell just half way down jack tripped upon a hidden stone and tumbled down and cut his head so badly that it nearly bled and jill was so alarmed that she let drop the pail immediately and fell down too and sprained her hand and had to go to dr bland and get it looked to while poor jack was put to bed upon his back number regarded his performance with a certain amount of pride he said it was after the manner of wordsworth and was a protest against the inflated style of most modern poetry which seemed to have for its sole object to conceal its meaning from the reader we had a good specimen of this kind of writing from number who wrote in blank verse as he said after the german i know not why why seek to know is not all life a problem and the tiniest pulse beats with a throb which the remotest star feels in its orbit why ask me rather say whence these vague yearnings whither swells this heart like some wild floweret leaping at the dawn 'tis not for me 'tis not for thee to tell but time shall be our teacher and his voice shall fall unheard unheeded in the midst still art thou doubtful then arise and sing into the empyrean vault while i drift in the vagueness of the ambrosian night we none of us dared inquire of number what was the particular bearing of these masterly lines upon the history of jack and jill i can picture the smile of pitying contempt with which such a preposterous question would have been met and i observe by the figures noted at the back of this poem that it received very few marks short of the highest award number posed as democratic poet who appealed to the ear of the populace in terms to which they are best accustomed 'twas a lovely day in august at the top of ludgate hill i met a gay young couple and i think i see them still they were drinking at the fountain to cool their parching lips and they said to one another looking up between their sips chorus i'd sooner have it hot love i'd rather have it hot it's nicer with the chill off much nicer is it not they took a four wheel growler for a drive all round the town and told the knowing cabby not to let his gee gee down but they'd scarcely got to fleet street when their off hind wheel went bang and they pitched on to the kerb stone while the crowd around them sang chorus i'm glad you've got it hot love i'm pleased you've got it hot it's nicer with the chill off much nicer is it not moral now all you gay young couples list to my fond appeal beware of four wheel growlers with spokes in their off hind wheel and when you go up ludgate hill all on a summer day don't drink much at the fountain or if you do i say be sure and take it hot love be sure and take it hot it's nicer with the chill off much nicer is it not this poem was not highly marked although number confessed he had sat up all night writing it he thought we had missed the underlying philosophy of his version and was sorry for it as he said the first essential of a poem is that it should be read and he believed no one could deny that he had at least written up to that requirement there was a more serious moral hidden in number 's version which was stated to be on the models of the early sonnets two lovers on one common errand bound one common fate o'erwhelms and so me seems a fable have we of our daily round who in these groves of learning here are found climbing parnassus' slopes our aim is one and one the path by which we strive to soar yet truer still or ere the prize be won a common ruin hurls us to our doom 'twere best we parted you and i so fate baulked of her double prey may seek in vain and miss us both upon the shadowy plain the writer of number i always suspected of being a borrower of other people's ideas in fact it seemed as if he must have had a thousand and one gems open before him while he was at work and to have drawn liberally from its pages the way was long the night was cold and jack and jill were young and bold try not the hill the old man said dark lowers the tempest overhead a voice replied far up the height we've many a step to walk this night ah luckless speech ah bootless boast two minutes more and they were lost who would not weep for jack and jill they died though much against their will and the birds of the air all fell sobbing and sighing as they heard of these two unfortunates dying the concluding line which was the only original one in the poem was specially weak and number i observe only received one vote and that was probably given by himself but for originality and humour number 's version was the most distinguished of the lot with it i conclude and if i may express an unbiassed opinion many years after the memorable contest i consider it far and away the best version of the story of jack and jill i have ever met with jack and jill went up a hill to fetch a pail of water jack fell down and broke his crown and jill came tumbling after chapter four sub chapter i eighteen hours with a kid copy of a holiday letter from gus cutaway of the upper remove shellboro' to his particular chum and messmate joseph rackett dear jossy if you want a motto in life i'll give you one 'ware kids don't you have anything to do with kids unless you want to lose all your pocket money and be made a fool of before the fellows and get yourself in a regular high old mess all round you needn't think i don't know what i'm talking about i do promise you'll never say a word to anybody especially to any of the fellows and i'll tell you it was on breaking up day you know all of you went off by the train and i had to wait till the that's the worst of going through london the trains never go at the right time it came in up to time for a wonder and i bagged a second class carriage to myself and laid in some grub and a bop and made up my mind to enjoy myself what do you think just as the bell was ringing a female with a kid rushed on to the platform and made a dive for my carriage i can tell you i was riled but that wasn't half of it are you going to waterloo young gentleman asks the female as out of breath as you like yes why said i would you be so kind as to look after tommy his father will be there to meet him he's got his ticket haven't you tommy say thank you' to the kind young gentleman bye bye be a good boy right forward sings out the guard love to daddy says the female stand away from the train shouts the porter and then we were off and here was i left alone in a carriage with a kid called tommy that i was to give over to a chap called daddy at waterloo how would you have liked it yourself jossy i was awfully disgusted and of course till the train was off i never thought of saying i can't and then it was too late i can tell you it's a bit rough on a fellow to be served that way if ever you're going by train and see a female and a kid coming along hop out of the carriage till you see which carriage they get into and then go and get into another i made up my mind i'd leave the little cad to himself so i started to read at least i pretended to really i took a good squint at him while he wasn't looking he was a kid of about four and a half i fancy with a turnippy head and a suit of togs that must have been new he was so jolly proud of them he sat staring at the lamp and swinging his legs for a good bit then he got hold of the window strap and fooled about with that then he remembered his swagger togs and looked himself all over and stuck his hands in his pocket he twigged me looking at him as he did so i've got a knife he said as cool as if he'd known me a couple of terms who said you hadn't i responded it's in my pocket he said oh said i i didn't want to encourage him he pulled it out staring at me all the time then he slipped down off the seat and brought it up to me open it he said open it yourself said i i can't said he open it open it all right keep your temper said i and i opened it a beastly blunt thing it was there you are take it i want to sit beside you he said when he'd got it do you i don't want you haven't you got all the rest of the carriage lift tommy up he whined i'd a good mind to chuck him out of the window lift yourself up i said and shut up i want to read then i'm bothered if the young cad didn't begin yelling just because i didn't lift him up i never saw such a blub baby in all my life i couldn't make out what he was up to at first i thought he was curtseying and seeing how long he could hold his breath but when it did come out my eye i thought the engine driver would hear i was in a regular funk i thought he'd got a fit or something i never heard such yelling he was black in the face over it and dancing i'd a good mind to pull the cord and stop the train but i thought i'd see if i could pull him round first so i picked him up and stuck him up on the seat would you believe it jossy the moment he was up he stopped howling and began grinning it had all been a plant to get me to lift him up and as soon as he'd made me do it he laughed at me i can tell you it's not pleasant to be made a fool of even by a kid i'm sitting beside you now he said as much as to tell me he'd scored one off me i was too disgusted to take any further notice of him i suppose he saw i was riled and began to be a bit civil he pulled a nasty sticky bit of chocolate out of his pocket and held it up to my nose a sweetie for you he said i didn't want to have him yelling again so i took it ugh all over dust and hairs and half melted he watched me gulp it down and then to my relief got hold of the boy's own paper and began looking at the pictures he got sick of that soon and went and looked out of the window then he came and sat by me again and began to get jolly familiar he stroked my cheeks with his horrid sticky hand and then climbed up on the seat and tried to lark with my cap then just because i didn't shut him up he clambered up on my back and nearly throttled me with his arms round my neck and what do you think he began to kiss me that was a drop too much stow it kid i said dear dear he said getting regularly maudlin and kissing me at about two a second let go do you hear you're scrugging me nice mannie he said i didn't know what to do until i luckily thought of my grub like a bun said i he let me go and was down beside me like a shot you should have seen him walk into that bun his face was all over it and the crumbs were about an inch deep all over the place when he got near the end of bun number he looked up as near choking as they make them and said i like buns awfully all right have another said i you see as his governor was going to meet him in town it didn't matter much to me if he got gripes at night anything to keep him quiet after the third bun he was about full up and said he was thirsty i couldn't make the young ass understand that i had no water in the carriage he kept on saying he was thirsty for half an hour till we came to a station i had made up my mind i would get into another carriage at the first stop we came to but somehow it seemed rather low to leave the kid in the lurch so i bought him a glass of milk instead which set him up again nobody else got in the carriage knew better and off we went again he'd got an awful lot to say for himself about dicky birds and puff puffs and dogs and trouser pockets and rot of that sort and didn't seem to care much whether i listened or no then just when i thought he had about run dry and was getting sleepy he rounded on me with tell me a story me i don't know any stories oh yes a funny one please i tell you i don't know any what about the three bears' i don't know anything about three bears' said i do do do he said beginning to get crusty so i did my best he kept saying i was all wrong and putting me right he might just as well have told it himself i told him so but he took no notice and went on badgering me for more stories i can tell you i was getting sick of it when i made up a story for him to laugh at he looked so solemn and said not that a funny one and when i told him a fairy tale he snapped up and said he didn't like it it ended in my telling him the the three bears over and over again it was about the sixty fifth time of telling that we got to vauxhall and had to give up tickets now young 'un look out for your governor when we get in i don't know him you know the young ass didn't know what i meant look out for daddy then i said he promptly stuck his head out of the window and said the ticket collector was daddy then that the porter was then that a sweep on the platform was it wasn't very hopeful for spotting the real daddy at waterloo i told him to shut up and wait till we got there when we got there i stuck him up at the window as large as life for his governor to see there were a lot of people about but i can tell you i was pretty queer when no one owned him we hung about a quarter of an hour asking everybody we met if they'd come to meet a kid and watching them all go off in cabs till we had the platform to ourselves here's a go kid said i daddy's not come i 'spex says he when the middling size bear found his porridge eaten up he wondered who it was shut up about the bears said i what about your gov your daddy where does he live in london town said he as soon as i could knock those bears out of his head whereabouts what street london town do you mean to say look here what's your name tommy what it's tommy he said i know that is it tommy jones or tommy robinson or what it's tommy he repeated my name's tommy here was a nice go stranded with a kid that didn't know his own name or where his governor lived the worst of it was i had to stop in london that night as there was no train on my pater had written to get a room for me at the euston hotel so that i should be on the spot for starting home first train in the morning i was regularly stumped i can tell you it never turned a feather on the kid his governor not turning up and i couldn't make the idiot understand anything he hung on to me singing and saying who's been tasting my porridge and eaten it all up or else cheeking the porters or else trying to whistle to make the trains go i thought i'd better leave word with the station master where i'd gone in case any one turned up and then there was nothing for it but to take a cab across to the hotel the kid was no end festive to have a ride in the cab it would have been in a little better taste if he'd held his tongue and shown a little regret for the jolly mess he'd let me into but bless you he didn't care two straws what will daddy say when he can't find you i said trying to get him to look at things seriously daddy will say who's been sitting in my chair and broken the bottom out' said he still harping on those blessed bears i gave him up after that and let him jaw on when we got to the hotel i was in another fix the chap in charge said he'd got instructions about one young gentleman but not two oh i'm looking after this boy said i till tomorrow i'll have him in my room the chap looked as if he didn't like it and of course just when he was thinking it over the young cad must go and cheek him what makes that ugly man so red on his nose he asks at the top of his voice for every one to hear the chap was no end riled at that and looked as if he'd kick us out when he'd cooled down he said you wait here i'll attend to you presently that was a nice go if i had had tin enough i should have gone somewhere else but i'd only got enough for the journey to morrow and so thought i'd better hang on here where the governor had arranged the lid went on anyhow while we were waiting in the hall he ran and stood in front of people and he pulled waiters' coat tails and got mixed up with the luggage and called out to me to know where the ugly red nosed man had gone at last i had to pull him in look here kid said i if you don't hold your jaw and sit here quietly i'll give you to a policeman tell me about the bears then oh how i loathed those bears think of me captain of my eleven in that rackety hall with people coming and going and a row enough to deafen you telling a kid about the three bears you may grin jossy but i was reduced to it after a time the hotel chap came and said we were to have a double bedded room and he should charge half extra for the kid and if we wanted dinner we'd better look sharp as it was just beginning so we went up and washed at least i had to wash the kid's sticky hands and face for him and then came down to table d'hote i was in a regular funk lest any of our fellows or any one i knew should see me we got squeezed in between a lady in grand evening dress and a professor chap with blue spectacles and as they were both attending to their neighbours i hoped we might scrape through without a scene you should have seen that kid tuck in i mildly suggested that he'd better not have any mock turtle soup but he began to get up steam for a bowl and a half so i gave it up he said it was ugly stuff but for all that he polished off a plate of it and then walked into salmon after that he had a turn at roast pork and apple sauce and after that a cabinet pudding and some gorgonzola cheese he was very anxious to have some beer like the professor or some wine like the lady but i put my foot down there and let him have lemonade instead you should have seen people stare at him the professor glared as if he was a rum animal your brother said he not exactly said i uncommon appetite would you mind telling me in the morning what sort of night he had i shall be curious to know the lady glared too chiefly because the kid had sprinkled her silk dress with melted butter and pork gravy and lemonade he caught her eye once and said out loud to her our cat's called flossy what's your cat called the lady turned away whereupon the kid began his cheek again that lady said he to me and the company at large has got a nice dress and a nasty face i like nice faces bestest do you shut up or i'll clout your ear snarled i in a regular perspiration of disgust what's clout inquired he then feeling his ears my ears don't stick out like that man's over there do they do you hear shut up you little fool we've got a donkey at home and his here i could stand it no longer and lugged him off whether he liked it or no he was just as bad in the reading room he wouldn't sit still unless i told him stories and made a regular nuisance of himself to the other people then i suppose it was his big feed he began to get crusty and blubbered when i talked sharply to him and presently set up a regular good old howl why don't you put the child to bed said a lady he's no business up at this hour nice wasn't it i had to sneak off with him upstairs howling all the way he wouldn't stop till i gave him a mild cuff on the head that seemed to bring him round enough to demand the the three bears once more anything to keep him still so at it i went again then i told him to go to bed and he told me to undress him as he couldn't do the buttons i can't make out how i got him out of his togs then he kicked up no end of a shine because i was going to stick him in bed without his bath i've got no bath said i wait till the morning tommy wants his bath bring it bring it he shrieked finally i had to mess him about in a basin in cold water which set him yelling worse than ever then i had to put him in my night gown for he'd got none of his own i want to get in beside you he said as i stuck him in bed i'm not going to bed yet said i not likely at eight o'clock more yells and a chambermaid came and knocked at the door to know what was the matter i tried all i knew to quiet him down he wouldn't listen to me not even when i tried to tell him his three bears he bellowed out one incessant want to get in beside you want to get in beside you till finally i chucked up the sponge and actually went to bed to oblige him he simmered down after that and i began to hope he'd drop off and get to sleep but bless you jossy was it likely after those buns and the dinner he'd had we had a fearful night i can tell you he kicked till i was black and blue and rolled over and over till i hadn't a stitch on me then he wanted some water to drink then he wanted the gas alight then he began to blubber for his mother then he wanted the clothes on then he wanted them off then he got his feet entangled in the night gown then he wanted some chocolates then he wanted to know who was talking in the next room then he wanted the pillow turned over then he wanted a story told him and shut me up before i'd begun one sentence of it then he wanted me to put my arm round him then he wanted me to lie over on the edge of the bed then he had a pain in his tummy and called on me to make it well and howled because i couldn't poor little beggar he was in a jolly bad way and i couldn't well cut up rough but i can tell you it was the worst night i ever spent he didn't quiet down till about three in the morning and then he went off with his head on my chest and his hand on my nose and i daren't for the life of me shift an inch for fear of bringing it all on again i suppose i must have dropped off myself at last for the next thing i remember it was broad daylight and the young cad was sitting on the top of me as merry as a cricket trying to prize my eyes open with his fingers can't you let a chap be grunted i haven't you made a beast enough of yourself all night without starting again now i want to see your eyes said he then he began to jump up and down on the top of me and explained that he was riding in the puff puff i wished to goodness he was of course i had to wake up and then we had those brutal three bears on again for an hour till it was time to get up he insisted on being tubbed all over with soap and criticised me all the while boys who spill on the carpet must be whipped said he mother will whip you and you'll cry ha ha i don't care said i as long as she clears you off he never seemed to understand what i said and wasn't a bit set down by this then came the same old game of getting him into his togs and parting his horrid hair and blowing his nose and all that i can tell you i was about sick of it when it was done when we got down in the hall the first chap we met was the hotel man there's the ugly man with the red nose sings out the kid i can see him there is he pointing with all his might look here young gentleman said the man coming to me we aren't used to be kept awake all night by your noise or your baby's you may tell your papa he needn't send you here again there's half a dozen of my visitors leaving to day because they couldn't get a wink of sleep all night no more could i said i he was going to say something more but just then a man came in from the street directly he spotted the kid he rushed up to him why it is tommy said he tommy put on a grin and dug his hands into his pockets i've got a knife said he of my very own are you the young gentleman who left the message at waterloo said the man why the letter i got said the train got in at am not pm you don't know what a turn it gave me to go down there this morning and not see him have you had him here all night rather said i daddy there's an ugly man came to this house i can see him now with a red nose look there i hope he's been a good boy said the proud father i'm sure i'm much obliged i'm afraid he's been a trouble to you i've got a cab here my word i'm glad i've got you safe tommy my boy come say good bye to the kind gentleman he was naughty and spilt the water on the floor he must be whipped ha ha observed tommy by way of farewell he didn't seem to care twopence about leaving me and chucked me up for his governor as if i'd been a railway porter however i can tell you i was glad to see the back of him and didn't envy his governor a little bit of course i'd lost my first train home and had to wait till mid day to endure the scowls of the hotel man and the frowns of all the people who had been kept awake by the kid's row among others there was the professor well said he what sort of night did baby have middling said i i expected it would be middling said he now jossy you know what i mean by 'ware kids keep all this mum whatever you do i wouldn't have any of the fellows hear about it for the world i can tell you i feel as if i deserve a week's holiday longer than the rest of you never you utter the words three bears in my hearing or there'll be a row yours truly gus cutaway chapter five sigurd the hero sub chapter i the tower of the north west wind on the rugged shore of the northern sea where the summer sun never sets there stood long ago a grim bleak fortress called the tower of the north west wind before it stretched the sea which thundered ceaselessly at its base like a wolf that gnaws at the root of some noble oak on either side of it glittered the blue fiord dotted with numberless islets throwing its long arms far inland behind it frowned a dense forest of pines as far as eye could reach in which the wind roared day and night mingled often with the angry howls of the wolves the tower of the north west wind stood there the solitary work of man in all that wild landscape not a sign of life was to be seen besides not even a fisherman's hut on the shores of the fiord or a woodman's shed among the trees the stranger might easily have taken the rugged pile itself for a part of the black cliff on which it stood no road seemed to lead up to it no banner floated from its walls no trumpet startled the sea birds that lodged amongst its turrets yet the old castle was not the deserted place it looked for here dwelt sigurd the mightiest hero of all that land brother to ulf the king men hated ulf as much as they loved his brother for sigurd with all his prowess was just and generous and lied to no man if sigurd were but king said they one to the other our land would be the happiest the sun shines upon as it is ulf makes us wretched we had rather be his enemies than his friends but though they said this one to another sigurd listened to none of it and when they urged him to rebel he sternly bade them hold their peace and he went forth and fought the battles of the king his brother and they followed him wishing only the battle cry were sigurd and not ulf for all this loyalty the king gave his brother little thanks indeed as victory followed victory and sigurd's fame rose higher and higher ulf's heart swelled with jealousy and jealousy presently grew to hate for it was not in ulf's nature to endure that another should be held greater than himself so instead of rewarding his brother for his service he accused him and degraded him and made another general in his place now said the soldiers our chief will surely rebel and we will follow his lead and pluck down ulf from the throne and set up our sigurd but sigurd sternly silenced them and bade them serve their king as they feared him he meanwhile departed sadly from his brother's court and came and dwelt alone in his tower of the north west wind for many weeks the time passed slowly as sigurd brooded over his wrongs and pined in idleness yet this grieved him less than the secret visits of not a few of his old comrades who had deserted ulf and now came begging him to lead them forth and rid the land of a tyrant he sent them each sternly away bidding them on pain of his anger return to their duty and serve the king and they durst not disobey so passed many a weary month in the tower of the north west wind when one bright summer day a little fleet of english ships sailed gaily up the fiord under the castle walls sigurd joyfully bade the voyagers welcome to his castle for the chief of the little band was raedwald an english king whom sigurd himself only two years before had visited in his own land there too he had met not raedwald only but raedwald's beautiful daughter who now with her gay train of attendants accompanied her father on this visit to his friend and comrade and now the days passed gaily and only too swiftly for the happy sigurd in the company of raedwald and amid the smiles of the ladies ulf was forgotten and all the wrongs of the past vanished the tower of the north west wind was no longer a gloomy fortress but a gay palace and like the summer day in the northern heavens the sun of sigurd's content knew no setting before the day of raedwald's departure arrived a wedding had taken place in the chapel of the good old tower and the english king as he hauled his anchors and set his sails westward knew not whether to mourn over the daughter he had given up or to rejoice over the son he had gained as for sigurd he could do nothing but rejoice and some who saw him and heard him laugh said smiling the queen his wife is a fairer sweetheart than was the king his brother ulf and our country and all of us are forgotten in the smiles of this little english maiden but three days after raedwald had sailed a storm broke over the tower of the north west wind the summer sea lashed furiously against the rocks and far up the fiord the angry breakers rushed in so that no boat could live upon their surface for an hour that night as sigurd sat heedless of the hurricane without and feasted with his lords and ladies they came and told him that a raft had been driven ashore at the foot of the castle with a man upon it half dead sigurd bade them instantly bring him to the castle and give him fire and clothing and food to revive him in his unhappy plight this they did and presently came to the hero with the hews that the man lived and desired to speak with his deliverer so sigurd ordered him to be brought up and as the tempest raged without his heart rejoiced to know that one man at least had been saved from its ravages the man was of the common order and though clothed in a rough woodman's suit it was plain to see he was a soldier he fell at the feet of the prince and poured forth his thanks for the shelter given him that night and who art thou asked sigurd to whom such thanks were never welcome i am a servant of king ulf thy brother at the mention of the king's name the faces of those present fell and sigurd asked sternly and what is thy errand here i was sent said the man with two others to spy into your state here the king has heard of your merrymakings and of your alliance with the english king he bade us see how you were armed and how prepared for a sudden assault and then return secretly and report it to him and is it thus you perform your errand cried sigurd where are thy companions drowned my liege in the fiord as i had been but for your gracious help and when is the king coming to assault this tower demanded an english noble who sat near never said the man shortly and why asked sigurd oh my liege said the man dropping once more on his knees please heaven in a week's time there will be no king in all this land but sigurd the hero started from his seat and seized the man roughly what is it you say he cried speak out and that plainly or it will be worse for you on this day week said the trembling serf ulf is to visit his castle of niflheim he goes there alone as you my liege came hither to receive his bride but he will never return the way he came for bur and harald your friends my prince have vowed to slay him there and at one blow rid the land of a tyrant and give it a just and good king when sigurd heard this he turned white and red with wrath and fear fiercely he summoned his guards and bade them seize the spy and cast him into the dungeon then as soon as words came he turned to the company and said you hear what this knave says yes we hear cried some and we rejoice that sigurd's day has come at last long live king sigurd then sigurd struck the table with his fist as he started to his feet and glared at the rash companions villains he shouted with a voice that made the room itself tremble yes sigurd's day has come the day for teaching cowards like you the duty of a knight and a brother ulf at his bridal unarmed slain by traitors' hands is that the chivalry ye praise if so begone from my sight and reach of this arm but 'tis no time for talk without there my arms and saddle my horse what means this cried all where go you sigurd i go to my brother he said your brother ulf is eight days' sail from here 'tis but five days across the forest said the hero at this the ladies shrieked and all looked on sigurd as a man that is mad the forest said you cried one it swarms with wolves sigurd and where the wolves are not the robbers lurk sigurd smiled scornfully it is wolves and robbers i go to seek he said if thou wilt go they said then we will go with thee no cried sigurd i go alone let him who loves me remain here and guard my lady i can trust you to be true to a lady but ye have yet to learn to be loyal to a prince at this many hung their heads and were silent sigurd meanwhile put on his armour and turned hurriedly to bid farewell to his wife the hero's voice trembled as he prayed heaven to guard over her they all accompanied him to the courtyard where quickly mounting he departed and rode slowly forward into the forest sigurd rode slowly forward into the forest and as he entered it he turned for one last look at the brave old castle which held within its walls the joy of his life and a soft voice at his ear whispered return yet he halted not nor did his courage waver for another voice louder than the other cried onward it seemed like his brother's voice as he had known it years ago before troubles came and when as merry boys the two lived with but one heart between them and at the sound he put spurs to his horse and plunged into the wood gloomy indeed was this forest of lonely pines which rocked and groaned in the wind and in which a dim twilight deepening often into black darkness reigned on every hand and gloomier still were those distant cries which rose ever and again above the tempest and caused even the brave horse to shiver as he heard them but sigurd shivered not but rode forward trusting in his god and listening only to that old remembered voice ahead for a league the road was easy and the perils few for thus far the woodman's axe had often fallen amidst the thick underwood clearing a path among the trees and driving before it the sullen wolves into the deeper recesses of the forest but as sigurd rode on and the boughs overhead closed in between him and the light of day these few traces of man's hand vanished his good horse stumbled painfully over the tangled ground often hardly finding himself a path among the dense trunks and all around those wild yells which had mingled with the tempest seemed to draw closer as though eagerly awaiting the horse and its rider somewhere not far off sigurd heeded them not but cheered himself as he rode on by calling to mind some of the beautiful stories of the old religion of his land he thought of the elves and fairies who were said to dwell in these very forests and at midnight to creep up from their hiding places and gambol and play tricks among the flowers and dewdrops with the wild bees and the summer insects or dance in magic circles on the greensward and it did his heart good to feel he was not alone but that these merry little companions were with him lightening his way and guiding his course all the night through and he thought too of luckless dwarfs whom odin had condemned to dig and delve all day deep in the ground and throw fuel on the great central fire of the earth but who at night like the fairies might come above and revisit then old haunts and even these mischievous little companions helped to cheer the heart of the wayfarer and beguile his journey and so he plodded on all through the night resolutely plunging deeper and deeper into the forest and leaving the tower of the norths waistcoat wind league after league farther behind the day passed as the night had passed save for an occasional halt to rest his horse and refresh his body with food nothing broke the dullness of the journey the wolves alone were silent waiting for the night as the afternoon wore on sigurd could see their gaunt forms skulking among the trees casting many a hungry sidelong glance that way and licking their cruel jaws as foretaste of the wished for meal and now sigurd needed to stop his ears closer than ever against the voice which cried return and set his face still more steadfastly towards niflheim for though his heart never faltered his spirits drooped as another night closed in and weary and oppressed he pushed onward the fairies no longer cheered him nor could he smile again at the antics of the dwarfs the soft voice of one behind was all he heard and the music of its tones was sad the voice before still cried onward but it mingled dismally with the storm overhead and the wild and ever increasing howling of the wolves the horse too seemed to share his master's trouble for he stumbled forward spiritlessly hanging his head and trembling at each approaching howl nearer and nearer those cruel voices closed in around him not one but half a score stealthily at first they dogged their prey then gaining boldness advanced and pressed more closely on the heels of the horse sigurd as he glanced quickly round saw a score of cruel eyes flash out in the darkness and almost felt the hot breath in his face one bolder than the rest made an angry snap at the horse's heel the unhappy animal who long ere this had lost his wonted nerve made a sudden bound forward which almost unhorsed his rider the sudden movement was the signal for the pack to leap forward with wild yells and next moment sigurd and his gallant horse were fighting for dear life desperately fought sigurd swinging his trusty axe right and left and carrying at each stroke death among his savage assailants at length the horse beset on all sides exhausted wounded dropped to the ground unable longer to hold out with a cry of savage triumph the wolves leapt upon him in a hideous howling struggling mass sigurd scarcely gaining his feet after the fall started forward alone for the horse that was dead was more to the wolves than the hero who yet lived and over the carcass they jostled and fought and screamed ravenously till nought remained to fight for sigurd knew well as he hastened forward axe in hand and sword in belt his spear had broken off short that the respite was but short a few minutes and the pack would be once more on the trail and then it would be his turn yet he prayed his god to send him help and bring him through the peril he hurried on yet slowly by reason of the tangled paths and dense underwood of the forest listening to the angry tumult behind and wondering how long before the hue and cry began once more it was not long scarcely had he forced his way a half mile when he could hear the pack following onward they came at a rush with hideous tumult and sigurd knew that the foremost would be upon him in a moment he strode on casting a glance back at every step and gripping fast his trusty axe presently just as he reached a small clearing among the trees the brushwood behind him crackled and a pair of eyes gleamed close at hand then sigurd turned and putting his back against a broad tree waited on they came half sated doubly savage with the taste of blood on their jaws desperately once more fought sigurd swinging his axe right and left and dealing death at every blow till he stood surrounded by a half circle of dead or dying wolves sigurd fought till he could scarce stand or wield his axe many a cruel wound weakened him his eyes grew dim his hand unsteady his blows uncertain he could do no more the axe fell from his grasp and he reeled back as he did so there rose loud above the wind and above the howling of the wolves a cry which caused sigurd to start once more to his feet and the wild beasts to pause midway in their mortal onslaught it was the deep mouthed voice of a dog and next moment a huge mastiff dashed from out of the thicket and fastened on the throat of the foremost wolf it was sigurd's own watch dog thor whom some dear hand had loosed from his chain and sent forth into the forest to guard and maybe save his master at the sight of the great champion and at sound of his bark the cowardly wolves one by one slunk sullenly back into the woods and sigurd felt that he was saved a joyous meeting was that between gallant master and gallant hound thor my brave dog cried sigurd is it to thee then i owe my life my brother's life yet not to thee so much as to the fair lady who sent thee a messenger of love and life to me thanks thor thanks lady thank most to god now shall i reach niflheim even yet thor wagged his great tail and barked joyfully in answer all that night sigurd lay secure watched over by the sleepless thor whose honest bark was the sweetest music that ever lulled a hero to repose for two days sigurd trudged safely onward through that dense forest with thor the dog beside him the way was hard and painful and the hero's limbs now his only support crashed wearily through the thickets but faint and weary though he was his bold heart and the thought of his brother carried him through four days had come and gone since he quitted the tower of the north west wind and in three more ulf would either be saved or slain sigurd as he thought of it strode sternly forward and shut his ears to all the backward voices and with thor at his side all danger from the wolves seemed at an end as the two pressed on many a distant how fell on their ears many a gaunt form stole out from among the trees to gaze at them and then steal back thor's honest bark carried panic among those cruel hordes while it comforted the heart of sigurd for two days without sleep without rest without proper food the hero walked on till on the fifth morning after quitting his castle the light broke in among the trees the woodman's cheerful axe resounded through the glades the angry howling sounded far behind and sigurd knew he was on the other side of the forest in one day he would reach jockjen and scarce two hours' march beyond jockjen lay niflheim thor seemed to guess his master's mind and with a hopeful bark bounded forward but sigurd regarded his companion sadly and doubtfully he called him to him caressed him lovingly and said good thor thou hast been like a messenger from god to bring me through this wood alas that we must part thor stopped short as he heard these last words and moaned piteously yes good thor said the hero sadly for i cannot live another day without sending a message to my lady that i am safe thanks to her and thee the dog who seemed to understand it all looked up in his master's face beseechingly as if to persuade him against his resolve the danger now is past said sigurd no wolves haunt the forest betwixt here and jockjen and in the town thy presence may discover me so haste back good thor to my lady with this my message so saying he took from the ground a smooth strip of bark on which with the point of his sword he wrote something then turning to thor carry this he said to her and as thor turned and hastened off on his errand sigurd looked after him and sighed and wished he too were going that way but time forbade that he should linger long thus and once more he turned his face resolutely towards jockjen and went on alone although the forest stretched some leagues farther the trees were no longer dense or the path difficult in parts large clearings had been made and felled timber here and there betokened the busy hand of the woodman sigurd met more than one of these who accosted him he would not however tarry with any of them but pressed eagerly forward so that they would turn and look after this noble knight and wonder who he was and whither he hasted one of these simple folk with whom he waited a few minutes to partake of a hasty meal said at parting beware my lord of the robbers who haunt the skirts of the forest they come suddenly upon the unwary traveller and have no pity sigurd smiled i have passed the four footed wolves he said i fear not the two footed nay but said the peasant they are not to be despised ever since sigurd was banished many of his soldiers have deserted the king and now live the robber's life in these woods stay here my lord till a band of us will be going to jockjen together but sigurd smiled scornfully and thanking the man started forward fearing nothing save arriving too late at niflheim yet the woodman's warning was not lost upon him for he walked with his drawn sword in his hand keeping both his eyes and ears open as he went all that day he pressed onward and towards evening came to a lonely part of the wood where the trees for a short space all round closed thickly overhead and shut out the light he had passed through this spot and was once more emerging into the open when three men suddenly sprang out of the thicket and faced him two of them were in the garb of common peasants and carried the one a club the other a knife sigurd guessed them at once to be two of the robbers of whom the woodman had warned him their companion was a powerful man in the dress of a soldier and carried a sword in him though he knew not the man sigurd recognised a soldier of the army of the king who as he might guess had deserted his lawful calling for the life of a bandit the party was plainly unprepared to meet a knight fully armed they had expected rather to find some defenceless merchant or even woodman whom they might easily overcome and as easily rob they fell back an instant before the noble form of sigurd but the next true to their calling rushed upon him shouting to him to surrender and yield up whatever of value he might possess on his person sigurd wasted not a word in replying to this insolent challenge but defended himself against the sudden assault at the first onslaught the two bandits were foremost who thought to bear him down by sheer weight but sigurd stepping back a pace caught the knife of the one on his shield while with his own sword he ran his comrade through the body so quickly was it done that the soldier advancing wildly to the attack stumbled and fell over the body of the prostrate man and before he could rise again to his feet a second thrust from sigurd's sword had laid low the other bandit beside his comrade the soldier therefore was the only adversary that remained and of him sigurd thought to make short work but in this he judged wrongly for this robber proved to be a man of extraordinary strength and agility while sigurd himself was faint and jaded with his long and painful march for an hour that afternoon the woods resounded with the clash of swords the two men spoke not a word but fought with teeth set and lips closed once and again by common consent they halted leaning on their swords for breath but as often closed again more furiously than ever it surprised sigurd to find an adversary so resolute and dextrous at another time it might have pleased him for he loved courage even in an adversary but now when every hour lost meant peril to ulf his bosom swelled with wrath and disappointment by force of superior weight he drove his adversary back inch by inch till at the end of an hour the two stood some yards distant from the spot where the fight began yet though falling back the soldier kept a bold guard and while not inflicting any wound on his enemy was able to ward off all blows aimed at himself at length when for a moment sigurd seemed to flag in the combat the man gathered himself together for one mighty stroke at the hero's head it fell like a thunderbolt but sigurd saw it in time and caught it on his uplifted sword and with such force that the soldier's weapon broke in two and he himself overbalanced by the shock fell backwards to the ground then sigurd with a glance of triumph planted his foot on the body of his prostrate foe and prepared to avenge the delay of that hour's combat the man neither struggled nor called for mercy but looked boldly up in his victor's face and awaited death with a smile the sword of sigurd did not descend some passing memory perchance or some soft voice breathing mercy held it back he drew back his foot and sheathing his weapon said keep thy life and return and serve the king thy master the man lay for a moment as one bewildered then springing to his feet and casting from him his broken sword he knelt and cried oh merciful knight to thee i owe my life and it is thee i will serve to the world's end peace said sigurd sternly this is no time for parley i must be in jockjen this night follow me if thou wilt thus far and with that he began to stride once more forward with rapid steps followed closely by his late adversary sigurd uttered not a word but walked with sword drawn as before fearing nothing save to arrive too late at niflheim once as they neared jockjen two other robbers rushed out from the woods as if to attack him but when they perceived the stalwart champion who followed hasten forward and place himself beside the traveller they refrained and departed suddenly the way they came and now they were come at last to jockjen but when sigurd made as though he would enter the town his follower hastened to overtake him and said my knight avoid this town for ulf the king is here and has commanded that no stranger enter it is ulf here inquired sigurd they told me he was at niflheim the man looked strangely at him my lord said he you know what only a few know ulf is to be at niflheim when demanded sigurd this night said the man sigurd answered nothing but walked on quickly the man seeing that he was determined to enter the town followed cautiously and at a distance waiting to see what might happen it was evening as sigurd entered jockjen the little town overshadowed by its grim fortress was astir with unwonted bustle for the king's marriage on the morrow had brought together many of the country people who though they loved not ulf loved a pageant and a holiday to see it in and besides them many soldiers were there who talked mysteriously at street corners and seemed to have other business than merry making on hand sigurd passed unheeded through the streets keeping his face hid in his cloak and avoiding all points where the crowd seemed large or curious he was hastening thus stealthily down a by street which led towards niflheim when he suddenly became aware of a small group of men before him under the shadow of a high wall in eager talk he halted for by their eager gestures and cautious looks he judged them to be desperate men whom it would be well for him to avoid rather then meet withdrawing quickly into a deeper shade he waited with impatience till their conference should be over as he waited he heard them speak by this time said one he should have learned what is in store doubtless said another yet i am glad it was no earlier for it will all be over before he can prevent it ulf once dead said the first sigurd cannot help being the king however much he may dislike it nay he dislikes not being king but he is so foolishly tender about his brother the other laughed there are others i trust will not be foolishly tender with his brother this night at what hour is the deed to be done by midnight at this sigurd who had heard it all could not refrain from starting where he stood the men heard him in an instant and finding themselves thus discovered rushed with one accord on the hero before sigurd could draw his sword or offer any resistance he was overpowered and held fast by his assailants who for fear he should cry aloud and alarm the town threw a cloak over his head and led him off quickly to the castle here when the guards came out and inquired what it all meant this man they said we know to be an enemy of the king's who has come disguised to this town to do him some harm keep him fast till the morning the guard without so much as uncovering sigurd's face hurried him through the gate and brought him to a dark dungeon into which they thrust him turning the key twice upon him then sigurd cast himself on the floor in despair to find himself thus confined after all the fatigues he had suffered and all the perils he had escaped was fearful indeed the more so because he knew his brother was close at hand and yet must die with no brotherly hand to help him for himself he cared nought the men who had cast him there called themselves his friends and as he knew desired only to keep him fast believing him to be a stranger who might disclose their plot when all was over and ulf dead they would release him and perchance discover who he was sigurd wished he might die before the morning but presently as he lay he heard a sound of feet on the pavement without approaching his dungeon the door slowly opened and a monk stood before him the hope that dawned in sigurd's breast as the door opened faded again as a gruff voice without said do thy work quickly father a short shrift is all the villain deserves with that the door closed again and sigurd and the monk were left in darkness i am to die then asked the hero of the holy man 'tis reported said the monk you seek the king's life therefore in the morning you are to die but added he speaking lower you shall not die my lord sigurd started not at the words but at the voice that uttered them who art thou he whispered one who owes thee his life and would repay thee my lord i am he whom thou sparedst but lately in the wood in the dark sigurd could not see his face but he knew he spoke the truth quick said the man throwing off his gown and hood off with thy armour my lord and don these there is no time to spare for a moment sigurd paused amazed at the man's offer then the thought of ulf decided him brave friend said he heaven bless you for your aid for four hours i accept thy deliverance and borrow my freedom if before then i have not returned call me a coward and a knave speak not of borrowing my lord said the man heaven forbid i should require again the poor life thou thyself didst give me peace said sigurd quickly casting off his armour and covering himself in the monk's garb in a few moments the exchange was made then sigurd grasping the hand of his brave deliverer pulled the hood low over his face and stepped to the door and knocked the guard without unlocked the door and as he did so the robber crouching in a distant corner of the dungeon clanked his arms and sighed ha ha brave monk said the guard to sigurd laughingly this villain likes not your news 'tis clear you have done your task the headsman shall soon do his sigurd said nothing but with head bent and hands clasped walked slowly from the cell and on towards the gate here no man stopped him but some more devout than the rest rendered obeisance and crossed themselves as he passed once out of the castle sigurd breathed freely and with thankful heart quickened his pace through the fast emptying streets in the direction of niflheim a double care now pressed on him the first on account of his brother's danger the other lest he himself in his efforts to save the king should be detained and so unable to keep faith with the brave man he had left in his place in the dungeon he therefore pressed on with all speed unheeded by passers by to whom the sight of a monk hurrying on some mission of mercy was no strange thing in due time in the dim twilight the castle of niflheim rose before him and he felt that his journey was nearly done late as it was there was revelling going on in the palace knights and ladies crowded the halls whilst without in the outer rooms persons of all degrees congregated to witness the festivities and share in the hospitalities of the royal bridegroom for though ulf was hated by all some either through fear or greediness failed not to keep up a show of loyalty and even mirth in the royal presence sigurd entered the palace unchallenged and mingled with the outer throng of onlookers no one noticed him but he looking round from under his hood could see many faces that he knew and amongst them the conspirators whom he had that evening overheard plotting in the streets of jockjen the sight of these men doubled his uneasiness for the appointed hour was nearly come and unless he fulfilled his errand forthwith he might yet be too late he therefore approached a knight whom he knew to be still faithful to the king and drawing him aside said sir i would speak with the king i have great news for him you cannot speak to night holy friar said the knight for the king is banqueting come in the morning it may be too late in the morning said sigurd why what news have you that is so urgent demanded the soldier i bear news of sigurd the king's brother who is approaching and may be here to night ha exclaimed the knight eagerly sigurd advancing how many has he with him and does he come in peace or war you know said sigurd there is no peace between ulf and sigurd but i pray you take me to the king for i have more news that will not bear delay at this the soldier went and sigurd waited anxiously the knight soon returned the king said he will see you anon after he shall have spoken to four worthy citizens of jockjen who have craved a secret audience so saying he left him and advanced to where the conspirators stood expecting to be summoned then sigurd could contain himself no longer with hurried strides pushing his way among the crowd he followed and overtook the knight before he could deliver his summons seizing him fiercely by the arm in a way which made the man of war start in amazement he led him aside and said eagerly sir i must see the king before those men the knight in anger at being thus handled cast him off roughly but sigurd would not be daunted bring me to the king he said or i will go to him without thy leave the knight amazed at being thus spoken to looked round and made as though he would summon the guard but sigurd seeing it and now grown desperate caught him by the neck and putting his mouth to his ear whispered something which done he drew back and for a moment lifted the hood from his face the knight started in amazement but quickly recovering his presence of mind stepped aside with sigurd then sigurd knowing the man to be loyal and trustworthy hurriedly told him all and charged him to be secret and see to his brother's safety the knight begged him to remain and see the king but sigurd fearing all delay and feeling that his task at the castle was done would not stay but departed forthwith before he had well left the place the four conspirators were arrested and lodged in the deepest dungeon of the fortress the guards especially such as stood near the person of the king were enlarged the guests were quietly dispersed and that night ulf slept secure at niflheim little dreaming of the peril he had escaped or of the brother who had saved him sigurd meanwhile light at heart sped on the wings of the wind back to jockjen people wondered at the wild haste of the monk as he passed but he looked neither right nor left till he stood once more at the great gate of the castle the guard stood at the entrance as before thou art returned betimes holy father said he for our prisoner is like to want thee for a last shrift presently great was sigurd's joy to learn that he was in time and that the man he had left behind lived still when is he to die he inquired before an hour is past said the guard for what crime the guard laughed you are a stranger in ulf's kingdom monk if you think a man needs to be a criminal in order to die but in truth the king knows nothing of it what is the man's name said sigurd i know not did you see his face or hear his voice no why should we we could believe those who brought him here and were they the king's officers the king's that is now said the guard why exclaimed sigurd what do you mean is not ulf the king no said the man when you went out two hours ago he was but now sigurd is king false villain cried sigurd catching the fellow by the throat thou art a traitor like all the rest the soldier astonished to be thus assailed by a monk stood for a moment speechless and before he could find words sigurd had cast back the hood from his own head the man who knew him at once turned pale as ashes and trembling from head to foot fell on his knees but sigurd scornfully bade him rise and summon the guard which he did great was the amazement of the soldiers as they assembled to see a monk bareheaded stand with his hand on the throat of their comrade and greater still did it become when they recognised in those stern noble features their own prince sigurd before they could recover their presence of mind sigurd held up his hand to enjoin silence and said let two men go at once to the dungeon and bring the prisoner out while they were gone the group stood silent as men half dazed and wondered what would happen next in a few moments the two guards returned bringing with them the prisoner whom sigurd greeted with every token of gratitude and joy brave friend he exclaimed but for thy generous devotion this night might have ended in murder and ruin and these knaves and their friends might have done their king and me a grievous wrong accept sigurd's thanks what exclaimed the prisoner falling on his knees art thou sigurd do i owe my poor life to the bravest of all heroes i owe my life to thee rather said sigurd and not mine only but my brother's then turning to the bewildered and shame struck soldiers he said men for i scorn to call you friends it remains for you to choose between your duty or the punishment reserved for traitors you may thank heaven your wicked plans for this night have been foiled and that traitors though you be you do not stand here as murderers also let those who refuse to return to their allegiance stand forward not a man moved then said sigurd i demand a pledge of your loyalty we will prove it with our lives cried the men conscience struck and meaning what they said all i ask said sigurd is that not a man here breathes a word of this night's doing besides yourselves one man only knows of my being at niflheim and he has vowed secrecy do you do the same the soldiers eagerly gave the required pledge i leave you now said sigurd at the post of duty let him who would serve me serve my king we will we will cried the men sigurd held up his hand it is enough said he i am content and you friend said he to the late prisoner will you accompany me home the man joyfully consented and that same night those two departed to the sea and before morning were darting over the waves towards the castle of the north west wind sigurd's secret was safely kept ulf to the day of his death knew nothing of his brother's journey to niflheim nor could he tell the reason why the loyalty of his soldiers revived from that time forward he died in battle not long after yet he lived long enough to repent of his harshness towards his brother and to desire to see him again messengers from him were on their way to the tower of the north west wind at the time when he fell on the field of brulform sigurd's first act after becoming king was to erect a monument on the spot where ulf fell with this simple inscription which may be read to this day to my brother chapter six sub chapter i my first tragedy foreword i have admired tragedy from my earliest days i believe i must have acted in it in the nursery at least the scenes i have in my mind appeared to me to be tragic at the time although it was not of my own will that i participated in them the occasions for instance when i was stood in the corner for misconduct at table or thrashed by my big brother for my cheek or dosed with castor oil by the doctor for mulligrubs all stand out in my memory as tragic and no doubt prepared me to appreciate tragedy later on as a fine art as soon as i went to school i found still more extended opportunities for studying that art tragedy dogged my footsteps and marked me for her own from the first i was bullied that was bad enough i was caned that was worse i had to learn latin verbs that was worst of all i was a practised tragedian at seven acts one two and three were performed as a rule once a day and now and then encored the worst of it was that the person who got most of the applause was not the wretched actor but the author i was quite overlooked this convinced me early that it is more profitable to make tragedies for other people to act than to act in them oneself and at a tender age therefore i set before myself the profession of a tragic author for long enough however i had to wait my inspiration i was kept so busy in the capacity of actor from which my special talents would not permit me to retire as early as i should myself have wished that it was comparatively late in life i mean i had turned twelve before the grand idea of writing a tragedy dawned in my ardent breast even then it was destined to simmer for three or four years owing to pressure of other work and the still more pressing lack of a subject meanwhile however i read tragedies ardently i read shakespeare more or less and admired him rather although i could see his weak points and thought him considerably overrated i had also read the nursery rhymes carefully and most of the harrowing stories of history and fiction particularly the latter i had moreover recently made a tragic acquaintance with the greek drama in the person of a scoundrel called aeschylus whose sickening lucubrations i was forced to learn by heart and now and then to copy out a hundred lines at a time till i grew to detest him all these circumstances combined decided me to write a tragedy on my own account which while following shakespeare in his good points should avoid his weaknesses which should embody the best features of the nursery rhymes and which should avoid like poison the shockingly debased style of aeschylus after mature reflection i hit upon a theme which i flattered myself was original and suggestive shakespeare had kept off it and it was after aeschylus' time and as far as i knew i was the first to clothe it in a tragic garb i refer to the story of romulus and remus it was classical sanguinary and sounded well on a title page besides as very little was known about it there was plenty of scope for original treatment and no one could say whether i was wrong in my facts because no one was in a position to contradict me in addition to that as the story related to boys and athletic sports both of which subjects i knew something about it seemed the very theme of a good tragedy which might make my name immortal and rank to all generations as an english classic it might have but somehow it didn't however i have kept the copy still and this book shall be the fortunate medium of introducing the tragedy to the world in case any of my readers as is possible should be unacquainted with the story of romulus and remus let me say that i believe but am not quite sure that they were two twin brothers both boys left orphans at an early age and nursed by a stepmother in the shape of a wolf they were subsequently discovered and having grown to manhood it occurred to romulus to build rome for this modest undertaking remus chaffed his brother and practised the high jump over his walls naturally damaging them considerably whereupon romulus knocked him on the head and lived happily ever afterwards this briefly is the story now for the tragedy romulus and remus or catching him on the hop the sub title was a concession to the democratic tastes of the present generation who like to have their curiosity excited without being told too much dramatis persona men romulus a boy remus his brother john a shepherd faustulus a policeman women a wolf mary ann a maiden of forty chorus soldiers sailors volunteers bricklayers boys maidens and lictors act i scene i a wood near rome enter she wolf with two boys in her mouth john following john she monster tell me what have you got there wolf two kids my john and dinner time is

this big lonely wood and i live in a hole in a tree and i daily prowl forth in my free hungry mood to look for my dinner and tea i never object to the wing of a man or a tender young lamb gives me joy but what i like best is a slice off the breast or the leg or the arm of a boy to day i'm in luck as you plainly may see by the morsels that kick in my maw fetch a knife fork and spoon john for you and for me dinner's ready young boys taste best raw rom oh impious monster hold thy howling jaw and you john to your flocks return once more forbear to talk of eating me and remus you ugly wicked ill conditioned schemers here i should remark that to be strictly accurate my tragedy should be called a tragic opera it abounds in songs calculated to stir familiar chords in the breasts of a popular and juvenile audience it may here be objected that my heroes are at this time only a few weeks old but instances of precocious children especially in tragic drama are not unheard of and after careful inquiry the author is not satisfied that in the present case the young persons in question did not speak fluently allowance must of course be made for youthful inexperience in the matter of rhymes remus d'you hear you cads shut up and let us be you shall not dine off romulus and me john in alarm upon my word what if the boys are right friend lupus thanks i'd rather not to night wolf scornfully what do you funk it well i call that rough john fact is i can't help thinking they'd taste tough rom and rem excitedly we would we would we're awful tough to eat we're only skin and bone and gristle

little kids from nurse you let us be or we'll tell our ma and she'll inform our awful pa if he comes round you'll catch a tartar two little kids from nurse wolf turning pale your words alarm me gentle lads behold i'll be your nurse until you're two years old then if you have not found your pa or ma i will adopt you what say you rom and rem hurrah john so now that's settled let's chant one more strain and after that i'll to my home again song rom who ran to gulp me where i lay and took me in her mouth away and talked of eating me to day the she wolf rem who scrunched my arm and clawed my side and would not heed me when i cried but whispered won't he taste prime fried the she wolf john who wouldn't spare two pretty boys until they kicked and made a noise who ever thus her time employs

your size keep down your guard good hit out fair that's one for remus' nose ha romulus you caught it there keep steady with your toes don't lose your tempers it's not right the author's motive in thus lightly treating the opening scenes of his hero's career is to postpone the gloom of the tragedy to a later period time let 'em blow a bit my how i like to see 'em fight it sends me in a fit has a fit

walls of a great city dig this was his object here he takes his stand romans ever ever ever i'll command chorus all going rule old roma roma rule the land romans ever ever ever he'll command exeunt omnes chapter seven a night with the crowned heads sub chapter i the arrest it was a ferociously hot day at the beginning of the summer vac i as in duty bound had been spending my first day as a well conducted newly broken up schoolboy should being fully impressed with the importance of combining self improvement with all my recreations i had been in the morning to the zoo where i had eaten buns with the elephant cracked jokes and nuts with the monkeys prodded the hippopotamus got a rise out of the grizzly made the lions roar had a row with the chimpanzee and generally enjoyed myself then i had done the tower this only took ten minutes as the place was horribly slow and fellows looked after you wherever you went after that i had had a turn at the circus to study the habits of the horse in a state of nature i should have liked this more if the clown had not been such a muff he wasn't half up to his business and consequently the place was not as improving as it ought to have been so i shook off the dust of it from my feet and after laying some apples and other things aboard took an omnibus to madame tussaud's where i knew i should see some fellows of my acquaintance and be able to improve my mind in good company you must know i had pulled off the third history prize in our division last term and therefore felt more or less friendly disposed to the kings and queens generally and was even a little curious to see what they looked like now that i was supposed to know more about them than most fellows do to tell the truth although i had several times been to madame tussaud's before i had invariably cut these grand people and devoted myself to another part of the establishment which boys are usually supposed to understand better even on the present occasion it was necessary to pay a visit to those regions since several celebrated historical figures were kept down there which i felt i must on no account miss seeing but after i had thoroughly explored that portion making the acquaintance of all the new comers putting my head into the guillotine taking a turn in the condemned cell sitting in napoleon's carriage and otherwise informing myself concerning the seamy side of human nature i determined to be virtuous and devote at least half an hour to the study of the royalties in the great hall the enterprise was not to be undertaken without refreshment i therefore took a preliminary excursion to the ground floor where the historical costumes are kept and close beside them the ices buns victoria sandwiches ginger beer turkish delight lemon squashes and other wholesome aids to historical research here i dallied a little just long enough to repair the ravages of nature and then feeling very much as little jack horner did after he had partaken of refreshment i mounted once more the marble stairs and set myself to do the crowned heads i set myself literally for it occurred to me i could do their majesties just as well sitting as standing and as the afternoon was hot and the sofa near the door was comfortable and as moreover i was slightly oppressed with my study of the costumes downstairs and considerably soothed by the strains of madame tussaud's orchestra it so fell out that just as i was nodding how do you do to william the conqueror i dropped asleep how long i slept i must leave it to those of my readers who have come through the same exertions of mind and body to guess i had never intended to exceed a short forty winks because i was aware that only half an hour was left before the time for closing arrived but when i awoke it was with a start to find that the place was silent dark and deserted the music had gone the shuffling of footsteps on the stairs had ceased the hum of voices had died away all was so quiet that my own breathing sounded loud and noisy i rubbed my eyes and looked round yes i was on the same seat but not a soul was left in the place only i i and the wax figures the lights were out all except one solitary gas jet over the door of the chamber of horrors which sent a flickering gleam my way and danced weirdly in and out among the motionless images around me it was not a comfortable position to be in and i confess i did not like it of course a wax image in the dark is the same as a wax image in the day still thought i i would sooner be outside and what was it made me stop short and sit up in my seat petrified and with the blood curdling in my veins my eyes while i meditated had turned towards william the conqueror to whom as i have already said i had been in the act of nodding in a friendly way when i dropped asleep to my horror i now perceived that he was in a most unmistakable manner nodding at me yes by the feeble light i could see not only his head move but even his eyes too i was helpless and speechless i could no more move or call out or take my eyes off him than if i had been a wax figure myself presently i saw his hands move slowly to the arms of his chair and then keeping his eyes still on me he rose to his feet i could hear the clank of the sword against his greaves as he stepped off his platform on to the floor of the hall and advanced a step towards me then as i sat quaking there i felt his eyes upon mine and knew that he was staring at me from head to toe by a superhuman effort i dug my fingers into the plush of the sofa and ejaculated a frantic oh the cry resounded fearfully through the building and seemed to wake echoes which certainly had nothing in common with my voice it was as if every one in the place had suddenly caught sight of me at the same moment and was giving vent to his or her astonishment i had better have remained silent for as i gave one scared look round i saw king john lay down his pen and rising hastily walk towards me he scowled viciously at me and then as i collapsed in a heap on to the floor i saw him turn inquiringly to william the conqueror whatever the question he asked was william answered it in the affirmative whereupon john turned round to the rest of the company and beckoned with his hand instantly william rufus henry the first stephen matilda henry the second and richard coeur de lion came forward william the second turned me over with his foot and stooped down to look at my face that's him said he that's he you mean said henry beauclerk i mean nothing of the kind said rufus i mean him so now old lampreys they were not lampreys said henry sulkily they were oysters yes yes said matilda but what business has he here him said rufus doggedly you'd better ask him said stephen with a sneer the chances are he'll want to know what business you have here i'm as much an empress as you said matilda spitefully i know that which means you're no empress at all look here said henry the second don't you cheek me steevie she let you have it pretty hot you know hot i like that said stephen it was cold enough that day she made tracks in the snow i've had rheumatism ever since by the way said henry the second i can put you up to a capital cure for rheumatism tried it myself it was after that little affair about beckett you know i was a good deal run down and i got a fellow to touch me up on the shoulder with a cat you've no notion how it picks a fellow up quite my own notion too come and i'll give you a dose don't mind the governor said richard he will have his joke did you ever read the talisman tilly jolly story all about yours truly you can get it for pence ha'penny i say what's to be done with this chap johnny he's a little like arthur of brittany isn't he suppose just to keep your hand in here john turned very red and got into a towering rage and threatened to tear up the magna charta to spite them all whereat they all laughed all this time i lay bewildered and speechless on the floor it was a long time before they could bring their minds to decide what was to be done with me and indeed i began half to hope they had forgotten me in their own squabbles when a great burly form pushed his way into the group and asked what all the noise was about as if i haven't noise enough in my place with all my six wives talking at the same time said he without your row what is it can't you settle it and be done william rufus turned me over again with his foot that thing's the matter said he king hal stooped down with his hands on his knees and stared at me then he gave a low whistle whew said he that's a catch and a half where did you get him here a quarter of an hour ago said william the conqueror it was me nobbled him not me i said henry the first you exclaimed the conqueror why what do you expect if you tell lies like that i didn't mean i got him explained henry i meant you should say it was i i shan't say it was you when it was me said william i'm not given to that style of thing i can tell you no no began henry again what i mean is that instead of saying it was me who said it was you i said it was me yes and that's where you make a mistake you should say look here said henry the eighth suppose you settle that outside the thing is whoever nobbled him as william says hadn't we better give him a cold chop now we've got him better try him first said john i make a strong point of that in magna charta you know much easier to take the chop first said henry i prefer stakes myself said queen mary joining the party well well any way you like said king hal anything for a quiet life the ladies are worrying me to give them a day out and an old bailey trial will be a nice variety for them only let's have it done in proper state if we have it at all i suppose you'd like me to be judge eh nobody seemed particularly pleased at this proposal and richard said you'd better ask elizabeth hadn't you oh good gracious no exclaimed henry in alarm don't say a word about it to her or there'll be a terrible rumpus i assure you i have studied law all my life come along bring him downstairs and let's begin here teddy cried he to a nice looking boy not far off who must have been edward the fifth here teddy run and tell catherine and annie and janie and annie cleeves and kitty howard and kitty parr let's see is that all said he counting them over on his fingers yes six tell 'em all to hurry up and not to let elizabeth see them whatever they do oh and you can tell all the lot of majesties after johnny here they'd better come too come look alive my lad all very well said teddy how am i to look alive after the way i've been served besides i can never remember all their names well look them up in the catalogue they're all down there tell them the big dock downstairs and if we're lucky and get the job over in time i don't mind standing treat all round in the refreshment room afterwards that will fetch them i fancy eh what sub chapter ii the trial the room suddenly grew dim and silent again and i began to think that after all i had been only dreaming but when i lifted my head and looked round the place of the kings was empty there was william the conqueror's footstool where he had upset it and there lay the pen and ink on the floor under king john's chair as for the big group in the middle not a soul was left there except chaucer and william caxton who had taken possession of the two easiest chairs and were deep in a game of chess as i picked myself slowly up off the floor i became aware of the gleam of a lantern approaching me and heard a footstep coming down the hall it was too dark to see who it was till he was close up then with a gasp i recognised marwood the hangman oh said he pleasantly you're the young party are you come cheer up you've got to be tried first the fact is they couldn't find the regular police and asked me to step up for you come my lad said he proceeding to pinion me with the cord in his hand this will brace you up wonderfully you may depend on me to do the job neatly i've just invented a new noose and have been wanting a light weight to try it on so you're in luck come along and don't keep them waiting and he proceeded to conduct me to the chamber of horrors as we passed along the hall one or two of the figures nodded to us and oliver cromwell requested in marwood to let him know when his part of the business was going to begin as he should like to be present i don't care about the trial you know said he seen plenty of that sort of thing but i'd like to see how you do your job you know so don't forget and he slipped a shilling into marwood's hand you've no idea of the civility i receive from some of these gentlemen said the latter to me with emotion little drops of kindness like this always touch me you shall have a little drop too my boy presently i tried feebly to laugh at the joke but i couldn't whereupon he got very sulky and bundled me down the stairs without another word by the dim light of a few candles placed about the room i could see that the chamber of horrors was packed by a dense crowd of sightseers who occupied seats on the floor of the court and sat impatiently whispering together expecting my arrival as i stumbled up the steps of the old bailey dock where room had been made for me between burke and hare the usual thrill of sensation passed round the court i could see henry the eighth and his wives opposite me in the small dock while the other crowned heads jostled one another on the platform of the guillotine there too was the old hermit peeping out through the bars of his cage and the warder in charge of the condemned cell was sweeping his place out and changing the sheets on the bed now then said henry the eighth when all the bustle had subsided wire in somebody let's begin you'd better get a jury first said king john that's one of the first things i insist upon in magna charta order in the court cried henry and magna charta be bothered i shall do as i like do have a jury love said catherine parr it's such fun when they come in with their verdict oh all right have it your own way i should have thought though i could come in with a verdict as well as they now then you there said he addressing the convicts round me answer to your names and he proceeded to call the names out from the catalogue when a dozen had answered anne of cleeves said that's enough henry dear we've got twelve oh have we said he you can have more if you like you know there's plenty left the ladies however decided that a dozen was enough and the trial began prisoner at the bar said edward the black prince who was acting as usher are you guilty or not guilty what's the use of asking him that said henry the eighth when everybody knows eh john here began to explain that he had arranged the matter in magna charta whereupon the judge exclaimed oh gracious if we're to have that up every two minutes i'll adjourn the court now you there said he to me why don't you answer i tried in dumb show to explain that i was not aware what i was being tried for but as no one saw the point of my answer i tremblingly pleaded not guilty oh said henry growing very red in the face all right now somebody let's have the indictment to my horror i suddenly saw reflected on a screen in large characters at the far end of the room my recent examination paper with all my answers appended thereto as i staggered back in terror henry laughed too late now said he you've said not guilty' so you've got to be tried got to be tried eh what now start away begin at the top what's that he says about alfred the great where is alf by the way oh said edward the third he can't come the fact is they've taken him and dressed him up as a french general and he's so awfully busy he says you'd better let his part of the thing slide all serene replied henry lucky job for you prisoner i know what a rage he'd be in over that toast and muffin story you've been telling about him he'd have done you brown my boy i can promise you never mind now let's go on to the next read it out nigger edward the black prince who answered to this genial pet name accordingly read william the conqueror was a cruel tyrant he made many homes desolate and wrote doomsday book in the year ' there cried the conqueror coming to the rail of the guillotine and striking it in a passion with his gauntlet what do you think of that i wrote doomsday book it's a lie my lords and gentlemen of the jury i can stand anything else but when he says i wrote doomsday book i say it's a lie and i hope to see him hung hanged suggested henry the first all right all right said henry the eighth keep cool and you shall see him hung and henry shall see him hanged we'll oblige all parties so you mean to say willie you never did such a thing no never i hope i know my place better said the conqueror and i'm surprised at you for asking such a question got that all down nigger asked the judge yes forge ahead said the black prince now we come to the next william the second surnamed rufus shot in the new forest by walter tyrrell' eh shouted rufus pushing his father aside and coming to the front what's that me shot by walter me do say i suggested henry the first the red king rounded on him at once oh he cried it was you then was it you're the one that did it i guessed as much i knew you were at the bottom of it all along what do you think of that my lords and gentlemen the thing is drawled edward the second did walter order in the court cried henry the eighth kindly allow me to conduct my own case all you've got to say rufus is whether it's true what he says that walter tyrrell shot you him cried rufus he couldn't hit a haystack a yard off if he tried then he didn't do it that's all right why couldn't you have said so at once all down nigger that makes two lies now call up the next henry the first surnamed beauclerk never smiled again after his son was lost and died of a surfeit of lampreys read the prince oh those lampreys groaned henry i am perfectly sick of them i assure you my lords and gentlemen they were no more lampreys no not after you'd done supper growled rufus in that case william retorted beauclerk i should have said there' and not they' but i do assure you gentlemen i never saw a lamprey in my life and as for smiling again added he in quite an apologetic way i did it often when nobody was by really i did are you sure asked the judge show us how you did it whereupon henry the first favoured the court with a fascinating leer which left no doubt on any one's mind that he had been falsely accused so two more lies were set down against me and the black prince called over the next stephen usurped the throne on henry's death' quite right quite right said matilda perfectly correct matilda after a civil war in which her bad temper made her many enemies ' oh you story exclaimed the empress oh you wicked young man address the judge please said henry the eighth oh you wicked young man repeated the empress turning to the bench i'd like to scratch you i would don't do that said henry i get quite enough of that at home i assure you anyhow nigger can chalk it down a lie for you eh and one for me too please said stephen how can a fellow usurp what belongs to him give it up said coeur de lion ask another silence in the court cried the judge put it down nigger and for mercy sake drive on or we shall be here all night henry the second murdered thomas a becket and was served right by having a family of bad sons' read the usher that's nice said henry advancing bad sons indeed never had a better lot in all my life really my lord that ought to count for four lies right off the idea of calling my johnny a bad boy why my lord he was his father's own boy you've only to look at him and if he was a bit of a romp why so were you and i in our day speak for yourself said henry the eighth severely but what about becket ah well there was a little accident i believe about him and he got hurt but i assure you i never touched him in fact i was a hundred miles away at the time i'll prove an alibi if you like no no said the judge that is quite sufficient chalk down two nigger one for becket and one for the bad family how many does that come to that's eight said the black prince all right we only want two more go on richard the first surnamed the lion heart was the strongest and bravest man in england and won many glorious battles in the holy land' hullo i say said the judge that's pitching it just a little strong isn't it what have you got to say to that dicky seems pretty square said richard modestly he doesn't say what a good dentist i was though my the dozens i used to pull out and oh i say look here he says nothing about blondel and the tune i composed that's far more important than the crusades it was an andante in f minor you know and that'll do that'll do dicky we've heard that before interrupted the judge score him down half a lie nigger and call up johnny king john surnamed lackland was a wicked king he was forced to yield to the barons and he lost all his clothes in the wash' well i never said john foaming with rage if that isn't the coolest bit of lying i ever heard here have i been and worn my fingers to the bone writing magna charta and giving england all her liberties and he never once mentions it my lord and gentlemen i should like to read you the document i hold in my hand in order that you may judge what eh read that thing exclaimed henry the eighth in horror you'd better try it on that's all good gracious me what next i've a good mind to commit you for contempt of court the question is were you a wicked king and did you lose your clothes in the wash i am surprised and pained that your lordship should ask me either question when i assure you my lord and gentlemen that a more dutiful son a wiser monarch a tenderer husband and a more estimable man than the humble individual who now addresses you never drew teeth put in richard i no breath continued john and when i further tell you that i never even sent my clothes to the wash and therefore could not possibly have lost them there you will all right pull up said the judge that'll do keep the rest my boy that makes ten and a half more than we want now then the next thing is what sort of execution shall we have oh please said the ladies please harry darling let the jury go out and bring the verdict in it will be such fun eh what said henry oh bother the jury where are they clear out do you hear said he addressing the twelve go up to the napoleon room and talk it over and stay till i send for you the jury obeyed and i was left alone in the dock now said the judge evidently relieved let's have the execution but we've not had the verdict yet said anne boleyn that'll do any time said henry just as much fun to have it afterwards besides it's a wonderful saving of time to get the execution over now while we're waiting and then we can go straight to the refreshment room eh girls eh what ah i thought so oh well said catherine of aragon but do put him in the condemned cell for a minute or so and then have him brought out like they all are and as they all are said henry the first like is only used when hold your tongue you impertinent forward young man said catherine in a rage there now added she beginning to cry i've forgotten what i was going to say all through you i think said henry the eighth waving his hand for silence he'd better be hung marwood tells me it's a very pretty sight and the gallows are there quite handy besides added he confidentially we should have to tip him in any case so we may as well let him have the job and get what we can for our money what eh every one approved of this and the executioner was summoned then as i stood there shivering in every limb unable to speak or even to move i was aware once more of the lantern coming towards me and of a hand laid heavily on my shoulder come young gentleman said the voice wake up or you'll get locked in they're shutting the doors tumble up and look sharp it was madame tussaud's porter and i had been fast asleep after all chapter eight a story of the civil wars sub chapter i the interrupted feast the singletons were a small lowland clan or rather faction for their name does not appear in history as a clan for all that they were as loyal to their king and as devoted to their chief as any clan in scotland and when the time for sacrifice and hard blows came the singletons as every one knew were ever to the front and it is only fair to say the singletons were always in the wars when they were not fighting the roundheads they were fighting the campbells or the frasers or the macintoshes or others of their hereditary foes or if none of these were obliging enough or at liberty to indulge them in their favourite pastime then they made enemies for themselves among the neighbouring clans or else crossed over to holland to keep their hands in there till fortune favoured them once more at home the old castle with its rambling towers and walls and buttresses was a sort of rallying point for all the pugnacious spirits of the time and its bluff walls showed many a scar and many a dint where hostile guns had played upon them not you may be sure without reply the singletons in fact and specially since the old laird had died thrived on fighting at the present day they might perhaps have passed as freebooters and outlaws but during the troubled times of the commonwealth they were looked upon as a noble band of patriots whose swords were ever ready in the king's cause and whose castle was as open and hospitable to a friend as it was unyielding to a foe such was the place within whose weather beaten and war beaten walls a festive company was assembled one november afternoon in the year of our lord for once in a way the singletons were at peace the king's cause was for a time under a cloud and the campbells and the frasers and the macintoshes were far too busy about their own affairs to come out of the way to defy this small bulldog of a clan in the south the singletons had serious thoughts of invading some place or sacking some castle or making a raid across the border just to pass the time it was like being out of work they fretted and chafed in their fortress and nearly fell out among themselves and very heartily wished some one would give them a pretext for a fight but no one did it was at least a diversion for them to celebrate the coming of age of the young laird and the event which in times of war might have passed scarcely heeded now became one of mighty importance to these restless singletons they called together every man of the name who could easily be found between the solway and the tay they hoisted the old family ensign on the castle walls and by way of mischief some of them displayed the pennant of the macfies another rival clan below it they drove in twelve head of oxen regardless of proprietorship wherewith to make good cheer at table and they decked the grand old banqueting hall with branches and heather till it was more like a bower than a room these and many other things the singletons did by way of showing honour to the occasion and when that evening thirty of them sat round the festive board with the young chief at the head and with pyramids of beef and mutton and bread before them their satisfaction and enthusiasm reached its highest pitch here's luck to the singleton shouted they root and branch laird and clan and amid cheers prolonged and deafening the health was honoured and the banquet proceeded was ever luck like ours growled one youth to his neighbour here have we been six weeks idle with never a knock and it'll be six weeks longer before we get one again i'm thinking unless the king's party gather said his comrade we don't get our fair share of fighting tam that's what it is may be the young laird will change all that but i say donald i have my doubts of it what of the young laird exclaimed the others ay he's been brought up in a queer school in england they tell me where it's considered ill breeding to molest your neighbour do you say so the barbarians that would never do for us tam but of course the young laird taught them better they say they taught him worse and that well never mind what is auld geordie saying auld geordie was on his feet announcing with great glee that a convoy of treasure bound for edinburgh was on its way at that moment from newcastle so he had heard and would pass within three miles of singleton towers and it'll be ours boys cried the old man turning to his comrades and the young laird shall win his spurs upon it what do you say a shout was the only answer the proposal was one after the singletons' own heart every one looked towards the young laird singleton was a dark mild looking youth old for his years and up till the present time a stranger to his clan for as has already been hinted he had but just returned from england where his boyhood had been spent to celebrate his coming of age great things were expected of him not only as the head of the clan but as the son of his brave father who had died twelve years ago and since whose death the singletons had been leaderless with a bold leader they might achieve anything and they now welcomed the presence of a chief once more in their midst with all the hope and confidence of sons welcoming a father it was therefore with astonishment and dismay that they heard him reply to auld geordie's proposal i did not know the singletons were highwaymen if the roof had fallen in it could not have caused greater consternation the singletons looked aghast to hear such a speech from their chief is the boy mad said one in a whisper or a coward said another or a fool said another the laird's joking said auld geordie in a coaxing voice and we are glad to see ye so merry but ye'll be in earnest to morrow i warrant with a score of troopers between you and a thousand pounds i'm in earnest now replied young singleton i'm no robber chief i tell you the convoy shall go safe to edinburgh as far as we are concerned but come now geordie i want to hear something about this old castle of mine for you know i was scarcely in it since i was a boy but it was easier to turn the talk than to turn the thoughts of his clansmen they experienced all of them a distinct disappointment at this first exercise of authority on the part of their young laird and the cheeks of some of the younger among them actually coloured with shame at the thought that a singleton the singleton should be lacking as they could not help thinking he was in bravery however they said nothing but seemed to listen to auld geordie as he launched out into an account of the old castle of singleton towers it's a brave old place said he sir david singleton it was who built it here on this arm of the sea in the time of king wallace the story goes that wallace himself set the top stone of the great tower with his own hands sir david did not live long to enjoy the stronghold as you have heard how did he die i never heard that asked the young laird alas it is a sad story though a short one sir david had a son and that son was a coward the first and we hope the last coward who ever bore the name here all looked hard at the youth who not noticing their meaning glances said amen with all my heart go on well this son grew up like you in england and it was not till he had reached man's estate that he came here his father a proud man and ambitious rejoiced as your father would have rejoiced this day to see a son in his place ready as he hoped to carry on the brave traditions of his name to a future generation the youth was welcomed home with great pomp and rejoicing and for aught men could see he was a worthy son of a worthy sire but alas as the bible says pride comes before the fall' a few days after his home coming the news came that a party of english was advancing on singleton towers the old laird nothing doubting ordered his son to take fifty men and meet the enemy while he himself stayed behind to guard this place the lad obeyed and marched forth they met he and the english under brantor hill yonder and then appeared the real character of the boy at the first onset before ever a blow was struck he turned and fled no one knows whither the old laird for long would not believe it but when on all hands the story was confirmed and no news came of the lad he sickened and drooped he shut himself up in the turret room out there and never left it except at night when his one walk was on the east terrace over this very room one night they missed the sound of his footsteps and next morning he was found dead in his little chamber dead of a broken heart and they say that if ever again a coward should be the laird of singleton that that old man will walk out there where he walked four centuries ago a dead silence followed the close of this story and all eyes by a sort of common instinct were turned towards the head of the table at that moment apparently from the terrace outside came a sound of footsteps and as they listened every cheek grew suddenly pale and a shudder crept round the assembly the silence however was broken by a laugh from the young laird himself who had been the only unmoved hearer of this last mysterious sound why there is my poor dog jupiter out there i had quite forgotten him let him in some one no one stirred the young chief looked round perplexed and then rose himself and went to the window and opened it as he did so a huge shaggy mastiff bounded into the apartment barking and capering for glee at seeing once again his master and hearing his voice lie down sir quiet now my men what think you of this for a ghost thanks geordie for your story i remember now i heard it when a child well let's hope it will be a long while yet before sir david's ghost is put to the trouble of a midnight walk hist my young master said tam it's ill jesting with the spirits what tam one would think now by the way you speak you would not dare to keep a solitary watch on the east terrace yourself i'd dare anything replied tam but but you would rather not replied singleton laughing that laugh roused the spirit of tam who though superstitious was hardly a coward i never said that he cried and if needs be i would do it even to night even to night repeated singleton what does the man mean even to night i've a good mind to order you to the watch to night for talking in riddles sirrah the watch here has always been a double one since i can remember put in auld geordie to my mind one man ought to be able to watch as well as two for the matter of that and so tam you mean you would be more comfortable with a comrade on the east terrace to night perhaps sir david would oblige you he added with a laugh the soldier flushed angrily ay you may say that he muttered in an undertone it's more than likely sir david will be walking to night the boy caught these last words and glanced quickly at the speaker the meaning of these mysterious utterances suddenly flashed upon him these men then mistook him their chief their captain for a coward a crimson flush suffused his face a flush of shame and anger as he sprang to his feet at that instant and before he could utter a word a bugle sounded at the gate and there entered the hall a soldier whose appearance bore every mark of desperate haste singleton he cried as he entered the king's friends are up glencairn musters his men at daybreak at scotsboro' and expects the thirty men of the singletons promised him there and then here was a piece of news the long wished for summons had come at last and the heart of each singleton present beat high at the prospect of battle and yet in the midst of their elation a serious difficulty presented itself thirty men said geordie looking round him why there are but thirty one men here counting the laird some must stay but the young laird who had noticed the same thing cried out promptly to the messenger tell your general he shall have his thirty men before dawn and with that the soldier withdrew the joy of the singletons now gave place to something like panic as they comprehended what the rash pledge of their young chief really meant it meant that thirty of them must go and one must stay and what could one man do to defend a castle like singleton towers the elder soldiers were specially concerned call him back singleton said geordie you cannot leave this place defenceless think of the peril ten men must stay at the least who says must' to me cried the young chief impatiently are the singletons to be word breakers as well as highwaymen thirty men shall go have we not promised but who will stay asked some one ah that's it cried another who is to stay silence ensued on the question and then i will stay quietly replied singleton you the laird shouted every one in amazement that can never be why not inquired the youth who is chief here you or i but who is to lead us in battle ah said singleton that is my duty i know but it is equally my duty to stay here but it is certain peril and you could do no good let one of us stay let me stay with you said geordie no brave geordie you must go it must never be said the singletons broke their word even to save their castle take the thirty men to glencairn if he permits ten to return well and good you will find me here but your place is at our head said the men and there i will be to morrow to night i watch here ay and on the east terrace with sir david tam he added with a smile but come to horse there you lose time bring out the guns on with your belts men be brisk now take every man some bread and meat from the table and with these words the martial fire of the father blazed out in the son so that his men wondered more than ever how they could have suspected him of faint heartedness are you all equipped and mounted lower the drawbridge there open the gate forward men and singleton for the king' and waving his hand he bade them march forth and watched them slowly defile across the drawbridge and turn their horses' heads eastward the last man to cross was tam heaven protect you he said humbly and forgive me for the insult i put upon you then reining in his horse he added almost beseechingly once again let me stay with you not i replied young singleton gaily forward tam and to morrow if you return you shall hear how i fared tam said nothing but setting spurs to his horse bounded across the drawbridge and rejoined his comrades singleton having watched the troop as they slowly wended their way among the trees of the wood till they were lost to sight drew up the bridge and closed and barred the great gate then with a stout though anxious heart he turned and addressed himself to his solitary and hazardous undertaking sub chapter ii the night watch the young laird of singleton turned slowly from the courtyard out of which his men had just ridden back into the castle young as he was and inexperienced he knew enough of the state of his country to feel that the task which he had imposed upon himself was one of the greatest peril not only to his own life but to the ancestral castle of his clan for the country swarmed with freebooters and hostile clans on the look out for any chance of plunder and they if only they got wind of the unprotected state of singleton towers would lose no time he knew in striking a blow during the absence of the clan which might end in the loss of the old fortress for ever still what else could he have done he was bound in honour to fulfil his pledge to the royal cause by sending the thirty men and as for himself he had no hesitation in deciding that for this night at least the post of duty if not of honour was on the ramparts of his own castle even though on that account the singletons must ride leaderless to the king's standard besides it must be confessed there was a spice of adventure about the undertaking which well accorded with his bold spirit and as his thoughts went back to the scene of the banquet and the suspicions entertained there as to his own courage it pleased him to reflect that whatever happened a singleton would never again be able to charge his chief with cowardice it was nine o'clock and quite dark when he turned from the gateway out of which his men had just sallied and retraced his steps slowly into the deserted castle his solitary footsteps sounded weird and lonely across the paved yard which a few minutes before had rung with the clatter of horses and the bustle of preparation still more solitary did they sound as he passed on his way through the deserted passages and found himself once more in the old banqueting hall where the feast remained still on the board and the empty chairs all round just as the clansmen had left them to obey the sudden and urgent order to march forth but dreariest of all did they sound as forcing open a small and long disused door which grated back on its hinges and groaned as he did so he stepped out on to the east terrace before he did this however he took all the wise precautions necessary to insure as far as possible the safety of the old castle and in some respects this was not a difficult task for singleton towers stood at the head of a narrow arm of the sea which on three sides completely surrounded it leaving only the east side assailable by land on the sides of the sea the castle rose perpendicularly from the water the only entrance being by way of a creek half cave half boathouse the entrance to which could at pleasure be barred by a portcullis this precaution singleton took and had the satisfaction of feeling that on its seaboard at least the castle was as secure as if a garrison of a hundred men watched it on the land side however security was not so possible the water was continued in the form of a ditch twelve yards wide round this side also but it was a narrow protection at the best the drawbridge which spanned it was as we have already seen drawn up and the great iron gate connecting with the outside world carefully barred and bolted still as singleton looked down he felt concerned to think how easily a few bold men could swim the moat and assault the place but he was in for it now as auld geordie had said the guns of the castle were all loaded and ready for action and singleton was relieved to see that one of these was mounted on the turret over the great gate and a further discovery relieved him still more and that was that the woods on this side were so dense that except along the narrow clearing through the trees it would hardly be possible for any number of troops especially if they brought artillery to approach he therefore took advantage of the moonlight to point the gun carefully so as exactly to cover the entrance to this narrow path a precaution which as will be seen stood him in good stead before the night was out as to the other guns there was one on the east terrace rusty and old fashioned but happily loaded and there were others at various corners and buttresses all of which the young laird inspected and ascertained to be ready for any emergency he also placed muskets in readiness at various points in case of need all these preparations occupied a long time in effecting and it was not till an hour had passed since the departure of his men that singleton felt able to take his place on the watch and quietly await the result of his venture he had scarcely done so however when it occurred to him that though all the garrison had left the place there was still plenty of armour in the castle which might be used to good purpose why not set out helmets on the ramparts and pikes as well as guns it was a good idea he hurried to the armoury and quickly took from their places all the steel helmets and pikes and plumes on which he could lay his hands these he artfully disposed on various parts of the battlements so that to any one below it would appear that instead of one man twenty armed warriors guarded the place who knows but these numskulls may serve me in good stead said the youth to himself laughing to think what excellent substitutes for a living man an empty helmet with a spear head beside it may be made to appear this little artifice being satisfactorily accomplished and lights set burning in various rooms of the castle still further to aid the delusion he returned once more to the east terrace and began his solitary vigil the moon was up and peeped occasionally from behind the drifting clouds to light up the dark scene below as singleton peered down from his lofty post he could see the water sparkling below him and catch the distant lights here and there on wood and mountain not a sound was to be heard but the moaning of the wind among the turrets and the distant splash of the water against the south base of the castle not a moving creature was to be seen except the uneasy bats which flapped round now and then over his head everything below was motionless and silent without one token of life except indeed the distant light of a beacon which tinged the sky with a lurid glare and added a weird feature to the dark solitary landscape singleton after a turn or two was conscious of a half dismal sensation and a feeling of loneliness which as long as he had been busily occupied had not oppressed him he paced quickly to and fro whistling to himself and determined not to yield to the effects of his position he wondered how far his men were on their way by this time was old geordie riding at their head suppose they were attacked how would they come out of it he wondered too if tam was what was that a low groan from one corner of the terrace and the clanking of a chain singleton halted dead and for a moment his heart was in his mouth then he broke into a laugh jupiter again that's the second time he has played ghost to night well old doggie you've woke up have you and you're going to keep me company eh and then as he resumed his march he talked in a low voice to the dog who rose quietly from his corner and with soft stealthy tread proceeded to accompany his master to and fro along the terrace singleton was ashamed of himself for being as startled as he had been at this incident a pretty hero i shall make at this rate said he if this is the worst alarm i am to have to night i shall get off easily eh jupiter solemnly wagged his tail and evidently considering he had done enough in accompanying his master some twenty turns up and down retired quietly to his old corner and once again composed himself to slumber singleton walked on halting now and then to make a careful scrutiny all round and continuing to whistle softly to himself all the time somehow his mind continually found itself reverting to geordie's story it was an old wife's tale of course but a queer one too and this was the very terrace on which the old warrior used to walk and that little turret chamber there was his room ah strange how the reflection of the moon should make it appear as if there were a light in the room if he were not certain no light was there he could have vowed that was one bah he wished geordie had kept his story to himself it made him feel quite dismal hark a footstep he was certain he heard one close at his side too he stood still and listened everything was silent he moved on again there he heard it distinctly almost in step with his own he looked up and down everywhere and then geordie's words rushed back on his memory if ever again a coward should be laird of singleton that old man here he stepped forward and again suddenly halted the footstep that time was as distinct as his own pooh what if it was he was not going to be afraid of all the ghosts in scotland and he laughed out loud by way of assuring himself of his nerve but he had hardly done so when just above him sounded another laugh mocking his own and as he stepped suddenly forward the footsteps began again as clear as ever this was more than singleton had bargained for and he sat down on the end of the gun in bewilderment and alarm had any one been there to see his face it would have appeared a good deal paler than was its wont and it was certainly something more than the cold that made him shiver he sat perfectly still and listened there was not a sound he strained his eyes on every hand nothing was visible through the darkness but the silent terrace on which he watched what could it be as he sat and wondered the pike which had been resting carelessly across his knee slipped and fell on to the stone pavement with a sudden clank which was instantly repeated overhead just as the laugh and the footsteps had been of course it flashed upon singleton then an echo nothing but a simple echo among the nooks and crannies of the castle and at a simple echo his cheek had turned pale and his heart had stood still and his hands had actually trembled he scorned himself bitterly for his cowardice and once more relieved in mind and humbled in spirit set out on his night watch determined this time that nothing not even a score of ghosts should terrify him and now the night began to wear on by this time the men must be very near their rendezvous for it was an hour past midnight and the moon was getting down towards the west he wondered what other clans would muster round the royal standard and how soon the king's forces would be likely to meet the enemy this time to morrow he would be with his men that is provided the general permitted ten of them to return and relieve guard here supposing no one came at that moment jupiter gave a very low growl which made his master stop short in his march and listen with all his ears for a long time not a sound was audible and then he fancied he could just detect the tramp of a horse or horses in the far far distance but that seemed to die away and again all was utterly silent but once more just as he was starting again on his walk jupiter growled and this time rose to his feet and came to his master's side yes it was the sound of horses somewhere more than one too with straining ears and beating heart the youth leant on his pike and listened the sound grew more and more distinct and presently he could tell that whoever they were they were galloping he ordered jupiter to lie down and be silent they were in the wood somewhere were they bound for singleton presently he was able to distinguish voices and a minute afterwards it seemed as if every sound had ceased he stepped quietly followed by jupiter from the east terrace to the rampart over the great gate where he was able to command as full a view as the uncertain light would allow of the glade through the frees which led to the castle but nothing could be seen as he watched the sounds commenced again and this time he fancied he could detect a rumbling noise as of a cart accompanying the horsemen it was now easy to tell the meaning of all these sounds a troop of horsemen he could not yet guess how many were approaching singleton towers and bringing with them a gun the young laird's heart beat now in right earnest but not with fear that had been left behind with the ghosts he forgot everything but the defence of his castle and the glory of his clan and waited eagerly for the time of action the cavalcade made a halt about halfway through the wood and in the still night air with the light breeze carrying it singleton could hear the sound of voices as in hurried consultation then a single horseman approached and before many minutes he could just discern in the dim moonlight a form emerging from the wood and stealthily approaching the castle let him come and spy said singleton to himself he will see the lights and perhaps a few spear heads on the walls and he'll report as much to his chief ah at that moment the clouds cleared away from the moon and clearly revealed the intruder he was one of the macfies singleton could see and fully armed he dismounted at the border of the wood and advanced cautiously on foot to the edge of the moat this he made no attempt to cross but made his observations from the far side singleton taking care not to be seen crept back into the armoury from which he took a bugle bringing it out into the terrace he sounded a few shrill notes and then instantly seizing a lantern ran hurriedly to and fro with it on various parts of the battlements then without waiting a moment he took up a musket and fired it in the direction of the scout who however was by this time out of reach there said singleton putting down his weapon that will satisfy them we are on the alert all of us and ready for them perhaps they will think better of it and turn tail no in a few minutes the sound of the advancing troop again rose in the night they came on at a trot dragging their gun along with them presently there was a gleam among the trees and next moment some fifty horsemen appeared in view with a cannon in their midst which equally to singleton's satisfaction and surprise they proceeded to get into position at the very entrance to the wood it was on this spot it will be remembered that the young laird had carefully levelled the gun that surmounted the great gate everything depended now on the skill with which he had aimed it he gave the foe a minute or two to fix and point their weapon and once more carefully calculated the poise of his own then just as they were proceeding to load and the horsemen were preparing to follow up the attack on the gate he applied the match and with a mighty roar the piece discharged it was an anxious moment while the smoke slowly cleared away when it did he had the joy of beholding the enemy's gun on end and disabled and not only it but at least three of the enemy themselves involved in the same disaster he could not resist a triumphant cheer at this success which was promptly answered by a defiant shout from the enraged macfies as they set spurs to their horses and rushed towards the moat and now began the hard work of the night for the foe thought nothing of such a narrow obstacle as a simple ditch some swam it on horseback and some left their animals behind but all all except two whom singleton's trusty muskets had found out crossed in safety the raid they made on the great gate was something terrific and singleton's heart trembled within him as he heard it creak before their united weight but he worked away steadily at his post always taking care not to expose himself yet never wasting a shot with a bad aim the enemy very soon quitted the gate and took to the more formidable work of attempting to scale the walls and here singleton's power was tried to the utmost for at one part the ground sloped a considerable distance up one of the buttresses which made the ascent from below comparatively easy and if only the macfies had been suitably equipped for an assault they could not have failed to carry the place with ease but happily for singleton they had come very ill prepared evidently expecting to walk into a defenceless stronghold without a blow and now they were not only disappointed but disconcerted yet there was no keeping them down eventually in vain singleton plied his weapon with deadly effect in vain he dislodged and hurled down upon them one of the massive coping stones of the east terrace as fast as the foremost fell back dead or wounded others swarmed up it was well for singleton no attempt was made on any other part but this assailable buttress and even this was scaled at last the young laird had stepped back hurriedly to load his weapon when he suddenly saw a head appear above the battlements and next moment a fierce lowlander sprang on to the terrace with the butt end of his weapon singleton felled him while at the same moment jupiter flew at the throat of the man next to him who was also springing on to the wall it was a narrow escape indeed and but for the dog the castle might after all have been lost once more the youth cleared the buttress and this time with such deadly effect that the enemy halted a moment before resuming the attack this short breathing space was unutterably valuable to singleton for it gave him time not only to load several muskets but to bring one of the smaller cannon in position so as to almost cover the weak point this precaution however as it turned out was not requisite for just as the enemy were returning with redoubled fierceness and determination to the attack there was a shout from the wood and a cry of singleton to the rescue well did the young chief know that cry he was saved in another moment the macfies had too much to do to defend themselves from the sudden attack in the rear to think of renewing the assault and the youth knew well enough how to make good use of the interval with a loud cheer to his gallant clansmen he kept up a dropping fire on the enemy with musket and gun until galled on both sides they fairly took to their heels and plunged once more into the moat how many came out of it and escaped history does not record but they left of their number under the walls of singleton towers twenty men dead or wounded it was a proud moment when the young laird flung open the great gate and let his comrades in the leader of the party was tam who had implored the general of the king's forces whom fortunately they had met on the way to the rendezvous to be allowed to return if only for a few hours to share his young laird's peril the request had been granted and with fifteen men the delighted tam had spurred back to singleton as fast as their horses could carry them falling unexpectedly on the enemy's rear they had brought about the panic which saved the castle and rescued the young chief from his perilous position this was the first but by no means the last fight in which the young laird of singleton bore a part he grew old in warfare and ended his days at last on the field of battle but to the day of his death this memorable night watch on singleton towers was ever the achievement about which he liked best to be reminded chapter nine run to earth sub chapter i on the trail michael mccrane had bolted there was not a shadow of a doubt about it the moment i reached the bank that eventful morning and saw the manager's desk open and the tin cash box lying empty on the floor i said at once to myself this is mccrane's doing and as i and the messenger stood there with dropped jaws gaping at the dismal scene i hurriedly called up in my mind the incidents of the past week and reading them in the light of this discovery i was ready to stake my reputation as a paying cashier that my fellow clerk was a robber and a fugitive mccrane had not been at our bank long he had come to us from one of the country branches and much to the disgust of some of us juniors had been placed over our heads as second paying cashier i was third paying cashier and from the moment i set eyes on my new colleague and superior i felt that mischief was in the wind a mysterious silent man of twenty six was michael mccrane so silent was he indeed that were it not for an occasional how will you take it not endorsed next desk ejaculated in the course of his daily duties any one might have supposed him dumb he held himself gloomily aloof from his fellow clerks none of us knew where he lived or how he lived it was an event to get a word out of him wherever it was possible he answered by signs or grimaces he glided into his place in the morning like a ghost and like a ghost he glided out at night and vanished more than that his personal appearance was unsatisfactory he was slovenly in figure and habits with a stubbly beard and unkempt hair and although he had l a year his clothes were threadbare and shabby he seemed always hard up for money he did not go out as most of us did in the middle of the day to get lunch but fortified himself with bread and cheese which he brought in his pocket and partook of mysteriously behind the lid of his desk now and then i had come upon him while he was deeply engaged in writing what appeared to be private letters and i could not help noticing that on each occasion when thus interrupted he coloured up guiltily and hid his letter hastily away in his blotting paper and once or twice lately mysterious parcels had been handed to him over the counter which he had received with a conscious air hiding them away in his desk and carrying them home under his coat at night i did not at all like these oddities and holding the position i did i had often debated with myself whether it was not my duty to take the manager or head cashier into my confidence on the subject and yet there had never till now occurred anything definite to take hold of nor was it till this october morning when i saw the manager's desk broken and the empty cash box on the floor that it came over me that mccrane was even a worse fellow than i had taken him for he had been most mysterious about his holidays this year he was to have taken them in may among the first batch but suddenly altered his arrangements giving no reason and requesting to be allowed to go in september september came and still he clung to his desk finally another change was announced mccrane would start for his fortnight's holiday on the second thursday of october these changes were all arranged so mysteriously and with such an unusual show of eagerness on mccrane's part and as the time itself drew near he exhibited such a mixture of self satisfaction concealment and uneasiness that no one could fail to observe it add to this that during the last day or two he had made more than one mistake in his addition and had once received a reprimand from the manager for inattention at which he vaguely smiled and you will hardly wonder that my first words on that eventful morning the first of his long expected holiday were michael mccrane has bolted the manager when he arrived took the same view as i did i don't like this samuels said he not at all samuels when mr trong called any one by his name twice in one sentence it was a certain sign that he meant what he said how much was there in the box i inquired l shillings pence said the manager referring to his petty cash account there was one five pound note but i do not know the number the rest was cash the messenger was called in and deposed that mr mccrane had stayed the previous evening half an hour after every one else to wind up as he said the witness stated that he heard him counting over some money and that when he left he had put out the gas in the office and given him the deponent the key of his the suspect's own desk bring his book said the manager i did so and we examined it together the last page had not been added up and two of the lines had not been filled out with the amounts in the money column oddly enough when the two cancelled cheques were looked at they were found to amount to l we must go thoroughly into this said the manager it looks worse and worse what's this it was a torn piece of paper between two of the leaves of the book part of a memorandum in mccrane's handwriting it read thus a scrap of paper is illustrated here what do you make of that asked the manager a light dawned on me i wonder if it means euston perhaps he's going by that train the manager looked at me then at the clock and then went to his desk and took up a bradshaw is the train for rugby lancaster fleetwood samuels sir said i you had better take a cab to euston you have just time if he is there stop him or else follow him and bring him back if necessary get the police to help you but if you can bring him back without so much the better i'm afraid the l is not all it may turn out to be a big robbery when we go through his book i must trust to your judgment take some money with you l in case of emergency be quick or you will be late telegraph to me how you succeed it was a word and a blow a quarter of an hour later my hansom dashed into the yard at euston just as the warning bell for the train was sounding where for sir asked a porter any luggage i did not know where i was for and i had no luggage i rushed on to the platform and looked anxiously up and down it was a scene of confusion groups of non travellers round the carriage doors were beginning to say a last good bye to their friends inside porters were hurling their last truck loads of luggage into the vans the guard was a quarter of the way down the train looking at the tickets the newspaper boys were flitting about shouting noisily and inarticulately and the usual crowd of just in times were rushing headlong out of the booking office and hurling themselves at the crowded train i was at a loss what to do it was impossible to say who was there and who was not mccrane might be there or he might not what was the use of my step inside if you're going shouted a guard i saw a porter near the booking office door advance towards the bell at the same moment i saw or fancied i saw at the window of a third class carriage a certain pale face appear momentarily and with an anxious glance up at the clock vanish again inside wait a second i cried to the guard till i get a ticket not time now i heard him say as i dashed into the booking office the clerk was shutting the window third single anywhere fleetwood i shouted flinging down a couple of sovereigns i was vaguely aware of seizing the ticket of hearing some one call after me something about change of a whistle the waving of a flag and a shout stand away from the train next moment i was sprawling on all fours on the knees of a carriage full of passengers and before i had time to look up the train was outside euston station it took me some time to recover from the perturbation of the start and still longer to overcome the bad impression which my entry had made on my fellow passengers indeed i was made distinctly uncomfortable by the attitude which two at any rate of these persons took up one was a young man of the type which i usually connect with detectives the other was a rollicking commercial traveller you managed to do it then said the latter to me when finally i had shaken myself together and found a seat yes just said i the other man looked hard at me from behind a newspaper best to cut your sort of job fine continued the commercial knowingly awkward to meet a friend just when you're starting wouldn't it with a wink that he evidently meant to be funny i coloured up violently and was aware that the other man had his eye on me i was being taken for a runaway worth my while to keep chummy with you said the heartless man of the road start a little flush don't you i ignored this pointed inquiry not bank notes i hope because they've an unkind way of stopping them not but what you might get rid of one or two if you make haste but they're ugly things to track a chap out by you know why i knew a young fellow much your age and build borrowed a whole sheaf of 'em and went up north and made up his mind he'd have a high old time he did slip through a fiver but would you believe it the next he tried on they were down on him like shooting stars and he's another two years to do on the mill before he can come another trip by the they all fancy this train this style of talk much as it amused my fellow passengers and interested the man in the corner made me feel in a most painful position my looks and blushes i am aware were most compromising and my condition generally without luggage without rug without even a newspaper enveloped me in such an atmosphere of mystery and suspicion that i half began to wonder whether i was not an absconding forger myself fortunately the train stopped at willesden and i took advantage of the halt to change my carriage explaining clumsily that i should prefer a carriage where i could sit with my face to the engine whereat every one smiled except myself and the man in the corner i tried hard to find an empty carriage but the train was full and there was no such luxury to be had besides guards porters and station masters were all shouting to me to get inside somewhere and a score of heads attracted by the commotion appeared at the windows and added to my discomfort finally i took refuge in a carriage which seemed less crowded than the rest having but two occupants alas to my horror and dismay i discovered when the train had started that i had intruded myself on a palpably honeymoon couple who glared at me in such an unfriendly manner that for the next hour and a half without respite i was constrained to stand with my head out of the window even in the tunnels i had no encouragement to turn my head round this was bad enough but it would have been worse had it not happened that in craning my head and neck out of the window i caught sight in the corner of the carriage next to mine of half of the back of a head which i felt sure i knew it belonged in fact to michael mccrane and a partial turn of his face left no doubt on the matter i had run my man down already i smiled to myself as i contemplated the unconscious nape of that neck and recalled the gibes of the commercial traveller and the uncomfortable stare of the man in the corner what should i do the train would stop for two minutes at bletchley and not again until we reached rugby should i lay my hand on his shoulder at the first place or the second i wished i could have dared to retire into my carriage and consult my timetable about trains back but the consciousness of the honeymoon glare at my back glued me to the window i must inquire at bletchley and act accordingly we were beginning to put on the break and show other signs of coming to a halt when i was startled by seeing mccrane stand up and put his head out of the window i withdrew as hastily as i could not daring of course to retreat fully into the carriage but turning my face in an opposite direction so as to conceal my identity i could not guess whether he had seen me or not it had all occurred so quickly if he had i might have need of all my strategy to run him to earth as the train pulled up i saw him lower his window and with anxious face make a sudden bolt across the platform that was enough for me i darted out too much to the satisfaction of my fellow travellers when's the next train back to euston take your seats bawled the guard ignoring me when does the next train go to euston there's a time table there i went keeping one eye on the train another on the spot where my man had vanished and feeling a decided inconvenience from the lack of a third with which to consult the complicated document before me in a rash moment i ventured to concentrate my whole attention on the timetable i had found bletchley and my finger painfully tracing down one of the long columns was coming very near to the required latitude when i became aware of a whistle of a figure bun in hand darting from the refreshment room to a carriage of a loud puff from the engine i abandoned the time table and rushed in the same direction alas the train was in full motion a porter was standing forbiddingly between me and my carriage and the honeymoon couple were blandly drawing down the blinds in my very face worst of all i saw the half profile of michael mccrane inflated with currant bun vanish and as the end carriage whirled past me i received a friendly cheer from the commercial traveller and a particularly uncomfortable smile from his silent companion in the corner i was left behind the bird had flown out of my very hand and there was nothing now but to return in confusion and report my misfortunes at the bank stay i could telegraph to detain my man at rugby let me see to station master rugby detain michael mccrane bank robbery tall dark third class left euston i follow samuels how would that do i was pleased with the look of it and in the fullness of my heart consulted the station master he eyed me unfavourably who are you he had the boldness to inquire i'm from the bank oh he said and added your best plan is to follow him in the supplemental it will be up in five minutes he's sure to be bound for fleetwood and you'll catch him on the steamer they won't stop him on the road without a warrant they don't know you i admitted the truth of this and after some inward debate particularly as i had a ticket through i decided to take advice and avail myself of the supplemental it was painfully supplemental that train a string of the most ramshackle carriages the line could muster and the carriage in which i found myself smelt as if it had been in billingsgate for a month however i could sit down this time there was neither honeymoon commercial traveller nor man in the corner to disturb my peace only a rollicking crowd of irish harvest men on their way home in spirits which were not all of air i was claimed as one of their noble fraternity before we were many stages on the road and although i am happy to say i was not compelled to take part in their potations for the simple reason that they had none left to offer me i was constrained to sing songs shout shouts abjure allegiance to the union jack and utter aspirations for the long life of charlie parnell and father mickey i believe that was the reverend gentleman's name and otherwise abase myself for the sake of peace and to prevent my head making acquaintance with the shillalahs of the company i got a little tired of it after a few hours' incessant bawling and was rather glad by the assistance of a few half crowns which i fervently trusted the manager would allow me to charge to his account to escape their company at preston and seek the shelter of a more secluded compartment for the rest of the way i found one occupied by two files of soldiers in charge of a couple of deserters and in this genial company performed the remainder of the journey in what would have been something like comfort but for the ominous gusts of wind and rain which as we neared the coast buffeted the carriage window and promised a particularly ugly night for any one contemplating a sea voyage sub chapter ii bowled out when we reached fleetwood it was blowing so i heard some one say half a cap i privately wondered what a whole cap must be like for it was all i could do by leaning hard up against the wind and holding on my hat a chimney pot hat by the way to tack up the platform and fetch round for the belfast steamer which lay snorting and plunging alongside it takes a very good sailor to be cheerful under such circumstances i felt profoundly melancholy and wished myself safe at home in my bed the sight of the black and red funnel swaying to and fro raised qualms in me which although still on terra firma almost called for the intervention of a friendly steward alas friend there was none in my desperation i was tempted basely to compromise with duty how did i know michael mccrane was on the steamer at all he might have dropped out at any one of a dozen wayside stations between bletchley and here indeed the probability was that he had or and i felt almost affectionately towards him as the thought crossed my mind even if he had come so far he like myself might be a bad sailor and prefer to spend the night on this side of the angry channel i could have forgiven him much i felt had i been sure of that in any case i asked myself earnestly was i justified in running my employers into the further expense of a return ticket to belfast without being reasonably sure that i was on the right track and was i reasonably sure was i even on the steerage deck of the steamer below me with a portmanteau in one hand and a brand new hat box and a rug in the other a figure staggered towards the companion ladder and disappeared below that figure even to my unwilling eyes was naught else but a tragic answer to my own question michael mccrane was on board and going below a last lingering hope remained hardly put off to night will you said i to a mate beside me with the best assumption of swagger at my command he was encasing himself in tarpaulins and appeared not to hear me i repeated my inquiry and added in the feeble hope that he might contradict me doesn't look like quieting down no said he looking up at the sky there'll be a goodish bit more of it before we're over all aboard there no i shouted rushing towards the gangway i'm not oh how i wished i could have found myself just left behind as it was i was precipitated nearly head first down the gangway amid the by no means friendly expletives of the sailors and landed at the bottom a clear second after my hat and two seconds at least in advance of my umbrella before i had recovered all my component parts the royal duke was off it was not the slightest comfort to me to reflect that if only i had dashed on board the moment i saw my man and arrested him there and then we might both be standing at this moment comparatively happy on that quay whose lights blinked unkindly now above us now below now one side now the other as we rolled out of the harbour bit of a sea outside i guess said a voice at my side outside then what was going on now did not count i clapped my hat down on my head and made for the cabin door it had entered my mind to penetrate into the steerage at once and make sure of my runaway but when i contemplated the distance of deck between where i now stood and where i had seen him disappear and when moreover as the boat's head quitted the lee of the breakwater a big billow from the open leapt up at her and washed her from stem to stern something within me urged me to go below at once and postpone business till the morning i have only the vaguest recollection of the ghastly hours which ensued i have a wandering idea of a feeble altercation with a steward on hearing that all the berths were occupied and that he had nowhere to put me then i imagine i must have lain on the saloon floor or the cabin stairs at least the frequency with which i was trodden upon was suggestive of my resting place being a public thoroughfare but the treading under foot was not quite so bad as being called upon to show my ticket later on that was a distinctly fiendish episode and i did not recover from it all the night more horrible still a few brutes lost to all sense of humanity attempted to have supper in the saloon within a foot or two of where i lay mercifully their evil machinations failed for nothing could stay on the table oh the horrors of that night who can say at what angles i did not incline now as we swooped up a wave i stood on my head next moment i shivered and shuddered in mid air then with a wild plunge i found myself feet downward and as i sunk my heart and all that appertained to it seemed to remain where they had been now i was rolling obliquely down the cabin on to the top of wretches as miserable as myself now i was rolling back and they pouring on to the top of me the one thought in my mind was which way are we going next and mixed up with it occasionally came the aspiration would it were to the bottom above it all was the incessant thunder of the waves on the decks above and the wild wheezing of the engines as they met the shrieking wind but i will not dwell on the scene once during the night i thought of michael mccrane and hoped he was even as i was at that moment if he was no dog was ever in such a plight at last the early dawn struggled through the deadlights at last i groaned we shall soon be in the lough where are we said a plaintive voice from the midst of the heap which for the last few hours had regularly rolled on the top of me whenever we lurched to larboard off the isle of man was the reply shouldn't wonder if we get a bit of a sea going past too off the isle of man only half way and a bit of a sea expected as we went past i closed my eyes and wished our bank might break before morning whether the bit of sea came up to expectations or not i know not i was in no condition to criticise even my own movements i believe that as time went on i became gradually amalgamated with the larger roiling heap of fellow sufferers on the floor and during the last hour or so of our misery rolled in concert with them but i should be sorry to state positively that it was so all i know is that about a hundred years after we had passed the isle of man i became suddenly awake to the consciousness that something tremendous had happened had we struck in mid ocean had the masts above us gone by the board were we sinking or what on careful reflection i decided we were doing neither and that the cause of my agitation was that the last wave but one had gone past the ship without breaking over her and out of the next dozen waves we scrambled over i counted at least five which let us off in a similar manner oh the rapture of the discovery i closed my eyes again lest by any chance it should turn out to be a dream the next thing i was conscious of was a rough hand on my shoulder and a voice shouting now then mister wake up all ashore except you can't stay on board all day i rubbed my eyes and bounded to my feet the royal duke was at a standstill in calm water and the luggage crane was busy at work overhead are we there i gasped all except you said the sailor how long have we been in best part of an hour got any luggage mister an hour then i had missed my man once more was ever luck like mine i gathered up my crumpled hat and umbrella and staggered out of that awful cabin look here said i to the sailor did you see the passengers go ashore i saw the steerage passengers go said he and a nice looking lot they was there was one of the steerage passengers i wanted particularly to see did you see one with a portmanteau and hat box plenty of 'em was the reply yes but his was quite a new hat box you couldn't mistake it said i maybe i saw him there was one young fellow dark yes dark and tall yes tall enough dismal looking they were all that did you see which way he went no but i heard him ask the mate the way to the northern counties railway so i guess he's for the derry line it was a sorry clue but the only one i was scarcely awake and after my night of tragedy was hardly in a position to resume the hue and cry yet anything was preferable to going back to sea so i took a car for the northern counties station for a wonder i was in time for the train which i was told was due to start in an hour's time i spent that hour first of all in washing then in breakfasting finally in telegraphing to my manager fancy tracked him here rough crossing will wire again shortly then having satisfied myself that none of the steamer passengers could possibly have caught an earlier train and determined not to lose the train this time i took a ticket for londonderry and ensconced myself a good quarter of an hour before the appointed hour in a corner of a carriage commanding a good view of the booking office door as the minutes sped by and no sign of my man i began to grow nervous after all he might be staying in belfast or having got wind of my pursuit might be escaping in some other direction it was not a comfortable reflection not did it add to my comfort that among the passengers who crowded into my carriage and helped to keep out my view of the booking office door was the gloomy detective looking individual whose demeanour had so disconcerted me during the first stage of this disastrous journey he eyed me as suspiciously as ever from behind his everlasting newspaper and under his scrutiny i hardly dared persevere in my own look out i made a pretext of buying a newspaper in order to keep near the door to my dismay the whistle suddenly sounded as i was counting my change and the train began to move off at the same moment a figure carrying in one hand a portmanteau and in the other a hat box rushed frantically into the station and made a blind clash at the very door where i stood i shrunk back in a panic to my distant corner with my heart literally in my mouth there was a brief struggle on the doorstep the hat box flew in and the door was actually opened to admit the owner when a couple of porters laid violent hands upon him and dragged him off the train it was not i who had been left behind this time but michael mccrane and while he and his portmanteau remained disconsolate in belfast i and his hat box were being whirled in the direction of londonderry in the company of a person who whatever he may have thought of mccrane without doubt considered me a fugitive it was a trying position and i was as much at sea as i had been during the agitated hours of the terrible night i tried to appear calm and took refuge behind my newspaper in order to collect my ideas and interpose a screen between myself and the critical stare of my fellow passenger alas it was avoiding scylla only to fall into charybdis the first words which met my eyes were bank robbery in london a robbery was perpetrated in 's bank on wednesday night under circumstances which point to one of the cashiers as the culprit the manager's box containing a considerable amount of loose cash was found broken open and it is supposed the thief has also made away with a considerable sum in notes and securities the cashier in question has disappeared and is supposed to have absconded to the north he is dark complexioned pale mysterious in his manners and aged when last seen wore a tall hat gloves and a grey office suit instinctively i pulled off my gloves and deposited my hat in the rack overhead and tried to appear engrossed in another portion of the paper but i could not refrain from darting a look at my fellow traveller to my horror i perceived that the paper he was reading was the same as the one i had and that the page between which and myself his eyes were uncomfortably oscillating was the very page on which the fatal paragraph appeared i was dark i was pale after my voyage and who should say my manners were not mysterious in imagination i stood already in the box of the old bailey and heard myself sentenced to the treadmill and was unable to offer the slightest explanation in palliation of my mysterious conduct in such agreeable reveries i passed the first hour of the journey when to my unfeigned relief on reaching antrim my fellow traveller quitted the carriage no doubt his object was a sinister one and when i saw him speak to the constable at the station i had no doubt in my own mind that my liberty was not worth five minutes' purchase but even so anything seemed better than his basilisk eye in the corner of the carriage i hastily prepared my defence and resolved on a dignified refusal to criminate myself under any provocation what were they doing to my horror the detective the constable the guard and the station master all advanced on my carriage in there said the official my late fellow traveller nodded the station master opened the door and entered the carriage i was in the act of opening my lips to say i surrender myself there is no occasion for violence when the station master laid his hand on the hat box it's labelled to c he said take it along guard and put it out there he's sure to come on by the next train right away there next moment we were off what did it all mean i was not under arrest nobody had noticed me but mccrane's hat box had engaged the attention of four public officials free and easy way of doing things on this line said an englishman in the carriage quite the regular thing for a man and his luggage to go by different trains always turns up right in the end are you going to derry sir he added addressing me no said i hastily i'm getting out at the next station what at and he pronounced the name something like tobacco yes i said pining for liberty no matter the name it was called by at the next station i got out it was a little wayside place without even a village that i could see to justify its claim to a station at all nobody else got out and as soon as the train had gone i was left to explain my presence to what appeared to be the entire population of the district to wit a station master a porter and a constable who carried a carbine i invented some frivolous excuse asked if there wasn't a famous waterfall somewhere near and on being told that the locality boasted of no such attraction feigned to be dismayed and was forced to resign myself to wait three hours for the next train it was at least a good thing to be in solitude for a short time to collect my scattered wits mccrane was bound for c and would probably come in the next train which by the way was the last that was all i had a clear idea about there was a telegraph office at the station and i thought i might as well report progress to my manager on the trail expect news from c wire me there post office if necessary the station master who as usual was postmaster too received this message from my hands and the remainder of the population i mean the porter and the constable who were with him at the time read it over his shoulder they all three looked hard at me and the station master said tenpence in a tone which made my blood curdle i was doomed to be suspected wherever i went what did they take me for now i decided to take a walk and inspect the country round it annoyed me to find that the constable with his carbine thought well to take a walk too and keep me well in view i tried to dodge him but he was too smart for me and when finally to avoid him i took shelter in a wayside inn he seated himself on the bench outside and smoked till i was ready to come out i discovered a few more inhabitants but it added nothing to my comfort they too stared at me and followed me about until finally i ran back to the station and cried out in my heart for the four o'clock train about five o'clock it strolled up i got in anywhere without even troubling to look for michael mccrane if he should appear at c well and good i would arrest him if not i would go home for the present at least i would dismiss him from my mind and try to sleep i did try but that was all we passed station after station some we halted at as it appeared by accident some we went past and then on second thoughts pulled up and backed into at last as we ran through one of these places i fancied i detected in the gloaming the name c painted up is that c i asked of a fellow traveller it is so you should have gone in the back of the train if you wanted to stop there missed again i grew desperate the train was crawling along at a foot's pace my fellow traveller was not a formidable one i opened the door and jumped out on to the line i was uninjured and c was not a mile away if i ran i might still be there to meet the back of the train and michael mccrane but as i began to run a grating sound behind me warned me that the train had suddenly pulled up and a shout proclaimed that i was being pursued half a dozen passengers and the guard none of them pressed for time joined in the hue and cry what it was all about i cannot imagine all i know is that that evening in the meadows near c a wretched cockney in a battered chimney pot hat and carrying an umbrella was wantonly run to earth by a handful of natives and that an hour later the same unhappy person was clapped in the village lock up for the night as a suspicious character it had all been tending to this fate had marked me for her own and run me down at last perhaps i was a criminal after all and did not know it at any rate i was too fatigued to care much what happened i reserved my defence as they say in the police courts and resigned myself to spend the night as comfortably as possible in the comparative seclusion of a small apartment which whatever may have been its defects compared most favourably with the cabin in which i had lain the night before it was about ten o'clock next morning before i had an opportunity of talking my case over with the inspector and suggesting to him he had better let me go he good fellow at once fell in with my wishes after hearing my statement and in his anxiety to efface any unpleasant impressions i suppose proposed an adjournment to the hotel to drink siccess to the ould counthree the proposed toast was not sufficiently relevant to the business i had on hand to allure me so i made my excuses and hastened to the telegraph office to ascertain whether they had any message for me there they had it was from my manager as i expected but the contents were astounding return at once robber captured here keep down expenses it would be hard to say which of these three important sentences struck me as the most cruel i think the last i was standing in the street staring blankly at the missive when i was startled beyond measure by feeling a hand on my shoulder and a voice pronouncing my name samuels it was michael mccrane but not the michael mccrane i knew in the city or the one i had seen going below on board the steamer he wore a frock coat and light trousers lavender gloves and a hat glorious product of that identical box in which you might see your own face a rose was in his button hole his hair was brushed his collar was white and his chin was absolutely smooth whatever are you doing here he asked oh faltered i for i was fairly overcome both by my own misfortunes and his magnificent appearance nothing only a a little business run you know for the manager i didn't know we had any customers in these parts well no but i say what are you doing here business too said he grave business by the way samuels have you got any better clothes than these here was a question and from michael mccrane because he went on and here he became embarrassed himself if you had in fact you'd do as you are because you won't have to wear your hat what i mean is that now you are here i'd be awfully obliged if you'd be my best man i'm to be married this morning i say there's the bell beginning to ring come on samuels chapter ten new light on an old fable part i a discovery what cannot one discover on an old bookstall who would have supposed i should have had the luck to pick up the extraordinary collection of newspaper cuttings which are here presented to the reader the extracts speak for themselves they present in a moderately connected form the story of a famous epoch in english history and shed a flood of light on transactions which have long since passed into the region of myth although the dates of months and days are given the actual year to which the extracts refer is unfortunately left in obscurity but from internal evidence and certain references to current events it is supposed that the date cannot have been later than the reign of king arthur or at any rate before the saxon period i may say that in reading over the present account and the mythological story of jack the giant killer i am struck by several discrepancies in the commonly received tradition and in the account of the manners and customs of the times here revealed i make no attempt to reconcile the two versions though i am decidedly of opinion that of the two the present may be accepted by the reader as the more authentic at any rate it is an editor's duty to give his story as he receives it and to leave his readers to form their own conclusions the following then is an exact transcript of the newspaper extracts to which we have referred from the stilly gazette june th despatches from the mainland report that the season is now in full swing the charming seaside resorts on this attractive coast are crowded with visitors it is remarked as a singular indication of the uncertainties attending excursion traffic that the proportion of arrivals is greatly in advance of the departures this is particularly noticeable in the neighbourhood of giants' bay where the well known hospitality of the residents appears to have an extraordinary fascination for visitors it is rumoured that although fresh arrivals take place daily and no departures are announced the number of visitors remains comparatively stationary and the place has at no time been inconveniently crowded altogether there seems

president i anticipate the more detailed account of this singular neighbourhood which i hope to make when i address you at the meeting on september st by a few preliminary notes on some most extraordinary anthropological discoveries which certain members of the society have recently made among the inhabitants of giants' bay at a very early period of the world's history midway it is conjectured between the glacial and basaltic epochs that is to say about years before the creation of the world there appears to have prevailed an unusual divergence in the normal stature of the mammal bipeds in the county of cornwall fossil remains indicate the primeval existence of an undersized race whose average height has been ascertained to be feet inches this precise figure has been calculated by a member of this society from the measurement of an apparently human footprint discovered in the chalk deposit thrown up in course of the erection of a public lamp in the vicinity of the assembly room as the heavy rains of the last few days have unfortunately obliterated this interesting impression the society is to be congratulated on the prescience of the member who was energetic enough to measure it while still existent in contrast to this diminutive race we have discovered traces of a gigantic race still in existence three of these remarkable beings inhabit this locality where they occupy high positions as proprietors of the leading hostelries of the place indeed i may say that the members of the society at the present time at giants' bay have the good fortune to be quartered on the premises of one of these singular specimens of a mammoth prehistoric civilisation an opportunity is about to be given to each member singly to inspect the phenomenon thus opportunely brought under observation it need hardly be stated that the collaboration of the individual reports which it is proposed to make promises to result in one of the most important contributions to anthropological science which has ever been placed on record the preliminary inspection is to be made by the president to morrow and it is expected that the complete report will be ready for the

grand hotel has it appears been missing since the th inst when he was seen in his usual good health and spirits exercising on his machine in the grounds of the hotel as abrupt departures are not uncommon at seaside places of resort no notice of his absence appears to have been taken for a day or two on his failure to return however after three days inquiries were at once instituted and the

clergyman fifty scientific men missing the most astonishing rumours continue to come in from giants' bay in addition to the disappearance recorded in a recent issue we have received information that a whole congress of anthropomorphists has been missing for a week they were quartered at cormoran's hotel where their personal effects still remain many conjectures are afloat the most reasonable of which appears to point to the probability of the unfortunate tourists having been engulfed in the sands which at certain states of the tide are said to be highly dangerous along this coast later at the round table to night a question was asked as to the extraordinary disappearances reported from giants' bay the home secretary requested the hon member to give notice of the question for this day

giant blunderbore from the scampingtonian july th dear chappies no end of a go can't find my people high or low people been sloping off all round fancy i know why now on monday i saw blunderbore's door open as i passed and i thought i'd pop in and see what he knew about it he was sitting in his chair looking jolly blue what's up blundy i said i'm awfully hungry said he why don't you have some grub i said doctors won't let me said he you see a week ago i happened to eat something that disagreed with me between me and you said he it was a knight in armour i didn't mind the knight but the armour gave me a very bad turn do you know said i that was my governor my dear boy said he i'm awfully sorry i feel for you i wish i hadn't done it sincerely but a fellow must live really i sympathise with you let me grasp your hand not if i know it you cad said i and where's my mother that's another thing that troubles me said he tell me did she wear a brocaded silk gown with beads most unlucky for us both beads never did agree with me it's a warning to both of us to be more particular really you must let me grasp your hand not much said i look here blunderbore i mean to show you up i'll let some of our fellows know about you and you see if they don't make you sit up before long i feel much more like lying down said he would you mind handing me that medicine bottle don't you wish you may

did it serves him jolly well right from the giants' bay broadsheet july th it is with feelings almost akin to consternation that we announce the sudden and critical illness of our esteemed fellow citizen giant cormoran the regret with which we make this announcement will be shared by all those visitors to this charming retreat who during the last months have come into contact with the amiable and accommodating gentleman giant cormoran is one of the old school of englishmen whom we can ill afford to lose capacious in mind and body with a large sense of humour of strict personal integrity and a hearty enjoyment of life it is indeed sad to think of him at the present moment as lying on a bed of languishing from which it is doubtful whether he will rise more very little news leaks out from the sick chamber dr smith is in regular attendance and according to a curt bulletin published an hour ago reports his patient's condition as exceedingly grave giant cormoran is in a state of collapse there is a complete loss of nervous power the patient has quite lost his head we have no doubt that the melancholy death of his comrade giant blunderbore has seriously affected his nerves happily his condition spares him the additional pang of knowing that giant galligantus is also on the sick list with what it is feared is a mild attack of the prevailing epidemic later the following

august th our special correspondent at giants' bay writes the excitement here is unabated all sorts of conjectures are afloat general opinion seems to connect the wholesale disappearance of tourists and the sudden death of the three giants as parts of the fiendish scheme of some person unknown the miscreant is supposed to be interested in some other watering place we have been fortunate enough to secure a personal interview with the celebrated dr john smith whose remarks in view of his recent close personal relations with the deceased giants will be read with interest we found the youthful doctor enjoying a fragrant weed in the verandah of his father's bijou residence in scilly a beautiful day doctor' we said taking the vacant seat beside him is it' replied he placing his two feet in a graceful attitude on the elaborately polished balustrade of the balcony heard of you at giants' bay' we remarked by way of leading up to the subject there was a pause and then the doctor replied oh' a strange affair the sudden mortality in that place doctor' what about it' was the unexpected rejoinder as the man of physic slowly assumed a standing attitude he was dressed in a light check suit which reflected considerable credit on the provincial tailor who made it that's the question' we replied with a touch of humour the doctor appeared to feel the heat but presently recovered sufficiently to call our attention to the peculiar make of his boots they were large with flapped uppers and clumped soles and could hardly have cost less than a guinea the pair we congratulated him warmly upon his possession dr smith was evidently proud of them see them' said he pointing to the right foot we nodded a friendly assent inwardly amused at our friend's eccentricity do you see that hill there' said he abruptly pointing over our shoulder we turned to look it was indeed a fine view which met our eyes a view of which any native of scilly might be proud we were about to make an observation to the effect when he interrupted us feel them' we certainly did feel something not in front of us and not being anxious to take up more of our friend's valuable time we thanked him for his courtesy and

forward outstanding accounts by return to messrs payup and shellout solicitors london chapter eleven sub chapter i the coastguardsman's yarn a legend of the civil war several summers ago i happened to be spending a few weeks at w a small fishing village on the welsh coast a beautiful little place it was nestling in a break of the cliffs which rose majestically above it on either side and stretched in gaunt rugged walls seaward the beautiful bay with its sunset lights behind the grand headland with its deep caves and tumbled rocks and above all its blue waters lying sometimes calm and motionless and at others dashing furiously at the foot of the cliffs was enough to attract any lover of nature and dull little place as it was with its one tiny inn and its handful of natives the time i spent there with my easel and paint brush was one of the most enjoyable of my life but beautiful as the view was from the land i found the view from the sea still more attractive and in order to gratify my tastes in this respect i took pains to get myself into the good graces of one or two of the fishermen a few of whom could speak english and many times accompanied them on their fishing cruises in the bay where while they toiled at the nets i sat and drank in the thousand beauties of the coast or worked eagerly with my brush to commit them to canvas the expedition i liked best was towards the southern headland of the bay where the cliffs were tallest and steepest and where to add to the other attractions of the view stood perched like an eagle's nest on the edge of the crag the ruins of an old castle by old i do not mean roman or even norman indeed in that sense it was comparatively modern for the building what was left of it looked more like one of those tudor manor houses which dot the country still than a fortress and yet that it had been fortified was plain enough even still on the side towards the sea it needed no protection indeed looking up at it from below it seemed almost to overhang its precipitous foundation but on the land side there remained traces of a moat and loop holes in the walls and a massive gate it was scarcely to be called a picturesque ruin except inasmuch as every ruin is picturesque its bare walls rose gaunt and black out of the ground not out of a heap of tumbled moss grown masonry or covered over with ivy there were very few signs of decay about the place ruinous as it was and very little examination was enough to show that it had suffered not from old age or from the cannon of an enemy but from fire no one about could tell me its story and the mystery of the place only added to its charm indeed i was quite glad to discover that it had not even a name and that the country folk would as soon have thought of crossing the old moat after nightfall as they would have done of stepping over the edge of the cliff the only thing i could learn about it in fact was that it was haunted and that the one little turret which still retained a roof and over which the only ivy visible tried to creep was railed the lady tower and was the most haunted spot of all i could not believe that the one corner of the old ruin where there still remained a sign of life and verdure could be infested by any very terrible ghost still i am not quite sure whether i should have enjoyed a solitary night's rest there and to have suggested the thing to the natives of w would have been enough to secure my incarceration as a raving lunatic so i did not but by daytime i added myself one more to the spirits that haunted the place and yielded myself up completely to its fascination one day towards the end of my visit i walked over to a coastguard station some miles along the shore for the sake of taking a last survey of the beautiful coast when i reached it i found to my pleasure one of the w fishing boats just preparing to put out and sail round the headland back to the village one of the coastguardsmen was on board and i was glad to accept the invitation of my honest friend to form another of the party i found the coastguardsman a most intelligent fellow well informed on many subjects and even professing to be something of an art critic i showed him one or two of my pictures and he was graciously pleased to approve of them especially a sketch of the ruined castle from the south with the lady tower in the foreground the examination of this picture naturally turned the conversation on to the ruin and i was delighted to find my companion seemed almost as interested in the subject as i was it's a strange thing said i that the one thing wanting seems to be a story ah that was burnt out by the fire sir i was rude enough to laugh he fancied i was lamenting the absence of the top storey i don't mean that i said what i mean is no one seems to know anything about the place or its history not they what should they bother their heads about it for but it must have a history of some sort said i of course it has do you know it of course i do it was quite a shock to me to find any one knew anything about my ruin and it was some time before i ventured to ask would you tell it to me instead of saying yes the coastguardsman laid down his telescope pulled a plug of tobacco out of his pocket and cutting off a small quid put it into his mouth looked up at the sail shifted himself once or twice in his seat and then looking to see if i was ready began it's not such a wonderful yarn after all sir you see something like two hundred and fifty years ago when our civil wars were going on you've heard of them i suppose yonder castle belonged to a stout charles the first's man called fulke he owned a good bit about this coast i'm told and the folk at the new manor are sort of descendants but direct descendants they can't be for fulke only had one daughter sir and she never married if it hadn't been for those cruel wars she would have been married though for she was betrothed to a neighbour young morgan who lived beyond that hill there and mightily they loved one another too fulke whose lands joined on morgan's was pleased enough to have the two families united and united they would have been to this day but for the civil wars i'm no great hand at dates sir but it was somewheres about that things began to get unpleasant one day not long before the wedding was to be fulke and his daughter went over to morgan hall and while the young folk spent the day love making in the garden the two old folk sat and discussed the affairs of the nation in the house and it's safe to say the two out of doors agreed far better than the two indoors for morgan went with the parliament and told fulke the king had no right to try and arrest the five members and that the parliament had done a fine thing in protecting them and that if he'd been there he'd have called out against the king as loud as any of them at that fulke who was a hot headed man at best of times and who went mad to hear any one say a word against the king got up in a rage and taking his hat stalked out into the garden and taking his daughter by the arm marched away from morgan hall with never a word it was a sad business the young folks begged and the old morgan sent a letter but no fulke wouldn't listen to one of them and forbade his daughter to leave the castle whether the lovers saw one another after that i don't know but almost directly after the war blazed out and the whole country went mad morgan and his son had to leave these parts and took arms under the parliament while fulke brought guns and powder into his castle and hoisted the flag of king charles the young lady had a busy time of it sheltering and entertaining the royalists who came this way but she had no heart in it not that she didn't love the king sir yet she loved young morgan more so things went on for four or live years the king as you know sir got the worst of it and was driven to his wits' end most of his friends had fallen and some had deserted but so far no one had given fulke much trouble either they had never heard of him or saw there was not much to fear from him so the royal flag waved over the castle day and night and the young lady did what her father bid her and never went abroad or heard a word of young morgan but at last the king not knowing what to do tried to bring over the irish to help him and then it was the troubles in these parts began for every one that was suspected of aiding in this venture was doomed by the parliament and fulke was suspected rightly or wrongly i can't say but i've a notion there was something in it anyway his castle commanded the bay and the parliament made up their minds to have it fulke had only time to get a score or so of men with arms and provender inside his gate when a troop of roundheads came with their guns over the lulls and sat down before it the leader of the troop was a colonel frank a cruel ruffianly fellow as you shall hear and the second in command was no other than young captain morgan himself he had had plenty of rough work during the war and had done it well and it's a pity sir all the parliament's officers weren't of his sort for he was as unlike colonel frank as a house dog is to a wolf when first ordered on this expedition he didn't know where he was going and you can fancy his horror at finding out that he was to lay siege to the very castle that held his lady love at first he would have held back and even refused but he was under iron rules and besides thought he i might help my lady more by going than staying away so he came with the troop to the castle and looked wistfully up at the little turret yonder and prayed that she might never know that he was where he was colonel frank came expecting an easy task with this small out of the way castle but it was not so easy as he thought on two sides as you see sir no mortal man could get at it and on the other two fulke had guarded himself so well that by the end of a fortnight the roundheads were not an inch nearer getting the place than they had been when they began the rage of the colonel knew no bounds and he vowed all sorts of vengeance you may fancy one of his men did not join in his threats many a time that fortnight captain morgan wished a shot from the castle might find him out and end his misery and yet whenever he was tempted to desert or quarrel with his colonel the thought of the lady left with no protector at the mercy of such a man held him to his post all he could do was once or twice to urge the colonel to raise the siege or come to terms with its master but frank was bent on vengeance and at last poor morgan had to desist for fear of getting suspected himself about three weeks after the siege had begun when the roundheads were beginning to lose spirit and morgan's hopes were beginning to rise once more a trooper rushed into the colonel's tent to say he had found a small cave below the top of the cliff which seemed to run up under the castle the colonel's eyes blazed at the news and he ordered the man to lead him instantly to the spot do you see a square grey patch on the face of the cliff up there sir nearly at the top under the south corner yes what is it that's the mouth of the cave at least it's not a cave now for it's filled up but it was there the trooper under cover of night led the colonel and the captain they didn't do more than mark the place then for fear an alarm might be given by a sentinel within now' says colonel frank the castle's ours and not a soul inside it shall be there by this time to morrow' what shall you do' says captain morgan pale and with a shaky voice do art thou a dunce morgan without doubt at the end of that cave is a way up into the castle and though the passage be too narrow for all my troop three men and a captain will suffice to lay faggots and light them at the door what say you comrade' what' cries morgan would you burn the place no no colonel we will capture it if we can but it is no soldier's work to burn men in their beds' fool' exclaims the colonel in a passion it is no captain's work to read sermons to his colonel sirrah these rebels shall be smoked out like all other vermin' but' says the captain once more and very pale but i hear there is a lady in the castle and ' peace sir on your peril' exclaims the colonel and hold yourself ready to obey orders when i shall give them' it was no use saying more young morgan saw that as it was he knew his colonel half suspected him of some treachery and for the rest of that day put a watch upon him twenty times that day he was on the point of risking all consequences and declaring to his officer's face he would have no hand in this bad business but the thought of how much worse that might be for the folk in the castle kept him to his post well sir the day passed and they kept up a show of besieging the place on the land side and took care to keep all fulke's guns turned that way but at nightfall colonel frank called morgan to him and ordered him to take six men whom he named and try the passage if you find a sentinel at this end' says the colonel see he is overpowered and taken before an alarm can be given over the cliff will be the shortest way with him the men you take know their business and see you perform yours' he says with a scowl i and the rest of the troop will be ready to storm the place as soon as we see the flames go now lose no time and hark you there is no quarter to night for traitors' this last remark may have been meant for the captain who knew that at heart he was a traitor to the parliament that night or it may have been meant for the inmates of the castle anyway it sounded ugly enough and it was all morgan could do to hold his peace and make no reply he found the six men waiting for him without and in the darkness they crept stealthily round to the edge of the cliff where a narrow ledge led down to the end of the cave it was a perilous step down especially to those unaccustomed to the way but the spot had been carefully marked in the daytime and presently the little band all stood there at the entrance morgan in his secret heart wished some sentinel of the besieged might have perceived them and so given an alarm but no such was the security fulke felt in the secrecy of his cave that it never entered his head to guard it the men entered one by one with a man carrying a light in front the passage was too narrow to allow of two abreast and too low for any one to stand upright in it so single file on hands and knees they crawled forward at last when they had gone some way and the sound of the sea grew faint in the distance morgan halted his men give me the light' says he and stay here while i go forward and see how the passage ends' he crawled forward to the front of the file and took the torch from the hands of the foremost man but when he began to move forward he noticed that two of the band followed him at a short distance did i not order you to remain with the rest' demands he angrily pardon captain the colonel bade us keep close to you' says one of the men sourly morgan's blood ran cold in his veins and his last hope of giving a friendly warning to those in the castle vanished however it was no time to quarrel and he answered with a forced laugh the colonel flatters me by his attention but as he is anxious for my welfare come on my men and keep your eyes on me' the three went forward till the cave became so narrow that they could scarcely drag themselves farther in one place a little chink in the roof let in a faint ray of moonlight from above at length they could get no farther and morgan turning his head said it's a false scent after all the cave leads nowhere' but at that moment over their heads they heard a sound of feet and presently of voices at first they could distinguish nothing but after a while morgan's ears caught some words pray master get you to bed for this one night the scoundrels can do nothing till the morning' i need no rest i tell you' said another voice sternly how stands the provender peter' it will last three days master and the shot will hold out for two the water alas is already exhausted' ah and my child how is she' in good heart master she was sleeping like a child as i passed her room just now' morgan could forbear no longer he turned quickly to his men and said in a loud voice which might be heard by the unseen watchers overhead my torch has gone out crawl back one of you to the rest and bring another for if the castle is to be fired to night ' there was a startled movement above which told him his object had been gained the voices grew silent and the footsteps moved suddenly for a moment his two companions did not comprehend what had happened but it flashed on them soon enough and they were ready for the emergency one of the two suddenly lit a small ball of hemp saturated in some inflammable substance which he had carried with him and fixing it on to the point of his sword held it up to the boards above at the same time that the other drew his pistol and pointed it at morgan's head not a word was said and not one of the three stirred until a sharp crackling of the wood above told its own tale the soldier still held up his brand till the place was well alight then withdrawing it and beckoning to his companion he began to retreat towards the mouth of the cave saying as he did so with a mocking laugh farewell master traitor i doubt not your business keeps you where you are we shall miss your company' morgan did not hear them he sprang desperately towards the now blazing boards but it was too late to stay the fire and the heat and falling embers drove him back still he could not go but stayed there half suffocated determined at least not to desert his post while a glimmer of hope remained in a few moments there was a crash and a shower of sparks at his feet the trap door had fallen in heedless of the peril or the pain he sprang once more at the opening and this time how he knew not succeeded in lifting himself into the blazing apartment many a time had he been there before in happier days he rushed across to the door and out into the great hall of the castle not a man was there to stop him he heard voices and shouts outside but the castle seemed to have been left to its fate there was yet time thought he before the flames reached so far to rush up to his lady's room and save her he sprang up the staircase halfway up he saw a figure before him ascending too he called and the man turned suddenly morgan knew him in a moment it was fulke himself the old royalist seeing himself pursued by a soldier in the dress of a roundhead concluded the enemy had already entered his castle and with the fury of a desperate man drew his sword and threw himself upon the stranger morgan had no time to hesitate the delay of a moment might cost his lady her life with a rapid pass of his sword he struck fulke across the arm and as the weapon dropped from the old soldier's hand morgan rushed past on towards the lady's chamber another obstacle still awaited him this time it was a groom unarmed who encountered him he too defenceless as he was sprang wildly upon the intruder to dispute the passage but morgan put him by with the flat of his sword and crying look to your master below i will see to the lady' darted on after that it was all like a dream he was dimly conscious of rushing down those steps shortly after with a precious burden in his arms how he struggled through the smoke and fire or how he kept his feet on that tottering staircase no one knows it's enough to say he struggled forward down the stairs and across the hall as far as the outer door where some one snatched his unharmed burden from his arms and carried her to a place of safety where already her father tended by his faithful servant was recovering consciousness the courtyard by this time was crowded with troopers royalist and roundhead and above the roar of the flames and the crashing of falling roofs there rose the report of guns and the clash of swords morgan half stunned and like a man in a dream was standing propped up against a tree a helpless spectator of the scene when suddenly one of his own men rushed up to him and saluted the colonel sir is dead he was under yonder wall as it fell the men sir look to you for orders' morgan sprang to his feet like one electrified call the men off' he cried hoarsely instantly without another blow and bring the prisoners to the camp to me lose not a moment friend' the order was obeyed the roundheads were glad enough to get clear of the tottering walls without being too particular as to who escaped and who was captured among the prisoners who next morning were reported to the captain as safe were fulke his daughter and one manservant morgan's heart failed him he could not dared not see them he ordered them to be kept in safe custody and meanwhile summoned two of his most trusty soldiers to receive orders respecting them that night a small boat was brought round to the bottom of yonder cliff where you see the little creak sir and in it fulke and the young lady and their servant were rowed secretly to w where a fishing boat waited to carry them to ireland that's the story sir and what became of morgan said i no one heard of him after this affair sir and they do say he was punished as a traitor but whatever the end of him was he never repented his night's work at the burning of fulke castle chapter twelve fallen among thieves a grandfather's yarn sub chapter i when i was a young fellow began my grandfather there was a general silence and a settling of ourselves in our seats as the wavering voice of the old man uttered these magical words no one had asked him to tell a story some of us had almost forgotten that he was sitting there in his big chair one of the group which crowded round his own christmas fire at culverton manor he was an old old man was my grandfather the proverbial threescore years and ten was an old story with him and even the fourscore awarded to the strong was receding into the distance yet there he sat in his old straight back chair hale and bright as he looked round on us his descendants sons and daughters grey haired already grandchildren who some of them were staid heads of families themselves and the little group of great grandchildren who knew as well as any one that when their father's grandfather began to talk of the days when he was young it was worth their while to hold their peace and prick up their ears when i was a young fellow began my grandfather stroking his old grizzled moustache i was a cornet in the buffs it was in the year heigho my memory's getting rusty it was in the year i believe when every one was expecting the french over and i was quartered with my regiment at ogilby ogilby is an inland town you know thirty miles from here and as there was not much immediate danger of bonaparte dropping in upon us there without good warning we had a lazy rollicking time of it in that bright little place we young officers boys that we were thought it a fine thing to live as grand gentlemen and spend our pay half a dozen times over in all sorts of extravagances and i recollect with sorrow i was as bad as any of them our colonel was an easy going old soldier who had been a wild blade himself once and held that it was little use looking too sharply after us so he didn't look after us at all and we in consequence did just as we pleased sometimes we invited all the gentry round to feast with us at mess and pledged our pay months in advance to load the table with the most costly delicacies at other times we would sally forth and out of sheer mischief organise a riot in the town and end the night with broken heads and now and then in the lock up and when we were tired of this we got up i know not what gaieties to pass the time as i said i was as bad as any of them worse perhaps for i had had a good home and careful training and knew all the time i was joining in the excesses of my comrades that i was a fool and a prodigal and a traitor to my better self and yet i went in and might have gone on to the end of the chapter had not an event happened to me which served to pull me up short one evening that winter our festivities culminated by a grand entertainment given by the officers of our mess to all the countryside compared with this our former efforts in the same direction had been mere child's play we had hired the largest assembly room in the town and decorated it regardless of all expense the wine merchants and confectioners for miles round had been exhausted to furnish our supper and the tailors and milliners driven nearly distracted over our toilets ogilby had never seen such a brilliant entertainment and the officers of the buffs had never achieved such a triumph i was among the last to leave the gay scene and as i stepped out into the chill winter air and called for my horse the clock of the church was striking four my man had to help me to my saddle for what with the sudden change of air added to the excesses of the evening i was not steady enough to do it myself my man was the son of an old tenant of my father's and as he had known me from childhood i was used to allowing him more familiarity than most gentlemen allow to their servants i was therefore not surprised when on reaching my quarters after helping me to alight he stopped a moment to speak to me before i entered the house by your leave master hal' said he saluting i thought you might like to know there is bad news from culverton' how' i demanded scarcely taking in what he said bad news begging your honour's pardon i had it in a letter from phoebe the dairymaid at the vicarage who your honour may know is my sweetheart or rather i am hers and by your ' sirrah man drop your sweetheart and come to your news what is it' it is news of the squire master hal' said the man seriously my father' i exclaimed suddenly sobered by the name he is ill please your honour he had a stroke a week ago and phoebe says his life is despaired of' ill a week and i never heard' i exclaimed why did no one tell me' your honour may remember you have not examined your letters for these three days past' it was true in the whirl of excitement with late nights and later mornings and never ending frivolity my very letters had lain on my mantelshelf unopened my man turned to take my horse away to the stable his action recalled me suddenly to myself hold' i said leave the horse here tucker and help me into the saddle again' tucker gazed at me in astonishment but did as he was bid i am going to culverton' i said shortly taking up the reins to culverton at this hour and in this weather' said tucker in tones of alarm stay at any rate till you have had a night's rest for you need it master and till i can put up what you need for the journey' let go my horse man' i cried excitedly setting spurs to the animal and abruptly ending the honest fellow's remonstrance the thought of my father lying ill dying perhaps and me here revelling in ogilby made it impossible for me to contemplate a moment's delay even so much as to change my gay attire or provide myself with necessaries for the journey culverton was thirty miles distant i had a good horse and with all my dissipation i was capable of a fair share of endurance i therefore yielded to my impulse and halting only to leave word with a comrade whom i met to explain my absence to the colonel i dashed off into the night on my way to culverton what were my thoughts during those first few hours i need hardly tell you i hope and trust none of you will ever be tortured by the self reproach of which i was then the victim for some distance out of ogilby the roads were pretty good and i made tolerable progress so that when morning broke about seven i was at least a dozen miles on my journey i could scarcely brook the delay of a few minutes at the first village to rest my horse and swallow a hurried breakfast but i knew that for the rest of the way accommodation either for man or beast was very limited and therefore prudence made the unwelcome delay a necessity once more in the saddle i hoped to make up for lost time but in this i was fated to be disappointed for scarcely had i got beyond the village when the weather suddenly changed the chill morning air freshened to a wind which brought snow with it light at first but increasing in heaviness as the day went on the road rapidly became covered and my horse unable on the treacherous foothold to maintain the canter of the morning was compelled to slacken into a trot i was in no gear for weather like this as you may suppose i still wore the light festive attire of the previous night covered only with my military cape which i now drew more closely around me at every step how i wished i had taken tucker's prudent advice but it was too late to help it now what troubled me most was not the cold or the driving snow in my face but the slow pace at which progress was now possible i had hoped to reach culverton by noon but by noon i had accomplished scarcely two thirds of the distance and every moment the difficulties of the way were increasing my horse trudged on gallantly the trot had long since given place to a walk and the walk in turn often became a sheer struggle for progress through the drifts and obstacles of the uncertain road as for me i was nearly frozen in my saddle and more than once was compelled to dismount and tramp along beside my horse in the deep snow in order to keep the blood going in my veins and all the while the thought of my father lying there at culverton neglected perhaps with no son at hand to tend him drove me nearly frantic the afternoon dragged on and towards dark the snow ceased to fall that was at least some comfort for to battle through that storm in the dark would have been an impossibility as it was my good horse was even now ready to drop and i was in little better plight if either of us failed it meant an entire night in the snow and that would be little short of certain death it was a dreary prospect however as i say the snow ceased to fall and towards night the sky overhead began to clear until presently the moon shone out and lit up the wintry scene but for this light we might have lost our way hopelessly for the road lay over a heath which being all covered in snow we had only the wayside posts to direct us and keep us on the beaten track it must have been near eight o'clock sixteen hours since i had left the assembly at ogilby when i caught sight in the moonlight of a small cottage a little way removed from the road on our right the sight of this the first habitation we had passed for hours was welcome indeed i could scarcely stand with hunger fatigue and cold and my brave horse was stumbling at every step our only chance of reaching culverton that night was in seeking such rest and refreshment as this place might afford and i therefore gladly turned aside and led my weary steed along the by path that led up to it it was a small tumbledown cottage or rather barn and my fond hopes as to fire and refreshment were dashed at once it was empty the broken door stood ajar the roof was nearly fallen in and everything within and without testified that for weeks at any rate it had been deserted still it had walls and a roof and so if we were not to have board we might at least for an hour or so help ourselves to lodgings i led my horse in and after much groping about was delighted to discover in one corner of the hovel a sort of stall which had evidently at one time or other been occupied by a cow the ground was still strewn with a little old and very vile straw which however was an unexpected luxury to us both and a mere mouthful of stale hay remained in the trough to these desirable quarters i conducted my faithful companion who without ceremony devoured the hay and then too exhausted to stand dropped into a recumbent posture and lay stretched on his side on the straw i quickly followed his example creeping as close to his side as i could for the sake of the warmth and thus we lay in the dark resting as we had never rested before after our day's work my own fear was lest i should fall asleep in spite of my anxiety about my father and my bitter reproaches against myself i felt a stupor come over me which it was almost more than human nature to resist once or twice i dozed off for a moment and then woke by an effort each time more painful until i was tempted at last to give in and resist no longer whatever it cost i had just come to this resolve when i became suddenly aware of the sound of voices in the cottage whoever they belonged to i felt sure they must have entered after me for i had explored every corner of the place when i took possession they had probably entered during one of my fits of drowsiness my first impulse was to discover myself to the new comers and see if they could help me and my horse in our distress but on second thoughts i decided to remain where i was until i could ascertain at least who the intruders were and if they had any better right in the cottage than i had i was wide awake now and raising myself noiselessly from my horse's side i crawled to the side of the stall and peered over by the uncertain light of a small fire of sticks which they had made i saw two men sitting on the floor regaling themselves with bread and meat and the contents of a bottle the sight of these good things made me still more inclined to disclose my presence but prudence again forbade besides which there was something strange about the look of the men and the place where they were which excited my curiosity for a long time they continued their meal in silence it went to my heart to see the victuals disappearing at such a rate as you may suppose at length when for the present at any rate their appetites seemed to be appeased they began to talk once more you're sure there's no mistake this time' said one i have his own word for it' replied the other i tell you tom he's planned it all out like bonaparte himself' all i can say is' said he who was called tom i hope something will come of it for i'm sick of all this doing nothing' you may be sure something will come of this' replied the other and it will be something worth the while too unless i'm mistaken for the old gentleman is very rich see here' said he producing some papers from his pocket this is what he says' he began to read a letter and you may fancy how i listening behind the partition started as i heard it jack' it said i'm watched and can't come you and tom must do it without me be you know where by eight on friday night and i'll send one i can trust to show you the way and help you through with it you may rely on him though he's a queer dog here's a map of the grounds of culverton but you won't need it for he i send knows the place well the steward is on our side and will leave the back door unlatched the strong box stands in the study the second door on the left after you pass the great clock the old man lies ill and only two maids are in the house besides the young puppy is away at ogilby bring what you get to the tower by the river on saturday night there are jewels in the desk in the old man's room he cannot hurt if he tries he must be quieted you know how' i was so horrified that for a moment or two i scarcely knew whether i was awake or dreaming my poor father not only ill but in peril of robbery and perhaps murder and i what could i do my impulse was to spring from my retreat and make one desperate effort to overpower the villains but i was too weak to do it besides i was unarmed whereas they had each his pistol what could i do the man who had read the letter carefully put it along with the rough map of the culverton grounds into the fire and the two sat and watched the papers as they burned he's a good man of business' said tom middling' replied the other and if he ' at that moment my horse gave a sudden start in his sleep the quick ears of the two villains instantly caught the sound hullo' said one in a whisper what was that' hist' said the other holding up his hand strike a light tom' while tom obeyed i softly dropped on my hands and knees and crawled back to my old place beside the horse where i lay motionless and to all appearance in a profound sleep i'm sure i heard something' said tom holding up the lantern from where they were they could see nothing but the side of the stall they therefore crept round stealthily and as i lay i saw the light suddenly turn on the horse a nag as i'm a dutchman and saddled too' exclaimed tom if that's so the rider's not far off' said the other grimly taking the lantern and advancing it was all i could do to lie motionless breathing heavily as the light fell full on my face ah found him' was the exclamation as both rushed towards me i heard the cocking of a pistol close beside me and was conscious of a rude plucking at my arm come get up there what do you do here get up do you hear' i had one hope left and it was a desperate one i roused myself slowly and with many feints from my mock slumber and rubbed my eyes and yawned and stared first at one then the other get up' again cried the men still pulling my arm roughly and say what you're doing here' doing here' i drawled as unconcernedly as i could stretching myself at the same time that's a pretty question to ask me what were you doing not to be here at eight o'clock i'd like to know' the men let go my arms and looked at me in bewilderment why' said one are you ' there' said i we don't mention names in our trade you'll learn that when you grow older and you'll learn to be punctual too' i added testily the men looked half abashed we were here at eight' they said no you were not i was here at eight to the minute and i had time to fall asleep as you see before you came but never mind that you know what business is on foot i suppose' yes i had it all from ' hush no names you dolt what did i tell you before' the men were perfectly sheepish now and i began to breathe again it was well i had been described in the letter as a queer dog' for it is an easy part to act even to save one's own life besides this would account sufficiently well for my unbusinesslike attire my great fear was lest the real person referred to in the letter should arrive on the scene before i had quitted it i therefore ordered an immediate departure we've lost an hour already with your dilatoriness' i growled don't let us lose any more as it is it is a chance if we reach culverton before morning come lead out my horse and bring what food you have with you for i'm starving' before five minutes had passed we were safe out of the cottage and in the high road i mounted on my faithful and partly refreshed horse eating ravenously of the scraps of bread and meat my companions had left while they trudged along in the snow one on either side in this manner we progressed for an hour or so in silence until about one o'clock there appeared on the side of a distant hill a twinkling light i knew it at once it had guided me home often and often before now and it was doing so again but in what strange company that's culverton on the hill there' said i the men who were nearly dead beat with their tramp through the deep snow said nothing but plodded on doggedly it was nearly an hour more before we reached the outskirts of the estate and by this time so exhausted were they that when i cried a halt they fairly sat down in the snow i was strongly tempted to leave them there but a desire to bring them to condign punishment prevented me they were armed and i was not besides the reference in the letter to my father's steward made me anxious to sift the matter to the bottom come come' said i at that rate you'll never see the strong box get up men' they struggled to their feet had they been anything but the villains they were i could have pitied them they looked so miserable hold my horse' said i dismounting while i go and reconnoitre i know every inch of the ground keep in the dark whatever you do under the hedge there so are you loaded' i am' said tom sullenly taking out his pistol so am i' said the other give me one of the pistols' i said as coolly as i could you won't want both here and i may want one' tom handed me his now keep a look out here and when you hear me whistle over the wall come sharp mind' so saying i left them and went on towards the house except in my father's room no lights were burning and i began to hope that what the letter had said about the steward might after all prove to be false i went quietly up to the back door and turned the handle it was open the story was true then and in my rage and indignation i could hardly contain myself to act my part any longer however i made a desperate effort holding the door slightly open i whistled softly there was no answer i whistled again louder this time there was a sound of some one moving and the faint nicker of a candle and presently i heard a voice whisper is it all right' all right' i whispered back and you steward' yes all ready come in' i entered my hat was over my eyes and in the faint candle light the false servant did not know me i followed him to his room you're late' he said reaching down some keys from a nail where are the rest' outside' i replied in a low whisper but low as it was the voice was not disguised enough to escape the quick ear of the steward he turned sharply round and looked at me while i at the same moment throwing off my cap sprang towards him and presented my pistol he was too stunned and terrified to do anything but drop on his knees and utter incoherent entreaties and ejaculations for pity how is my father' i inquired not heeding his entreaties and pointing the pistol still at his head better' he faltered much better oh master ' come with me' i replied turning to the door he accompanied me like a lamb had my father been worse i had intended to lock him up a prisoner in his own room as it was i took him silently and stealthily through the village and delivered him up then and there into the hands of the watch this villain secured it only remained to make sure of the other two and this as it happened was a very easy task for both exhausted by their long forced march and utterly benumbed by the cold had fallen into a drowsy stupor under the hedge where they had been left crouching beside my faithful steed for warmth in this state it was simple work to secure them and march them off to custody where at any rate they were not less comfortable for a time than they had been a further visit next morning to the tower by the river' which was well known to the watch as a rendezvous of thieves served to secure the rest of the conspirators and the law of the land shortly afterwards put it out of their power one and all to practise their wicked craft again as for me that night taught me a lesson or two that i've not forgotten to this day and which in my turn i've tried to teach to some of you here i went back to ogilby a wiser man than i had left it and thank god a better one and what did the poor horse do asked the youngest of the culvertons why he carried me back as merrily as if he'd never seen snow in all his life chapter thirteen our novel a summer holiday achievement sub chapter i the plot it was a bold undertaking no doubt at our tender age to propose to take the world by storm but others had done it before us we had read our wonderful boys and our boyhood of great men carefully and critically we had seen that mozart had composed music at six and written it down very untidily too we had seen that marlborough had by sheer cheek been made an officer at about our age that david wilkie one of the dullest of boys had painted pictures while at school that scott a notorious blockhead had written poetry at thirteen and that james watt at the same age with very little education had pondered over the spout of a tea kettle all this we had seen and been very greatly impressed for surely if some of these very ordinary boys had succeeded in startling their generation it would be strange if we two sydney sproutels and harry hullock who had just carried off the english composition prize at denhamby couldn't write something between us that would make the world sit up that english composition prize had really been a great feather in our caps it was the first thing of the kind we had done not the first english composition but the first sustained literary effort and it had opened our eyes to the genius that burned within us the exercise had been to expand the following brief anecdote into an interesting narrative which should occupy two pages of denhamby paper with twenty lines in a page orpheus son of oeagrus and calliope having lost his wife eurydice followed her to hades where by the charm of his music he received permission to conduct her back to earth on condition that he should not look behind him during the journey this condition he broke before eurydice had quite reached earth and she was in consequence snatched back into hades i need not say that two pages of denhamby paper were all too short to express all we had to say on this delightful subject i being by nature a poet could have used all my space in describing the beauties of the spring morning on which orpheus made his unusual expedition while hullock whose genius was of a more practical order confided to me afterwards that if he had had room he had intended to introduce a stirring conversation between the widower and his wife's ghost in which the latter would make certain very stringent conditions before consenting to return once more to household duties however by dint of severe self denial we both managed to restrain our muses to the forty lines prescribed and sent in our compositions with quite a feeling of envy for the examiner who would have to read them when the results were announced the doctor publicly stated that though many of the compositions were meritorious yet on the whole those of sproutels and hullock showed most originality and indeed gave considerable promise the prize would be shared between them of course after that all question as to our calling in life was at an end and the sooner we fleshed our pens before the world the better so it was arranged that hullock was to get his father and mother to invite me for the midsummer holidays and that before denhamby saw us again our novel should be started the hullock family it is necessary to say here consisted of my partner his two parents a maiden aunt and a sister mr hullock a good and worthy little man who had not had all the advantages of education which his son possessed was a retired coal merchant spending the afternoon of his days at saint leonards his wife as kind and motherly as she was tall and portly treated me like her own son from the moment i entered her house and with her to look after me and alice to fall in love with and harry to collaborate with i was about as comfortable as a restless genius could be that is i should have been so had it not been for the damp and frigid influence of aunt sarah who sympathised neither with genius nor youth and certainly not with the two in combination twenty times a day she grieved me by calling me silly little boy and twenty times a day she exasperated me by reminding harry and through him me that little boys should be seen and not heard however we decided to ignore this uncongenial influence and bury our sorrows in our novel tell you what said harry as we walked on the pier the first evening we ought to look sharp and get our plot wouldn't it be better to settle on the characters and get the plot afterwards all serene said harry can you suggest any one for a hero harry said this in a half significant half off hand manner which made it evident to me he expected i should at once nominate him but in my judgment harry hardly possessed all the qualifications necessary for the hero of our novel so i replied half significantly half off handedly too hadn't you better think of some one here we were in a fix at the very start for harry insisted he would much rather that i should select and i was equally anxious for him to do it at length we compromised the matter and decided we should make the hero a mixture of two fellows the fellow harry liked best and the fellow i liked best after this amicable arrangement it was comparatively clear sailing we had not to look far for the heroine and it occurred to both of us that it would be original as well as pleasant to make the villain a female and middle aged as for minor characters we were able to draw on our acquaintance at denhamby to supply them and failing that harry was magnanimous enough to offer his father and mother as not bad for some of the side plots we had got our characters that one walk on the pier settled them all we also stopped a bit to watch the people we entered into conversation with a sailor who turned out to be deaf and insinuated ourselves into the front of a street row all with a view to reproducing our observations on life into our novel the street row indeed furnished an inspiration for our plot it was the arrest of a make believe italian female organ grinder whose offence appeared to be that she was carrying about in a cradle attached to the organ an infant that did not belong to her and as the infant brought her in much more money than her music did she protested in very strong english against having it removed with the quickness of genius we saw in this incident the pivot on which our novel should be made to turn the baby was the heroine the organ grinder the villain who had stolen her from her high born station in life two of the characters fitted at a blow we had even got the high born parents ready if required and when sixteen years later the little truant was to discover her noble station we had our hero ready to take her home between the pier gate and warrior square we had the whole story worked out what has kept you little boys out so late asked a voice as we entered mr hullock's hall it's not right you should have been in bed by eight it was aunt sarah and we secretly condemned her on the spot to a public execution in our last chapter as we undressed that evening another point was cleared up we can't keep the hero hanging about sixteen years before we bring him in said harry humph i observed unless we said sixteen years passed' at the end of the first chapter and then we might get him in in the second it strikes me said harry dubiously he ought to be in it all through what do you say to making him another stolen baby belonging to another organ just as likely to have two stolen as one it did occur to me that if it came to that all the characters in the story might begin life in this romantic way however there seemed no objection to starting the hero in an organ grinder's cradle and we closed with the suggestion at once and got into bed i woke very early i had the hero on my mind i wanted him to be a good one after the best model and i could not help thinking that the harry in him ought not to be overdone besides if he was to make himself pleasant to the heroine the less he was like harry and the more he was like harry's chief friend the better for sisters in fiction never make much of their brothers but they often make a lot of their brothers' friends i nudged harry with my elbow in order to represent the case to him from this point of view i did it delicately and in a most conciliatory manner i was thinking old man as alice is the heroine and you're her brother i might don't you know perhaps you'd like if well what i mean to say is perhaps i'd better do the gush when it comes to that happily harry was scarcely awake and did not take in all my meaning all serene said he we'll have as little of that as we can i mean i think you'd do the parts about the villain and that sort of thing better don't you but as harry was asleep again i had to take silence for consent the day that followed was an anxious one it is easy enough to get your characters but it is awful having to fix their names and it is simple work getting a plot compared with the agony of dividing it up into forty chapters this was the task before us to day and we retired as before to the pier head with pencils and paper in order to do it beyond the sound of aunt sarah's voice we endured agonies over the names the hero's name should naturally have been a judicious combination of the names of the two fellows we had in our minds' eyes but neither sydrey sproutock nor hardney hulltels exactly pleased us finally we decided to call him henry sydney and strange to say it occurred to me it would be best as a rule to speak of him by his surname while harry was equally strong about calling him by his christian name at last we agreed that when we the authors spoke of him it should be as sydney and that when the heroine or any one else mentioned his name it should be as henry harry explaining that as they're to be kids together there won't be anything strange in her calling him by his christian name the heroine after much searching of heart we christened alicia dearlove and the villain sarah vixen the other names we made up from a local directory which we were lucky enough to stumble across in the pavilion then came the formidable work of slicing up our novel into forty pieces we wrote the figures down the side of a long sheet of paper and looked with something like dismay at the work we had set before us seems a lot of chapters said harry couldn't we make it thirty wouldn't run to six shillings if we did said i that settled it and we set ourselves to fill up the blanks chapter the first wrote i theft of alicia sorrow of her parents the organ grinder's lodgings suspicions of the police the hero in the room underneath hold hard cried harry that's too much for one chapter we shall have to make that do for four of 'em or else we shall run out in ten how on earth can you make four chapters of that said i well you can make theft of alicia' spin out into one oh ah why all there is to say is that aunt sarah i mean mother vixen came across her in the square and collared her however are you to make a dozen pages of that oh said harry we shall have to make her call at public houses on the way and that sort of thing and describe the scenery in the square and have the nursemaid go off to see the militia band go by and leave the baby on the seat bless you it'll spread out harry seemed to know all about it so we went on with our skeleton trotting our little foundling round town on the organ where she witnessed with infant eyes street rows cricket matches bicycle races a murder or two and such other little incidents of life which we deemed calculated to enliven our story about the twelfth chapter she and our hero had already exchanged tender passages in the twentieth chapter her real father and mother happen to see her in the street she being then sixteen and are immediately struck by her resemblance to their lost baby by chapter twenty five our hero had saved the lives of his future mother and father in law and had rescued the heroine single handed from a hatton garden mob in the twenty ninth chapter aunt sarah had committed her murder with every circumstance of brutality and unpleasantness the victim being one of our schoolfellows whom we neither of us loved then for a chapter or two there was some very active police play interspersed with a few love scenes between the hero and heroine who though it never occurred to us at the time must have enjoyed independent means which made it quite unnecessary for them to follow the ordinary avocations of organ grinders about the thirty fifth chapter there was to be a sudden drawing in of threads from all quarters sub chapter thirty sixth was to be devoted to sarah in the condemned cell thirty seventh alicia discovers her name by seeing it marked on a pocket handkerchief she had been using at the time she was stolen sub chapter thirty eighth the hero discovers his name by being told it by a solicitor who has known all about it all the time sub chapter thirty ninth all comes right everybody goes back to their mothers and fathers and a quiet wedding ensues sub chapter forty execution of sarah finis we were tired and hungry by the time our paper was full but we were jubilant all the same stunning fine plot said harry if we only work it out it ought to be as good as nicholas nickleby rather by the way we ought to have one or two funny chaps in it to work off some of our jokes there's that one about the sculptor dying a horrid death you know because he makes faces and busts i'd like to get that in somehow all serene that might come in in the last chapters i've got the family jest book at home we might pick a few things out of that and then settle where they come in and work in for them as we go on we accordingly made a judicious selection and having marked the initials of the character who was to bring them in against each and also the number of the chapter in which they were to come on we really felt as if everything was now ready for our venture we went to bed early so as to get a good night and arise fresh to our work not however before we had made an expedition to the stationer's and expended half a crown in manuscript paper j and d pens blotting paper blue black ink and forty small paper fasteners these provided and the servant being particularly charged to call us at five o'clock we retired to rest and slept with our skeleton under the pillow sub chapter ii the plot thickens a grave question arose the moment we opened our eyes next morning who was to write the first chapter a great deal depended on how it was done the style of the first chapter would give tone to the whole novel and so to speak show the way for all the other chapters i thought said harry in his suspicious off hand way if you took the even numbers and i took the odd that might do might it that would mean he would write chapter one i wanted to write chapter one on the other hand it would mean i should have chapter twelve with the execution in it which would suit me very well i mentioned the fact and could see that harry had forgotten it for he tried hard to back out of his arrangement i think you'd do the first chapter best said he there's some scenery in it you know and you're more of a dab at that than i am but my modesty preferred the even numbers and our novel looked very like being water logged before she had even been launched a compromise was however arrived at as the question of style was very important it was decided we should both write chapter one and then after comparing the two attempts arrange our further procedure accordingly so i with a j pen and harry with a d retired to opposite corners of the room and plunged headlong into the theft of alicia it was a hard morning's work and by the time the breakfast bell rang we were both getting the steam up the sight of aunt sarah brooding over the tea tray had but one meaning for us and sister alice's pretty face and soft voice spoke to me only of that baby i had left in my chapter lying on the seat in the square now little boys are you going to play on the beach to day said the villain as the meal concluded no aunt said harry syd and i have got some work we are doing what work demanded aunt sarah english composition said harry boldly and under cover of this truthful announcement we escaped it was midday before i laid down my pen and gathered my scattered sheets together harry had been done before me but he had only written eleven sheets so our pace was about equal done said he as i sat back in my chair yes lock the door said i i must beg the reader's pardon if i do not lay before them the whole of the two lucubrations they must be content with a few impartially chosen selections my chapter began with a poetical description of london in early morning london in the morning what a scene the whistle of the workmen's trains sounds and the noise of vegetable carts going to covent garden market give the place an animated appearance very few people are awake and those that are look sleepy in such a scene as this a hideous looking woman about fifty years old with a long nose and a shabby barrel organ wended her way from some of the slums near farringdon street station in the direction of euston square it was not a very pretty walk there were no birds twittering in the trees or cuckoos you could not hear the gentle roar of the ocean and what flowers there were were in pots on the window sills the ugly woman chose the road where there were most public houses and i am sorry to say that any one who had walked close beside her would have heard her talking to herself in very bad language here followed the description of a few of the public houses and their natural beauties and my narrative proceeded in this way the wicked woman reached euston square she was greatly intoxicated and not able to play the tunes on her organ correctly nobody gave her anything which was not surprising and the police moved her on all round the square at last it was plain she would have to do something to get some money after thinking over all the different things she thought she would steal a baby and get money that way so seeing a baby lying on a seat close by whose nurse had gone off to see a militia band marching towards gower street she stole it and went off as fast as she could there was a cradle hanging on to the organ and when people saw the baby in it the wicked woman got as much money as she liked my reader will have guessed by this time that the baby which was of the feminine gender is the heroine she was really high born her father was a retired coal merchant he was a very little man and dropped his h's her mother was what the vulgar would call a whopper' let not the reader think she whopped her baby or her husband on the contrary she was kind but big they lived at highbury and the nurse always took the baby out for walks before breakfast it was at this point that it had suddenly flashed across me that i had left out the joke allotted to chapter one and as the narrative was well advanced i ought to work up for it without delay so i proceeded we left alicia for that was the name of our heroine being wheeled back on the organ to hatton garden it was an unpleasant journey the bad woman called at a lot more public houses and left alicia and the organ outside in the rain it was a wonder alicia was not stolen again she began to cry people who came by couldn't make out what it was for she was hidden under the quilt and some thought instead of an organ it must have been some strange animal an organ that cried like a child would be a very queer animal nearly as queer as an author whose tale comes out of his head and some of the people said so i was hot and tired by the time i had worked off this piece of humour and began to wish i saw my way to the end of my twelve sheets two more i occupied with a picture of the organ grinder's quarters in hatton garden and concluded with the following poetical passage little thought the wicked vixen as she huddled her stolen infant into a damp corner of the filthy room how much would happen before alicia and her poor parents next met we know very little of what is going to happen and perhaps it is a good job at any rate it was a good job for alicia as she lay fast asleep the world is all before the little baby it doesn't know what's all in store for it if it did know it seems to me that maybe it wouldn't like the prospect not a bit end of chapter one harry looked a little uncomfortable as i finished reading my chapter aloud i concluded he felt rather out of it and i was not surprised for on the whole it read well and in some respects i flattered myself it had rather a pull on nicholas nickleby harry wisely reserved his criticisms until he had read his own chapter which i awaited with a smile of brotherly resignation you know explained he before he began i tried to get more incident than you that's why i left out the scenery aha my scenery had fetched him then i wondered what his incident would be like fire away said i her name was sarah vixen i'm beginning now her name was sarah vixen she was a horrid old maid one morning she went and played her organ in euston square she played wait till the clouds roll by' and sweethearts' waltz' and the marseillaise' one after the other after which she paused and watched a tennis match which was going on in the square it was a four handed match between two rather good looking boys who wore red and green ribbons on their straws those were the denhamby colours and two big london fellows the schoolboys won the toss and the fair one served first he put in a very hot service just over the net which broke sharp as it fell and bothered the londoners completely the dark hand in played close up to the net and was very neat in the way he picked up balls and smashed them over harry paused and looked doubtfully at me for a moment and then went on the schoolboys pulled off the first three games and then the londoners scored a game owing to the wind a large crowd collected to see the match and shouts of well put over' greeted the schoolboys on every hand the londoners didn't score another game in the first set and scored nothing in the second the crowd became thicker and thicker every moment in the last game the fair schoolboy spun a ball into the far left hand corner which the londoner could not reach and the match ended in a glorious victory for the two schoolboys who apparently unaware of the cheers of the crowd walked home arm in arm as if nothing had happened on their way they met a runaway horse and loud cries of take care' get out of the way' met them on all sides a nursemaid was wheeling a child across the road at that moment and quick as thought the fair boy sprang at the horse and brought him to a standstill just in time the crowd seeing it rushed with a great cheer to the young hero but he seeing it took his friend's arm and walked on as if nothing had happened what are you so pale for' asked his friend oh nothing very much i have broken my arm but it really doesn't matter much' while he spoke he fainted and if it had not been for his friend might have fallen meanwhile the baby left to herself in the perambulator in the middle of the road began to cry which attracted the notice of vixen who seeing she was a nice child went and lifted her out of her perambulator and put her in her cradle on her organ while nobody was looking and took her to her home whose home' i asked harry did not condescend to notice this interruption he may have guessed i was jealous all that about the heroic fair boy had been taking an unfair advantage of me and i think he knew it for i was of a dark complexion his narrative went on to describe a fight in the organ grinder's lodgings and a burglary followed by a fire at the residence of the parents of the lost child as a matter of course the fair boy with his broken arm turned up on the fire engine and brought most of the family down the escape with his sound arm then by a sudden transition the scene changed back to the organ grinder's cottage on the ground floor of which in another cradle slept another infant a boy fair of course and beautifully made showing great promise of physical force and heroism of disposition he was older than alicia and could speak a little there was no one in the room and as he sat up in his cradle he felt very sad presently two young organ grinders came into the room one was dark and vicious the other was fair of course and had a pleasant expression they took no notice of the baby but sat and smoked and asked riddles of one another the fair one of course was far the cleverer of the two and caused much laughter by his wit can you tell me' said he in a pleasant silvery voice very unlike an organ grinder why an author is a queer animal' give it hup' said the vulgar one who always put his h's' wrong because his tale comes out of his head' it was long before the vulgar one saw it and then he laughed so much that the baby began to cry and they had to go into the next room for fear of disturbing it having left the door open the fair baby got out of its cradle and being old enough to walk went quietly upstairs and there what should he see in a cradle in the room above but alicia this was the first time the two met they did not say much but cupid's arrow went through them both from that minute that's all said harry there was a silence which at last i broke and which chapter do you think we'd better put in that's just what i was going to ask you said harry you see said i cautiously you've got rather a lot about that fair chap in yours and he's not in the plot oh he turns out somebody said harry who i don't know yet he's not the hero of course said i decisively he's to be a mixture of both oh of course said harry but i say don't you think there's rather too much about scenery in yours there's very little of that in nicholas nickleby or poetry either no that struck me as one of the weak points of nicholas nickleby said i i thought it was settled the hero was to be in it from the first said harry falling back on another line of defence so he is i shall say in the next chapter that he was in the room underneath all the time said i rather testily oh well said harry of course if you think yours is the best you'd better stick it in i'm out of it if you're going in for poetry you're not obliged to do any poetry said i thanks i shouldn't try unless i was sure of writing something that wasn't doggerel said harry this was hitting me on a tender point look here said i starting up do you mean to tell me i write doggerel i didn't say so you meant it i'd sooner write doggerel than stuff i'd be ashamed to read in a penny dreadful' call yourself a fair boy alas for our novel we spent half an hour that evening in anything but a literary competition aunt sarah remarked on harry's black eye and my one sided countenance at breakfast next morning and inquired artlessly if english composition had caused them we truly answered yes our friendship was quickly restored but our poor novel after that one evening has never lifted up its head again we have sometimes vaguely talked of finishing it but we have been careful to avoid all discussion of details still less all reference to chapter one in fact we have come to the conclusion that it is better not to startle the world at too early an age if you do you are expected to keep it up and that interferes with your enjoyment of life when our novel does come out well we think conan doyle wells and those other fellows will sit up chapter fourteen preface our own penny dreadful i am always coming across old manuscripts i am not sure of the date of the following but i fancy it must have been written for a prize which strange to say it failed to secure the only conditions were that the story should have lots of go in it that the incidents should be natural the tone elevating and the characters carefully studied i ask any of my readers if this does not fulfil all these conditions i know when it was returned to me as not quite the style we care about i was extremely angry and replied that i should very much like to see what style they did care about if not this they had not the common politeness to reply another publisher to whom i submitted it actually wrote back that he was not in the habit of publishing penny dreadfuls i was never so insulted in all my life however as a specimen of the kind of story some boys read and some editors do not publish the reader shall have my penny dreadful and decide for himself whether it has not lots of go is not strictly true to nature elevating in tone and carefully studied if it is not then he had better not read it the plaster cast or septimus minor's million a thrilling story in fifteen chapters by the author of blugram blunderbuss or the dog man sub chapter i the murder the golden sun was plunging his magnificent head angrily into the sheen of the bronze atlantic when septimus minor scaled the craggy path which leads from crocusville to the towering cliff above the wind came and went in fitful gusts which now and again carried septimus off his feet and sometimes lifted him a foot or two over the edge of the rugged cliff in time for another eddy to carry him back nature this evening suited the gusty humour of septimus minor's breast the crisis of my life approaches he said to himself as a magnificent wave from below leapt eight hundred feet in the air and fell drenching him from head to foot i am fifteen years old next week and something here here he laid his right hand on his left side tells me i am a man as he spoke another wave leapt skyward and out of it emerged the form of a man yes cried septimus her father septimus was the youngest of seven children most of whom were orphans but we digress belay there haul in your mainslacks and splice your marline spike where are you coming to cried peeler the coastguardsman for such we need hardly say was the rank of the new arrival how are you said sep in an off hand way blooming said the not altogether refined peeler a gust of wind lifted them both up the twenty remaining yards of the cliff and left them standing on a sheltered crag at the extreme brink spin us a yarn said sep the setting sun cast a lurid flash over the figures of that strangely assorted pair the next moment it had set and nothing was visible but the reflection of the end of sep's cigar in the glass eye of his interlocutor septimus minor had lived in crocusville ever since he could remember and the coastguardsman some years longer hence sep's request mr peeler was a fine specimen of his class he wore a sou'wester and boots to match and round his shoulders but why all this minute detail concerning one who is to disappear if he had but known it before that howling night twas in ' she grounded said he transferring something from his right cheek to his left hang me on the union jack that was a nautical expression by which peeler added solemnity to his statement if there was not exactly one million spanish doubloons on board sep whistled but immediately checked himself and sat down on the wind to hear the rest bust my buttons if mortal man knows where she lies continued peeler save and except yours 'umbly stand by my shaver and cast your cock eye on this bit of rag and he produced from his pocket a greasy piece of parchment with a map upon it there said he laying his broad thumb on a red cross somewhere in the west pacific there she lies full of gold my boy shiver my jury masts if she don't the wind on which sep was sitting lifted him to his feet as he grasped the map and gazed with quivering excitement on the mysterious red mark he laughed sardonically and the perspiration stood in beads on his brow then pushing peeler over the cliff he put the map in his pocket and walked on whistling in the night air to the cottage sub chapter ii the smile my own velvetina sep my pet can it really be even so a silence during which a pair of tangled eyelashes are dim with humid dew then did you meet daddy on the cliff pet he turned ashy white even in the darkness and recoiled several yards at the unexpected inquiry where at last he gasped prevaricatingly then you saw him not cried she and he is out alone on this wild night and only his thin socks on really replies sep let me go and look for him he crushed her lily hand lovingly in his own and went but he turned to the left at the end of the lane and with scarcely half a dozen bounds reached the railway station grasping the map and murmuring to himself my velvy all the way any one who could have seen that happy boy's face at the window of the second class carriage as the train steamed majestically out of the station would scarcely have dreamed of the deep meaning concealed beneath that ingenuous smile smile on septimus yet beware the sleuth hound is already on the track sub chapter iii the sleuth hound solomon smellie of scotland yard had yet his way to make in the world he was not exactly young for time had already thinned the luxuriant growth of his hair nor was he without encumbrance for he had fifteen children yet he was an active and intelligent officer and had once detected something he forgot what but that is not to the point what brought him walking on this particular evening to the foot of the beetling cliffs ask the howling wind which ever and anon flattened him against the chalk or drove him miles inland up some cavernous cave be that as it may he walked i wish i could detect something in all this said he pulling himself together and glancing scornfully into the darkness as he did so captain peeler's corpse alighted gracefully on the sand at his feet ah ha said he this looks like business now let me think how comes this here there were no footsteps in the sand beside his own therefore the miscreant or miscreants must have escaped in some other direction aha said he presently looking up they may be up there and he leapt actively to the beetling summit better and better said he looking round him and observing a hoof mark in the yielding clay of which he promptly took a plaster cast another link ha ha the murderer was a horseman and he sat down and wrote a lucid report on the whole case for his sergeant solomon smellie was in luck assuredly scarcely had he concluded his literary labour when at a distance he perceived a twinkling light ha ha said he now see how the real artist in crime works yonder is a light the murderer cannot have gone that way therefore he has gone this and he stepped into the railway station just as sep's train steamed out too late this time muttered he between his teeth but time will show time will show never did man speak a truer word sub chapter iv the stowaways the harnessed mule was a splendid vessel of a hundred and fifty tons and as she sailed past the nore like a floating queen flapping her white wings in the breeze she reminded the beholders that england still rules the waves her crew consisted of a skipper four men and a boy was that all who is this lurking figure in the forward hold who with a complacent smile on his lips gazes on a crumpled map and ever and anon sharpens a gimlet there is a stowaway on board the harnessed mule one there are two for in the stern hold lurks another figure also smiling as the wind plays through the thin hair on the top of his head and mutters to himself ha ha time will show sail on o harnessed mule you carry a weighty freight inside you who will reach the goal first sub chapter v the wreck of the harnessed mule latitude degrees minutes longitude degrees minutes a hot breathless day the harnessed mule glides swiftly over the unruffled blue the crew loll about listening to the babbling of the boiling ocean and now and then lazily extinguishing the flames which break up from the tropically heated planks it is a typical pacific day the stowaway in the forward hold lies prone conning his map and marking the gradual approach of the harnessed mule to the red cross marked there frequently he is compelled to raise himself into a sitting position to give vent to the merriment which possesses him this is better than latin prose says he to himself how jolly i feel could he but have guessed that through an adjoining crack another figure was drinking in every word he uttered and taking it down in official shorthand he would have spoken in less audible tones yes the second stowaway is solomon smellie of scotland yard and he has the plaster cast in his pocket this must be about the spot says sep comparing his chart with the figures on the mariner's compass here goes two vigorous turns of the gimlet and the harnessed mule rears on her beam ends and with one stupendous lurch goes to the bottom that's all right says sep as he hauls himself to the summit of a mountain of naked rock which rises sheer out of the sea on all sides to a height of a thousand feet the words are scarcely out of his mouth when his face turns livid and he trembles violently from head to foot as he perceives standing before him solomon smellie the detective of scotland yard sub chapter vi the rencontre this is an unexpected pleasure says solomon delighted i'm sure says septimus craftily then they talk of the weather eyeing one another like practised fencers in a death struggle ha ha thinks sep he has heard of the sunken doubloons ha ha thinks solomon if he only knew i had that plaster cast in my pocket are you making a long stay here says the former naively depends is the dark laconic reply sorry i must leave you for a little says sep an appointment and he takes a magnificent header from the cliff into the very spot where the wrecked gold ship lies buried when after a couple of hours he rose to the surface for breath sep was relieved to find himself alone peeler was right said he to himself flinging back the matted hair from his noble brow my fortune is made and he dived again in the damp cabin of the sunk ship stood the gaunt form of many a brave mariner faithful to his post even in death seth gave them a passing glance and shuddered a little as he met their glassy eyes he was about to rise to the surface with the remainder of his booty when the figure nearest the door fell against him turning on him a cold perspiration suffused our hero from head to foot and his hair rose like porcupine quills on his head it was not a corpse but solomon smellie the detective of scotland yard sep had barely time to close to the cabin door and strike out with his precious bags for the surface he felt he had had a narrow escape of detection and that the sooner he sought a change of climate the better as for solomon it would have needed a strong door to keep him from his prey ha ha said he the chain grows link by link two and two make four patience solomon and you will be famous yet sub chapter vii the fete and the fracas it was the most brilliant ball which had ever been given in the english capital the very waiters sparkled with diamonds the gorgeous suite of apartments several miles in length were ablaze with all that wealth and beauty in electric light could effect coote and tinney's band was in attendance down the sparkling avenues of lustres whirled the revellers in all the ecstasy of the hilarious dance peals of laughter and the rustling of fans combined to make the scene the most gorgeous ever witnessed in this or any other metropolis the host of the princely revel was a mysterious young foreign nobleman known by the name of the duc de septimominorelli and reputed to be the richest man in europe what makes this evening's entertainment particularly brilliant is the fact that it is to be graced by the dazzling presence of the peerless donna velvetina peeleretta who as every one knows is shortly to wear the diamond tiara of the house of septimominorelli in other words she and the duc are betrothed the festivities are at their height and the duc for the fifth time is leading his charming fiancee to the supper room when the venerable butler announces in a voice that attracts universal attention a new arrival monsieur le marquis de smellismelli if possible the marquis was more magnificently attired even than the duc and went through the salutation with the easy grace of a man who had often appeared in court who is he asked every one an old college friend explained the duc but his face was the colour of his handkerchief and the place shook with the trembling of his limbs the marquis quickly made himself at home and vied with his host in his eagerness to take the donna velvetina down to supper the duc's face darkened visibly in proportion as that of his guest beamed and to those who looked on it was evident that a scene was imminent at length when for the nineteenth time the lady accepted the arm of the gallant marquis the duc ground his teeth and stepping up to his rival pulled his nose the marquis in return flung the duc the entire length of the apartments and with folded arms calmly awaited the result we fight monsieur le marquis ground out the smarting duc rather replied the marquis with a proud smile sub chapter viii the duel it was a tragic end in that night's gay scene guests whose carriages were not ordered till am stood shivering in the hall at pm five hours to wait meanwhile on two special steamers the duc de septimominorelli and the marquis de smellismelli sought the shore of france on the lonely sands between calais and ushant the rivals stood face to face at a hundred paces distance they had no seconds so each loaded the other's weapon it could not have been the wind that made their knees tremble and their teeth chatter for there was none neither could it have been the weight of the pistols which made their hands wave to and fro for these were boxer's eight ounce maxim repeaters no these two men were the subjects of deep physical emotion the moment had come and the duc was about to drop his handkerchief when the marquis abruptly folded his arms and said excuse me we have met before have we not ha ha sep my boy at the sound of his voice the so called duc flung his weapon two hundred yards in the air and with the bound of a hunted tiger buried himself in the turmoil of the french capital there was no duel on those yellow sands after all sub chapter ix afterwards the mysterious disappearance of the dazzling duc de septimominorelli created a profound impression throughout civilised europe the donna velvetina peeleretta was inconsolable after a while she too went abroad sub chapter x the sleuth hound again many many years flew past solomon smellie's youngest son had been twice lord mayor of london and all london had forgotten the duc de septimominorelli and the peerless donna velvetina peeleretta all no there was one exception an aged man in a back room of the mansion house sometimes produced a plaster cast from the recesses of his pocket and muttered to himself a time will come aha sub chapter xi the desert journey a lonely traveller traversed the sandy desert wastes of central africa he was ill accoutred for so trying a journey having only a cane to protect himself from the wild beasts and patent leather shoes on his feet no one knew his name and what made him more mysterious was that although he spoke english he paid for everything in spanish doubloons half a century old what could his errand be amid the typhoons and siroccos of that desolate continent for six weeks he had not moistened his parched lips with so much as a drop of water and his only food had been dried elephant yet he kept his eyes fixed on the mountain range twelve hundred leagues ahead of him and as each day brought him fifty miles nearer for he was evidently a practised walker he murmured to himself i come velvetina and thought nothing of the fatigue the man's shoes were unequal to his spirit and within a hundred miles of his goal he sunk crippled to the ground the blinding sand swept over him in mountains and the tropical sun made the end of the cane he carried red hot any other man in such a condition would have succumbed not so our mysterious traveller if he could not walk he could roll and he rolled sub chapter xii three clouds on the horizon on the summit of the topmost of those gigantic mountains the peak of which is lost high in the depths of the cloudless sky a female stands and gazes southward her fair form is mysteriously draped in white and the parasol with which she shuts out the scorching sun from her face effectually conceals her features he cometh he cometh not says she weeping at length in the remote horizon of the limitless desert there arises a little cloud of dust is it a panther seeking its prey or a newspaper buffeted by the wind or the mirage of the desert it is the revolving form of a rolling body and as she discovers it she trembles like an aspen leaf he comes mutters she another cloud of dust not in the south but in the east can it be an optical delusion or another revolving figure ever and anon the sun gleams on something bright which looks like the end of a cane a sickening sensation comes over the watcher they both come says she and turns her eyes northward what is it another optical delusion or is this yet one more cloud in the north which as it approaches also takes the semblance of a revolving figure hot as the weather is she shivers sensibly and closing her parasol mutters her lips as white as driven snow they all come sub chapter xiii the watcher on the cairn twenty four hours of agonising suspense and then the revolving figures reach the base of the mountain and commence simultaneously to roll up the side the female figure on the top gives a despairing glance around her and drops senseless on the cairn at length as the sun is setting in the only unoccupied horizon she starts rigid and stiff and listens on either side of her approaches a dull grinding noise mingled with heavy snorting and the low muttering of voices she dares not look it is terrible enough to hear so evenly do they approach that at the same instant they reached the summit then she rises majestically to her full height spreads her arms and utters a cry which is heard simultaneously at cairo at zanzibar and at cape town a terrible silence follows broken only by the trembling of the mountain and the breathless panting of the three figures as each rears himself slowly to his feet the scene that followed may be more easily imagined than described sub chapter xiv all comes out it is time we went back to the scene on the cliff at crocusville narrated in the opening chapter peeler the coastguardsman after descending the cliff resumed his ordinary avocations and sent his daughter to a superior high school hence her presence at the duc's ball and on the desert mountain the duc de septimominorelli for such was the mysterious traveller recoiled several hundred yards on finding himself confronted not only by the aged father of his now middle aged velvetina but by the form of his old opponent the marquis de smellismelli aha said the latter producing his plaster cast how do you find yourself sep my boy hot said septimus with characteristic coolness introduce me to the old gentleman said the detective peeler was the laconic reply it was solomon's turn to turn inquiringly to the lady she only bowed i wish very much i had known this before i have wasted fifty years over you said solomon in injured tones i must lose no more time if i am to detect anything good morning aha stay shouts sep in a voice of thunder it is i who have wasted fifty years running away from you you owe me an apology sirrah the caitiff's face underwent a kaleidoscopic change as these terrible words rant in his ears with the bound of of a wounded antelope he sprang to the summit of the nearest mountain and stood there with arms erect against the sky like a statue of ajax he don't seem blooming shiver my timbers if he do said old peeler we shall not meet again said sep grinding his teeth in his direction why should we be standing here in the sun said velvetina let us return to england they returned the same evening sub chapter xv omnia vincit amor septimus minor and velvetina peeler were married quietly at the crocusville cathedral the bride was given away by her father captain peeler rn the company was select and the presents were costly amongst the latter none attracted more attention or curiosity than an excellent plaster cast of a horse's hoof presented to the happy couple by the marquis de smellismelli and his grandson the lord mayor of london there were few knew its history but it was eloquent in meaning for mr and mrs septimus minor who have given it an honoured place on the mantelpiece of the second spare bedroom of their bijou residence in pink street chapter fifteen a queer picnic sub chapter i a mysterious mountain magnus minor and my brother joe were about as chummy as two fellows who had not a single taste in common could well be magnus you know was an athlete at least he was in the fourth eleven and ran regularly in the quarter mile open handicap he got fifty yards the first year and came in tenth in the second year they gave him a hundred and he came in eighteenth in the third year they generously gave him a hundred and twenty yards and he never came in at all for some unexplained reason after that he passed as an athlete and considered himself an authority especially at home on all matters relating to sport joe on the other hand was a dreamy boy he wrote poems when he should have been construing caesar and gave several other indications that he was destined to a great career he cared as little about sport as magnus did about poetry this probably was the reason the two were such chums they never trod on one another's toes when they went for a walk joe usually dawdled along trying to think of rhymes for nightingale and poppy and windmill and the other beauties of nature which met his eye or ear while magnus stopped behind to vault gates which always caught his foot as he went over and do sprints with wayside animals in which the wayside animals usually managed to pull off the event i'm not sure that they ever talked to one another which again may have been a reason for their great friendship if they did nobody ever heard them indeed they never seemed to look at one another or to be aware of one another's existence which no doubt fully explains their mutual devotion the only real bond of sympathy that i can think of was that they were always going in for examinations together and always getting plucked had the name of either ever appeared on a prize list i am convinced there would have been a panic in the school even when they entered for the wheeler exhibition for boys under joe being on the day of examination years days and magnus being a week younger no one supposed for a moment they had a chance against the fellows of eleven and twelve who went up against them and no one was disappointed i asked magnus afterwards how it was he came to grief it was those beasts the greek gods i'd like to kick them said he by an odd coincidence i put the same question on the following day to my young brother eh said he what do you call them you know the thingamybobs that lived in mount what's its name i'm sick of 'em mount olympus you mean that's it mount olympus pack of shrimpers this was a good specimen of my brother's poetic style i gathered from this that a new bond of sympathy had arisen between the two friends they had both been ploughed in an unexpected paper on greek mythology and were in consequence death on the divinities i genuinely pitied the divinities well mind as i wasn't in the affair i can only relate it as i heard it a very curious adventure happened to magnus minor and my young brother shortly after this it was in the holidays and we went as usual to llandudno and oddly enough magnus's people went there too the two chums consequently had an opportunity of feeding the fires that consumed them and of carrying on their feud with the greek gods in boats and bathing machines on the great orme's head and in the pier refreshment room whenever i came across them they were still implacable and once or twice i believe they actually spoke to one another on the subject which shows how deeply they felt one day they made up their minds to do snowdon and with a respectable basket of provender and an alpenstock apiece on which the name of the mountain in fact several mountains had already been cut they started off by the train to llanberis magnus minor being an athlete occupied most of the journey in training himself on cold boiled eggs and damsons while joe being a poet read somebody's half holiday in a corner at the place where the train stopped they got out and wondered whether they had not already had enough of it it was a grilling hot day they hadn't an idea which was the way to snowdon and nobody seemed to know a railway porter said second to the right but they could see he was humbugging as if a mountain could be up a turning let's jack it up said magnus who was feeling a little depressed after the damsons eh said joe there's no train back to what's his name for two hours what would it cost to cab it up oh pots said magnus i tell you what we might have a go of ginger beer somewhere and see how we feel after that whereupon in silence they found out the leading hotel or the place and expended sixpence apiece on ginger beer at threepence a bottle naturally they felt much refreshed after this and without condescending to further parley decided to stroll on only as the porter had mentioned a turning to the right they selected a turning to the left as decidedly more probable it may have been snowdon or it may not in any case it was a hill and a stiff one magnus the athlete taking out his watch said he meant to do it under twenty minutes and begged joe to time him joe the poet agreed and sat down on the shady side of a rock with the watch in one hand the half holiday in the other and his share of the damsons in his mouth how long have i been shouted the athlete after stumbling up the slippery grass slope for about five minutes time's up shouted the poet whereat magnus surprised at the rapid flight of the enemy checked his upward career and not only did that but assaying to take a seat on the grass began to slide at a considerable pace and in a sitting posture downwards until in fact he was providentially brought up short by the very rock under which his friend rested facilis descensus averni observed joe making a brilliant sally in a foreign tongue the remark was followed by instant gloom it was too painfully suggestive of the heathen deities besides magnus had nearly smashed himself against the rock and had to be brought round with more cold boiled eggs and damsons after this the ascent was resumed in a more rational way they accomplished a quarter of a mile in the phenomenal time of two hours during which period they sat down fourteen times drank at twenty one streams fell on their noses about eighty times and wished a hundred times they had never heard the name of snowdon i thought you said there was a thingamy' all the way up said joe so there is we're on it said magnus minor oh said joe he had previously had some misgivings that he was growing shortsighted but he was convinced of it now at the rate at which they were going there was every prospect of getting to the top of the first ridge about three o'clock on the following afternoon but magnus minor and my brother joe were fellows who preferred doing a thing thoroughly even though speed had to be sacrificed to the thoroughness so they pegged on detesting this mountain as if it had been olympus itself and making a material difference in the level of the lakes below by the number of tributary streams they tried to drink up by the way at last they actually began to get up a bit how far now said joe lying on his back with his coat off his shirt sleeves turned up his collar off and his braces slack just about there said magnus minor he spoke figuratively of course they were a quarter of the way up perhaps i don't believe this beast is what you may call him at all it strikes me we ought to have turned to the you know it looks like him said magnus anyhow it'll do for him i'd like to do for him growled joe they went on presently in shocking tempers both of them they loathed that mountain and yet neither liked to propose to go back that is the way in which a good many mountains are climbed magnus got riled with joe for not giving in he was the elder and it was his business to begin joe on the other hand never thought so ill of magnus as when he saw him pegging up twenty yards ahead never giving him joe time to catch up he made faces at him behind his back and tried to think of all the caddish things he had done since he came to the school but it was no good as sure as ever joe tried artfully to cut a corner or put it on for a yard or two magnus on ahead cut a corner and put it on too when magnus presently having improved his lead sat down to rest joe made sure he had caught his man at last but would you believe it just as he approached the place with every show of friendship announcing that he had something particular to say magnus got up and went on again leaving poor joe not only still in the rear but without time even for a rest all this astonishing activity as i said was the result not of energy but of bad temper the worse their tempers became the greater the pace and the greater the pace the nearer the top of that interminable ridge towards the end it was uncommonly like running magnus would have given worlds to venture to look behind and see how the idiot below was fagging and joe would have given a lot to see the lout above come a cropper and smash his leg it wants a pretty hot friendship to stand the test of a mountain side at last without a suspicion of what o'clock it was or how far they had come magnus actually stopped and lay down serves him right said joe triumphantly running with all his might to take advantage of his chance alas when he got up to his friend he discovered that after all he was not dead beat or wounded or ill the reason he had stopped was that he had got to the top as was natural as soon as this agreeable and amazing discovery was made magnus minor and my brother joe forgot their rancour and loved one another again with a mighty affection their own brothers weren't in it good old joey cried magnus as my brother lay on the turf beside him crowd in old hoss lots of room good old magny responded joe what a day we're having presently they condescended to look about them they were on a sharp ridge one side of which sloped down into the valley from which they had ascended the other looked out on an uninterrupted prospect of cloud and mist this isn't what's his name at all said joe there's a tuck shop on the top of it there's none here that chap was right said magnus that must be snowdon over there we've missed him horrid bore said joe who however regretted the mountain less than the tuck shop the afternoon was changing the clouds were beginning to sweep up from the other side and begriming the sky which had been so ruthlessly clear all the morning all of a sudden the mist below them parted and disclosed through a frame of cloud a great cauldron of rock yawning at their feet at the bottom of which as it seemed miles below lay a black lake it was a scene dante could have described better than i if we could get down there we could have a tub said magnus it's snug enough up here replied the poet don't you think so magnus admitted it was snug and did not press his motion for though he scorned to say so he was fagged and felt he could do with a half hour's lounge before undertaking a new venture so the reconciled friends took their siesta on the top of the mysterious mountain and in doing so oddly enough fell asleep sub chapter ii the immortals when they woke the sun was still shining but it had got round to the side of them which when they dropped off had been wrapped in cloud while the mist had taken possession of the valley and hillside by which they had ascended the transformation scene was so complete that had they not seen joe's paper on the ground beside them and recognised the bank of heather against which they reclined they would have found it difficult to say exactly where they were to all appearances they were at the end of the world the great cauldron gaped below them apparently perpendicular on every side enclosing in its depths the black lake on whose still surface the rays of the sun gleamed weirdly and gloomily not a sound was to be heard except a distant sullen rumble which might have been thunder or earthquake or the six o'clock train going back to llandudno above them as the clouds drifted past they could see as they lay on their backs occasional glimpses of blue and sometimes in the far distance a shining peak bathed in crimson light all this was natural enough and were it not that they had their return tickets in their pockets magnus minor and joe would probably have been content to enjoy the show for an hour or so what did concern them when they got to their feet was to observe that so far from being as they supposed and could have testified on solemn affidavit on the top of the mountain the ground now appeared to rise on every side except that occupied by the cauldron whichever way they tried to walk they found themselves going uphill rum start said magnus minor after ramping round in a semicircle and finding no trace of their homeward path it strikes me we shall have to hang out here till the clouds roll by joey all very well how about grub said the poet we shall be just about what do you call it by then hullo said magnus looking at his watch do you know it's pm and broad daylight joe consulted his watch and wound it up as he did so so it is must be a thingamybob a roaring boreali or whatever you call it going on wouldn't be so bad if it was good to eat magnus assented and the two outcasts stood and watched with somewhat mingled feelings the battalion of clouds as they swirled past and soared up at the heights above may as well go upstairs too said the poet dismally so they began the ascent this time magnus showed no inclination to forge ahead and joe took every precaution not to lag behind in fact they proceeded arm in arm trying to enjoy it but inwardly wondering who would have the benefit of their supper at llandudno it was easy enough going the turf was crisp and soft and as they got up a little flowers began to peep out though they could not see through the mists they fancied they could catch the sound of birds and the splash of water the clouds sweeping up on every side seemed to help them along so that sometimes they could hardly be quite sure whether they were walking on earth or air altogether had they but dined they would have voted the walk one of the jolliest they ever had in their lives presently a strange sound above brought them suddenly to a halt it was music of some sort but mingling with it the even sweeter music of plates and knives and forks and when for a moment the music ceased they seemed to detect voices and laughter some fellows having a picnic said magnus joyfully keep it up chappie and we shall get some of the pickings you see give them a what do you call it said joe whereupon magnus startled the air with a loud coo oo ey the sounds above ceased all of a sudden and the weather seemed to change to thundery then a faint echo of the shout came back and almost immediately afterwards a gentleman appeared through the mist he was a young looking man who had apparently been bathing and had not had time to dress after it he wore a curious sort of cap with a wing sticking out at either side and carried in his hand a very elaborately carved walking stick please can you tell us the way down to llanberis asked magnus thinking it better not to appear to notice the gentleman's deshabille the gentleman stared at the two boys in a startled sort of way and shrugged his shoulders a foreigner said joe try him in what's its name french s'il vous plait pouvez vous dire nous le chemin a bas a llanberis said magnus who was a capital french scholar it was not at all certain that the gentleman understood even this he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder up at the clouds which was certainly not the shortest way down to llanberis but as it was the direction from which the sound of the knives and forks had proceeded it seemed as if nothing would be lost by following the gentleman who in his excitement had clean forgotten about his garments hurried the boys up the hill at a terrific pace until all of a sudden they got out of the clouds and saw clear ahead the scene was a remarkable one magnus's idea of a picnic had been a correct one but such a picnic a party of some fifteen persons not by any means all gentlemen was sitting round a medium sized table spread with cups and dishes the entire company if they had not been bathing were apparently preparing to do so except one gentleman who was so encased in armour that it would have been a very tedious job to take it off and one lady who was also got up in a military fashion and carried a very ugly shield on her arm the person at the head of the table was an imposing looking gentleman who held a sort of stuffed football in his hand and had a tame eagle perched on his shoulder near him was a very good looking self satisfied fellow with long curls who had evidently been entertaining the company with a performance on a jew's harp then there was a lame old gentleman who looked as if he would be all the better for his bath when the time came who carried a big sledge hammer in his hand and another fishy sort of person who flourished about with a three pronged pitchfork a very cross looking lady sat next to the gentleman at the head of the table by the way she kept her eye upon him contradicting every word he said and snubbing him at every opportunity she was evidently his wife another good looking lady was playing with a very pert looking boy who wore a pair of toy wings on his shoulders and appeared to be a general favourite with every one except the other ladies who seemed generally a disagreeable lot and not at all good form in their manners at table the refreshments were being served by a nice looking housemaid and a page boy who had their work cut out for them in keeping every one supplied for these ladies and gentlemen whatever else may be said of them had uncommonly good appetites magnus minor and joe were too busy at first taking stock of the provender to devote much attention to the picnic party itself but when at last they did take a look round each uttered a cry of consternation and crowded up to his chum for protection joey said magnus don't you know them rather said joe i could tell them at once from the likenesses in what do you call him's smith's classical thingamybob it's olympus after all so it is groaned magnus oh jupiter at the mention of his name the gentleman at the head of the table looked up i beg your pardon said he in fairly good english his manner rather overawed the two boys who thought it wise to be civil to begin with at any rate so they touched their caps and magnus said do you happen to know the shortest cut down to llanberis sir we've lost our way don't you know said joe and we've got to catch the last train back to you know what's his name llandudno jove looked a little scared and by way of intimating that he did not understand a word shook his head i wish you wouldn't shake your head said juno the lady next to him it upsets everything and makes the glasses spill why can't you say like a man you don't understand german who are your friends pray we've quite enough boys about the place without any more what is it you boys we've nothing for you poor boys said the good looking lady before mentioned they look quite hungry so we are said magnus ainsi nous sommes tout droit said venus that was her name with a smile across the table at the gentleman with the jew's harp vous aurez quelque chose a manger dans une seconde make room for the boys vulcan we'll excuse you here the lame gentleman with the murky face slowly hobbled up apparently greatly relieved to be allowed to go and magnus minor and joe without further invitation crowded in at the table between venus and the lady with the shield beasts all of them whispered magnus to his friend and it don't look much of a spread but it's better than nothing here tommy said he addressing the page boy quelque de cela do you hear tommy whose real name was ganymede obeyed with alacrity and put before each a plate of what looked like very flowery mashed potato and a small glass of a frothy beverage i suppose this is what they call nectar and ambrosia said magnus i'd like to catch them giving us such stuff at school plenty of it that's one thing said joe i fancy we can keep young what's his name going for half an hour or so comfortably well my dear and how do you like olympus said the lady with the shield oh i dare say you're all right said joe diplomatically but i don't think much of the rest what did he say inquired juno from the end of the table never mind said minerva we're having a little friendly chat you need not interfere you're talking about me i know you are said juno non nous ne sommes pas said joe never mind her said minerva she doesn't count for much here of course you know the gentleman opposite with the lyre my brother apollo the poet is he i say cried joe across the table mr apollo do you know anything that rhymes with catsup' apollo smiled rather foolishly and said he fancied it was not in the rhyming dictionary at least he never had to use the word in his day joe's opinion of a poet who could not rhyme any word in the language fell considerably he means well does polly said minerva apologetically but he never had a public school education you know magnus meanwhile was making himself agreeable to his fair neighbour i say said he in the midst of his fourth helping of ambrosia which is the fellow who once kicked the other fellow downstairs venus laughed immoderately the other fellow is my husband the poor dear who made room for you just now the fellow that kicked him down is jupiter there good old jupiter said magnus i'd like to see you do it again did you do it with a place kick or a drop or a punt it's no use speaking to my husband said juno he can't hear and if he could he's too ignorant to understand he's getting old you must be getting on yourself said magnus i remember hearing my grandfather say he knew you very well when he was a boy juno bridled up angrily at this which was the signal for a round of laughter from every one else and a scene might have ensued had not apollo at the moment struck up his lyre and drowned everybody's voice he wasn't a particularly good player and his instrument was of a cheap make but the noise served to keep the peace which was all that was ever wanted presently the meal ended and the two boys were very glad to get up and stretch their legs after the heavy supper they had had they felt bound to be moderately civil and some of the ladies and gentlemen especially the former made themselves agreeable enough but they could not get on at all with some of the men mars the fellow in armour was one of these he was a horribly conceited snob they agreed and only wore his armour because it was a new suit and he thought he looked well in it well my little men said he grandly as they came up so you have come to see the great god of war i will not hurt you try to lift my spear it weighs two hundredweight and some odd pounds you have heard no doubt of some of my achievements oh yes said magnus minor you were the chap that got a hiding outside troy from diomed and yelled enough to bring the roof down ha ha good old diomed said joe mars turned red and white with anger and said that if it were not too much trouble he would like to knock their two impudent heads together at which they and every one else laughed all the more you boys said venus coming up opportunely at this point here is a friend i know you will like to meet he's just the sort of person boys admire he's not one of our regular party you know but we ask him in to dessert now and then don't we hercules how do you do said magnus holding out his hand to a great stout gentleman who wore a rug over his shoulders and carried a club in his hand done all your jobs swabbed out those stables yet the stout gentleman flushed up a little at this allusion and said something in greek which fortunately the boys did not understand been having any more lessons on the sewing machine lately eh old chap inquired joe we know all about you magnus minor and i there's fellows at our school could lick you into a cocked hat you come to our sports one day and see hercules a good deal ruffled used a considerable amount of idiomatic greek and made for the boys with his club fortunately for them minerva's shield happened to be lying on the ground close by and joe with great presence of mind recalling his classics for the occasion took it up and presented it at the giant naturally he turned to stone on the spot and as at that particular moment he had one foot off the ground his club above his head and his mouth wide open the effect was striking they amused themselves for a short time playing aunt sally at him and then getting rather tired of the whole affair looked about them for some way of escaping they met cupid the boy that belonged to venus prowling about with his bow and arrow hullo kid said magnus here you are three shots a penny and twopence if you hit me at twenty yards cupid aimed and missed and then very foolishly began to cry what are you blubbering at asked joe you young soft cupid said he was miserable everybody up there bullied him and he couldn't hit anything nowadays with his bow and arrows jack it up then and come to our school said magnus slapping him on the back lots of larks there you can wear etons and a topper and chum in our study can't he joe yes if he likes to do his share of the fagging said joe i don't much mind what i do as long as i get away from this lot all serene come down with us we're hanging out at llandudno for the holidays my mater will take you in i'm certain ah yes and by the way said joe once more making a brilliant dive into his classics there's a friend of yours you know called what's her name only a few doors off isn't there magnus rather said magnus who had not a notion what was being referred to you don't mean to say psyche that's her the very article rather a wonner too magnus is spoons on her you know added joe with a wink at his friend but he'll back out for you oh said magnus blushing it don't matter to me besides she's going to morrow this settled matters let's cut said cupid impatiently or we shall be too late a great row was going on among the gods goodness knows what it was about nobody ever did know that venus and juno were scratching one another's faces jupiter was shaking his fist and thundering all round the other men were arguing in high greek and the other ladies were screaming at the top of their voices they're at it again said cupid making a wry face that sort of thing goes on here from morning to night we shan't be missed come on you fellows down they went at a great pace cupid who was much less encumbered with clothes than the other two showing a lead presently they lost sight of the top and through the clouds below caught a distant glimpse of the black lake can't we take a short cut down there asked joe not good enough said cupid that's where charon hangs out and he and i don't hit it off no we'd better go down to where you went asleep and then trot down by the track to llanberis i know the way come on they followed wondering at the pace at which they went in scarce five minutes from the top they stood on the spot where they had first halted hours and hours ago there a remarkable thing happened cupid who had all along seemed the most eager of the three to escape into the valley suddenly halted spread his little wings and with a merry laugh began to fly upwards hold on said magnus that's not the way down you young cad ha ha said cupid rising higher in vain they besought him to stay he only laughed and soared higher and higher and the next thing they were aware of was that they were lying on their backs waking up from their sleep and watching a white gull skimming the air overhead and crying out seaward whether they had been to olympus at all or had only dreamt it they could never say the one thing they did know was that they just managed to catch the last train that night back to llandudno where they found supper waiting them the end
